It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas

 
The spirit of Christmas has already entered the city way ahead of December 25. It is the season to light up Colombo with multi-hued stars, colourful decorations and lights. Stores have already stocked up with all kinds of products associated with the season. Our photographer Shan Rambukwella captured the spirit of the season which had taken over the streets, hotels, stores and in our hearts.
