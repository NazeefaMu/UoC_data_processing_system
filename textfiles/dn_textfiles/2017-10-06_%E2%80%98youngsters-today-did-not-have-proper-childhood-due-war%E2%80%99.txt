‘Youngsters of today did not have proper childhood due to war’

Children of this country did not have a childhood for the past 30 years. They spent their childhood in a country that was on fire because of racial tensions and they did not have a tomorrow to look forward to. The youngsters today are the children of those days. They must have memories of their childhood. Our country did not have the bonds that we have today. We are really split along boundaries, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He was addressing a gathering at the Manchester International Football Institute, Kollonawa, to commemorate the world Children’s Day where the biggest training session in Sri Lanka held in this regard.
The Minister said Children have followed the example of their elders and were divided along narrow racial lines.
"Children have the freedom to learn and play. It is the responsibility of the elders to train youngsters to maximise use of this freedom. I request all citizens of this country not to corrupt the young and impressionable minds of our children. It is everyone’s duty to develop a strong generation who will take charge of the country’s tomorrow," he said.
He said there was a drop in the percentage of children taking up to sports. "The main reason is that children give priority to studying. Another reason is that parents do not have the financial ability to spend on extra activities for children. A strong future generation can be built up if children are encouraged to take up a sport that is in keeping with their financial abilities," the minister said.
He said it was common in our country to see people cheering different countries when international matches were played forgetting that they were Sri Lankans.
"In this world there is only one country that a person can call his motherland. We are all Sri Lankans no matter what religion or ethnic group we belong to. If more and more children are encouraged to take up sports I believe that we will be able to develop a strong nation tomorrow," the minister said.
Manchester Football Institute Kollonawa had organised the event to commemorate their first year anniversary and representatives from all over the island participated.
