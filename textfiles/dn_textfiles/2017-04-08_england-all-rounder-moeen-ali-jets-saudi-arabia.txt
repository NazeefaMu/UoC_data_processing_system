England all-rounder Moeen Ali jets off to Saudi Arabia

England all-rounder Moeen Ali has made the most of a rare gap between fixtures as he jetted off to Saudi Arabia to visit some historic landmarks.

The Worcestershire off-spinner is gearing up for another domestic season, which gets underway in the coming weeks.
But coming off the back of a successful tour of the West Indies, where England came away with a clean sweep in the 3-0 ODI series win, the 29-year-old took some time to himself before plunging into another English season.
Ali, a practising Muslim, posted pictures on his Instagram as he visited landmarks synonymous with Islam. The Quba mosque, in Medina, is one of the oldest in the world and Ali captioned a photo standing in the foreground: ‘First ever mosque built in Medina. Beautiful place.’
Ali also posted a snap in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, as well standing beneath a sign reading ‘Umar Bin Al-Khattab’ and captioning it: ‘When you see the name of a true hero.’
It has been another packed winter for the left-handed batsman, having toured Bangladesh, India and the West Indies since October.
And their limited overs campaign this summer likely to be just as busy. They have two ODIs against Ireland and a two-match series against South Africa before England host the ICC Champions Trophy in June.
Then England face the South Africans in an eagerly anticipated Test series and Ali is likely to be heavily involved in all three formats as the summer progresses.
But before the elegant stroke-maker worries about any of that, he has the matter of Worcestershire's domestic season to tend to first.
