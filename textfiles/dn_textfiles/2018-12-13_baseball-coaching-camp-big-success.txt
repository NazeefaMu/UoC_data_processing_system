Baseball coaching camp, a big success

The Women’s Baseball Federation of Japan conducted five-day Baseball Coaching Camp in Sri Lanka in cooperation with the Embassy of Japan in Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Amateur Baseball /Softball Federation.
The five members came to Sri Lanka under the program called “Sport for Tomorrow”, sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan to bring the joy of sports directly to ten million people in over one hundred countries by the time the Olympic torch reaches Tokyo in 2020 and to spread the value of sport for the future generation.
The Women’s Baseball Federation of Japan had two main objectives of visiting Sri Lanka, namely, 1) to spread the joy and excitement of baseball to those women and girls who are not familiar with baseball and 2) to share the skills and techniques to those already active female players to improve their performance.
The first objective has been achieved through 3-day camps with the participation of more than 100 beginners in Kandy on December 6 and 7 as well as nearly 50 beginners, including students from Kelaniya University, Sri Jayawardenapura University, Sirimavo high school and Magedera high school, in Diyagama (Japan-Sri Lanka Friendship Ground) on December 10.
As for the second objective, they conducted a baseball coaching camp for female players of Sri Lanka Army and Navy from December 7 to 9 at Japan-Sri Lanka Friendship Ground.
Milka Priyadarshani, captain of Army team said “this is the first time to be trained by Japanese coaches in my 4-year career. So I deeply appreciate this valuable opportunity.” S.W.S.M Wickramarathna, captain of Navy team said “I have learnt a lot through this coaching camp. They are very kind and friendly, we enjoyed a lot. Simply it was very fun!”
At the farewell ceremony held in Ambassador’s residence on December 10, Akira Sugiyama, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, expressed his appreciation for the Sri Lankan players’ enthusiastic participation and was impressed by their passion for baseball, and expressed his heartfelt gratitude to all those who made this camp possible, especially the Sri Lanka Amateur Baseball / Softball Association headed by Fazil Hussain.
