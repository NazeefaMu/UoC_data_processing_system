Renuka Foods expands range with launch of wafer sticks

Renuka Foods PLC has introduced a novel ‘look and feel’ to Mr. POP that will take the brand to a wholly different platform within the snacking industry.
The newest product extension for Mr. POP sees its entry into the confectionery segment within the snacks category with an amazing new product variant – Mr. POP Wafer Sticks.
While the new product is aimed primarily at children, Wafer Sticks are likely to appeal to both children and adults and is a new experience for Sri Lankan taste-buds. It comes in Vanilla and Chocolate flavours. Speaking on the long-term vision for Mr. POP as a popular snack, COO Dinesh Nalliah said “Renuka Foods has made its mark with Mr. POP and we recently introduced an oat-based cereal bar to our range as well. Launching Wafer Sticks is an innovative step that will strengthen our portfolio of products significantly.”
“Mr. POP Wafer Sticks will undoubtedly bring a new, unusual and exciting taste experience to consumers in Sri Lanka” he added.
