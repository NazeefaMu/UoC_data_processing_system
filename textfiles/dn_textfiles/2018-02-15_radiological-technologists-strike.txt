Radiological Technologists to strike

The Government Radiological Technologists Association (GRTA) will launch an island-wide trade union action from today, GRTA Secretary Dharmakeerthi Epa said.
According to Epa, trade union action to be taken will present several demands.
Nearly 500 members of the association will stop all medical tests that should be carried out by visiting warded patients.
One of the main demands is to prevent other services from taking over the duties of radiological technologists. Persons from other services had been sent abroad for training on the Neuro Navigator installed in the Colombo General Hospital. Radiological Technologists should have been sent for this training, Epa said.
The contribution of Radiological Technologists had not been obtained for discussions on radiological equipment related matters such as PET scanners, MRI Scanners, importing O-Arm, digitizing X-Ray section in the accident ward, increasing the demand for CT Scans in the Colombo General Hospital etc., he added.
