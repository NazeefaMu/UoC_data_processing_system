Sri Lanka hosts debut international TT tourney

South Asian Junior & Cadet Table Tennis Championship 2017:
Sri Lanka will host its first major international tabel tennis tournament when the South Asian Junior & Cadet Table Tennis Championship 2017 will work off from May 19 to 21 at the S. Thomas College Indoor Stadium, Mount Lavinia. This was revealed to the media during a press briefing at the Berjaya Hotel, Mount Lavinia on Tuesday.
The regional governing body of table tennis, the South Asian Table Tennis Federation (SATTF) under the directions of Asian table Tennis Association has conferred upon the task of hosting this important championship on the local governing body, the Table Tennis Association of Sri Lanka (TTASL) and the TTASL with the support of Sports Ministry, Colombo Municipal Council and generous sponsorships will conduct the three-day tournament.
Each South Asian country will be represented by a 14-member playing squad. According to the organising committee head Chandana Perera, five countries have conformed their participation namely, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives and host Sri Lanka. Even though Nepal has submitted their entries, they are yet to conform participation.
The tournament will be a great opportunity for local players to gain much needed exposure at international level. TTASL hopes that the event will help to enhance teamwork dynamics, communication skills and leadership qualities among local youngsters.
"Hosting an international tournament is a hard task. Sri Lanka was approved as the host nation at the last moment. So we had to arrange everything in a great rush. Even our players had a little time for preparations with few weeks of comprehensive practices. Even though India is the obvious regional TT stronghold, if our players can prosper on home advantage, they are capable of posing a threat to India. Perera explained.
TTASL also hopes that tournaments of this magnitude will greatly help to popularise table tennis in all parts of the country with the support of a good media coverage.
The tournament will include the following events: Under 15 Team (boys), Under 15 Team (girls), Under 18 Team (boys), Under 18 Team (girls), Under 15 Singles (boys), Under 15 Singles (girls), Under 18 Singles (boys), Under 18 Singles (girls), Under 18 Doubles (boys) and Under 18 Doubles (girls).
