Argentina’s ‘White Giant’ collapses

ARGENTINA: An ice bridge in Argentina collapsed in front of thousands of stunned tourists.
A large chunk of the Perito Moreno glacier, located in Los Glaciares National Park in the southwest Santa Cruz Province, came crashing down into the water.
The Patagonian glacier, known as the ‘White Giant’, sent impressive waves surging into the Lago Argentino lake as it fell.
Around 4,000 people gathered at a nearby vantage point hoping to see the natural phenomenon, which last happened four years ago.
Spectators broke into applause as they witnessed the breathtaking moment that the arch, which measured 250 metres wide and 70 metres high, collapsed.
A video shows how small pieces of ice dropped into the water before the entire bridge collapsed inwards and crashed into the lake.
The Perito Moreno glacier measures 19 miles long and has a total area of nearly 100 square miles.
Ruptures occur around every four to five years after the glacier forms a dam over the southern arm of the lake.
Water in the dammed section rises up to create pressure that eventually breaks through.
The imposing glacier, near the southern town of El Calafate, is one of 48 glaciers fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field shared with Chile which is the third largest ice concentration in the world after the North and South Poles.
The largest glacier is the 31 mile-long and nearly five mile-wide Upsala Glacier, but the Perito Moreno glacier, named after a 19th century explorer, is the most famous.
Matilde Oviedo, spokeswoman for Los Glaciares National Park, said: ‘It made a tremendous noise when it came down.
‘There were a lot of people but we were expecting it to happen a little later.’
Around 700,000 tourists visit the park, which is a UNESCO world heritage site, every year.
Speaking before today’s rupture, the country’s Tourism Minister Gustavo Santos said: ‘We’re about to witness a marvellous spectacle of nature in an Argentinian setting that was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site and attracts tourists from around the world.’ - AFP
