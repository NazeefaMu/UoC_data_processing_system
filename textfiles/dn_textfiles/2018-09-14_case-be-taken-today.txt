Trial against Prasanna Ranatunga
Case to be  taken up today

Following a request made by defence counsel, the trial against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife was yesterday postponed for today (14) by the Colombo High Court.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed indictments against former Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, his wife Maureen Ranatunga and a third person on the charge of threatening a businessman demanding the balance money out of Rs. 64 million.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Champa Janaki Rajaratne, a junior counsel appearing on behalf of MP Prasanna Ranatunga moved court that the trial be fixed for another date since his senior counsel Anil de Silva, PC, was appearing before the Court of Appeal over another case. Accordingly, the case was re-fixed for trial today by the Colombo High Court.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court decided to proceed with the trial against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife in absentia of the third accused Naresh Kumar Fareek who was evading court from the beginning of investigations. MP Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife are currently on bail.
The Attorney General filed indictments on 15 counts against three accused, Prasanna Ranatunga, Maureen Ranatunga and Naresh Kumar Fareek based on charges of committing offences between April 6, 2015 and June 2, 2015.
In addition, the AG has named 65 witnesses and included 35 articles as court productions against the three accused in this case.
