SLFP condemns Pohottuwa supporters’ behaviour

Condemning the incident of hooting in front of the SLFP Headquarters by the SLPP (Pohottuwa) supporters during the protest march held on September 5, SLFP General Secretary Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa said the behavior of these protestors is similar to the act of insulting one’s own mother.
Considering the request by the group of UPFA and SLFP MPs, President Sirisena as the Party Chairman let them to sit in the opposition as an independent group.So there is no argument with their right to engage in a protest against the government since they represent the opposition. But they should not go beyond the ethics of politics.
“We are now in the process of restructuring and reforming the SLFP according to the modern political culture,” he said.
He further said that President Maithripala Sirisena firmly believes in the importance of holding intellectual discussions within the party, rather than holding individual-based discussions.
“The restructuring and reforming process of the party is currently going on with the participation of intellectuals and professionals. Around 90 percent of the establishment of Balamandala had been completed.” he added.
