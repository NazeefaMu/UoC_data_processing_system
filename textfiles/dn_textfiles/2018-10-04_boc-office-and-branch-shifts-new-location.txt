The Bank of Ceylon’s Eastern Province Office and Trincomalee Super Grade Branch relocated to its new premises at No 455, Main Street, Trincomalee on October 3, 2018 with the participation of Minister of Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development, Lakshman Kiriella. The invitation was extended by BOC’s Chairman, President’s Counsel, Ronald C. Perera and the General Manager, Senarath Bandara on behalf of the Bank. Deputy General Manager Sales and Channel Management, C. Amarasinghe, Deputy General Manager, Retail Banking Range I &II, D.M.L.B. Dassanayake, Assistant General Manager, Eastern Province, D.M.K.S.

This move is a strategic relocation as the new place with ample parking space and a state-of-the-art building with consciously organized interior for added convenience for its customers. It has a well-equipped province auditorium with a seating capacity over two hundred.
The Province Office and the Super Grade Branch building is designed according to the “Green Banking Concept” that include a vertical green garden that helps to maintain a comfortable interior temperature and which refreshes air and improves air quality and uplifts the overall atmosphere. These green gardens are maintained through a supply of rain water whenever possible through the rain water harvesting system that is installed within the branch. Well planned landscaping allows the branch to save the energy compared to a similar type of base building. Designed to let in as much daylight as possible whilst using solar panels the usage of electricity obtained through the national grid is minimized.
The “SmartZone” situated within the premises provides ATMs and CDMs that allows customers to transact 24 hour x 365 day at their convenience. For “BOC”, improving social and economic well-being is an integral part of its core operations. In this regard, the Bank ensures that it follows ethical guidelines to sustain customer relationships. Whilst providing a dedicated banking service to its community, BOC looks into the sustainability of their customer’s business as well. The Bank at all times encourages environmentally friendly projects and sees that loans and advances are granted to deserving environmentally friendly projects that reap greater benefits for the community. By increasing its CDM/ATM network to reach over 900 machines throughout the country, encouraging customers to enroll with “Online Banking”, introducing “no passbook” SmartGen account option, workflow automation and Document Management Systems the Bank of Ceylon has not only promoted green banking but also promoted sustainable and inclusive economic growth.
