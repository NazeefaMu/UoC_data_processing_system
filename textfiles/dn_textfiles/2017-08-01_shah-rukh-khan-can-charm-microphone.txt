Shah Rukh Khan can charm a microphone

Actor Anushka Sharma says Shah Rukh Khan’s genuineness made it easy for her to do on-screen romance with the superstar in their upcoming film, Jab Harry Met Sejal.
Anushka, who made her debut with Shah Rukh in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, has teamed up with the 51-year-old actor for the third time in the new film by Imtiaz Ali.
Asked how was it to romance Shah Rukh, Anushka told reporters, “Extremely easy. He has a lot of genuineness. If you see this song, his eyes have a lot of genuineness when he looks at you with love.”
“In my opinion, Shah Rukh can romance this mike also. He can look at the mike with the same kind of love he would look at the most beautiful woman in the world,” she said.
To this, SRK added in a lighter vein, “As long as you’re holding it I can romance it, otherwise no.”
They were speaking at the launch of Hawayein song from the movie, on Wednesday. The duo was accompanied by filmmaker Imtiaz Ali and music composer Pritam.
The 29-year-old actor has worked with directors like Yash Chopra and Aditya Chopra but said the best part about Imtiaz, with whom she has teamed up for the first time, was the “moments” he brought out between the two characters.
“His films are love stories but I don’t think the characters are aware that they are in love. There is some internal travel, soul searching which happens and then they realise it,” she said.
“That’s when they discover love... he has a very deep understanding of a man-woman relationship,” she added.
