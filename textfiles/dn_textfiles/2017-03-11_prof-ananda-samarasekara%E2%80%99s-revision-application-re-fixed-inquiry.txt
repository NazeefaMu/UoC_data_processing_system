Prof.  Ananda Samarasekara’s revision application re-fixed for inquiry

 
The inquiry into a revision application filed by former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara challenging the Colombo Magistrate’s Court order to reject anticipatory bail for him over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen was yesterday re-fixed for March 14 by Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe, the Court was informed that the prosecution was yet to receive the DNA report pertaining to the skeletal remains seized at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
In his revision application, Prof. Samarasekara had cited CID Homicide Investigations Unit OIC and the Attorney General as the respondents.
On a previous occasion, former Colombo Chief JMO and Vice Chancellor of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Prof. Ananda Samarasekara had filed an anticipatory bail application in Court to pre-empt the possibility of his arrest on charges of a non-bailable offence relating to the alleged loss of body parts of Thajudeen. On September 15, 2016, Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe refused to grant anticipatory bail on the former JMO, citing that the investigation pertaining to the loss of body parts of Thajudeen could be hampered if the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail.
However, through his revision application Prof. Samarasekara sought an order to revise Colombo Magistrate’s Court order to refuse him with anticipatory bail.
Prof. Samarasekara denied allegations levelled against him and maintained that he had not committed any offence.
President’s Counsel Shavendra Fernando with Counsel Thisya Weragoda and Iresh Seneviratne appeared for the former JMO.
