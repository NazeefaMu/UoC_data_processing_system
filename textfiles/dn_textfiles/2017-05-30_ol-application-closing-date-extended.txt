O/L application closing date extended

The Examinations Department has extended the closing date to apply for G.C.E. (O/L) Examination 2017 to be held in December this year, to June 15.
Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam had instructed Examinations Commissioner General W. M. N. J. Pushpakumara to extend the deadline as many Sri Lankans have now become helpless due to the recent floods.
Minister Kariyawasam told the Daily News that the closing date to apply for the examination was earlier fixed for May 31.
