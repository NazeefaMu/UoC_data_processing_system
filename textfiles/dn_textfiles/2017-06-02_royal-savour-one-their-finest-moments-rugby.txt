Royal savour one of their finest moments in rugby

Royal College Colombo savoured one of their finest moments on the rugby field when they won the inter-schools Singer league rugby tournament decider with a near flawless 22-17 win over Trinity College, Kandy in their own den at Pallekelle.
It was a glorious end to the 2017 schools league for the glamour boys of schools rugby who improved vastly when the season progressed enjoying tremendous success winning against all the schools with one blemish losing 17-22 to 2017 league runners-up Isipathana College.
It was the special brand of the now famous rolling maul through their granite forwards that Royal are famous for which enabled them to be different from all other school sides.
Royal clinched the coveted Singer rugby league trophy for the 11th time in their history.
The ‘Daily News’ spoke to some of the rugby stalwarts including their head coach, captain and asked them for their opinion of the 2017 team’s performance in the just concluded Singer league tournament.
Sanath Martis (Head coach of Royal): “It was a collective effort and in the bigger picture I got all my ammunition together and made this team victorious as well as a champion outfit. I would like to thank my team, their parents, rugby advisory board, Rohantha Peiris, MIC Gamini Sarathchandra, support staff of Dushanth Lewke, Ajith Silva, Sunimal Manamperi, Akila Perera, Supun Warnakulasooriya (manager), medical staff of Dr. Harindhu Wijesinghe, Thushantha, Kithsiri, Banaka Fernando, Principal and the admin and, all those Royalists young and old who has supported us.”
Rohantha Peiris (Chairman Royal Rugby advisory committee): “We started the season in a simple beginning. Isipathana, Dharmaraja, St. Peter’s, Wesley, Trinity were really outstanding. We had one or two good players but we did not have the kind of brilliant players like Isipathana. “If you recall the 1978 Royal team which I captained had only five coloursmen. The present side played as one team and Ovin Askey led them admirably throughout the season. Captaincy is a very important aspect when it comes to winning championships. Behind the scene leadership is very much required when moving forward and young Askey proved that by being a brilliant captain. Until we win the Bradby we are not complete. Hat’s off to all, who have supported us on and off the field. I am happy with all what I have got from them and it was a true team effort and we were like one whole family together.”
Ovin Askey (Royal College 2017 1st XV rugby captain): “It was a great victory for all the Royalists out there. All my boy’s played their hearts out not only today but throughout the entire league and I am really grateful and proud of them. We had a minor setback where we lost to defending champions Isipathana (17-22) midway in the league, but we quickly rectified our mistakes and came back strongly to clinch the prestigious Singer inter-school league title. I would like to thank Martis sir (Sanath), Lewke sir (Dushanth), Gamini sir (Sarathchandra), Supun sir (Warnakulasooriya), our school rugby committee, all the parents, all the Royalists young and old and all well-wishes.”
Wasantha Perera (Royal old boy): “It was sheer hard work, dedication and team work. Captain Ovin Askey got the entire team to this stage by rallying them around him. All were one unit and they never gave up. This was a highly confident bunch of players. The season’s midway tournament loss to Isipathana enabled them to be more focussed with the help of the tireless coaching staff and captain Askey’s motivation. Their forwards are the unsung heroes for me. They are behind this sensational win and their defence was excellent. Hats off to our entire forwards for their tireless performance right throughout. This was completely a team effort and the entire squad of players delivered in the end to be undisputed league champs of Sri Lanka schools rugby.”
Senior DIG Nimal Lewke (Former SLRFU president and national rugby head coach): “When Royal started the season they were not a good team but they shifted three of their three quarters to the pack due to the coaching staff’s mounting knowledge. It was a big risk they had taken but within a little period of time Royal dominated through their forwards. The entire Royal coaching staff has done a wonderful job, especially the players tackling was of really high class; not only did they bring down the opponents but they secured ball position as well. Within a short period of time they have produced a champion outfit. Compared to how Royal started the season and how Trinity started, Royal were 15-all with Dharmaraja and thanks to Askey’s last minute drop goal it secured them the 18-15 win and with Isipathana they lost 17-22, while Trinity were thrashing all their opponents over 50 points. From the Isipathana game onwards the preparation of Royal was marvelous and they played as a team. Ovin Askey led the team brilliantly. Their place kicking was excellent and having two reliable kickers was a confident booster for in the end the relevant kicks made the difference. Congrats to Royal and their entire support staff.”
