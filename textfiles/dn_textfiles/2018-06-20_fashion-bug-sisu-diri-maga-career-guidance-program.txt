Fashion Bug Sisu Diri Maga Career guidance program

A leading clothing retailer Fashion Bug conducted two successful ‘Sisu Diri Maga’ career guidance programs in Kandy recently by targeting the students of Ranabima Royal College and Seethadevi Girls School.
Senior Lecturer Asanka Jayaratne conducted the program where he enlightened the students on important exam techniques, how to face for the O/L exam and its importance, how to manage time to study and short notes techniques.
Fashion Bug’s award-winning ‘Sisu Diri Maga’ project has benefitted over 14,000 students from around the country, to date. Over 500 students from Ranabima Royal College and Seethadevi Girls School participated at the programs which were held on May 31 and June 1. The management of Fashion Bug commended the cooperation that was extended by the Ministry of Education, Kandy Zonal Education Office and the staff of Ranabima Royal College and Seethadevi Girls Schools.
“We need to let students discover their true calling and help them select the right career path for themselves. Career guidance and planning exercise would encourage students to understand their interests and aptitude and choose the appropriate career opportunity linked to proper skill training. Therefore our efforts through ‘Sisu DiriMaga’ aim at giving our future the best guidance and motivation that they need,” said Shabier Subian-CEO of Fashion Bug.
Projects such as these are a key focus of Fashion Bug, who spends millions annually on various CSR projects carried out around the island in various sectors – from sports to education, through to health, public services and beyond.
