As such, growth in interest expenses was curtailed to 7.2% YoY while Net Interest Income (NII) grew by 15.1% YoY to Rs 10.7 billion.
The low cost deposit base was instrumental in the bank continuing to attain above industry net interest margins.
Commenting on the performance, MD/CEO of the Bank Jonathan Alles stated that “The banking sector is challenged by the implementation of SLFRS 9 reporting standards which could result in higher impairment charges, Basel III regulations requiring greater capital buffers as well as the new Inland Revenue act stipulating numerous and significantly higher taxes on banking revenues. Notwithstanding, we stay positive and committed on continuing our efforts to raise the bar.”

Core non funded income sources being Credit Cards, Trade Finance and Bank Guarantees performed strongly while fees from Digital Channels exhibited promising growth. A net trading loss of Rs 273.7 Mn was reported during the quarter whereas a trading gain of Rs 541.7 Mn was reported during first quarter 2017.
The total impairment costs of the Bank increased by Rs 587.5 Mn against the comparable period in 2017, largely due to adverse weather and market conditions.
PBT of the Bank grew by 23.6% YoY to Rs 6.3 Bn while the PAT improved to Rs 4.5 Bn. The Bank recorded a ROE of 16.43% and a ROA of 1.84% for the first quarter of 2018.The Bank’s asset base grew by 3.8% during the quarter to Rs 990.8 Bn.
