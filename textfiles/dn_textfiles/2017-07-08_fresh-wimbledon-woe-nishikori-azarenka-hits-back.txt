Fresh Wimbledon woe for Nishikori, Azarenka hits back

LONDON AFP July7, 2017
Kei Nishikori suffered fresh Wimbledon misery as the Japanese star crashed out on Friday, while Victoria Azarenka stepped up her bid to become the first mother to win the All England Club title for 37 years.
Former US Open finalist Nishikori had hoped to finally advance past the fourth round at Wimbledon after years of underachievement.
But the world number nine didn’t even reach the last 16 as he was over-powered 6-4, 7-6 (7/3), 3-6, 6-3 by Spanish 18th seed Roberto Bautista Agut.
Nishikori’s third round exit means Wimbledon remains the only Grand Slam he has failed to make the quarter-finals.
It was the 27-year-old’s earliest departure from a major since his first round defeat against Benoit Paire at the 2015 US Open.
