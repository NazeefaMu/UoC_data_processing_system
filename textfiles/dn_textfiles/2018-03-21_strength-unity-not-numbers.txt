Strength is in unity not numbers

It seemed an impossible task to gain the 4x110 yards relay record from the formidable Royalists. Everyone thought so, including the Josephian coach. As the anchor, I told the other runners if we exchange the baton as a team, we will win. The first lap was taken by a Singhalese, the second by a Muslim, the third by a Burgher; it was neck and neck when I received the baton giving me an opportunity of ruffling the feathers of the Royalists.
My home is Negombo. So were the home of my parents, their parents and their parents down the mists of time and dare not do anything to tarnish the reputation of this ancient, multi-racial and proud town which the Dutch with all her armed might could not humiliate or subdue.
My foster home is Kandy. Beloved, because it was on the hallowed Asgiriya grounds, as a 14 year old, coming all the way from Kurunegala, in a rickety bus seated on a wooden plank described as a seat, a 4 hour journey, thereafter sleeping alone on a bench in the gym of St Sylvester’s because the rest of the small contingent left to be with their relatives. On the following day looking at the well-manicured beautiful Grounds of Asgiriya I was convinced, after having trained on an abandoned paddy field and outrunning wild buffaloes, I could outrun even the Devil, running bare feet.
They were cocky, walking about in their school blazers. Others were lying on long tables inside the pavilion the masseurs feverishly toning their muscles. Parents with Thermos flasks were serving hot drinks to their sons getting them warmed up to meet all challenges. I had nothing. Waiting and waiting, seated in the hot sun, on an abandoned roller but with grit and determination to stand up and be counted. That is the way Providence works if help is sought. Takes the disadvantaged from the paddy fields and mud of the streets and makes them champions.
Trinity College
After the shocks of the margin of defeats measured in yards not feet subsided, the famous coach of Trinity College Bultjens shook my rustic hand and invited me to join Trinity College, offering a scholarship with full board and free tuition, which offers l conveyed to my father who in turn told Bro Alban the Headmaster of St Anne's, who reminded my father that Church rules do not permit a Catholic boy to attend a non Catholic school when a Catholic school was available. It was then Fate took my hand and led me to Darley Road, Thurstan Road, and then on scholarships to London, New York and Washington, a long journey the purpose for which I simply could not understand, just the way I cannot understand the need for expanding a function in a Fourier series of orthogonal Sines and Cosines. When the envelope with stamps came from Madras into the hands of Hardy at Cambridge with Ramanujan's equations he did not understand them and was forced to seek help from Littlewood, a Senior Wrangler, who decomposed some equations by using the Fourier Series. Why he did that is not explained.
It was in Washington I learned what true mathematical elegance is by talking to Robert McNamara, then President of the World Bank when he visited the Economic Development Institute where I was a scholar. He was a specialist in Management through statistical control and approached the twin scourges of racism and poverty, because where there is racism there is poverty, like a missionary.
He had a lifelong obsession with maths. This latter-day Archimedes once remarked that maths is a language to him and the only true basis to understand the curse of racism and its twin poverty.
My wife was born in Kandy. Years later we travelled to Kandy to join her parents when her father, a Supreme Court Judge, was presiding over the Assizes. I then took the opportunity to walk to the beautiful Asgiriya Grounds, sat on the very same abandoned roller, and allowed my emotions to trickle with a tear in my eye.
Ancient and elegant city
My emotions returned after reading with shock the recent events which tarnished the reputation worldwide of this ancient and elegant city. The incident was trivial which in other countries would be put down as road rage, a matter for the local police. When the cinder of racism was introduced by those who do not care a tuppence for this country, the cinder turned into an inferno. If the same incident was between a Singhalese lorry driver and Singhalese passengers in a 3 wheeler, nobody would have cared. Scribes who monopolize the opinion columns in the papers in the morning and sup with the devil in the evening are responsible for the recent dark chapter in our history. Expose, identify and condemn them as predators. They have no place in a decent and self-respecting society.
Now the centuries-old Trinity/Anthonian cricket match is cancelled. A match that gave the fastest century for St Anthony's by Anderson and century opening partnerships for Trinity by that graceful pair Pilapitiya and Sirimane. Old boys of both schools both Singhalese and Muslims must hold their hands in friendship and see whether the match can be played at a later date when things calm down.
Recently there was an incident at Koswatte Junction, the junction one meets travelling from Malabe before Battaramulla, proceeding towards Fort, which is now disciplined by a system of sophisticated traffic lights. The driver of a bus seeing a fancy car parked blocking the road had repeatedly tooted the horn, angering the passengers who happened to be an unsavoury politician, a sawdust thug and his equally despicable wife. Out they jumped and assaulted the bus driver, the wife brandishing a fully loaded pistol. Mind you, this happened on the day when the rest of the women in the world were peacefully celebrating Women's Rights Day. If the race had crept into the picture, the result a conflagration. The Talangama Police acted swiftly arrived on the scene and arrested the assailants. Here is an opportunity for the Police to demonstrate their grit, plant the flag and not retreat and for fearless magistrates to uphold the law at any cost, and remove the animals off the streets.
When I was attending St Mary's College Chilaw, my friends were mostly Muslims. There was Yousoof, the Arabic name for Joseph, who came to class wearing not a hijab but a fez. The Noordeen brothers and many more.
Gruesome tragedy
We often walked with our hands over each other's shoulders to places like Deduru Oya, and Pallama where a deadly incident recently took place. A boy of 12 sexually abused and killed by a monster. The hound from Hell fled with a team of Police in hot pursuit, was apprehended in a fishing village in Mullaitivu on the east coast of the island, a distance of over 200 miles from the scene of the incident. Say a rumour was spread that the boy was a Singhalese and the killer a Muslim the firestorm would have been unstoppable, sweeping all the way to Puttlam turning left at Palavi and travelling past Talawila to Kalpitiya, snuffing the lives of many an innocent who had nothing to do with the gruesome tragedy.
It is the duty of citizens who are truly devoted and love this country to erase any trace of racism from future incidents. Politicians and placard-carrying Pharisees, Sadducees have no place in this game.
If dug deep into the grit and mud you will discover they are the ones who are responsible for these occasional upheavals. To identify and annihilate must be a nonstop process. Not to be doused when there is a fire, forgotten, and then wait for the next. For that, the intelligence system must be well oiled and efficient. Use the hobos found seated in street corners. They are the best spies like the way the Police used Miss Marples in the celebrated detective series by Agatha Christie. I have a nose for clandestine things and very likely would have ended my career at the pinnacle if not for the sharp reminder at the final interview where I was told the University spends millions in training engineers not to run after thieves.
Fervent supporters of the Field Marshal believe he is the man for the hour. The Romans said you need only one, so long as that one is the right one. I was watching Aljazeera the other day where a scholarly Buddhist monk speaking in Singhalese was singing his praises and criticism for not appointing him as Minister of Law and Order and made a startling revelation. He said the background of agitators who are masquerading as Buddhist monks must be checked to find to which temples they belong to. Ubi dubium ibi libertas, where there is doubt there is freedom.
To be is to be perceived. We survive only by changing our reality as well as our image. We are creatures of God, unwilling to trim our sails according to every passing fad and not descendants of Apes. The notion of apes sits well only with Charles Darwin, given his bushy eye brows, bald head, short nose and the long beard.
