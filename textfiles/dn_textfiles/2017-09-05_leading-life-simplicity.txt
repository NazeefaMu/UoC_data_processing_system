Leading a life of simplicity

For all of us, it’s time to convert to simplicity in lives; at least if we want some peace of mind and joy in our lives! Many people say they want to live a simple life, but based upon statistics about stress levels, not that many are actually following through with their expectations.
For most of us, life is getting busier. Especially for those who have children to take care of. I see parents scurry here and there to work, school activities, the dentist, grocery store, vocal lessons, etc. It’s never-ending.
Living more simply is not a new idea. It’s actually been around for thousands of years. Our ancestors lived simple lives, accumulating just what they needed and giving the rest away.
It has been over time that the endless pursuit of “things” has edged out simplicity and peace in our society. The concept of “open economy” started off sounding great, but keeping up with the Joneses has cost many men and women their peace and joy; the drive to push and push, to get more and more, and be the best. And, that has depleted numerous people leaving them empty, cold, and very fatigued. Many Buddhist teachings will help you to find out how to create that “balance” in life.
Dighajanu
A townsman named Dighajanu once approached Buddha and asked him the following: “We are lay people enjoying sensuality; living crowded with spouses & children. May the Blessed One teach us what contributes to our happiness and betterment in our present lives here, and hereafter."
The Buddha in reply said: "Dighajanu, there are four factors that contribute to the happiness of a person in this world". What are the four?
(1). Utthana - sampada (2). Arakkha - sampada (3). Kalyana-mittata (4).'Samajivikata.
You should be skilled, efficient and energetic in whatever your profession and you should know it well. You should make maximum effort in your profession and work on it with sustained courage. This is 'Utthana-sampada'.
You should protect your income, which you have righteously earned on your own sincere effort. This does not mean living miserably. You should be generous and free at the same time. This is 'Arakkha-sampada'
You should have good friends who will help us along the right path away from evil. The friends should be faithful, learned and virtuous. Associating good friends has been given much importance in Buddha Dhamma. This is Kalyana-mittata .
You should spend reasonably in proportion to your earnings, neither too little, nor too much. In other words, you should not hoard riches nor should you be spending recklessly. You should keep to a balanced life, within your means. This is ‘Samajivikata'.
The above advice relates to Happiness in this life. In the same sutta, the Buddha identifies four traits conducive to happiness in future lives.
Those are (1) saddha – faith in the fully enlightened Buddha; (2) sila - virtue as exemplified by the five precepts; (3) caga - generosity giving charity and alms; (4) panna - wisdom having insight into the arising and passing of things
Anatha pindika
Once, the householder Anatha pindika went up to the Buddha, saluted him, and sat down at one side. As he was sitting thus at one side, the Buddha One spoke:
“Householder, there are these four kinds of joy to be won from time to time, as the occasion arises, by a lay person who enjoys sense-pleasures. What are the four? (1) The joy of ownership (atthi sukha); (2) The joy of enjoying his wealth (bhoga sukha); (3) The joy of being a debtless person (anana sukha); (4) The joy of blamelessness (anavajja sukha).
And what, householder, is the joy of ownership? Here, householder, when one has wealth gained by hard work and obtained in a lawful way, he attains pleasure, he attains happiness. This is the joy of ownership.
And what, householder, is the joy of enjoying his wealth? Here, householder, when one has wealth thus gained, both enjoys his wealth and does meritorious deeds, he attains pleasure, he attains happiness. This, householder, is the joy of enjoyment. And what, householder, is the joy of being a debtless person? Here, householder, when one owes no debt, great or small, to anyone, he attains pleasure, he attains happiness. This, householder, is the joy of being a debtless person. And what, householder, is the joy of blamelessness? Here, householder, when one is endowed with blameless actions of body, blameless actions of speech, blameless actions of mind, he attains pleasure, he attains happiness. This, householder, is the joy of blamelessness.
Hindrances
The Patta Kamma Sutta is a remarkable little discourse on the ideal lay practitioner, heading for accomplishment or excellence both on the worldly and spiritual levels. It closely parallels the Digha Janu Sutta. Both these suttas deal with the fourfold noble growth of faith, moral virtue, charity and wisdom.
The importance of overcoming the five hindrances in lay life is pointed out in the Patta Kamma Sutta. (1) rampant greed (visama lobha), (2) ill will (vyapada), (3) sloth and torpor (thina middha), (4) restlessness and remorse (uddhacca kukkucca), and (5) doubt (vicikiccha). In the Patta kamma Sutta the manner in which a person should spend his wealth is also given in detail as follows: (1). Expenditure on food and clothing and other needs, (2). Maintenance of parents, wife and children and servants, (3). For illness and other emergencies. (4). For charitable purposes. (5). For the performance of the following: (i) treating one's relatives; (ii) treating one's visitors; (iii) offering alms in memory of the departed; (iv) offering merit to the deities; (v) payment of state taxes and dues in time.
Buddhism teaches us to consume wealth moderately otherwise it would lead to an excessive indulgence on sensual pleasures. Buddhism prescribes righteous and systematic methods of earning wealth which are devoid of extremist path and prejudices
Kula sutta
Buddhist teachings on the progression of wealth can be clearly understood through the Kula Sutta. It is a short teaching dealing with basic home management. The wisdom taught is simple and practical:
(1) Look for what is lost; (2) Repair what needs repairing; (3) Eat and drink in moderation, and (4) Have someone virtuous to manage things.
