Kumara Welgama’s FR re-fixed for support

The Supreme Court yesterday re-fixed for support for November 7, a Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama.
Kalutara District UPFA Parliamentarian Kumara Welgama had sought an order preventing FCID from arresting and remanding him in connection with alleged financial frauds said to be taken place at Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) while awarding several tenders to two private companies to supply bus spare parts since 2011 to 2015.
Through this petition, Welgama sought the intervention of the Supreme Court to exercise the fundamental rights jurisdiction to prevent an imminent arrest of him over the magisterial inquiry at Colombo Magistrate’s Court No 3 (B/43481/3/15).
In his petition, the former Minister had cited FCID Chief Inspector (Unit 7) C.I. Ranasinghe, ASP P.K. Serasinghe, DIG Ravi Waidyalankara, former police chief N.K.Ilangakoon and Attorney General as respondents. The petitioner further sought an order and declaration that collective acts of the first to fourth respondents causes an imminent infringement of his Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1), 12(2), 13 (1) of the constitution.
