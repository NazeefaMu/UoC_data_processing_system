Gamperaliya benefits for Dambulla people

Rs. 90 million will be provided under the Gamperaliya programme to help people repair their houses, Dambulla SLFP Balamandalya and Acting SLFP Organiser for Dambulla Kusumsiri Ariyaratne said.
He said Rs. 50 million will be allocated to provide electricity and another Rs. 50 million to build playgrounds in the Dambulla electorate. The recipients of these grants do not have to repay them, he said.
The money will be provided for deserving people without discrimination and SLFP members who contested the local council elections will assist the programme, he said.
