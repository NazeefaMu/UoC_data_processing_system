Kalutara prison bus attack: Court calls for report on telephone conversation

Court yesterday called for a report on the telephone conversation that took place between individuals inside the Kalutara prison and those outside on the day that remand prisoners including Aruna Priyashantha alias Samayang were taken to the Kaduwela courts in a black maria.
Seven remand prisoners including notorious gangster Samayang were killed when a Black Maria was ambushed by unidentified gunmen in Police uniforms after blocking the road.
Kalutara Chief Magistrate Bharati Wijeratne ordered the telecommunications companies to furnish the required details to court. Further Magisterial Inquiry was postponed for March 16.
