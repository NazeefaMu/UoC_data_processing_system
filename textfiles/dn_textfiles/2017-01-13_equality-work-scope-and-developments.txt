Equality at work: Scope and Developments

 Part I
Income inequality between the rich and poor is increasing almost everywhere in the world, because among other factors, of the weakened bargaining strength of labour, due to multiple options available to capital in the globalized economy. Intensified global competition is adversely affecting the working conditions and labour standards world over.
Calls for re-asserting social and labour rules relating to work environment in today’s global market place, culminated in 1998 with the historic at the International Labour Conference, a solemn declaration of ‘Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work’, emphasizing on eight I.L.O Conventions – No. 29, 87, 98, 100, 105, 111, 138, and 182. While all I.L.O. Conventions are important, the international community during the late 1990s had underlined the importance of this particular group of Conventions, known as the core labour standards.
The core labour standards are binding on all member states of the I.L.O including on those states, which have not ratified the eight conventions. They are both ‘Universal and inalienable and are not relevant to the stage of economic development of the country’ and are binding on all the member states, irrespective of their economic progress. Following this Declaration, all members of the I.L.O. are obliged to respect, promote and realized in good faith the eight core conventions.
Sri Lanka has ratified the eight core conventions. The I.L.O. identified these core labour standards following the Social Summit held in Copenhagen in 1995 which said the ‘Millennium Goals’ and the ‘Global Compact’ as the social floor of the emerging global economy, to counteract the erosion of worker rights.
The I.L.O felt that good governance of the labour market based on respect for fundamental principles and rights can contribute to a stable social and political environment and make the Declaration as the key to such an environment. Social dimension is essential to the success of the structural adjustment and good social policy is an integral part of economic efficiency.
The aforesaid I.L.O Declaration obliges its member States to respect the principles that are the heart of these core Conventions, which include (a) free of association (No.87) (b) effective recognition of the right to engage in collective bargaining (No.98) (c) elimination of forced or compulsory labour (Nos. 29 and 105) (d) elimination of discrimination in employment (Nos. 100 and 111) and (e) elimination of child labour and child abuse (Nos .138 and 182).
Discrimination in employment Conventions
Out of the above mentioned eight core Conventions, two are related to elimination of discrimination in employment.
They are (i) Equal Remuneration Convention No.100 of 1951.
(ii) Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention No. 111 of 1958.
The right to freedom from discrimination is inherent in the ILO. Constitution and in the labour standards. Equal Remuneration Convention No. 100 of 1951 emphasizes the need to promote ‘equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value’ while Discrimination in Employment Convention No.111 of 1958, defines discrimination as ‘any distinction, exclusion for preference made on the bases of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin which has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation’ and allows additional criteria included after consultation by the Government with the employers and worker organisations. It aims to promote equality of opportunity and treatment for men and women workers with family responsibilities.
Violation of human rights
Discrimination bars people from some occupations, denies them a job altogether at times and does not reward them according to their merit on account of their ethnicity, race, caste, sex or social background. This generates a social and economic disadvantage that in turn leads to inefficiency and unequal outcomes. Discrimination at work is a violation of human rights that entails a waste of human talents, with detrimental effects on productivity and may lead to social upheavals and may adversely affect investment and economic growth. Discrimination stifles opportunities, wasting the human talents need for economic progress, accentuates social tensions and inequalities. Compacting discrimination is an essential part of promoting decent work. Millions of women and men around the world are denied access to jobs and training, receive low wages, or are restricted to certain assumptions simply on the bases of their sex, skin colour, ethnicity or beliefs, without regard to their capabilities and skills.
Discrimination may be direct or indirect – direct when rules, practices and policies, exclude openly, people of certain ethnicity or of certain political party or give preference to certain individuals. Discrimination also occurs when the same job of equal value a migrant worker – an expatriate receives a higher pay than a national. Forms of direct discrimination include job advertisements stating discriminating conditions.
Human resources practices that require regular pregnancy tests of female employee, conditions prohibiting female employees marrying while in employment, are act of violations of the Conventions Nos. 100 and 111. Discrimination is indirect when apparently neutral forms and practices have disproportionate effect on one or more identifiable groups without justification. Differential treatment of particular categories of workers in the form of inferior social benefits or remuneration also amounts to discrimination. The lower protection granted to domestic servants (most of them are lower income male and female workers belonging to racial and ethnic minorities) under the various laws of our country also tantamount to discrimination and a violation of the above two conventions.
The state has a major responsibility in ensuring equality, at not only in public sector but also in private sector workplaces. Equally the trade unions and employers two have the responsibility to ensure that discrimination does not prevail in their work places.
ILO Headquarters in Geneva: The right to freedom from discrimination is inherent in the ILO
Despite a number of positive moves in terms of policies and legislation, the overall condition of women in Sri Lanka had not significantly changed. Bias in recruitment in working conditions, gender based low wages / salaries and cultural inhibitions, still keep the gender gap wide. The distinction made between male and female in fixing of minimum wages under the various wages boards for works of equal value is also discriminatory and is in conflict of with conventions No.100 and 111.
Collective bargaining and equality
With regard to interface between collective bargaining and equality, one important fact is that these two fundamental principles and rights are mutually reinforcing and can together promote work place governance which reconciles economic with social goals. Unequal access to collective bargaining is an equality challenge. Inequitable access to collective bargaining is a human right issue that implicates systematic discrimination against historically disadvantaged groups in the work place.
For equality to be advanced through the collective bargaining process, it is essential that trade unions and employers be committed to seeking it. The process of preparing for collective bargaining by both unions and employers and the setting of bargaining demands and prorates should include an assessment of existing problems of inequality and discrimination. Inclusive strategies for consultation and participation of historically excluded and disadvantaged groups are essential to identifying and defining problems of inequality.
Collective agreements and achievement of equality
Discrimination bars people from some occupations, denies them 
a job altogether at times and does not reward them according to their merit on account of their ethnicity, race, caste, sex or social background. This generates a social and economic disadvantage that in turn leads to inefficiency and unequal outcomes. Discrimination at work is a violation of human rights that entails a waste of human talents, with detrimental effects on productivity and may lead to social upheavals and may adversely affect investment and economic growth 
An important starting point for implementing equality at work is inclusion in the collective agreement of a basic commitment to equality and non-discrimination. Equality rights clauses may also serve as interpretive aids to other provisions in the collective agreement.
In the face of ambiguity or potentially contradictory provisions in the collective agreements, an anti-discriminatory clause may reinforce interpretations that are consistent with equality there is much potential within collective agreements to promote equality. Creative bargains struck in a context – sensitive fashion can greatly enhance the promotion of equality.
Legislation setting a floor flow of decent working conditions, including minimum wage laws, restrictions on hours of works, minimum rest periods as well as occupational safety and health legislative systems, serve a crucial equality role. Therefore, the importance of legislation on minimum working conditions for the promotion of equality is affirmed.
Bringing equality to the work place has significant economic benefits too. Employers who practice equality have access to a larger and more diverse work force. Workers who enjoy equality have greater access to training, often receive higher wages and improve the overall quality of the workforce. The profits of a globalized economy are more fairly distributed in a society with equality, leading to greater social stability and broader public support for further economic development.
Equality of human beings before the law is one of the most important of human rights and that it may be regarded as fundamental in the sense that it is the basis for the development of guaranties of specific human rights.
The concept of equality which is central to the discussion of justice lies at the root of the democratic idea. Many great revolutions aimed at shaking off arbitrary rule of one form or another has stressed this concept of equality. The question arises whether increased equality can only be achieved at the expense of liberty or conversely, whether expanding liberty must diminish equality. Learned opinion is divided on this matter. On the one hand, it is clear that certain degree of liberty is necessary to promote the ideal of equality. For example, to achieve economic equality in a society, a measure of liberty is necessary. Lord Acton, one of the outstanding thinkers on the concept of freedom, emphasized that equality unrestrained could destroy freedom.
