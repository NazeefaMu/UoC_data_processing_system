Pollution threatens Ratnapura water source

A water source overlooking Ratnapura town used by 201 families and 101 farmers in Ketaliyampalla for drinking and irrigation is threatened with severe pollution due to the dumping of garbage.
Keliyampalla Grama Niladhari W. M. Thilina Gunasekare who highlighted this problem at a meeting of the Ratnapura Regional Coordinating Committee on June 23 requested officials to find an urgent solution to this problem. Gunasekera said people living outside the city bring bags of garbage in vehicles and dump them at this catchment area.
He said heaps of garbage dumped by them were found on roadsides in the new town area too.
Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne requested the Police who were present to arrest people dumping garbage in this manner and take legal action against them.
It was also pointed out at this meeting that a section of the land belonging to the Ratnapure St. Aloysius National School had been acquired by a businessman running a shop nearby and this had hindered school activities. Minister Seneviratne said this was a business carried out for a longtime and the problem should be solved amicably through discussion.
Co-Chairman A. A. Wijetunge said steps would be taken to resolve this issue after surveying the school land. Parliamentarian A. A. Wijetunge also participated.
