Sudu Nelum Movement boosted reconciliation move: Chandrika

A survey by a French company on Sri Lankan Buddhis before the Sudu Nelum Movement found that only 22.3 percent Buddhists wanted reconciliation, Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chairperson and former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said.
Addressing a workshop on National Unity and Reconciliation through Higher Education at the University Grant Commission Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, she said after implementing the Sudu Nelum Movement in two years, the percentage increased up to 68 percent. Political, religious and community leaders of Sri Lanka did not speak the language of peace to the people before, he said.
According to the former President, surveys showed a small number of people in Sri Lanka were interested in reconciliation. The majority of them asked the government to reduce the Cost of Living, increase salaries and give employment. There is no point in preaching Bana to the starving people. But we have to make them realise that the root cause of all types of sufferings is not having reconciliation and having an unresolved conflict since Independence.
Former President Kumaratunga said: "When unprincipled people become leaders, they can do what they want, govern the country as they wish, they can rob, they can kill whoever. This is the moment of good governance," she said.
University Grant Commission (UGC) Chairma Prof.Mohan de Silva said the experience he received during the war made him realise the importance of reconciliation.
"The life stories related by patients with painful injuries made me realise the importance of reconciliation," he said.
