Countrywide survey to identify disaster resilient regions

The Megapolis Ministry will launch a country-wide survey shortly to identify regions or areas that are safe for human
settlement for the reduction of vulnerability of people and communities from the threats of natural, technological and man-made disasters.
Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said his ministry is committed to promoting development patterns that allow safer living and disaster resilience.
He said steps will be taken to deliver a national level rehabilitation programme for those living in the country’s disaster prone districts in the near future.
Ranawaka said “sustainable development will be integrated to restoration initiatives in physical resettlement.”
“I have apprised the members of the Cabinet and the President on the new reconstruction plans associated with the envisioned rehabilitation scheme,” the minister said.
“The government should focus on implementing a large-scale rehabilitation programme for recent disaster victims rather than becoming increasingly dependent on food and medicine aid from foreign countries,” Ranawaka pointed out.
“We have to look at how we can relocate people and communities from those disaster prone areas for their long term sustainability in terms of their economic and social well- being to reduce loss of life and property in a potential future disaster event,” he said.
“We have to ponder on it beyond the point of giving out a four or five perch land plots as some politicians have done,” he said.
“They only think about the elections ahead of them and they do not see the bigger picture, or think about the future of generations to come,” he said.
“We saw this was happening in Ratnapura, Bulathsihala, and Galle. The political circuses must stop. We must help them to stand on a strong economic sustainable footing.”
“If we can deliver a programme that can avert the negative impact caused on our economy by disasters, then we would have contributed to the uplift of the disaster affected,” he added.
