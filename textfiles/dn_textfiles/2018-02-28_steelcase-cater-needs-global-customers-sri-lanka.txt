Steelcase to cater to needs of global customers in Sri Lanka

Steelcase had decided to enter the Sri Lankan market to cater to the needs of its global customer who are now in Sri Lanka, said Praveen Rawal, Steelcase, Asia Pacific Managing Director, India and SEA.
Speaking to Daily News Business at the launching ceremony in Colombo he said the Steelcase Colombo showroom will open tomorrow.
“Our global customers who are now present in Sri Lanka obviously would like to have Steelcase in their environments because they work with us around the world.
We have for the last seven to eight years developing products for these markets including China the Philippines, Malaysia and Sri Lanka,” he said.
Rawal said Steelcase products will do well in these markets because they meet the performance and value segments in terms of price points and ergonomics and they plan to meet the customers and make them aware that the Steelcase brand was available in the Lankan market now.
He also said that they will do that through workshops, seminars conferences and also by inviting designers and customers to spread the message of design and ergonomics among everybody. That will get the attraction of the people to the brand, he said.
Rawal said they also can customize their products according to the requirements of the customer in term of power needs, power management and electrical needs on a work station.
“In term of colours and fabrics and finishes we have a huge pallet that we can offer to our customers and we have incorporated in our statement of line almost 95 percent what we observe across this part of the world in terms of our standard offerings.”
He noted that they were very high on sustainability and a lot of value was given on warranty with their products carrying warranty for 8 to 12 years.
Rawal added that their products were manufactured using the best materials and chemicals and are produced in China, India and Malaysia having a huge manufacturing footprint in Asia.
