Chapecoense: Brazil plane crash football team ‘a fairytale story with tragic ending'

The incredible rise of Brazilian football team Chapecoense has reached a “tragic ending”, after a plane crash in Colombia killed the majority of their team.
Six people survived the crash in Medellin, which was taking the team to compete in the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final on Wednesday.
They include defenders Alan Ruschel and Helio Zemper, and reserve goalkeeper Jakson Follman. The club's coaching staff and journalists were among the 77 passengers.
Chapecoense were in the Brazilian fourth tier in 2009, but had recently made themselves a “national force” before their run in South American football's secondary continental competition - the equivalent of the Europa League.
BBC Brasil's Fernando Duarte said: “Their story is a fantastic fairytale, but now it has reached a tragic end.”
The football world has paid tribute with players such as Brazil and Chelsea defender David Luiz counting former team-mates among those who lost their lives. Teams in Brazil have said they will give players to Chaecoense so that they can continue as a club.
Leicester City-like run
The club from southern Brazil were founded in 1973 and only won promotion to the country's top division in 2014, but victory over two legs in their first continental final would have seen them qualify for the Copa Libertadores, South America's premier competition.
The Brazilian Football Confederation has announced a seven-day mourning period, during which all matches have been postponed, while the Brazilian government has declared three days of mourning nationwide.
Chapecoense's “Leicester City-like run” in the Sudamericana was described as “a massive achievement for a very small club” by Duarte.
The president of Chapecoense's guiding committee, David de Nes Filho, summed up the sentiment at the club in an interview on Brazilian radio Globo.
“It was not just a group founded on mutual respect; it was a family,” he said.
“We lived in harmony, with great happiness. Before boarding the flight, they said they were going to turn their dreams into reality. The dream ended this morning.”
Clubs - including Chelsea, Barcelona and Real Madrid - paid tribute to the victims during training, and a minute's silence was held at both EFL Cup quarter-final matches in England on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Al Jazira and Al Shabab held minute silences for Chapecoense boss Caio Junior, who managed both Arabian Gulf League clubs.
The biggest game in the club's history
This is a club that as recently as 2009 were still in Brazil's fourth division. It is only in the last three years that they have established themselves as a national force.
This was to have been the biggest game in the club's history. Now we wait anxiously to find out how many players have survived this terrible accident..
The Copa Sudamericana is the second biggest cup competition in South American football, to have reached the final, after coming from Brazil's fourth division, in just six or seven years is a truly remarkable achievement which seems to have been interrupted by this terrible tragedy.
