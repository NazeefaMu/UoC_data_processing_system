Gota’s Writ Petition fixed for inquiry

The Court of Appeal yesterday fixed for inquiry on October 17, the writ petition filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa challenging the FCID inquiry that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.33.9 million.
The Court was informed that the Attorney General has already filed indictments against seven accused including Gotabhaya Rajapaksa regarding this incident.
The Court of Appeal has already issued an Interim Order preventing Police from acting against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act over this incident.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal had upheld the petitioner’s version that the certificate issued under Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of petitioner’s legitimate expectations. Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.
