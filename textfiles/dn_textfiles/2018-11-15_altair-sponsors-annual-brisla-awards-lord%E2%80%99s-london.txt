Altair sponsors annual BRISLA Awards at Lord’s, London

The fourth annual BRISLA (British Sri Lankan Association) awards took place in the historic Long Room of Lord’s Cricket Ground in London recently with corporate sponsorship from Altair, Sri Lanka’s most recognised high rise development.
One of the highlights of the event attended by nobility, diplomats, academics and celebrities, was the presentation of an award to British parliamentarian Lord Naseby for being an outstanding friend to the British Sri Lankan community.
Among the speakers at this prestigious high society event were Anthony Sheldon, Vice Chancellor of Buckingham University, Wasim Khan MBE, CEO of the Leicestershire County Cricket Club, James Dauris British High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, and Sugeeshwara Gunaratna, the Acting Sri Lankan High Commissioner in the UK at the time.
Princess Katarina Karadordevic of Yugoslavia, the widow of Desmond de Silva QC, several peers and two Lord Mayors of Greater London were among the eminent personalities that graced the occasion.
The BRISLA Awards were conceived to celebrate the positive contributions British Sri Lankans make to communities and to raise general awareness of the importance of social integration. The event also helps raise funds for Equality-based Community Support and Training (ECSAT). The BRISLA awards recognise achievements and contributions made in the spheres of Healthcare, Literary Arts, Performing Arts and Entrepreneurship.
