World-class golf course at Shangri-La Hambantota

Shangri-La’s Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa recently welcomed Rodney Wright, the globally celebrated golf architect who designed the 18-hole course, spread across a vast coconut palm plantation offering spectacular views and distinctive challenges for both beginners and seasoned players. Wright visited the resort to share his expertise with the resort team, review the golf course and celebrate the accreditation of the course as it has recently been USGA (United States Golf Association) Course Rated and Slope Rated.
Rodney Wright is a firm believer in integrating the culture and environment of the surrounding area into a golf course. His goal is to design a course that people walk away from, but remember every hole.
The golf course at Shangri-La’s Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa offers three zones, each with its own unique character; The Coconut Plantation offers lush fairways and challenging bunkers, The Dune Area - with its subtle elevation changes - gives way to breath-taking views of the Indian Ocean, and The Sapphire Mine showcases generous greens with an abundance of water features.The resort also recently opened its driving range where golfers can practice their golf swing.
The course development was approached from an eco-perspective, due to the resort’s dedication to biodiversity and habitat protection. The structure has revitalised an abandoned sapphire mine, restored vegetation, re-introduced birdlife and uses Paspalum grass for its salt-tolerant turf, which is resilient in the tropical climate and allows for the highest standards of course conditioning.
The golf membership at Shangri-La’s Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa provides all the amenities you would expect from a world-class golf club, with different categories of membership to suit golfers’ preferences and special benefits at the resort.
