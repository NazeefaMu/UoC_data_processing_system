Citizens' Mail

For public attention
At present we are blessed with a powerful media, who highlight the problems faced by the public from time to time.
Sometimes it may be biased. Regrettably the Public Sector response is very poor. Private enterprises rush and clarify the position and also try to take corrective action due to fear of losing their marketability. Public enterprises do not pay any attention to media reports (News, Editorials, Letters to Editor etc.) mainly due to –
1) Domination maintained by them by way of powers. For example Electricity Board, Water Board issue red notices and curtail supplies despite the protest made by the consumer. Department of Inland Revenue freezes the Bank account if taxes are in arrears.
2) No loss of marketability, no competition.
3) Refuse to commit themselves as they fear that action may be taken if their reply is false. They wish to avoid problems instead of resolving them.
4) Lack of officials with public interest and also due to arrogance in some instances.
This situation should change now under the new Government. Every public department should have a public relation officer who should respond to the information furnished in the media and any complaints by the customers as well. At least, important Departments like Inland Revenue, Custom, Excise and Police should start this practice.
In Singapore, any letter sent to Government Department should be replied within four working days. In Sri Lanka no reply is received from Government Departments even after four months, but legal action is taken on time ignoring the protests made by consumers.
Hope this letter comes under the attentive eye of all concerned. World-wise Sri Lanka should become a Happy Nation ranking within the first 100 at least.
This is a step to achieve the target.
