Students pay Rs 90,000 compensation for attacking schoolmate

Nine students attached to the Ginigathhena Central College were required to pay Rs. 90,000 as compensation to a student for brutally attacking him in the school premises.
The nine were arrested after the victim’s father, who is also a teacher in the same school, had lodged a complaint with the police regarding the incident.
After the involvement of some of the parents of the suspect students, the case had been forwarded to the Mediation Board by the Ginigathhena Police. The suspects did their G.C.E. (O/L) in 2017. The victim is a Year 10 student and his father is the class teacher of the suspects.
When the case was being heard at the Mediation Board, the father of the victim had agreed to close the case if he could recover the money for the medical expenses which he had to spend after his child was admitted to a private hospital because of the attack.
The parents of the suspect students had then agreed to pay Rs 90,000 as compensation.
