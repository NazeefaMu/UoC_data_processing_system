Palladium Holdings set to be the future of hospitality

“Palladium Holdings will be the future of hospitality and will play an integral role in defining the hospitality industry of Sri Lanka,’’ said Shamrin Mohamed, Founder and Director of Palladium, to a exclusive gathering of media, major corporate partners and hotel heads on October 18, at the Palladium Holdings head office.
“Given the recent expansion in the Sri Lankan hospitality sector, we believe that Palladium Holdings will be able to fill the gaps and correct the flaws in the market. The company has been conceptualized with a vision for the future of hospitality solutions and with the development of the tourism industry in mind,” he said.
According to a report filed and issued by JLL Global Commercial Real Estate Services, Sri Lanka has experienced a significant boom in the real estate industry and it is projected to increase further because of an immediate and constant demand for residential and commercial space as well as to benefit the country’s evolving tourism industry requirements.”
Abida Tariq, Head of Sales and Legal officer to Palladium further said, “Palladium creates a conducive environment as an all-inclusive resource for foreign investors seeking to invest in profitable deals that Sri Lanka is creating as an attractive destination for investments.”
