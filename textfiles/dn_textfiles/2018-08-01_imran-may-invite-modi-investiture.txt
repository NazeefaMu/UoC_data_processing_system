Imran may invite Modi for investiture

Pakistan’s Tehreek-i-Insaf (PT) is contemplating inviting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the oath-taking ceremony of PM-elect Imran Khan on August 11, reported news agency PTI.
The party is planning to invite heads of state of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations, of which India is also a member, to the event.
A decision in this regard is likely to be taken in the coming days.
“The core committee of Tehreek-i-Insaf is considering inviting the SAARC heads including Prime Minister Modi and a decision on this is expected shortly,” a leader of Khan’s party told PTI.
PM Modi had earlier called Khan to congratulate him on his victory in the general elections. - INDIAN EXPRESS
