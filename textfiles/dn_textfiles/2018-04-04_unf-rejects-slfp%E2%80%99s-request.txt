UNF rejects SLFP’s  request

The United National Front (UNF) while rejecting the SLFP’s request for the Prime Minister to resign from his position, yesterday decided to defeat the No Confidence Motion (NCM) which is to be taken up in Parliament today.
The UNF rejected the SLFP’s request for the Prime Minister to resign from his position before the NCM is taken up for debate in Parliament. SLFP Vice President and Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva had conveyed the SLFP’s request to the Prime Minister during the Cabinet meeting held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday.
UNF leaders reached this decision during a discussion with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday.The Premier had not made any remarks over the SLFP’s request at the Cabinet meeting. However, the UNF party leaders have decided that Prime Minister Ranil Wickrmesinghe should hold the Premiership. UNP Deputy General Secretary and Education Minister Akila viraj Kariyawasam had said that the No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister would be defeated even without the support of SLFP Ministers in Parliament.
