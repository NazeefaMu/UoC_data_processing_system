SLMWC to hold fund-raiser on Sunday

The Sri Lanka Muslim Women’s Conference (SLMWC) will hold a fund-raising event to provide vocation training programmes for needy women, on August 12.
The event - Harvest of Skills – will be held at the SLMWC headquarters on Sunday from 09.00 am to 8.00pm.
SLMWC President Sithy Ameena Faiza Musthapha said that a primary objective of the organisation is poverty alleviation and there is an urgent need for vocational training for school leavers, school dropouts, and widows who are either readwinners or who have to contribute to the family income.
After the completion of their course, trainees are awarded a certificate recognised by the state and this serves as passport for employment, she said.
Many of the women who complete the training are able to set up a small business.
