The Glow in the Desert: Queen Rania of Jordan

The first Gulf War of 1991 separated her from her family when they fled from Kuwait with thousands of other Palestinians. When the wish to reunite called her to Amman, Jordan, she might not have dreamed what a transformation her life was leading her into.
Queen Rania of Jordan, also known as Rania Al Abdullah was coroneted as the Queen consort of Jordon when she was 28 years of age. She is a strong progressive female voice in the Arab world and a powerful advocate for education, health, environmental concerns and women’s rights. Since marrying the now King of Jordan in 1993, she has used her position to promote community empowerment, youth and cross-cultural dialogue.
She is also an outspoken critic of “honour killing”– the custom of men murdering any female relative found to have committed adultery or lost her virginity before marriage.
Besides her actions to enhance the wellbeing of the society, the Queen also attracts the attention of the world through her radiating good looks. She is known for her affection for designer goods and is also viewed by many as one of the world’s best-dressed women. She is also an avid user of social media and she maintains pages on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter.
Crowned as queen
In January 1993, Rania accompanied a co-worker to a dinner party that marked a turn in her life like no other. When she met Prince Abdulla, it was “love at first sight.” Rania and Prince Abdullah were engaged just two months after their meeting. Then, in June 1993, less than six months after their first encounter, the couple got married.
In King Abdullah’s book, “Our Last Chance,” he tells that he was “struck by how poised, elegant and intelligent she was.”
Upon the death of King Hussein bin Talal in February, 1999, Prince Abdullah became King of Jordan. Six weeks later, he officially elevated Rania to the status of queen.
“The king chose as a bride someone he considers an equal,” said Prince Zeid bin Raad, a childhood friend of Abdullah’s to Hello Magazine. “He listens to her ideas. They feed each other’s intellectual curiosity. They’re a perfect match, two people very comfortable together, who think along the same wavelength.”
Early Life
Rania Al-Yassin was born in Kuwait, to Palestinian parents Faisal Sedki Al-Yassin and Ilham Yassin from Tulkarm. She attended the New English School in Jabriya, Kuwait, then received a degree in Business Administration from the American University in Cairo. Upon her graduation from the American University, she worked briefly in marketing for Citibank, followed by a job with Apple Inc. in Amman.
Views on education
Queen Rania has stated that an essential aspect of education is to equip young people with the necessary skills to perform well in the workplace.
“It can lay the foundation for lasting peace and development by providing youths with skills to build their countries,” she said in an interview with Condé Nast Traveller. “If education is missing for years during conflict, then there is nobody to establish peace, civic society, and the economic prosperity needed to create a future.”
The Queen is Chairperson of Jordan’s first interactive children’s museum. In 2008, the Queen launched “Madrasati” (“My School”), a public-private initiative aimed at refurbishing 500 of Jordan’s public schools over a five-year period. In higher education, the Queen Rania Scholarship Programme partners with several universities from around the world.
She initiated the Al-Aman Fund for the Future of Orphans in 2003 and has partnered with international universities providing scholarships for Jordanian students abroad. She supports INJAZ Al-Arab,a non-profit organization that drives youth education and training in workforce readiness, financial literacy and entrepreneurship across the Arab World. As reported in injazalarab.org, she has taught classes, in her capacity as Regional Ambassador of INJAZ Al-Arab, and engaged in dialogue with young people in other countries. She is also an enthusiastic supporter of the micro-fund movement which provides financial assistance to would-be entrepreneurs.
Light across the globe
In 2007, Queen Rania was named UNICEF’s first Eminent Advocate for Children. In 2009, Queen Rania became Honorary Global Chair of the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative (UNGEI). Archive.is reports that she worked alongside other world leaders, including former South African President Nelson Mandela, in a global movement seeking to improve the welfare of children.
In 2009, Queen Rania co-founded and led the launch of the “1GOAL: Education for All” campaign alongside English retired footballer and current sports broadcaster, Gary Lineker. The campaign raises public awareness and involvement in achieving education for all the 67 million children out of school worldwide.
In early 2002 Queen Rania joined the Board of Directors of the International Youth Foundation, based in Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States. In September 2006, Queen Rania also joined the United Nations Foundation Board of Directors.
Forbes magazine ranked her as one of the world’s 100 most powerful women in 2011.
Cross-culture dialog
Queen Rania has also been particularly vocal about the importance of cross cultural and interfaith dialogue to foster greater understanding, tolerance and acceptance across the world.She has used her status to correct what she sees as misconceptions in the West about the Arab world.
“I think we need to redraw the lines and realize that this battle is moderates against extremists,” she said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). “It’s not Christians against Muslims. It’s not West against East. It’s not Arabs against Americans. It is moderates against extremists. And once we can really understand that, then we can start to fight the real enemy.”
Publications
Queen Rania has also published four children’s books to date, inspired by her own experiences as a child: the New York Times best seller ‘The Sandwich Swap’, ‘Eternal Beauty’, ‘Maha of the Mountains’ and ‘The King’s Gift.’
More than what meets the eye
She told the CBC in the same interview: “I’d rather be dealt with as a person than a persona. With my children, I am just Mom. At the end of the day, the position is just a position, a title is just a title, and those things come and go. It’s really your essence and your values that are important.”
Wearing her spirit in her charismatic posture, Queen Rania of Jordan continues on her path to build the world, contributing to the future generously from where she stands. Beautiful on the inside and out, she, indeed, is a bright light in a misconceived world. (SSP)
