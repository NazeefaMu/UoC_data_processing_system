The to realize the truth urgently

The Buddha was self-enlightened. Although he went to certain teachers searching for the perfect truth, no one of them could show him the way to the ultimate truth. Therefore, he decided to rely on his soon effort with a determination to find out the truth.
An ascetic was so impressed by the radiant appearance of the Buddha. He asked him who his teacher was. At that time, Buddha replied thus, “All have I overcome, all so I know from all am I detached. All have I renounced wholly absorbed am I in the destruction of craving. Having comprehended all by myself, whom shall I call my teachers?”
Like a flower in full bloom which cannot keep the scent to itself, the Gautama Buddha, the fully Awakened One began to spread the sublime message soon after attaining the Enlightenment. He was merciful and generous completely to preach his teachings and share the supreme knowledge he had gained with the suffering of humanity. He was an incomparable teacher.
Certain people are extremely proud of their intellectual attainment. They claim to have knowledge but their knowledge is rarely coupled with wisdom. One western scholar admitted that the more we learn about things existing in the world, the more we create our own concepts and fantasies which are the product of our limited way of thinking and shaped by our limited senses. He said that instead of gaining wisdom, we have increased our ignorance. The people who claim to know many things only develop their egoism and sceptical views which create more confusion and disturb the peace and confidence in their own minds. The knowledge and attitudes they maintain often generate more misunderstanding and conflict instead of establishing harmony and goodwill.
During the Buddha's time, there was a young monk who had come from a wealthy royal family. Young and robust, he had had the opportunity of enjoying a wide variety of sense pleasures before his ordination. He was rich and he had a lot of friends and relatives. His wealth made available to him the full panoply of indulgences. Even then, he gave up all these on the point of seeking liberation. One day when the king of that country was riding through the forest, he came across this young monk. The king said, “Venerable Sir you are handsome and robust you are in the prime of youth. You come from a wealthy family and have a lot of chances to enjoy yourself. Why did you leave your home and family to wear robes and live in loneliness? Don't you feel lonely? Aren't you bored?
The monk then answered thus, O’ great king, when I was listening to the Buddha's discourses that leads to arousing spiritual urgency, a great sense of urgency seized me. I want to extract the optimum utility from this body of mien in time before I die. That is why I gave up the worldly life willingly realizing the danger of being late to spiritual progress and hence, I took these robes”.
The above story points out to us the need of practising the teachings of the Buddha without any undue delay for our own safety in the next life of ours.
If you are still not convinced of the need to practise with great urgency, without blind attachment to this physical body or life, the Buddha's words may also be helpful for you to ponder over with much enthusiasm. One should reflect, he said, on the act that the whole world of beings is made up of nothing but mind and matter which have arisen but do not stay. Mind and matter do not remain still even for one single moment, they are in constant flux. When we are very young, we like to grow but when we are old, we are stuck in an irreversible process of decline.
May we all have the wisdom comprehended the four noble truths, as preached by the Buddha in this very life.
