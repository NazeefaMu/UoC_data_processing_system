The President pointed out the responsibility of all Sri Lankans is to pay due honour the highest respect to all members of the Security Forces who sacrificed their lives on behalf of the territorial integrity of our great Motherland.
President Sirisena recalled the contributions of all patriots and endorsed by the election victory on January 8, the government will effect a radical change in the political, economic, social and cultural landscape to impart the people the real sense of good governance.
He said the nation should be grateful to the Armed Forces and the government leadership in defeating the terrorists and protect the country.
The President also underscored as priority undertaking, the need to build genuine unity among all people in the country after the physical defeat of terrorism in 2009.
President Sirisena called on the people to extend fullest cooperation to the government to fulfill the task of building the Nation by solving the issues left behind by the Colonial rulers in 1948 and the post-conflict issues that were not resolved after May 2009.
The President further said that the cultural, social and religious values of the Sri Lankan society deteriorated during over 400 years of foreign occupation and the independent nation inherited major issues when the Colonial rulers left in 1948.
During the past 68 years, the country failed to solve those issues and furthermore the country failed to address the post conflict issues that should have been solved after the elimination of terrorism in May 2009.
"The government did not take the required measures after the defeat of terrorism in 2009 and in January 2015, the people gave me the mandate to fulfill that task. Therefore, we have to take effective steps to build reconciliation and harmony and coexistence between the communities" the President said, while urging people to extend fullest cooperation for this national endeavour.
"If we had taken the steps that should have been taken after May 2009, we would not have faced the resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council in September 2015. The government is determined to face the UNHRC resolution with the collective strength of all sections in order to protect and preserve the national pride as well as the pride and dignity of our Armed Forces that had made numerous sacrifices to safeguard the country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity," President Sirisena added.

He noted that it was wrong to give false interpretations to the government policy with regard to the UNHRC resolution as the government is fully committed to safeguarding the nation and the pride of the heroic Armed Forces.
The President said that the people,especially the younger generation are equipped with the latest technological know-how to keep abreast with the ever changing world. It is, therefore, necessary to fully understand the thinking and expectations of the new generation, and as a government to take the necessary steps to help them realize these expectations.
"We should understand the difference between the Child of Culture of the post -1948 era and today's Child of Technology," he said.
"Together with the mandate given to us by the people on January 8, we made important promises and pledges to the people working as a new government and we have achieved a great success by strengthening democracy with the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Through that we have established independent commissions for elections, judiciary, police, public service, auditing and investigate bribery and corruption," the President said .
"We have brought about new transformations in politics, the economy,society and culture," he said.
Pointing out that the media enjoys unprecedented freedom today, President Sirisena, however, emphasized the importance of using that freedom with wisdom,responsibility and discipline.
He cautioned that if media freedom is not properly used, any future government could curtail media freedom once again.
