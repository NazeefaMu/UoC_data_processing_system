What the UNP has done and shelter for all by 2025

I’m sure you don’t need me to explain the importance of homes both for physical and spiritual welfare. We all remember our own homes with fondness and, of course, they set up for life. They are the places we congregate as a family. Here we share experiences and a safe haven for us to return after busy days in the outside world.
Housing is important to people and their families’ well-being and security. That is why it is our mission to ensure that all Sri Lankans have shelter by 2025 and why, while in government, the UNP has invested over Rs 22 billion into housing over the past two years.
This investment in these houses is only possible because of the measures our government has taken to build a strong economy. Some of those decisions have been hard and tough measures have been put in place. But let me assure you, decisions are always taken in the best interests of Sri Lanka and its people. We are working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans.
Government investment in housing
It is only by building a stronger economy that we have been able to invest so heavily in housing. Our government’s management of the economy has meant more money available for housing in poor and rural communities. We are proud to have helped well over 200,000 families secure a home so far and upgraded or made safe tens of thousands more.
Government investment in housing and amenities has doubled under the UNP and increased from Rs 7.8 billion to 19.6 billion in 2016. Under the Housing Plastering Program, 109,423 beneficiaries received Rs 10,000 worth of material. For those living in condition created over 30 years ago the housing conditions of almost 7,000 families have been upgraded and over 800 houses were completed for those working in the plantation sector.
By keeping to our plan to strengthen our economy we can keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future. Colombo is the nation’s commercial capital and the most important shipping hub for a vibrant region of over 1.5 billion people.
It boasts a highly educated workforce, a clean environment, modern cosmopolitan values, stable democratic governance, and mature investor-friendly structures.
Strong economy
Through the Megapolis programme, we are building a platform for growth that is consistent with social justice. A roadmap to development that is in harmony with the ecology. All this is possible because we are building a strong economy.
This government has helped over 200,000 families secure a home. In the process, we have improved the lives and security of hundreds of thousands of families and contributed to the UNP’s mission to ensure all Sri Lankans are sheltered by 2025.
Frankly, our government has the builders. We are building a strong economy and now we are building homes for our people from the proceeds of endeavour. Housing is a human right and we are delivering homes for our hard-working citizens. More homes, a stronger economy and we are building a better Sri Lanka.
