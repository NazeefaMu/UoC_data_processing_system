Pelwatte Dairy celebrates World Milk Day

World Milk Day falls on June 1, held in 2001 as an initiative of the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO).
World Milk Day is celebrated internationally and is the perfect opportunity to focus attention on this global food milk and ‘raise a glass to celebrate the benefits of milk for our lives.’
This year’s celebrations revolve around the themes of “Good food, health and nutrition, Farmers’ caring responsibility for their communities, the land, and their animals and how dairy contributes to economic development and livelihoods.
Pelwatte Dairy Industries is a first private sector firm to invest in a milk production plant and is in the forefront of promoting self-sufficiency in milk for Sri Lanka.
Pelwatte prides in ensuring that 100 percent of the milk used is locally sourced and is 100 percent organic without any added preservatives to increase shelf-life.
“As we celebrates World Milk Day, this is what Pelwatte aspires to do as we deliver Sri Lankans the highest quality dairy products while conserving valuable foreign exchange currently spent on imported dairy products”, said Pelwatte Dairy’s Managing Director, Akmal Wickramanayake.
