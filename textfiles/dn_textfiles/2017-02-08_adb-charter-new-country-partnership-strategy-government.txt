ADB to charter new country partnership strategy with Government

Asian Development Bank (ADB) is working on a new country partnership strategy with Sri Lankan government to address dynamic challenges with sustainable, inclusive and environmentally friendly solutions, a senior official said.
ADB, South Asia Regional Department Director General Hun Kim said ADB’s previous assistance to Sri Lanka was primarily focused on fulfilling the basic needs of people and filling gaps in physical capacities. “But in the coming years, ADB will be a forward looking strategic partner with the government to remove impediments to private investments and creates new engines of economic growth and enhance the productivity of economic systems,” he said.
“Without increasing lending capacities, we want to see the solutions expand in Sri Lanka whether it is for development finance, investment strategy or promotion of technology transfer,” he said.
“With the limited size in the domestic market and demand, strategic shift must be made to diversify production base in the country and most importantly increase productivity across sectors for expansion of exports and participation of global value chains and creation of higher value jobs.”
