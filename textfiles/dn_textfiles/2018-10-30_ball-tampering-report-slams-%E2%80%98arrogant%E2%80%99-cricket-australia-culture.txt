Ball-tampering report slams ‘arrogant’ Cricket Australia culture

MELBOURNE, Monday : A review into a ball-tampering scandal has condemned an “arrogant” and “controlling” culture at Cricket Australia that led to players cheating in pursuit of victory.
The independent review by the Sydney-based Ethics Centre accused Cricket Australia (CA) of only paying lip service to the spirit of the game, leaving players without any moral guidance.
“Responsibility for that larger picture lies with CA and not just the players held directly responsible for the appalling incident at Newlands,” it said.
The scandal involved Australian players using sandpaper to alter the flight of the ball in a Test match against South Africa last March at Cape Town’s Newlands Stadium.
Coach Darren Lehmann quit in the wake of the controversy and then-captain Steve Smith, deputy David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft were banned from the game. The scandal also claimed the scalps of CA chief executive James Sutherland and team performance boss Pat Howard.
“CA is perceived to say one thing and do another. The most common description of CA is as ‘arrogant’ and ‘controlling’,” the review said. – AFP
