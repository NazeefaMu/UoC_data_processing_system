Owing to the demonstration that lasted for about one and a half hours, the traffic movement of the area was hindered causing immense hardships to tourists and the people of the area.
They protested against the recent police directive which banned the parking of three-wheelers along the main road from Yaddehimulla Junction leading to the famous Devol Devala of Unawatuna via the tourist area. The police had taken this measure to rectify the long-standing traffic congestion in the area.
Following this directive, the police had started to fine three-wheeler operators who park their vehicles along the entrance road in irregular ways obstructing the vehicular traffic.
However, Habaraduwa Police OIC IP K. P. Udaya Kumara who arrived at the scene with Traffic OIC T.M.Thilakarathne, having discussed with the protestors, managed to convince them.
Petroleum Resource Development Minister Chandima Weerakkodi also met the demonstrators.
Following deliberations, the protestors dispersed peacefully as they were promised an appropriate plan in the area which will benefit all sections. They were assured that they will be allowed to engage in their livelihoods without hindrances.
