Five bowlers who have taken 10 wickets in an innings

Only once in a blue moon, any player achieves this sort of a record. While there are many instances of a bowler picking up 10 wickets in an innings of a match in the history of cricket. Here is my top 5 pick of this rare feat. Everyone knows about the 10-wicket haul that Anil Kumble took against Pakistan at the Ferozshah Kotla Stadium.
It is an incredible feat for any bowler to achieve regardless of the format and the competition he is playing in. Here is this list we will be discussing other players who have been able to achieve similar kind of feat across the world in different formats.
5. Jim Laker
The Englishmen achieved this great feat back in the year 1956 and that too in the Ashes. It can’t get bigger than this for any English player as this was against the mighty Australians. This was the fourth Test match of the series which was played in Manchester. In the first innings, England score 459 runs with the help of two centuries from Richardson and Sheppard.
Australia wouldn’t have thought this even in a nightmare. They were bowled out for just 84 runs in the first innings were asked to follow-on. Thanks to Jim Laker’s 9 wickets which helped England to wrap the Australians so early. Second Innings had something special in store for Jim Laker as he went on to become the first bowler in the history of International Cricket to take 10 wickets in an innings.
He completed with a figure of 51.2-23-53-10. He took a total of 19 wickets in the match which is still a world record for most no of wickets in a single Test match. England won the Test match by an innings and 170 runs on 31st July 1956.

4. Anil Kumble
Anil Kumble was the first Indian bowler to take 10 wickets in an innings of an International Test Match. He achieved this milestone against India’s arch-rivals Pakistan back in 1999. Pakistan was chasing a target of 420 runs in the final innings to win the Test at the Ferozshah Kotla ground.
Saeed Anwar and Shahid Afridi gave Pakistan an excellent start and put on a century run partnership giving hopes to the Pakistani fans that they can still win the Test match. Ferozshah Kotla Stadium which is known for its turning pitch helped India make a comeback in the Test match.

3. Mahaboob Alam
Few would know his name as he is not a player from a Test playing team. Mahaboob Alam is left-arm pacer from Nepal. This man had his name in the Guinness Book of World Record when he became the first player to take 10 wickets in an innings of a limited over format.
He was the first man to do so in an official limited over match. Nepal was playing Mozambique in an ICC World Cricket League Division 5 match in 2008. Nepal batting first scored 238 runs in their stipulated 50 overs.
Mozambique lost half their side at a total of just 9 runs. Nepal wrapped up the match in just 14.5 overs and thus winning the match by a handsome margin of 219 runs. A total of nine ducks were in the scorecard for Mozambique’s batsman. Alam finished with an overall figure of 10/12.

South Zone had two all-time great batsmen in their side, The Wall, Rahul Dravid and Very Very Special Laxman. Little mattered to Mohanty on that day as he was on top of his game. His bowling held East Zone to win the match by four wickets while chasing a modest target of 167 runs.
