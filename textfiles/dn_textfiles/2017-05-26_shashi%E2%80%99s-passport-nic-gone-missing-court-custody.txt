Shashi’s passport, NIC gone missing in court custody

The Attorney General yesterday informed Court that the general passport and the National Identity Card (NIC) belonging to Shashi Weerawansa, wife of National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa had gone missing while being kept under court custody as production items in the case.
The CID had filed two separate cases against Shashi Weerawansa over an incident where Mrs. Weerawansa had fraudulently obtained two passports including a diplomatic passport by submitting forged documents to the Department of Immigration and Emigration.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing on behalf of the CID called for an inquiry into the misplacement.
Taking into consideration the facts, Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara issued an order directing the registrar of Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court to immediately produce the concerned production items in Courts.
DSG Peiris submitted to Court that in accordance with the court journal entry dated February 25, 2015, the concerned production items had been handed over to court in open court.
“The registrar has informed the CID this morning that the general passport and National Identity Card belonging to the accused were not found in the locker,” Mr. Peiris added.
Meanwhile, the case was fixed for trial on May 31 and the seventh and eleventh witnesses of the case were advised to appear in Courts on the next trial date.
President’s Counsel Anil de Silva with Jayantha Weerasinghe PC appearing on behalf of the accused informed court that they were yet to receive the first complaint of the case.
