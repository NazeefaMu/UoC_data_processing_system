Mendis’ bag of 10 helps Richmond crush Dharmapala

Off-spinner Sandun Mendis captured a match bag of ten wickets to help Richmond College crush Dharmapala College Pannipitiya by 130 runs in the Singer inter-school cricket match played at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium, Sooriyawewa yesterday. A total of 23 wickets fell on the first day.
Richmond skipper Chamikara Hewage’s decision to bat first did not pay off when Dharmapala spinners Mahima Weerakoon and Dilshan de Silva grabbed four wickets each to dismissed Richmond for 120. Dhananjaya Lakshan top scored with 28.
Richmond bowlers made amends where their batsmen failed by bowling out Dharmapala for 70 with Dhananjaya Lakshan, Ravishka Wijesiri and Sandun Mendis capturing three wickets each.
Chamindu Subasinghe captured three quick wickets to see Richmond at 63/3 in their second innings at stumps on day one but the Dharmapala bowlers luck ran out when play resumed yesterday and Richmond were able to declare their second innings at 185/6.
Dhananjaya Lakshan who opened the innings was unfortunate to be caught at 71 while Thaveesha Abhishek was dismissed for 46. Chamindu Samarasinghe captured two wickets.
Chasing a target of 235 runs to win the Dharmapala batsmen fell victim to Mendis’ off breaks and were all out for 105 before tea. Mendis took 7 for 42 for match figures of 10 for 58.
