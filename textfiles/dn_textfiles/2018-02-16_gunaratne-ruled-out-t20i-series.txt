Gunaratne ruled out of T20I series

Asela Gunaratne, a member of the 15-member squad playing Bangladesh in the on-going two T20 Internationals has been ruled out of the series.
Gunaratne has sustained an injury in his right arm, while diving during one of the fielding drills and getting his arm caught in an awkward position, states a Sri Lanka Cricket media release.
Gunaratne was due to return to Colombo yesterday to undergo an MRI scan and start a rehabilitation process. No replacement will be sent.
