Ability to beat the field key to playing spin  in subcontinent

 
Australia and England the two oldest Test playing countries in the world has shown by their recent performances over the past five months that they are eon years behind mastering spin in the subcontinent.
Australia suffered a rare 0-3 whitewash in Sri Lanka in August and England after a disappointing 1-all draw in Bangladesh where they were expected to fare a lot better by winning the series have clearly demonstrated their incapability to counter spin by conceding the ongoing five-match Test series to India 0-3 with one Test to play.
While Australia’s strong batting was dismantled by the left-arm spin of Rangana Herath who finished the three-match series with a handsome haul of 28 wickets at an astonishing average of 12.75, England’s batting in India has run into trouble against off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin who has so far scalped 27 wickets at 23.70. In Bangladesh the England batting was undone by rookie off-spinner Mehedi Hasan who captured 19 wickets (avg. 15.63) in the two Tests.
Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen wrote prior to departure that England’s winter in India will be decided by which team plays spin best. As it has turned out to be Virat Kohli’s men have proved far superior to Alastair Cook’s troopers.
“India will want nothing less than a 5-0 whitewash against England this winter so they will be watching closely how they perform against Bangladesh over the next two Test matches,” wrote Pietersen.
“If England draw this series 1-1, or the batsmen struggle and the spinners are whacked, then everyone in India will be laughing at them and they will immediately find themselves under pressure when they arrive there.”
Prophetic words for exactly that’s what’s happened. India will be deprived of a 5-0 whitewash after England drew the first Test at Rajkot with their best performance in the series coming within three wickets of pulling off a win. If that had happened one wonders how the rest of the series would have panned out. India came back strongly to win the next three Tests and pocket the series with one to play.
The controversial Pietersen one of the few good players of spin in the England team wrote: “Playing spin in the sub-continent is all about picking length and understanding where you can score. You have to be able to rotate strike and play with the field. At all times you must have boundary options. As soon as you have boundary options, you can hit the ball hard and that opens up a gap for you to be able to manipulate the field.
“It is no good being able to just block all day because a ball will bounce and turn that gets you out. If you do not have boundary options, and can’t hit over the top or slog sweep for four, then it limits your areas for scoring and rotating the strike. If you do not rotate the strike then you die a slow death on the sub-continent.
“Look at the great players down the years. Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and now Kohli. Like his predecessors he has four or five boundary options which makes the opposition bowler think ‘goodness me where do I bowl’. If the captain puts boundary riders back for the sweep or pushes back long on it gives him 360 degrees around the field to take the single and rotate the strike. Once Kohli does that he has won half the battle. Once you have control over the field you just need to bat sensibly.
“The mental challenge of batting in the sub-continent is understanding your game plan and sticking to it. It is not a case of worrying about who is around the bat or what fielding positions they are setting for you. Just stick with your game plan. It is crucial not to worry about the opponents. In Australia and South Africa where there is true bounce and carry you can concentrate on the bowler and what he might do next. But in the sub continent you must focus on your job of scoring, having boundary options and getting off strike. There is no point thinking about short leg, or if there is a catcher here or there. You have to concentrate on your ability to beat the field.”
Pietersen is one of the few England batsmen to excel against spin in the subcontinent having scored a Test century in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka – he was dismissed for 99 in Bangladesh.
Who can forget his memorable knock of 151 against Sri Lanka at the P Sara Oval in 2012 that paved the way for England’s series equaling win in the two-Test series. Pietersen battled against the spin of Rangana Herath (6/133), Suraj Randiv and Tillakaratne Dilshan.
Going by how the Indian spinners have dominated the England batting in the series and the way Australia floundered against Herath in Sri Lanka, India will be licking their fingers for another successful home series against Australia when they tour there in February-March for four Tests.
