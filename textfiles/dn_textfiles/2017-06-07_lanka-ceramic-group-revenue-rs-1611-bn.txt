In addition, the group gross profit increased by 10.73% to record Rs.5.39 billion in 2016-2017 due to improved operational efficiency measures carried out earlier. The Group recorded a profit after tax of Rs. 2 billion for the year under review. As key players, Lanka Tiles PLC and Lanka Walltiles PLC strengthened group profitability, further enhanced by a strong performance by Swisstek Aluminium Ltd which recorded a profit of Rs. 326 million in the year under review.
