BASL explains role in Kannan’s appointment as HC Judge

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) in a statement yesterday explained the BASL’s role in the appointment of R.Kannan as High Court Judge.
The association said there has never been a practice of either the Bar Council or the Executive Committee of the Bar Association or Branch Associations approving persons that are to be recommended for appointment to the judiciary,” the statement said.
The statement: “There has been much speculation and allegations related to the above appointment and the role of the Bar Association in relation to it.
For over a year, representations were made by lawyers, especially from the Eastern Province, that there was an acute shortage of High Court Judges in the Northern and Eastern Provinces conversant in the Tamil language resulting in a backlog and delay in disposal of cases. These representations were made both at the Bar Council and Executive Committee meetings of the Bar Association.
‘This issue was taken up at the regular Bench and Bar meetings between representatives of the Bar Association and His Lordship the Chief Justice and other members of the Judicial Services Commission on several occasions.
At these meetings it was indicated that there was a serious shortage of Tamil speaking career judges senior enough to be promoted to the High Court and that even the Attorney General’;s Department was unwilling to release its officers conversant in the Tamil language for such appointments due to its heavy reliance on its very few Tamil officers.
Consequently it was suggested that if members of the Unofficial Bar even from the Northern and Eastern Provinces were willing to give up their practise and offer themselves for such appointment the same will be considered and that they could be posted outside the province of their practise. Previously some members of the unofficial bar in Colombo were requested to consider accepting appointment but such was not successful.
“In August 2016 a member of the Akkaraipattu Bar was recommended and his application supported by a senior President’s Counsel was forwarded to His Lordship the Chief Justice to be considered for such appointment through the constitutional process, but this did not materialise.
“In September 2016 Mr.R.Kannan’s application was forwarded by the President of the Batticoloa Bar to the undersigned. The referees were a former Attorney General and a retired additional Solicitor General as Mr. R. Kannan, prior to taking up private practise, had been an officer of the Attorney General’s Department for close to Twelve years.
Upon inquiries from officials of the Bar Association as well as the Batticaloa Bar and Eastern Province practitioners, Senior Silks and other members of the Attorney General’s Department about his suitability the undersigned was advised that he is a competent individual of integrity, trilingual, with over seventeen years as a practitioner enjoying a successful practise at the Batticoloa Bar of which he was the Secretary, though Mr. Kannan, in fact hailed from Matale”.
Accordingly, the application of Mr. Kannan, as directed, by His Lordship the Chief Justice, was forwarded by the undersigned to His Excellency the President the appointing authority for consideration, with copy to His Lordship the Chief Justice and the Minister of Justice by the undersigned’s letter of 21 st September 2016.
“In the meantime, representations continued to be made to the Bar Association as to the delay in appointing Tamil conversant judges to the Northern and Eastern Provinces due to the retirement of two High Court judges aggravated by a policy decision not to continue to appoint already retired Tamil conversant judges as Commissioners.
Due to this prevailing situation around September 2016 a capable Muslim judicial officer, conversant in Tamil though junior in the seniority list of career judges was appointed as a Commissioner with the intention of giving him a permanent High Court judges appointment when he reached the required seniority.
Against this background and delays discussions continued for the need to make early appointments especially as the application of Mr. Kannan, from the Unofficial Bar, was pending since 21 st September 2016.
There was never any concern or reservation communicated to the undersigned related to the suitability or otherwise of Mr. Kannan for appointment, or any suggestion to such effect, which the undersigned believes is based on some incorrect information or misunderstanding. Consequently there was never any appeal or the need for same by the undersigned or a delegation of the Bar Association related to pursuing the application of Mr. Kannan.
“The appointment of Mr. Kannan, was eventually effected by His Excellency with the concurrence of His Lordship the Chief Justice and the Judicial Services Commission and the Honourable Attorney General and in accordance with the Constitution.
His Excellency is reported to have stated that he made his own inquiries before making the appointment.
“The undersigned wishes to clarify that there has never been a practise of either the Bar Council or theExecutive Committee of the Bar Association or Branch Associations approving persons that are to be recommended for appointment to the judiciary though there have been several apppintments to the judiciary from the Unofficial Bar in the past.
It is also pertinent to note and recognise that the Bar Association has constantly maintained that courts, especially the Apex and higher courts, should comprise a healthy mix of members of the career judiciary, the Official and Unofficial Bars. In fact the yardstick referred to in the past has been 4 : 2 : 1 i.e. for every four (4) career judges two (2) from the Official Bar and One (1) from the Unofficial Bar should be appointed”.
