China pledges more support

Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yan has said China was ready to work on reducing the trade imbalance and to support economic and social development in Sri Lanka.
The Chinese Vice Premier met Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana, who is on an official visit to China to attend the celebrations of the 60th Anniversary of diplomatic relations and the 65th Anniversary of economic relations between Sri Lanka and China.
During discussions with Minister Marapana, Vice Premier Yan had observed that the Belt and Road initiative of China provides a better platform for a new open economy and since Sri Lanka has a favourable geographic location, it could benefit largely from the initiative.
The Vice Premier had emphasised that the Belt and Road Initiative is highly compatible for Sri Lanka to become the financial centre of the Indian Ocean
Vice Premier Yan recalled the friendship between the two countries and appreciated the Minister’s visit.
Minister Marapana congratulated the Vice Premier on his elevation as a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the CPC and mentioned that the friendship between Sri Lanka and China can be traced back to the 4th Century, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
Recalling the uninterrupted friendship between Sri Lanka and China, Minister Marapana had observed that the visits to China by President Maithripala Sirisena in 2015 and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2016 and in 2017, have added much impetus to the bilateral relations. The Minister stated that Sri Lanka has never deviated from the One China policy.
