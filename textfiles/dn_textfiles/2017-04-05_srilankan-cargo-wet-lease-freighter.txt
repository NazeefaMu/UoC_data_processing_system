SriLankan Cargo to wet lease freighter

SriLankan Cargo is mulling on wet leasing a freighter aircraft to expand operations,SriLankan Airlines’ Cargo Head Chamara Ranasinghe said.
He said that cargo volumes are growing and they see a greater demand in the future as well. “Due to the pull out of Frankfurt and Paris we lost out from the cargo segment and we want to capture this back firstly through Code Share agreements with other airlines upto the Middle East and then
connect to our network. Secondly we are looking at a separate cargo aircraft on a lease to intensify our operations,”he said.
He also said that today over US dollars 3 trillion of e commerce business is going out of China and they are also looking at taking a slice of this business through several synergies.
Asked by Daily News Business on the losses the Cargo Department suffered due to the airport closure, he said that it was around US$ 9 million.
He also said that the cargo is a key area in the national carrier and they contribute around 10% of the revenue to Sri Lankan. “Our target is to increase this to 15% soon.” The freight handling arm of SriLankan Airlines, set a new record for the amount of cargo handled at the Cargo Centre of Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport with a massive total of 239,636 tonnes in 2016, a remarkable growth of 12.88% over the 212,277 of the previous year.

Ranasinghe said that they do not have any cargo operations from Mattala since there is no connectivity. “However with proper connections and a highway in place it can be converted to a cargo hub.”
Worldwide Cargo Sales Manager Niran Seneviratne said they are the preferred cargo carrier of prestigious world companies like Nike, Addidas, Microsift, IBM, Dell, Nokia and they are every strong in the Indian sub continent.
Asked about complaints that SriLankan Cargo is expensive especially with regard to perishable cargo to Maldives he said that it was based on demand and supply situation.
He also said that local exporters should also be patriot and try to send goods through the national carrier.
