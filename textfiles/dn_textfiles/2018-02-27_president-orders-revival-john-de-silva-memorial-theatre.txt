President orders revival of John de Silva Memorial Theatre

The John de Silva Memorial Theatre in Colombo, which catered to the staging of dramas and other preforming arts at affordable prices in the past, is to be revived.
President Maithripala Sirisena has directed relevant authorities to take immediate steps to refurbish and modernise the theatre in a manner fitting the revival of the staging of dramas and other performing arts.
Recently, there were reports in certain sections of the media that steps were underway to sell this theatre to the private sector. This gave rise to various debates among the artistes and arts lovers. The President has made the latest directive after paying attention to these news items and debates. The President who emphasised that there were no plans to sell this theatre to the private sector, pledged to modernise the facility and hand it over for the use of artistes soon. The President has also directed Director General of Cultural Affairs, Dharmasiri Bandaranayake to convey this message to the cultural and arts fraternity.
