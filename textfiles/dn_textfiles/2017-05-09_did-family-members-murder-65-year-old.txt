Did family members murder 65-year-old?

Three family members including the wife and daughter of a former Ports Authority employee from Kerawalapitiya, Wattala have been arrested by Police over suspicion of murdering the latter, Police said yesterday.
Police probing the mysterious disappearance of 65-year-old Hettithanthrige Walton noted that the investigations carried out so far had revealed that Walton may have been murdered.
The third person arrested in connection with the disappearance of Walton is his daughter’s husband.
The family members earlier had told Police that Walton had migrated abroad. However, Police had received information from Walton’s neighbours that this claim was not true. Police after consulting Immigration and Emigration authorities had come to know that Walton had not gone abroad as claimed by the family members. During the probe over the disappearance of the man, Walton’s family members are said to have vacated the house and fled the area.
A special Police team yesterday had arrested Walton’s wife, daughter and her husband. Police said they are being questioned over the disappearance of Walton.
Police have also obtained a Court order to search the house and its immediate vicinity. The search is to take place today.
