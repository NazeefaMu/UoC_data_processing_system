Neil Jayasekara,  new CPC - MD

Neil Jayasekara who was the Manager (Refinery), assumed duty as the new Managing Director of CPC (acting) yesterday at the CPC premises in the presence of Minister Arjuna Ranatunga. Secretary to the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry, Upali Marasingha and CPC Chairman Dammika Ranatunga were also present on this occasion.
Jayasekara was the Manager (Refinery) for 7 years and he graduated as a mechanical engineer from the Peradeniya University. He was appointed as an engineer (A division) of the CPC on 03rd August, 1981, who later appointed as the Manager (Refinery) in 2010.
Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated that they always allow their workers to rise to higher positions for the betterment of the CPC.
“There should be a procedure in every institution, which allows their workers to rise to higher positions. Earlier, this procedure was not followed at the CPC, but we changed it.The Vision of the Yahapalanaya government is to make governmental institutions profitable. We were able to make Rs. 11billion as profits during my period I was the minister, because we allowed talented workers to rise to higher positions in the Ports Authority. We introduced this system to the CPC as well. We don’t require popular workers. We require talented workers who are not only concerned about the position, but the betterment of the institution,” Ranatunga added.
Secretary Upali Marasingha stated that the future responsibility of the CPC is to satisfy customers and it will be done successfully under the new managing director. Several dignitaries including the Additional Secretary Siripala Hettiarachchi also graced this occasion.
