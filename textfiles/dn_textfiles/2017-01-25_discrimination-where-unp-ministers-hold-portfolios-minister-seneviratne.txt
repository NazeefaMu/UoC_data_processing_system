Discrimination where UNP ministers hold portfolios: Minister Seneviratne

Today we are in the process of uniting the two sections of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) through discussions. Our aim is saving the party, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
There is a clear division in the SLFP trade unions. If the SLFP is to face the next election separately, the benefit of the division would directly go to the UNP. Members of the SLFP trade unions still face difficulties in some State institutions. Since this is a National Government, such acts of discrimination should not be tolerated hereafter, said Minister Seneviratne, addressing the Executive Committee meeting of the SLFP trade unions held in Colombo recently.
According to Minister Seneviratne, since this is not a 100 percent SLFP Government, the acts of discrimination take place where UNP Ministers hold portfolios. The issue should be brought to the notice of President Maithripala Sirisena in order to arrive at a solution.
Trade unionists pointed out that the members of SLFP trade unions where the Cabinet ministerial post is held by a SLFP Minister, also face discrimination.
