Music, his first love

Like Mozart's Requiem, the Sri Lankan listening audience is yet to be trained to respond to guitar music. It is of course the de facto earnest emotion that matters when listening attentively to guitar music. The guitar music can be on the other hand kaleidoscopic conveyors of emotion. Witness Rukshan Perera’s blend of untrammelled skill as he switches between guitar and piano with easy dexterity.
Q: Your mother was Trila Perera, a music teacher at Princess of Wales College in 1960s and 1970s. How did your mother influence your career?
A: My mother was a pianist, conductor, church organist and community leader. I always think of her when I compose and perform. I thank my mother for giving me the first lesson at the piano. With music of the Beatles, Shadows and Santana where music was heavy on guitar, I quickly switched to guitar. I taught it myself.
Q: How is it possible to self-teach an instrument?
A: We had no choice those days. There were no music schools. No guitar teachers. No books. Not even youtube or videos to watch and learn. All we had was radio. We listened to radio and took the portions, chords and lyrics as the song was played. That’s how we learnt. Our children find this hard to believe!
Q: Like any other artiste, you had to put art aside for higher studies. How did you strike a balance?
A: I entered a University in New York and obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Systems Development and continued with an MBA. While in the university I joined the College Jazz Band as guitarist and vocalist. I learnt the basics of jazz improvisation. After graduating I worked for Philip Morris International for over 20 years in the IT field and retired early to return to Sri Lanka to once again to continue music. This time with a difference!
Q: Despite credentials, why didn’t you join the corporate sector?
A: Working for Philip Morris for 20 years gave me the opportunity to use my analytical skills while travelling the world and managing employees. But I retired early to get back to my first love – music and I am very happy with the decision.
Q: Most of your compositions have an inclination towards social issues. Any particular reason?
A: I write songs to promote awareness on important social issues and raise funds for deserving charities. Most of my songs are in English and have touched the important topics of the day related to Sri Lanka and the world. Environment, child abuse, peace and unity, freedom, helping children, drug abuse, education, poverty alleviation, religious and racial harmony, helping victims of natural disasters, fighting cancer, helping disabled persons and fighting leprosy for example. Some songs have been written to specific organizations. I have managed to raise millions for charities through my concerts, my DVDs and other events. I must also thank all the musicians/singers and others who have joined me to support on such endeavors.
Q: However, we hardly hear them on local radio.
A: When I initially launched my CD titled Coming Home To You, I tried to promote it through radio, but got disappointed with lack of support for English originals in Sri Lanka. Therefore now when I compose a song, I record it, add appropriate video clips and post it on Youtube. I have only uploaded about 30 songs but I have 400 subscribers on my youtube channel who enjoy my music and already have about 400,000 hits on my songs. I believe I have more fans outside of Sri Lanka than in Sri Lanka! However, I will make another attempt with the radio stations.
Q: You are also skilled in whistling, scatting and composing acapellas.
A: I can whistle a melody and the harmony simultaneously. This is achieved with a subtle movement of the tongue which is hard to explain. Some musicians are very interested in analyzing this skill. Scatting is improvising using the vocal cords. You can also synchronize the guitar improvisation with the vocals, a skill introduced by my hero George Benson. I sometimes try scatting the harmony note of the note I am improvising on the guitar which is somewhat challenging to do spontaneously!
Q: What are your current projects?
A: I launched my third DVD recently at the Curve. The DVD is this year’s live concert and it comprises of the variety I talked about and some fun and entertainment songs as well. A good gift for a music lover! It’s available at Torana, Barefoot, Yamaha and Fasion Optic (Flower Road).
Q: Despite all your talents, you seem to lack national recognition. Why?
A: When I compose or perform, I do it because I enjoy, believe in the cause I am writing for and love to share my music with my fans, but never think of trophies, certificates or recognition. But if I may mention, a professor living in Canada who happens to be one of my fans and who has managed to watch a few of my concerts on his holiday in Sri Lanka has written to President to recognise my talents as a composer, for promoting the awareness on important social issues in Sri Lanka and for my contribution towards deserving charities. I was in shock when I recently received a copy of that letter in the mail. But I don’t think it is going anywhere!
Q: What are your future plans?
A: My seventh concert Rukshan Perera Live In Concert VII with original music will be staged on March 5 at Bishops Auditorium. I still need to complete my Jazz CD as well as a Christmas CD.
Q: What is jazz?
A: Basically, jazz allows a musician to spontaneously improvise and express a song with a solo on an instrument or voice. It can be just a basic variation of the melody to an ultra-difficult solo combining various scales and complicated rhythmic structures yet staying on the basic properties of the song. Today one can do a PhD in jazz theory and improvisation.
Q: What is your advice for up and coming musicians?
A: I have seen very talented youngsters. They sing well and play their instruments well. One thing we missed out when growing up in the 70s was not having music schools, teachers and other books or videos to learn from.
Today, there are good music schools, many teachers, many books and videos, and most importantly youtube where you can practically learn anything you want. Do a little research on the web in your instrument and make it as perfect as you can. Also, I hope more and more youngsters will get into doing originals instead of only performing cover songs.
We lack English originals big time in Sri Lanka and that should change instead of only following cover songs.
