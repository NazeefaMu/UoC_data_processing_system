Only 37 food sheet producers  SLSI certified - CEA

The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) recently highlighted that out of over 500 food wrapping sheets and bag manufacturers in the country only 37 manufacturers have obtained the Sri Lanka Standard Institution (SLSI) certificate to produce standard compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets.
According to the new law shopping bags are manufactured under the low density standard and both food wrapping sheets and bags which are environmentally friendly degrade in the environment after using 180 days.
Speaking to Daily News’ Business CEA, Director Ajith Weerasundara said that steps have already been taken to crack down food wrapping sheets and paper bags manufacturers who violate the law and were still manufacturing substandard products that were completely banned by the Government with effect from January 1 this year.
He said special CEA teams have been deployed to investigate manufacturers who defy the law and secretly go ahead with their usual productions in order to make profits without considering the future environment disasters.
He said the CEA authorized officials also visit traders, hoteliers, grocery shops, pharmacies and restaurants who defy the law even by keeping polythene wrapping papers and bags in their possession.
Director Weerasundara appreciated the assistance given by flying squads, attached to island-wide local Government institutions to raid area manufacturers who defy the ban.
“During the past few weeks authorized officers were able to raid over 100 manufacturing places and crack down 12 manufacturers who still defy the law and continuously engaged in the same old manufacturing process,” he said.
He once again reiterated that food wrapping sheets and bag manufacturers should obtain the authorized certificate from the Sri Lanka Standard Institution and thereafter get the registration from the Central Environment Authority to go ahead with their productions uninterruptedly.
When contacted, Plastic Packaging , Chairman Dr. Mervyn Dias said his company welcomed the Government’s decision and he has already obtained the CEA approval to manufacture food wrapping papers and bags to cater to both the local and overseas markets.
“Our company has already supplied about six million standard bags to super markets in the country,” adding that his company has manufactured only the UK approved EN 13432 standard compostable and biodegradable papers.
