Sri Lanka by 2025

The government’s vision is to make Sri Lanka a rich country by 2025. The government will do so by transforming Sri Lanka into the hub of the Indian Ocean, with a knowledge based, highly competitive, social market economy. The government will create an environment where all citizens have the opportunity to achieve higher incomes and better standards of living. To achieve this, the Government will create the conditions which will generate economic growth with equity.
Through a knowledge based highly competitive social market economy, Sri Lanka will become the hub of the Indian Ocean.
Our new approach to growth will be structured on a knowledge based highly competivive, social market economy model. The principles which underpin a social market economy are a well functioning and regulated market that will foster competition and efficiency, combined with high standards of social welfare and protection for the vulnerable. In addition, it will be a knowledge based economy, which will be driven by our intellectual capabilities. The result will be a highly competitive environment which is imperative for us to succeed in the modern integrated global economy.
The social market economy principles will foster and sustain successful institutions and policy, strong market structures, and a fairer society. The private sector will play a key role achieving high productivity, innovating enhancing quality, as well as investing and creating new jobs. The government will coordinate with the private sector to make the economy competitive and successful in the global environment. With market principles, economic competitive and successful in the global environment. With market principles, economic competitiveness and social benefit in mind, we will drive appropriate economic and social policies and strategies to ensure prosperity for present and future generations. In order to advance towards a diversified, high-value tradable sector growth process, alongside domestic private investment, we must attract the right type of FDI that brings in modern technology, access to GPNs and managerial know how.
The Government will strengthen the drivers of growth and make growth more inclusive. The Government is undertaking macro economic, factor market, institutional and regulatory reforms to enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the economy. These reforms are expected to raise private investment, especially knowledge intensive and technology driven FDI for export growth in both goods and services.
The Government will strive to create a strong and influential middle class towards an inclusive society. Mobility up the socioeconomic ladder allows people to achieve higher incomes and living standards. We will ensure that all people have more equitable access to public services, job opportunities, and living conditions.
We will introduce supportive legal reforms, in particular the new Inland Revenue Act, Foreign Exchange Act, Voluntary Disclosures of income, Act, State Land Bank Act, Anti Dumping Act, State Commercial Enterprises Act, Ports and Airports Act, Ruhunu Economic Development Corporation Act, Lands (Special Provisions) Act, Sustainable Development Act, Liability Management Act, and National Debt Office Act will considerably improve the business-friendly environment.
Strengthening the macroeconomic framework
The Government’s strategy to strengthen the national macro economic framework will have three prongs: fiscal consolidation, ensuring price stability and maintaining a market based competitive exchange rate.
Fiscal irresponsibility, budget deficits, and public debt are constraints consistency growth. Sri Lanka’s tax revenues, which declined steadily until 2015, are paltry in comparison to other middle-income economies. The result has been Government reliance on borrowings to finance the deficit which in turn has enlarged public debt to 79.3% of GDP, making Sri Lanka an outlier among its rating peers. Loss making SOEs impose a heavy burden on the Treasury and distort prices across the economy. The bunching of external debt repayments from 2018 requires strong fiscal consolidation measures for debt sustainability and growth.
We will use revenue based fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt in the medium term. The tax base will be broadened to ensure a tax revenue of 16% of GDP. We will rationalize the tax system by minimising exemptions, holidays and special rates, towards a fair and effective tax administration. We will strengthen administrative capacity to minimise evasion and improve tax compliance, bolster public finance management such as financial planning and discipline, and commitment controls. To increase tax progressivity and fairness, we will gradually change the ratio of direct to indirect taxation from the current 20:80 to 40:60 in the medium term, as the burden of indirect taxation falls heavily on the less affluent section of the population. We will generate more on tax revenue as a necessary condition for revenue enhancement.
We will rationalise government expenditure. The Government will strengthen the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act with mandatory binding targets for the fiscal deficit and overall government debt levels. Our medium term priorities are to rationalise public expenditure while eliminating unproductive expenditure. We will restructure SOEs to enable them to operate as commercially viable enterprises with accountability. Pricing of goods and services provided by SOEs will be at market clearing rates, and any form of subsidisation will be provided directly to the targeted population in a transparent manner. The Statements of Corporate Intent of the selected major SOEs provide a framework to pursue these objectives.
The Government will sustain fiscal consolidation to support the growth framework. We will implement fiscal reforms to achieve medium to long term targets for macroeconomic stability and an improved investor climate. However, the bunching of external debt repayments from 2018 requires tight budgetary control. Due to this lack of fiscal space, economic growth can no longer be driven by Government spending growth will instead require expansion of tradable activities, driven by private investment to service external debt.
We will initiate liability management strategies for domestic and foreign debt. We aim to progressively bring the debt to GDP ratio down to 70% by 2020. To this end, we have formulated a forward looking liability management strategy for domestic and foreign debt portfolios under the medium term debt management strategy (MTDS). This will address the high public debt stock while focusing on meeting Government’s cash flow needs using an appropriate composition of domestic and foreign debt instruments and maturities.
We will prioritise capital expenditure outlays for development with a comprehensive Public Investment Programme (PIP). After a fifteen-year lapse, the Government has published a detailed PIP for 2017-2020, which can be consulted by investors and other interested parties. The PIP lists over 1,000 ongoing, annual, matured, and future projects, only a limited number of which are included in this document. We will maintain public investment at 5-6% of GDP for the period 2016-2020. We will use this for economic infrastructure development, and for human resource development projects in education, health care, research and development (R&D), and vocational training, instead of buildings as has been the past practice.
The conduct of monetary and exchanges rate policies in the past during an era of fiscal excess dampened long term growth. Large debts necessitated monetary financing of deficits, resulting in uncontrolled inflation. Fiscal dominance over monetary policy prevented the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) from adopting policy adjustments when needed. Loose fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies aimed at boosting short term economic growth without introducing required structural adjustments resulted in sharp credit cycles and frequent balance of payment difficulties. Corrective measures adopted too late caused disruptive boom-bust cycles and lowered investor confidence.
The Government will take measures to ensure price stability. Our strategy to battle food price volatility and ease people’s hardships is two pronged. To address short term price fluctuations, we will encourage improved domestic supply and distribution networks, and allow imports of food products and essential commodities at reasonable costs within a competitive market framework. For medium to long-term price stability, the CBSL will move towards a flexible inflation targeting regime. They will present a comprehensive ‘Inflation Targeting Roadmap’ by the end of 2017, aimed at continuously maintaining low inflation while supporting economic activity and competitiveness. Price stability, which means low, stable and predictable levels of inflation, will keep nominal interest rates low and thereby support investment and long term economic growth. The Government will implement the legislative and operational changes necessary.
We will allow the exchange rate to be market determined. This will enable cost reflective pricing across all goods and services produced and traded in the economy, strengthening the competitiveness of Sri Lanka’s exports to global markets. Greater flexibility in exchange rate determination will help build international reserves and strengthen the resilience of the economy to external shocks.
Strengthening the growth framework
The Government will strengthen the growth framework by empowering the private sector. Accordingly, we incentivise domestic and foreign investment, revamp trade policy to enable an export driven economy, facilitate services expansion.
Shortcomings in investment facilitation and policy uncertainty are constraints to attracting investment. Private investment will be the key driver growth in Sri Lanka complimented by increased inflows of FDI. However, shortcomings in the investment climate have held back the expansion of large businesses, the growth of new business ventures, and the graduation of SMEs, especially micro enterprises. This has stunted private sector growth and reduced the competitiveness of the Sri Lankan economy. FDI inflows since 2009 have been notably low, averaging 1.1% of GDP, concentrated primarily on real estate and mixed development projects.
We will move Sri Lanka into the top 70 countries on Ease of Doing Business global rankings from its current ranking of 110 through legislative and regulatory changes. The Task Force for Investment Climate Reforms has identified the reforms needed to create an enabling business environment. One hurdle that investors currently face is a large number of Government agencies they have to deal with. We will establish a Single Window for new business registration that brings together 20+ Government agencies to streamline procedures and improve the investment climate.
We will clarify and reform investment incentive policies to improve investment policy predictability. We propose to phase out tax holidays, which have been the main traditional incentive offered to investors, and switch to other forms of efficiency improving incentives. The new investment framework will ensure policy coherence and consistency and streamline procedures to improve the overall business climate and attract FDI. We will stipulate a standardised package of incentives with clear eligibility criteria. Incentives while appropriately designed incentives will be offered for those in high technology and innovative industries. These incentives will be second to none in attracting the kind of investments that are appropriate for Sri Lanka at our current stage of development.
We will encourage Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). The Government will support PPS as a means of reducing reliance on loan agreements in the provision of public assets and services. We are formulating a clear PPP policy with a well defined legal, regulatory and institutional framework to attract private players with the requisite capacities. PPS currently focus on the provision of public amenities such as transport services, energy generation, drinking water, waste management, and industrial parks. Potential areas for expanding PPPs include health care, leisure, tourism, education, ports, and aviation. We will prioritise expanding opportunities for alternate financing, including securitisation, to support PPP programmes.
The Government will take steps to integrate SMEs into the formal sector. To boost domestic private investment, we will better integrate the SME sector into the formal sector through the financial system. We will establish hard and soft infrastructure frameworks to help them improve their brand value, and access credit and new markets. We will implement policies to increase project based lending rather than collateral based lending, remove taxes that prevent firms from expanding, and encourage knowledge sharing between R&D institution and SMEs.
The Anti-export bias in Sri Lanka’s trade policy has reduced the export share of GDP. Sri Lanka’s share of global exports reduced from 0.09% in 2000 to 0.06% in 2016, while its exports as a share of GDP declined from 33.3% in 2000 to 12.7% 2016. The export composition is stagnant and dependent on a few low complexity products. Export markets are undiversified with respect to markets and products. Para-tariffs have contributed to a highly complex, protectionist import regime, inhibiting Sri Lanka’s entry into GPNS.
We have formulated a new Trade Policy, along with an original National Export Strategy. These aim to create a more liberal, simple, transparent and predictable trade regime. These policy changes will attract more export oriented FDI, improve trade logistics, make customs procedures transparent and quicker, and boost firms’ abilities to compete in global markets.
