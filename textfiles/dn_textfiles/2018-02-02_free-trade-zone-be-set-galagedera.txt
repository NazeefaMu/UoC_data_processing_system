Free trade zone to be  set up in Galagedera

A free trade zone will be set up in Galagedera immediately after the construction of Central Expressway, said Leader of the House, Minister of Higher Education and Highways Lakshman Kiriella.
Addressing a rally held in Kandy, the Higher Education Minister said that the construction work of Central Expressway has progressed and people could reap the benefits in 2020 by reaching Colombo from Kandy within one hour using the highway.
The Minister further said that the mandate given by the people will be fulfilled.
There will be a remarkable development in upcountry when the highway is completed.
The land prices will go up. Foreign investors may invest for various development projects and youth will get job opportunities in those projects, the Minister said.
