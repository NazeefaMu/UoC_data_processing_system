FCID records Deputy Minister’s statement

The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) yesterday recorded a statement from Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara over a complaint he made in connection with an alleged corrupt deal behind the purchasing of two ships to the Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd. during the previous regime.
The Deputy Minister has lodged the complaint in July 2016. After giving the statement to the FCID, he told the media that an underhand deal running to USD 15-20 million has been revealed behind this purchase which occurred in 2014.
“This deal amounts to USD 70 million, but only USD 40-50 million had actually been spent on the purchase of two ships. A People’s Bank loan has been obtained to buy these ships and we have to pay USD 15,000 daily as the loan installment. The operation and maintenance cost of each ship is about USD 5,000 per day. However, if we hire out one of them we get only USD 5,000 per day,” he said.
“The loss the state incurs from each ship when they are in use amounts to Rs.2.5 million per day and this increases to Rs.3.5 million per day when they are not in use. The names of the persons and officials behind this deal will soon be revealed.
The FCID has made a lot of progress in its investigations with regard to this complaint,” he commented.
