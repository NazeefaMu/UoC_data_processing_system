Measures to control sugar content in sweetmeats

Rules and regulations will be introduced soon in order to control the sugar content in sweetmeats, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, discussions have already been held with biscuits and sweetmeat producers. A Cabinet paper will be presented to increase tax on food items with excessive sugar, salt and fat.
He was addressing the gathering during a health camp held at Malwana recently.
Dr. Senaratne pointed out that there will be pressure on him against increasing tax on food with excessive sugar, salt and fat, but he will not give into pressure.
The main objective of reducing the sugar, salt and fat levels in food is to control the rapidly increasing Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in the country.
The Traffic Light system has already been implemented to regulate the sugar level in soft drinks and bottled drinks. All soft drinks and other bottled drinks are now compelled indicate the sugar level in them, he added.
