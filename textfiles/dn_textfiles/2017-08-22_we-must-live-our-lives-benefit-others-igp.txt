We must live our lives for benefit of others: IGP

“We must live our lives for benefit of others and serve the country without adhering to petty personal agendas,” IGP Pujith Jayasundara said.
He was addressing the gathering on August 20 after opening the Bhahawan Sathya Sai Baba Hospital built at a cost of Rs.100 million on a 50-acre land in Batticaloa. He said someone from the majority community opening a hospital for the minority community was a golden example of racial integration, reconciliation and understanding.
“People live and die, but some live even after their deaths in hearts of others. We should serve the country without any racial, religious or political prejudice. We should all live and be grateful to be able to serve others,” he said.
SSP Batticaloa Saman Yaddawera, SP Batticaloa Keerthi Retna, Leela Ariyaratna, Manmunai Pattu Divisional Secretary N. Sathiyananthy, Batticaloa Traders Association President M. Selvaraja, atticaloa Tamil Sangam Puravalar Treasurer B.V. Ranjithamoorthy were present.
