Kaushal Wawlagala, Founder/CEO Global IT Park gave the opening remarks from Global IT Park. “When we started Global IT Park in 2016, I had only concepts and ideas to share with you. We were trying to create a blue ocean, an uncontested market space in Japan being the First Global IT Park where Japanese companies work collaboratively with foreign IT companies. But today after completing two years of our journey in Minami Uonuma, I have real stories to share with you. Those stories consist of the beautiful business partnerships that we built with you in Niigata,” Wawlagala said.
Samantha Wijesekera, Minister (Commercial), Embassy of Sri Lanka in Japan read out the message from Professor Dhammika Ganganath Dissanayake. “I am happy to know the progress of some the Sri Lankan companies operating under IT Park and their strides towards the Japanese partners. I believe Global IT Park can greatly harness the potential of Sri Lankan resources to answer Japanese needs”, highlighted in his message.
Katsuhiko Murayama, Director, Ministry of Economy Trade and Industries was the keynote speaker of the event. He highlighted the Japanese government’s new vision for connected industries to achieve society 5.0.
He further said that why it is essential for Japanese companies to collaborate with Global IT Park companies when expanding to foreign markets and how Global IT Park companies can support them by providing technology and global know-how for their Japanese counterparts.
Noguchi, President of Siance Co, Ltd, shared his experience about working with Global IT Park companies and the collaboration with Evolve Technologies Japan for using bi-lingual IT engineers from Sri Lanka. In the current model, Sri Lankan engineers work onsite with the Japanese engineers for about six months to learn the system and continue the project from Global IT Park. He expresses his desire to expand this collaboration in the future.
