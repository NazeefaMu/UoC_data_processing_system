The evening’s proceedings commenced with the singing of the Sri Lankan national anthem, followed by the Australian national anthem. The traditional oil lamp was lit by Australian Parliament Secretary to the Premier and New South Wales Multiculturalism and Disability Services Minister Scott Farlow, Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Australia Somasundaram Skandakumar, Foreign Affairs and Trade Department (DFAT) New South Wales State Office Director Rhonda Piggott and Diplomatic Corps Dean Jane Louise Connolly, representing the 16 Consuls General accredited to New South Wales and other invited high-profile dignitaries.
Religious blessings were performed by Australian Siamese Sect Malwatta Chapter Chief Prelate Ven. Pundit Meegahakumbure Dhammagavesi Thera, Rev. Father Chaminda Wanigasekera, Ubaidur Rahman Mahmood, and Kurukkal Arumugam Iyer.
Two minutes of silence were observed to commemorate all who sacrificed their lives while serving the nation. A message from the President was read by Consul (Commercial) M. M. Abdul Raheem. The consul general welcomed the invited guests who included New South Wales Parliament members, consuls general accredited to New South Wales, friends of Sri Lanka, and expatriate Sri Lankans.
Consul General Raheem expressed his praised Sri Lankan expatriate community, most of them consisting of professionals in wide and varied disciplines performing at high levels, apart from blending with the community at large, as expressed time and again by Australian government authorities. He also welcomed the spirit of reconciliation shown by the different ethnic groups of Sri Lankan origin in New South Wales and Queensland and urged them to move beyond by sharing their professional experiences and knowledge with their Sri Lankan counterparts.
High Commissioner Somasundaram Skandakumar in his address, agreed with Consul General Raheem and added that Sri Lanka has had many achievements as well as setbacks since independence, and it was time for all Sri Lankans to reach their true potential and the nation itself to move towards a highly-developed country. He said all should be treated equally, and with equal opportunity Sri Lanka would develop. Sri Lanka, gifted with many resources, is expected to grow, now that reconciliation and unity is at the forefront of governance.
Parliament Secretary to the Premier Scott Farlow said he has had great connections with expatriate Sri Lankans since his school days, and regarded them as intelligent people who have contributed towards the development of Australia. He congratulated Sri Lanka on reaching 70 years of independence and wished the people more strength and courage in their journey forward.
DFAT State Director Rhonda Piggott congratulated Sri Lanka on achieving this milestone and recounted people-to-people friendship and collaborations in the fields of commerce, agriculture, education, and border-protection amongst cultural and sporting ties to be the highlights of the two countries.
Keynote Speaker Dr. Siran Deraniyagala shared his knowledge in the field of archaeology and Sri Lankan pre-history through a detailed PowerPoint presentation.
