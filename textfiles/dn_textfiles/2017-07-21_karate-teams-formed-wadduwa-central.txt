Karate teams formed at Wadduwa Central

Karate teams have been formed at Wadduwa Central College by Master Shihan L P Edirisinghe, the visiting lecturer in Japanese Karate of Pasdunrata College of Education (Kalutara Teachers’ Training College) and the Kalutara District Representative of Karate Defence Methods (Japan).
This boys’ Karate team was formed by Master Shihan L P Edirisinghe at the request of the principal of Wadduwa Central College S D N Gunarathna who acceded to the request of parents of some students, to start Karate at school.
Master Edirisinghe started another girls’ team at the request of the principal after a short period of time and now Wadduwa Central College is blessed with nearly 56 Karate students who undergo training under the guidance of Master Edirisinghe.
A vast crowd of people and residents of Wadduwa flocked to the playground of Wadduwa Central to witness a special Karate Display and a demonstration performed by these Karate students, at the recently held sportsmeet of the same school. Parents and residents of Wadduwa are much thankful to the Principal of Wadduwa Central College who began Karate for the benefit of their children.
