Dambulla Temple needs urgent conservation: Akila

Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the government need not intervene unnecessarily with Dambulla Cave Temple but there is an urgent need to protect its frescoes, declared as a World Heritage by UNESCO.
The minister said the frescoes of the ancient Dambulla Temple are in a dilapidated condition, which needs urgent attention. He said so when he was questioned by a representation of youth Bhikkus at Temple Trees whether there is any truth that the government is planning to have control of temples.
The Minister said the condition of frescoes of Dambulla Temple cannot be accepted and there is an urgent need to restore it.
“At the same time, the temple receives a huge amount of money from foreign visitors. But there is no proper management. The money can be utilised for the development of thousands of less developed temples,” he said.
When asked whether the tills are sealed by the government, the minister said it is not a new practise as it is carried out by the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs since 1930. The money in tills are not utilised for any other activity other than utilising for the promotion of Buddhism.
“Dambulla Temple is at risk of being removed from the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites if the temple does not abide by UNESCO regulations and recommendations,” the minister added.
