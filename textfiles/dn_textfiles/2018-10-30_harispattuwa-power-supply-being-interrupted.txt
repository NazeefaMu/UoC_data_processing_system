Harispattuwa power supply being interrupted

The residents of Harispattuwa stated that they face inconvenience due to the constant interruption of electricity supply in the area.
Some residents said the electricity supply is extended to 84 Grama Niladhari divisions in Harispattuwa Pradeshiya Sabha area.
They said the residents’ failure to shear the trees by the roadside has contributed to the interruption of the power supply.
Residents added that although they have brought this matter to the notice of authorities, they have not taken measures to solve the issue so far.
They request the maintenance unit of the Ceylon Electricity Board to address this issue.
