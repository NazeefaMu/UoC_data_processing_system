CH go out favourites against CR today

A close battle for supremacy can be expected when CR & FC lock horns with giant killers CH and FC in their opening game of the 2018/19 Dialog ‘A’ Division inter club league rugby tournament today at CR grounds at Longden Place, kick off will be at 4.00 pm.
Going by the two teams CH has the edge hence will have a definite chance of coming on top over CR as they have a heavy set of forwards as well as a speedy three quarter line and this factor makes the event a thrilling tussle.
CH led by third row forward Yoshitha Rajapaksa also will have a definite advantage when it comes to the halves combination of former St.Anthony’s College Kandy sensational fly half Samuel Maduwantha and ex Wesley College scrum half Avishka Lee are very much faster than CR & FC halves combination.
The Maitland Crescent boys with the presence of a sturdy set of forwards who are capable of pulling the game in their favour will have to play a vital role in today's game and if their speedy three quarter line delivers the desired results today, then it will be a daunting task for the CR & FC outfit led by Kavindu Perera. But they will be countering their attack to pull off a much needed victory in the end.
Last year It was the CH and FC outfit which won both the first round as well as the second round games against CR & FC.
