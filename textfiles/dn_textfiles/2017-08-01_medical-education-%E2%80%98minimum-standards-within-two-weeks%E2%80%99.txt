Medical Education: ‘Minimum standards within two weeks’

“The minimum standards of the medical education will be gazetted within the next two weeks. The standards are now with the Legal Draftsman’s Department,” Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone for the Nurses Training School to be constructed in Galle at a cost of Rs. 555 million.
“Before commencing the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital, the relevant persons had checked the minimum standards of medical education with the SLMC, but then SLMC President had told them that such standards were not given. Then the culprit was the SLMC. But now some talk and shout about the quality of the medical education,” the minister said.
“Private medical education is globally spread and some Sri Lankan doctors were educated at foreign private medical colleges. Some are opposing private medical education. What they are having is a dialogue between idiots. The present Government is protecting free health and education,” the Minister said.
