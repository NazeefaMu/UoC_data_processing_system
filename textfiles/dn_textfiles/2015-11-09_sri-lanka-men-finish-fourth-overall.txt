Sri Lanka men finish fourth overall

Sri Lanka had to be content with fourth place in the Asian Rugby Sevens 2016 Rio Olympic Qualifiers when they were edged out 21-26 by South Korea at the Hong Kong International Stadium yesterday.
Sri Lanka gave off a superb fight back, with their dazzling runs and fierce tackling to score three tries all of which were converted, but could not match their much heavier opponents especially in the set pieces and the breakdowns and conceded three goals and a try. Korea thus clinched the important third place.
In the pool stages Tuskers beat Iran and Malaysia convincingly by 31-10 and 24-10 respectively but later in the day went down fighting to the host nation Hong Kong by 27 points to 12 , after holding on to a commanding 12-5 lead early in the second half.
In the final pool match played yesterday the Sri Lankan team shocked the entire crowd present at the grounds by defeating the formidable Philippine team 50-5. Sri Lanka gave a fabulous Fijian brand of rugby to thrash their opponents and enter the Cup championship semi-finals.
In the semis Sri Lanka did not have any clue to Asian giants Japan who thrashed them 43-nil.
For Sri Lanka ex-skipper Fazil Marija, Danushka Ranjan, Shenal Dias, Anurudda Wilwara, Gayan Weeraratne, Jason Dissanayka and Kanchana Ramanayaka played their hearts out in the tournament.
Japan kept their reputation as the number one team in Asia by coming from being 0-10 down beat Hong Kong 24-10 to bag the Cup Championship enabling them to go to the Rio Olympics in 2016. Meanwhile the Chinese men won the Plate Championship thrashing Malaysia 38-5.
Sri Lankan women’s rugby team gave an improved performance by securing sixth slot when they lost to Guam 21-5 in the fifth place playoff at Hong Kong Stadium. Incidentally in the pool stages Sri Lankan women thrashed Guam 22-7.
