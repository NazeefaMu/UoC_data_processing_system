How I became a Disciple of the Buddha
The Buddha in pictures

 
The life of Siddhartha Gautama, the person we call the Buddha, is shrouded in legend and myth. Although most historians believe there was such a person, we know very little about him. The standard biography appears to have evolved over time. It was largely completed by the Buddhacarita, an epic poem written by Asvaghosa in the second century CE. The following text is based on this poem translated and re-interpreted by Barbara O’Brien, a student of Zen Buddhism in New York, and on the stories, our guide Chap told us at Wat Phra That Doi Suthep in Chiang Mai.
Siddhartha Gautama’s Birth and Family
The future Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, was born in the 5th or 6th century BCE in Lumbini (in modern-day Nepal).
Siddhartha is a Sanskrit name meaning „one who has accomplished a goal and Gautama is a family name.
His father, King Suddhodana, was the leader of a large clan called the Shakya (or Sakya). It’s not clear from the earliest texts whether he was a hereditary king or more of a tribal chief. It is also possible that he was elected to this status.
Suddhodana married two sisters, Maya and Pajapati Gotami. They are said to be princesses of another clan, the Koliya from what is northern India today. Maya was the mother of Siddhartha and he was her only child, dying shortly after his birth. Prajapati, who later became the first Buddhist nun, raised Siddhartha as her own in the city of Kapilavastu.
By all accounts, Prince Siddhartha and his family were of the Kshatriya caste of warriors and nobles. Among Siddhartha’s more well-known relatives was his cousin Ananda, the son of his father’s brother. Ananda would later become the Buddha’s disciple and personal attendant.
He would have been considerably younger than Siddhartha, however, and they didn’t know each other as children.
At Wat Doi Suthep, the story of Buddha’s life started with a painting of the deity Shakra, riding on his holy elephant Airavata. In Buddhism, Shakra rules over the much sought Devas (which are Buddhist deities) realm of rebirth indicating that Siddhartha Gautama’s life is also just one of many lives, part of the reincarnation circle of Buddhist believes. Shakra becomes the guardian deity of Buddha both watching over him and paying homage to his teachings.
The Prophecy and a Young Marriage
When Prince Siddhartha was a few days old, a holy man prophesied over the Prince (by some accounts it was nine Brahmin holy men). It was foretold that the boy would be either a great military conqueror or a great spiritual teacher.
King Suddhodana preferred the first outcome and prepared his son accordingly.
He raised the boy in great luxury and shielded him from knowledge of religion and human suffering. At the age of 16, he was married to his cousin, Yasodhara, who was also 16. This was no doubt a marriage arranged by the families.
Yasodhara was the daughter of a Koliya chief and her mother was a sister to King Suddhodana. She was also a sister of Devadatta, who became a disciple of the Buddha and then, by some accounts, a dangerous rival.
The Four Passing Sights
The Prince reached the age of 29 with little experience of the world outside the walls of his opulent palaces. He was oblivious to the realities of sickness, old age, and death.
One day, overcome with curiosity, Prince Siddhartha asked his charioteer Channa to take him on a series of rides through the countryside. On these journeys he was shocked by the sight of an aged man, then a sick man, and then a corpse. The stark realities of old age, disease, and death seized and sickened the Prince. Finally, he saw a wandering ascetic. The charioteer explained that the ascetic was one who had renounced the world and sought release from the fear of death and suffering.
These life-changing encounters would become known in Buddhism as the Four Passing Sights.
Siddhartha’s Renunciation
For a time the Prince returned to palace life, but he took no pleasure in it. Even the news that his wife Yasodhara had given birth to a son did not please him. The child was called Rahula, which means fetter.
One night he wandered the palace alone. The luxuries that had once pleased him now seemed grotesque. Musicians and dancing girls had fallen asleep and were sprawled about, snoring and sputtering. Prince Siddhartha reflected on the old age, disease, and death that would overtake them all and turn their bodies to dust.
He realized then that he could no longer be content living the life of a prince. In Wat Doi Suthep this reflection and realization are depicted as Siddhartha’s first encounter with the demon Mara. In Buddhist cosmology, Mara is associated with death, rebirth and desire.
He is described as the personification of the forces antagonistic to enlightenment and thus tries to keep Siddhartha from being enlightened at all cost. Facing him alone at first, Mara is overcome by Siddhartha who is accompanied by his charioteer Channa, riding his horse Kanthaka.
That very night he left the palace and his hometown Kapilavastu, shaved his head at the river Anoma, and changed from his royal clothes into a beggar’s robe. Renouncing all the luxury he had known, he began his quest for enlightenment.
Riding Kanthaka, Channa returned Siddhartha’s accoutrements, weapons and hair to Suddhodanha upon his return to the palace. Following the departure of Siddhartha, Kanthaka died of a broken heart but was reborn as a Brahmin and went on to attend dharma talks by Gautama Buddha so that eventually the former horse of Buddha achieved enlightenment. The death is variously described as occurring either at the banks of the Anoma or upon returning to Kapilavastu.
