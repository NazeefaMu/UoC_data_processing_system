Govt. exploring potential of youth’s new invention

The government has paid attention towards the possibility of initialising a contraption invented by a youth from Ambakumbura, Doluwa, Gampola, for recycling solid waste in the country.
A team of intellectuals, including Moratuwa University Professors, led by Science and Technology Minister Susil Premajayantha yesterday visited the house of the inventor, Vikum Sampath Dimbulgastenna, and inspected the working of his new machine. Minster Premajayantha, who appreciated Vikum Sampath's invention, offered him a written undertaking to provide all necessary facilities to develop his machine for mass-scale use.
The minister said that his Ministry always welcomed new local inventions, and that he hoped to utilise Vikum Sampath's invention to solve the garbage problem in the country in the future.
The minster also directed the Engineering Research Institute to extend the necessary technological know-how and funding to Vikum Sampath to help him further develop his machine.
The minister was accompanied by Cosmy Institute Director General Prof. Ajith de Silva, New Inventions Commission Commissioner Dr. Mahesh Edirisuriya, and NERD Director General Senior Eng. Ananda Namal.
