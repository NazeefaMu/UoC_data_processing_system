Public may have access to Parliamentary Committees during PP Act amendments

The amendments to the Parliament Privileges Act will allow the public to access all Parliamentary Committees, Parliament Assistant General Secretary Tikiri Jayatilake yesterday said.
The public and media personals will have access to the Parliamentary Committees if the Committee Chairman gives consent, Jayatilake explained.
This is a revolutionary step taken, he said.
Meanwhile, Director (Legislative Services) on Standing Orders of Parliament Jagath Gajaweera Arachchige said the new standing orders have made two parties responsible on behalf of the Executive to respond to the recommendations made by the Parliamentary Committees.
Accordingly, the Finance Minister and the subject Minister of the probed State institute will have to produce their observations, conclusions, remedies on the reports submitted by the Parliamentary Committees.
Previously, there was no provision in law to make it compulsory for the Executive to respond to the recommendations of the committees, Gajaweera said.
Jayatilake and Gajaweera were speaking at an awareness programme for Parliamentary journalists organized by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy at Waters’ Edge, Battharamulla yesterday morning. Speaker Karu Jayasooriya, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe and COPA Chairman Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna addressed the gathering.
An open discussion was held following the speeches allowing the journalists to direct questions to the panel.
