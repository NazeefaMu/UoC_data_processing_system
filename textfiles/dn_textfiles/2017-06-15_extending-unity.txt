Extending unity

Having faced varied challenges related to natural disasters, Cabinet reshuffles and trade unions action from several quarters, the National Unity government is gearing itself to face yet another looming hurdle: the renewal of the accord between the United National Party (UNP) and the mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
The agreement between the two major political parties in the country, unparalleled in the country’s nearly seventy years of post-independence politics, came into being in the aftermath of the 2015 August general elections.
At this election, held seven months after President Maithripala Sirisena was elected to office in January that year, the UNP emerged as the single largest party, securing 106 seats. However this fell well short of the 113 seats required for a simple, working majority.
Prior to the election, the SLFP’s campaign was in disarray as nominees backing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were scrambling to get into the nomination lists of the various electoral districts, despite opposition from the Sirisena camp.
This culminated in President Sirisena going public with an unprecedented ‘address to the nation’ stating that even if the SLFP emerged as the single largest party after the poll, he would not be appointing Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.
Despite these reversals, the SLFP-led coalition emerged a decent second at the election, securing 95 seats. Crucially for the President, a majority of those elected from the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA), about 51 parliamentarians, were Rajapaksa loyalists. The third largest party was the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) with 16 seats while the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) secured six seats.
President’s role in government
Given this scenario, the UNP and its leadership, seven seats short of a working majority in Parliament, were weighing three options. It could function as a minority government and attempt to secure the support of the TNA (and indeed the JVP) for legislation it wished to introduce on a case by case basis.
This would not have appealed to the UNP because it had already spent eight months as a minority government from January to August and found that it was tough going, with no stability or authority, resulting in chaotic situations from time to time.
The second option which the UNP could have pursued was perhaps the most tempting. It could have easily invited about ten handpicked SLFPers to join the government, probably from among those loyal to President Sirisena. That would have ensured a working majority in Parliament and also strengthened the President’s role in government.
This was a tactic employed time and again with great finesse by Rajapaksa when he was President. Rajapaksa ‘poached’ selected politicians from the UNP almost at will by offering them Cabinet portfolios, strengthening his own numbers in Parliament and weakening the UNP at the same time.
For example, Gamini Lokuge, Keheliya Rambukwella and Johnston Fernando all began their political careers in the UNP and later joined the Rajapaksa Cabinet. There were several others such as Mahinda Samarasinghe, Dayasiri Jayasekera and Sarath Amunugama who did the same, but they have since shifted their loyalties once again- and are now in the Sirisena camp.
Constitutional changes
The UNP too would have been tempted to try this tactic. However, there was one difficulty with this option: while inviting a handful of SLFPers would secure a simple majority for the UNP, it would fall way short of the two-thirds majority it would need if it intended to pursue constitutional changes.
Indeed, constitutional changes, vis-à-vis changing the executive presidential system of government, reforming the electoral system and introducing amendments to redress ethnic grievances were all high on the UNP’s agenda. Hence it opted for a different arrangement instead- an alliance with the entire SLFP faction loyal to President Sirisena.
With 106 MPs of the UNP and about 44 MPs of the mainstream SLFP, such an alliance would be able to secure a two-thirds majority in Parliament. If such a government was formed, there was also the perception that President Sirisena could entice a few more SLFPers to his camp, if the circumstances warranted it. Thus, an agreement was reached between the UNP and the mainstream SLFP.
The agreement took the shape of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This MoU was signed on August 21, 2015. UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim and then SLFP Acting General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake signed the MoU at the Presidential Secretariat soon after the swearing in for Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The agreement was for a period of two years- with provision for extension if both parties agreed to do so. Both parties also agreed that during the period of this agreement, public representatives from both parties will not be permitted to cross over to another party.
It is this two year deadline that looms ahead in about two months. Although the relationship between the UNP and the SLFP has been fraught at times, many note that to see through the agreement for two years, given the polarities of the two parties, is by itself an achievement.
However there are rumblings of dissent- in both camps although the SLFP has been more vocal about it. Some SLFP ministers, notably the two Dissnayakes, S.B. and Duminda, have been openly proclaiming that President Sirisena would be the candidate of the SLFP at the next presidential elections.
This runs counter to the President’s pledge to abolish the Executive Presidency which underpinned his entire presidential election campaign. To be fair by the President, he has never endorsed these calls by his ministers- but then, nor has he aggressively denied them.
Other ministers- such as Nimal Siripala de Silva- frequently make public utterances to the effects that he is a minister in the government only because it is headed by a SLFPer and that he dreams of the day when a ‘purely SLFP government’ could be formed. Needless to say, these types of comments from senior SLFPers haven’t helped the relationship between the two parties.
Cabinet reshuffle
The UNP is annoyed that a Cabinet reshuffle was imposed on them at the behest of the SLFP. It managed to save face with a swap between the Finance and Foreign ministries but a SLFP minister, Dayasiri Jayasekera (who ironically is an ex-UNPer) is now rubbing salt into the UNP’s wounds, being critical of the allocation of the lotteries boards under the Foreign Minister.
It is a matter of disappointment that the primary objective of establishing a UNP-SLFP partnership- enacting constitutional amendments through the two-thirds majority that such a partnership delivers- has not seen the light of day.
Understandably, constitution making cannot be done overnight and a draft constitution is in the making but the government would do well to note that two years of its tenure are over and that enacting a new Constitution closer to the next general election (or presidential election, if there is one), could be a political nightmare.
The major question for the National Unity government in the coming weeks though is sustaining the UNP-mainstream SLFP alliance.
Clearly, both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe see no reason to change the status quo. If at all, they would want to introduce provisions to the MoU to minimise the intra-party sniping between loquacious ministers.
At this point in time, indications are that the MoU will indeed be renewed, probably for another two years. If not, the UNP would have to scour the Parliament for another ally, just as much as Prime Minister Theresa May is doing in Britain in the aftermath of their election.
That is extremely unlikely at this stage and the coming weeks will see an extension of the agreement, although there will be those opposed to this both in the UNP and the mainstream SLFP. They will be asked by the leaders of both parties to hold their horses- at least for the foreseeable future.
