Report on impact of potential ban  of chrysotile fibre in SL launched

The Chrysotile Information Centre of Sri Lanka held a seminar recently in Colombo to launch a publication on the‘Socio Economic Impact of the Potential Prohibition of Chrysotile in Sri Lanka’. The publication was based on a comprehensive research-driven study carried out by its Research Intelligence Unit (RIU).
RIU Director Roshan Madawala said, “Today’s report adds a fundamental enhancement on our knowledge about the safe use of chrysotile in Sri Lanka. Our study shows that an attempt to ban the fibre will have severe macroeconomic consequences, and at the individual level be felt most urgently by low-income and other rural communities at risk who rely on chrysotile fibre-based roofing.”
The programme consisted of a presentation followed by a panel discussion by experts who spoke on the potentially grave impacts of a ban of chrysotile fibre cement roofing products on Sri Lanka’s economy. Several dignitaries including Minister Susil Premajayantha, Minister Eran Wickramarathne and others graced the occasion.
The Director of the Chrysotile Information Centre and co-sponsor of the study, Sunil Amawarwansa said: “It’s essential to note that chrysotile has been used safely in Sri Lanka for more than 50 years – proving that safe use is a reality. This stands in distinction to other forms of asbestos.”
The facts show that the ban of chrysotile would cause economic losses, especially to the Government, with an estimated Rs. 1.653 trillion (US$ 11.25 billion) of unnecessary increase in economic burden on households in the entire country derived from removal, transportation and disposal of the existing chrysotile roofing.
Almost two million houses and buildings with chrysotile roofing materials need to be removed and pay for higher costs of substitute products, if chrysotile were to be banned.
The research report further explains that the impact on different groups of consumers include households, the business sector and the government sector as represented solely by the impact on the hospitals and schools. Over 43,000 hospital beds and 2,368 schools have been using chrysotile roofs. Thereby more than millions of people and children across the island will be affected by the potential ban.
Social effects were mostly connected to unemployment, leading to job reduction of up to 4,500 – in a short time. Unfortunately, closure of plants will further increase unemployment up to 250,000. The loss of income to direct and indirect employees in the industry will be US$122 million per year.
Clay tiles are in the frontline amongst alternatives proposed to substitute chrysotile roofing. However, the biggest drawback is the inability to increase production of clay tiles, as it requires increasing excavation of earth substantially. This would cause serious negative impacts on the environment such as landslides.
A case in point is the impact that a potential ban on chrysotile fibre imports may have on Sri Lanka's trade relations with Russia, the world’s biggest supplier of chrysotile fibre. The imports are currently valued at over US$ 426 million with the balance of trade in Sri Lanka's favour.
Since 1955, Sri Lanka has used locally produced chrysotile roofing material for home and commercial use. No specific studies, conducted internationally or locally so far, have shown disease being caused by chrysotile.
Roshan Madawela, CEO of RIU hands over the report titled 'Socio Economic Impact of the Potential Prohibition of Chrysotile in Sri Lanka' to MInister of Science, Technology and Research Susil Premajayantha. Sunil Amarawansa, Director of Chrysotile Information Centre is also present
This research study has shown that chrysotile fibre cement is a preferred choice of roofing material especially amongst Sri Lanka’s low and mid-income populations.
A potential ban on chrysotile poses adverse impacts on the national economy, even affecting householders’ affordability and quality of living conditions.
Therefore, through the release and dissemination of ‘Socio-Economic Impact of the Potential Prohibition of Chrysotile in Sri Lanka’ report, the Chrysotile Information Centre aims to provide invaluable references and guidance to key decisionmakers, authorities and stakeholders towards making favourable decisions to support the country’s economy, while maintaining conducive environment for international trade relations.
Asbestos is a commercial term, referring to two families of different, but naturally occurring fibre silicates, which are characterised by extraordinary heat resistance and strength. The generic term 'asbestos is an often mistaken as a single form of the mineral – when in fact the differences in form could not be more important. The form of asbestos that is associated most closely with human health problems is the amphibole form, and it includes blue asbestos (crocidolite) and brown asbestos (amosite). This form is banned around the world is not used in Sri Lanka.
The other form – serpentine or chrysotile – is in use in Sri Lanka today and is used by the majority of countries around the world, including the USA, Brazil, China, Canada, Russia, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and many others. Chrysotile fibre products do not cause any significant health issues.
