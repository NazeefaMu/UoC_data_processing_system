Prayer for no more prey

On April 27, a young girl who ventured out for a swim in the picturesque Bulannatuwa Lake in Galnewa was tragically killed by a crocodile. Villagers in the area allege that there are around 20 crocodiles in this lake.
The crocodile had killed one of their own. Thirteen-year-old S. M. Gimhani Anushika was a resident of No 246, Dorahatha, Lolugaswewa and had been studying in the seventh grade at the Galnewa school. She was the only girl in her family.

She had ventured out to the lake around 6.30 pm on April 27, along with her mother, uncle and two other cousins when she was attacked and killed by a crocodile. This attack has caused fear and panic among the villagers living around the tank and surrounding villagers and they have pressured the authorities to take quick action in dealing with the crocodiles.
Lake full of crocodiles
Bulannatuwa Lake is a large water body which belongs to the Galnewa Divisional Secretariat Division and No. 469 Grama Niladhari division. When the Daily News investigated into the incident, villagers informed us that they had witnessed around 20 crocodiles in the lake and the crocodile which killed the young girl was around 12 ft long and 3 feet wide.
After the attack, the villagers who had attempted to retrace the origins of the crocodile had found a burrow suspected to be its home. They have thereafter, dug it out to find four baby crocodiles inside.
Water bodies are of paramount importance in the dry zone and Bulannatuwa Lake supplies much of the water to surrounding villagers. With the death of Gimhani, the number of people coming to the lake to collect water has considerably reduced.

The villagers also complain that these crocodiles were in the habit of hunting dogs in the area and that in the recent past, two dogs and two calves had become prey to the crocodiles.
The presence of crocodiles in the lake, however, is not new information to the villagers. They have been there for the past 15 years in the lake and despite their presence it was common for villagers to bathe in the lake. This, however, was the first time that a crocodile attacked a human.
Take them out or build a fence
“It was my brother’s daughter who fell prey to the crocodile in such a tragic manner. With that incident, many of us are in fear of making use of this lake. This is the first time that a child was eaten by a crocodile in this area and the surrounding areas. As long as these crocodiles exist in this lake, there is a danger of such incidents repeating. So we ask the authorities to either remove these crocodiles from here or make our bathing places secure in some way,” said P. Shyamali Premalatha, a resident of Lolugaswewa.
“I have used this lake for the past 30 years. We did not have so many crocodiles in it before. But in the last 10 years, we have seen an increase in the number of crocodiles in this lake.
As far as we know, there are around 20 crocodiles in this lake. Since the death of the young girl, no one has ventured out to bathe in the lake. It is quite common to find soap foams along the vents in the lake as there are so many people bathing, but now, only leaves and rotten branches fill these vents.

There is much fear among the people to return. So we ask that the authorities construct a protection fence around our bathing areas so we can continue to use it,” explained Jayantha Somathilake, another resident from Lolugaswewa.
The Secretary of the 304/T2/T26 Dathusena Farmer Association, D.M. Asanka Pradeep was of the opinion that the crocodiles had started attacking humans having acquired the taste after hunting dogs and calves in the area.
“As the Farmer Organization, we have informed the Mahaweli Authority to find a suitable solution to this problem. We ask that they find a solution before another human life is sacrificed to these crocodiles,” said Pradeep.
Authorities in a quandary
The incident on April 27 has also triggered the Civil Defence Force in the area to action.
“After the incident which occurred a week ago, we have taken several measures to find ways in which we can protect the villagers from crocodiles.
It is not only this lake which has so many crocodiles. We have found that the lakes Siymbalewa, Kataragama, Nelumpathgama, Lolugaswewa and Kalankuttiya too, have similar issues. Crocodile numbers have progressively increased in these lakes over the years,” said Galnewa Civil Defence Committee Chairman H. M. Lionel Jayasinghe.
“We have got together with the Divisional Secretariat and devised a programme to find out what we can do to deal with this issue. As we too are villagers living here, we hope to take steps to protect the bathing areas in the lake.
I would like to request the authorities to take long term measures to either remove the crocodiles from this lake or find a way to protect the people who come to bathe here,” he explained.
Meegalewa Wildlife Office, however, estimated a lesser number of crocodiles in the lake. They said that they had not taken a decision on the crocodiles yet.
“We estimate around 10-15 adult crocodiles to be in this lake. But we have not decided whether we are to remove them or not.
We cannot say how these numbers came to increase significantly and nor do we understand how they came to be in these lakes.
They usually follow the waterways looking for food and settle in areas they find most suitable. However, we do know that there have been crocodiles in this lake for the last 10-15 years,” said the Wildlife head at Meegalawewa, Nimal Bandara.
He added that they would discuss matters with the villagers and arrive at a suitable compromise.
Galnewa Divisional Secretary E. M. Swarna Edirisinghe speaking to the Daily News admitted that there was fear and panic spreading in the area over the crocodiles and that they were responsible with regard to managing the situation.
“Villagers in the Kalankuttiya area, adjacent to Bulannatuwa Lake also complain that they have seen various species of crocodiles after the attack on the young girl.
We will discuss the issue with all stakeholders and decide whether we are to remove the crocodiles from the area or not.
The task of dealing with the crocodiles, however, is the job of the wildlife authorities and we hope to get them involved in our meetings.
We will also see to a fence or safety structure we can build around the bathing areas so the villagers are protected,” said Edirisinghe.
Galnewa Police OIC M.M.R.C. Munasinghe meanwhile said they would do their best to protect the people, but there was little they could do to deal with this unusual threat.
“We cannot get involved in the decision to remove the crocodiles or not,” said the OIC.
