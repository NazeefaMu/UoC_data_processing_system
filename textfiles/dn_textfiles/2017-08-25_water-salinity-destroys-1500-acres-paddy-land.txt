Water with salinity destroys 1,500 acres paddy land

One thousand five hundred acres of paddy fields at Godawayain Ambalantota DS area are being destroyed as a result of water with salinity flowing into these paddy fields due to sand dunes blocking the Walawe river mouth. The villagers remove the sand dunes that heap up once a month.
The Secretary Godawaya Farmers Association S.A. Dharmapala said the paddy fields at Kiralakele Manajjawa Walawe and Godawaya are being destroyed as a result. He said that there was a person called Modera Arachchi during the British era who was responsible for the removal of sand dunes and that there is none at the moment.
