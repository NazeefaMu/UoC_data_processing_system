Dengue infects 10 doctors at Negombo General Hospital

Reports indicate that about 10 doctors attached to the General Hospital, Negombo were diagnosed with dengue fever but the Hospital Director yesterday refused to confirm the number.
“I am aware that some of the doctors were diagnosed with dengue but I do not know the exact number and how they got the disease,” Director Dr Nilanthi Pathirana said.
The hospital is struggling to cope with the dengue crisis as a serious shortage of staff, beds and equipment continues to hinder their ability to deal with the lengthening queues of patients.
Dr. Pathirana said around 600 dengue patients were admitted to the hospital but the hospital has only 369 beds. She said the hospital was in need of more beds and staff to control the increasing number of dengue patients at the hospital.
“I don’t know when this is going to end because the number keeps on increasing. Around 150 dengue patients are admitted everyday,” she said.
She said several screening centres were set up at the hospital and anyone who suffers from fever can come and check. Pathirana said dengue patients are admitted only if their platelets were very low. If number are not too low, they will be given necessary instructions and sent home, the Director said.
