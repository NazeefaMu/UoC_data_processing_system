COPE summons RDA over Expressways

The Road Development Authority (RDA) has been summoned before the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) on September 19 to examine the projects related to Expressways.
JVP MP and COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti told the Daily News yesterday that the Committee decided to summon the RDA management as several issues with regard to construction of expressways have surfaced recently.
The JVP in a press conference late last month raised allegations of misappropriation of funds and bribery when constructing the Expressways.
The COPE Chairman said the Sri Lankan Air management was re-summoned before the Committee on September 20. The COPE questioned the Sri Lankan Air authorities even last week. Handunnetti said the investigations on Sri Lankan Air are mainly on the controversial order of eight A350 air buses.
“The COPE has directed its attention these days to study the history of this deal. The Government had to pay a large sum as compensation to cancel the orders for those aircraft and thereby incurred a huge loss. The COPE wants study the agreements in detail and find out who is responsible for taking the decisions,” he said.
