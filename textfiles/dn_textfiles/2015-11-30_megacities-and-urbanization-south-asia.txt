Megacities and urbanization in South Asia

This essay is prepared on behalf of the General Research Committee (GRC) of Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science (SLAAS) based on an Address delivered on October 15 organized by National Academy of Sciences Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Economic Association and the Institute of Town Planners Sri Lanka.
The last quarter of the Twentieth Century brought into prominence three important global realities. The first was about the severity and worsening state of the earth's bio-physical environment. The second concerned a process which is now generally referred to as “globalization”. The third reality had to do with the rapidity of urbanization currently taking place with particular intensity in the Third World Countries (TWCs). Thus it has come about that current and future development work in these countries should take cognizance of these realities. Most of the TWCs have little control over the first two realities.
The scale and pace of current urbanization is recognized as being unprecedented in human history. Urbanization and its consequences are most prominently manifest today in the TWCs. The Global Network of Science Academies recently placed population growth coupled with unplanned urbanization among the ten most serious global concerns. That important apex body of worldwide scientific institutions identified the necessity to develop and implement urban planning policies that internalize consumption needs and demographic trends to reap the benefits of sustainable urban living (IAP, 2012).

The gravity of urbanization and its impact on human habitat in the Third World had been anticipated even in the 1960s by a few eminent scholars and a landmark book was published on the subject (Abrams, 1964). On a call from a South Asian Prime Minister (Premadasa, 1980), the UN declared 1986 as the ‘Year of Shelter’ and then went further to launch a global campaign under the slogan ‘Shelter for all by the year 2000'. A UN agency subsequently predicted that during the period 1990-2020 the bulk of the world's population will be urbanized; that Asian cities alone will contain more than half that population; and this will mean that 1.5 billion people will be added to the urban centers of Asia (ESCAP, 1993). Despite considerable efforts to confront the adversities of urbanization, the TWCs have seen no breakthroughs.
This paper is based on a review of the planning literature covering the origins, growth and development of those concepts and theories which have already had, or could have influence in dealing with urbanization in the Third World. Its main purpose is to discuss the need to anticipate rapid urbanization and holistically deal with the attendant problems that are likely to be caused in the country of prime concern here, namely, that of Sri Lanka.
The nature of the problem
The rapid growth of urban populations in the TWCs is the result of natural increase and also, importantly, rural migrations to cities. These migrations are a consequence of extreme rural poverty coupled with the very poor access that most of these rural folk have to basic needs and social infrastructure in most TWCs. The entire urbanization process is seen by some scholars as one that helps the emancipation of under-privileged rural migrants and also supports economic growth through the provision of labour for industrial production.

The migratory targets of urbanization in these countries are usually those larger urban areas all of which already are, or likely to become ‘megacities'. The fact however is that rural migrants also face serious problems even in their eventual urban destinations. These include the inadequacy of shelter and access to basic services and appropriate employment opportunities. They, by their increasingly large urban presence cause severe and unabated stresses on the limited infrastructure facilities available to other city dwellers. Consequent to this type of urbanization, substantial and seemingly insoluble problems must be anticipated within these cities, if not already present in considerable measure.
Many planners grappling with urbanization issues in the TWCs do not confront the subject directly and in its entirety. They focus their attention only on its resultant urban impacts which are within the affected cities themselves. Some of the typical theoretical writings which support such limited actions tend to lay stress upon the urgent need for “radical planning” to support participation by often large, disenfranchised segments of urban and urbanizing populations. This focus was seen, for example, in the discussions: on squatter settlements in Latin America (Turner and Fichter, 1972); more recently on anti-eviction campaigns within the Western Cape in South Africa (Miraftab, 2009); and, still more recently on the “stubborn realities” of informal settlements in the global south (Watson, 2012). Even when dealing directly with urbanization, reliance is invariably placed on intra-urban interventions through the various professional disciplines concerned with urban planning. The solutions are consequently and inevitably based upon guiding the expansion of impacted cities in one way or other, often involving the planning and building of satellite towns in the vicinity of those cities. The predominant intellectual material which underpins the attempts to manage urbanization in this particular manner originated in the West a century ago.

Rural out-migration impacts not only upon cities that receive the migrants but also upon the rural hinterlands they left behind. It does so quite adversely in that agriculture is increasingly deprived of manpower and thus subject to continuing neglect. There are also studies which strive to predict the consequences of horizontal urban expansions due to rapid urbanization and their likely spatial impact on rural land.
The main prediction in one such recent study which was based on the assumption of continuing current trends, suggests the tripling of urban land cover worldwide within the next three decades with a notably adverse impact upon biodiversity (Seto et al, 2012). That study also indicated that the main biodiversity ‘hotspots’ likely to be affected by these trends are in the Third World with many being in South Asia.
Urbanization and South Asia
There were 23 very large cities worldwide in 2011, each with more than 10 million people. Asia had 12 with South Asia alone having 5 of these ‘megacities'. Three of them were in India, one in Pakistan and one in Bangladesh. The South Asian total is predicted to increase from 5 to 8 megacities by 2025 (UN, 2012). The urban populations and urbanization rates may be gleaned from Table presented above.
Shanties in Sri Lanka, Colombo
According to these estimates, Sri Lanka and Nepal have low proportions of urban populations, these being respectively 15.1% and 16.2%, as compared to 31.3% in India. The Real GDP Growth in 2012 of Sri Lanka was relatively high, estimated at 6.4%, while in Nepal it was estimated at a relatively low figure of 4.6% (World Bank, 2012). Urbanization, though not an immediately pressing problem within Sri Lanka, could indeed become so in the near future.
Indigenous South Asian coverage of urbanization in its demographic aspects and urban socio-economic impacts is extensive and very competent. These studies reveal that the larger urban areas receive far more rural migrants, with the largest cities gaining the bulk. The South Asian megacities experience immense difficulties. Many scholars are seriously concerned that the often illiterate and unskilled rural families who gravitate to large cities to escape rural poverty, eventually become trapped in squalid and insanitary urban environments of deprivation, malnutrition and endemic disease; that their sheer numbers cause un-relievable stresses on scarce urban infrastructure and services; and, that those cities cannot generate employment opportunities to sustain the massive and continuing influx of migrants. Thus, these megacities with their inevitable slums are becoming increasingly unmanageable and unsustainable.
Urbanization and Sri Lanka
With low urbanization, most scholars in Sri Lanka have hitherto not seen the subject as worthy of much attention in our context. Consequently, there are some important misconceptions found in the media, both favorable and unfavorable to urbanization. It seems necessary therefore to clarify at least one important misconception. It concerns the relationship between urbanization and economic growth. Although high growth in per capita GDP is associated with high urbanization in many TWCs, it is incorrect to assume a very direct causal relationship between them. For, it is far more likely that the comparatively high levels of poverty and inadequate access to social infrastructure facilities, prevalent realities in the rural sectors of most TWCs, are perhaps the real causes of rural-urban migration. Urbanization needs to be seen as the result of sharp differentials in living standards, income levels and the availability of opportunities for the youth that often exist between the rural and urban sectors. The mistaken view that urbanization can become a driver of growth has to be clarified and contradicted. The blinkered pursuit of economic growth by increasing GDP per capita without at least an equal concern for inclusive growth, equity and distributive social justice, may be seen as the main driver of high urbanization.
Urbanization and Colombo
The statistics indicate that in most TWCs urbanization is directed mainly to the larger urban centres. In each of the smaller TWCs, only one city, usually the capital, is impacted by urbanization. Historically, it is Colombo that has grown by urbanization although for many decades that growth has been slow. Nevertheless, Colombo already has its share of slums. With the military victory over the separatist terrorists in mid-2009 which brought to an end the 30-year war, the circumstances may have begun to change. The recent investments in Colombo's infrastructure, the beautification of the city and recent ongoing concerns to prepare and implement a comprehensive plan for the city are indeed welcome. These and the proposal to make a massive investment on a plan to extend the central business district of Colombo into the sea will, if successfully implemented bring about higher economic growth. However, these efforts may very well cause the city of Colombo to be impacted by urbanization on a scale hitherto unknown.
It would be appropriate at this point to quote an extract from my article entitled “Our Urban Future” published in the centre page of the Daily News newspaper on the first day of the new millennium (15 years ago). The quotation anticipates the possibility of rapid urbanization in our country, and runs as follows:
“…We in Sri Lanka have been insulated from the problem. For this we must thank the wisdom of our political leadership of the 1930s. The impetus they gave to domestic food production, dry zone colonization and rural development have helped us immensely. However, our unique situation in relation to Asian urbanization is predicted… (here)… to change very soon for many reasons…We now have to awaken from the dream of a predominantly rural Sri Lanka continuing into the future.
“The spatial impact of globalization on Sri Lanka needs also to be anticipated. Transnational corporations and other foreign enterprises that we want desperately to invest here will mostly opt to locate in and around Colombo, for many reasons. Thus an agglomeration in this region of businesses and industries may be expected on an unprecedented scale in the near future, regardless of our personal likes and dislikes. Rural migrations to Colombo will inadvertently but definitely be encountered…the full impact of urbanization will have to be taken by Colombo...The end to the on-going war, which we all seek, will seriously aggravate the problem…
“Without timely and concerted efforts based on a comprehensive plan, the past growth of Colombo has consistently outstripped all the sectoral and ad hoc attempts to upgrade its physical infrastructure. Needless to say, the first four of the five plans prepared for Colombo with the best of intentions over the past Century, but not implemented, have become obsolete. This has happened with urban growth mainly by natural increase in population. Compounded by migration estimated even at optimistically low rates, the future scenario for the unplanned growth of Colombo is indeed gloomy. The steady spread of shanties over vacant private and public land including reservations, parks and playgrounds; low density suburban sprawl and the filling of eco-sensitive low-lying land and the denudation of upland tree cover in the urban periphery; water shortages, sewer system failures, frequent floods and epidemics; worsening traffic jams; increased pollution of the air and water bodies; mounds and fields of rotting garbage; and increasing lawlessness and crimes both petty and violent are likely to be common features in the urban life of Colombo, as they are in some other Third World cities. If this ugly vision is not to become a reality we shall have to act wisely and fast.”
The theories
The study being presented here is based upon an earlier review of planning literature about the origins and development of the concepts and theories which have influenced or are relevant to urbanization in the TWCs (Gunaratna, 2014). It will not be within the scope of this article to discuss in detail these theories except to briefly mention those that are irrelevant to us and those that are more relevant.
That review revealed that there are basically two very different sets of theories: a set of utopian concepts from the late 19thcentury Britain and early 20thcentury Continental Europe which forms the base of most current planning approaches adopted in South Asia; and,a set of more scientifically rigorous theories some of which could underlie a far more relevant approach to the problems of urbanization in the TWCs. The latter theories, also of Western origin, are an integral part of the sub-discipline generally known as Spatial Economics.
The Utopian concepts
The particular solutions based on utopian concepts are intended to guide the expansion of impacted cities. The intellectual underpinnings are British from a century ago. The resulting models are still being used to deal with urbanization in the South Asian region. There is an obvious question of their relevance. The scale of current urbanization in the Indian sub-continent is of a different order of magnitude from its manifestation in Britain where the popular utopian concept was first envisioned. This is clear when one notes that the total urban population of England and Wales in 1901 was 25.1 million (Hicks and Allen, 1999). The current urban population of India grows by double that figure every five years.
A serious researcher discussing the development of Navi Mumbai (“New Bombay” )which is the latest of Mumbai's satellite towns, observed that:
“In the 1960s and 1970s, Asian urban development policies centered on slowing down the rate of urbanization…. Satellite towns and greenbelts have been among the most widely adopted means to achieve this. However,…(they) have proved to be ineffectual…The development of New Bombay is a reflection of many of the problems that have beset satellite-town building in Asia.” (Shaw, 1995)
