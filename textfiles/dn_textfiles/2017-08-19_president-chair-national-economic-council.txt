The proposed National Economic Council will be chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena. The Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Secretary to the President, Secretary to the Prime Minister, Secretary to the Treasury and the Central Bank Governor will be the other members, Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama said.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters on Thursday.
According to the minister, the council will seek the advice and services of experts in the field of finance and economics.
A Gazette notification with regard to the council will be issued soon, he said.
The council will be the apex body dealing with policy issues. There will be no misunderstandings or conflicts regarding policies of the government, he said.
He said the government decided to set up the National Economic Council to implement and speed up the economic activities of the government.
Minister Amunugama said the decision to set up the National Economic Council was made at the last Cabinet meeting.
"We have come halfway in our term of office. We are confident that we will go until 2020. We have to implement many initiatives within the next half of the government," he said.
The minister said the government is a coalition of two parties. This is a first time experience on this scale. Political parties have their own approaches. It is necessary to discuss issues and have a win-win situation, he said.
"One unfortunate aspect we have seen is that Cabinet Ministers, other ministers and party officials express their views and versions which are not in keeping with basic principles of Cabinet responsibility," he said.
"Ministers can have different views and arguments within Cabinet Meetings. But once the decision is made, all participants should respect the decision, he said.
