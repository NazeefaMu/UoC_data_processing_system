‘Ex-Finance Minister’s issue pales beside JO members’ king size robberies’

Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake’s issue is insignificant compared to the king size robberies by Joint Opposition members, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said the leaders in the Joint opposition are king size robbers who point their fingers at Minister Ravi Karunanayake. Minister Senaratne made these observations at a ceremony at Mannar Silawathura district hospital yesterday.
The minister said there are many charges against the leaders of the Joint Opposition. Corruption, malpractices and murders are among them. The people should know the amounts of funds in Dubai bank accounts belonging to the leaders of the Joint Opposition.
One secretary has US$ 1,800 billion, while another Parliamentarian has US$ 500 billion, the minister said.
