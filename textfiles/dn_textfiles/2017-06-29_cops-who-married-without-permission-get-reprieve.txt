Cops who married without permission get reprieve

A policy decision has been taken to reinstate 146 new police recruits who were discontinued from service for marrying without permission during their apprenticeship.
They have been recruited during the period from 18-5-2009 to 31-12-2016 police headquarters said in a press release yesterday.
They will be reinstated on condition that they send an affidavit expressing willingness to abide by several conditions set out, Police Media and Public Relations Director, SP Ruwan Gunasekera said.
The conditions include willingness to be reinstated as a new recruit, attend a capacity building course, obtain a background report on the period out of service and attend a medical examination.
