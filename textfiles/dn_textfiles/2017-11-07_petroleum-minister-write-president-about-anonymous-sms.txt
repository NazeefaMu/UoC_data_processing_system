Petroleum Minister to write to President about anonymous SMS

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said he would write to the President about the SMS that triggered the public which resulted in panic buying of fuel and an inquiry will be immediately initiated once the fuel issue is resolved.
The Minister said a SMS by an anonymous source triggered created panic amongst the public which led to panic buying of fuel for three consecutive days.
"This created a surge in demand at fuel stations that resulted in the rapid depletion of stocks at these stations,"he said.
Minister further said that there have been no plans to either increase or decrease the fuel prices.
