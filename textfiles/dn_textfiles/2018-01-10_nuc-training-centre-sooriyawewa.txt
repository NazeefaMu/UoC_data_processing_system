NUC training centre at Sooriyawewa

A new National Youth Corps (NUC) training centre will be set up very soon at Sooriyawewa at a cost of Rs. 1.6 million as a part of Yahapalana government’s vision for an empowered and independent youth, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa yesterday said.
Minister Premadasa was speaking at a ceremony held to form the United National Party Yowun Balamandalaya of Hambantota, Sooriyawewa yesterday.
Minister Premadasa pointed out that the government will grant a Rs. 3,000 monthly allowance for each student in the six-month training courses at the training centre. The centre set up at Weniwel-Ara in Sooriyawewa will offer leadership, English and Tamil languages and IT courses.
The students will be granted a Rs. 10,000 monthly allowance to continue with their higher education at the training centre, Minister Premadasa said.
“The Yahapalana government provide these facilities for the youths to empower them and make them independent. The allowances will lessen the burden upon parents to fund their children’s higher education. The government is dedicated to make a better tomorrow for the country’s youth,” Minister Premadasa said.
Minister Premadasa said the youth candidates entering into politics in the Local Government elections would not be victims of propaganda, alcohol and drugs.
“We will always allow you to voice your concerns and demands. We will give youth the power to discuss and make decisions on the issues relevant to their electorates. We are planning to establish a Board of Youth Councils in our Pradeshiya Sabhas. The councils will discuss and add to the development plan of each Sabha. If we are to establish a government ruled by the grass roots, youth must participate in the effort.” Minister Premadasa said.
