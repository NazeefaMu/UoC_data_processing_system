Next three years will be development era: Prime Minister

“The groundwork is now being laid to transform next three years into an era of development,” Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a meeting held at the Kaduwela Divisional Secretariat on September 1 to mark the distribution of certificates to 3,000 women who had completed a sewing training course and the distribution of sewing machines to 80 of them. The programme was organised by International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe.
The Prime Minister said investors would set up industrial zones in Horana, Kaluatra and Avissawella to open garment industries.
He said 100 acres were allocated in Horana for the purpose and the area would be increased to 1000 acres. “Industrial zones would be set up in Kalutara, Avissawella, and Hambantota,” he said.
“Women will be able to seek employment in factories set up in the zones without facing various problems and vicissitudes by seeking employments abroad,” the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said he highly appreciated the programme organised by Minister Senasinghe to provide job training to women in the area. He said steps would be taken to initiate a loan scheme for women trainees to enable them to start self-employment schemes.
The Prime Minister said the Government increased the salaries of state-sector servants by Rs. 10,000.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said more opportunities would be provided for women to enhance their economic standards and even enter the political field. He said the next local elections would be held according to a mixture of the Preferential and First Past the Post Systems. “There will be 28 candidates from each party contesting the Kaduwela Municipal Council election on the Ward basis and 25 percent of them should be women candidates,” the Prime Minister Said.
Minister Senasinghe said he was fully satisfied with the ministry post offered to him and he would never betray the party or its policies.
