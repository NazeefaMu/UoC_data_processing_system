Need for reliable witness protection programme in SL

"In deciding whether or not to include a witness in the WPP, you must consider the seriousness of the offence that the person has witnessed and the nature and importance of the relevant evidence. Officials should also take into account the nature of the perceived danger to the witness and the witness’ relationship to other witnesses being assessed for inclusion in the programme"
As Sri Lanka sets up its transitional justice processes and Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it is important that the country also installs a reliable and trustworthy Witness Protection Programme (WPP) in order to shield witnesses and victims from threats or acts of violence.
To that end, the South Asian Centre for Legal Studies (SACLS) sponsored a closed-door lecture entitled “Ensuring Victim and Witness Protection in Transition Justice Mechanisms: Lessons Learnt and Challenges” on Tuesday afternoon at the Sri Lanka Foundation.
The lecture was held under the Chatham House Rule, which means that the identity of the speaker may not be divulged. The lecturer was an internationally renowned witness protection expert who has years of experience protecting witnesses and victims across the world. In this article, the speaker will be referred to as Jones.
In the second of his two presentations, Jones covered the essentials for setting up a high functioning WPP and noted that there are a variety of viable forms that witness and victim protection can take. He first drew the distinction between a WPP and witness protection, noting that the former is the more involved form of protection, whereas the latter is a set of institutional practices.
“A witness protection programme is the highest form of protection that a country provides. But then you have alternate methods of protection, such as local protection measures.”
“It’s important to have good practice, both by witnesses in how they behave and by law enforcement or others who are dealing with the witness to minimise their exposure to risk. Then there are procedural practices that can be implemented by the court to protect witnesses,” he said.
In order for a WPP to be effective, the witness protection set-up must be very well managed. Moreover, a WPP should be used only if the institutional witness protection measures are not enough.
“A WPP is the last resort. You need to look at all other types of protection before you put someone into WPP, because these are very resource intensive and expensive programmes. They are only supposed to be used when there is no other avenue to protect someone,” he said.
Legislation
While Jones spent some time discussing the institutional practices that contribute to protecting witnesses, he also extensively reviewed the legislation that could create an effective WPP. Needless to say, the set of laws establishing such a programme must be precise and wide-ranging.
“First of all, any law will need a clear definition of what qualifies someone as a witness or victim. It should also make clear who can submit an application for witness protection,” Jones said.
Furthermore, the laws must qualify how applications are assessed and create an outline for an appeal process if people are rejected or removed from WPPs. Individuals can be removed from a WPP after the conclusion of court proceedings if the situation is deemed safe, but they can also be removed if they misbehave while in the programme.
“It’s important to write in law how people are removed from the programmes,” he said, while adding that there should also be consideration given to how re-identification processes take place.
“Anyone can go to a registry and change their name. In various international WPPs, however, countries have the power to make a new entry into the register of births, which effectively creates a new person. This is a very significant form of protection,” he said.
While creating a new identity for someone would seem to be an excellent form of protection, it is also very important to put in the legislation that WPPs are neither benefits nor inducements for evidence. Being in a WPP is a very arduous experience, and those who enter into them must know that they should not expect any extra aid through the programme. In fact, they will often have to sacrifice a lot. “It should be illegal for WPPs to give any benefits at all. For example, let’s take a driver’s license. You can’t just get someone a driver’s license if they don’t already have one. You can’t give them a skill they don’t have.”
“If someone is relocated, what normally happens is they are put into housing of equivalent standard, and this happens for their safety.”
“Lots of people who want to be on WPPs think they can forget about their past debts and loans. The legislation should stipulate that every participant will still be responsible for their existing obligations,” Jones said.
On top of this, there should also be legislation concerning an external oversight mechanism. If a witness is not happy with how they are being treated, they should be able to go to a separate body to lodge a complaint. Additionally, the laws should establish processes through which various governmental agencies can collaborate to assist people in WPPs.
“No WPP can succeed without help from other government agencies. Whether it’s assisting in changing a name, finding housing, or providing medical care, many government bodies need to be helping each other,” Jones said.
Assessment Criteria
It is also crucial that legislation establishes how a person will be assessed for inclusion in any WPP.
“In deciding whether or not to include a witness in the WPP, you must consider the seriousness of the offence that the person has witnessed and the nature and importance of the relevant evidence.”
“Officials should also take into account the nature of the perceived danger to the witness and the witness’ relationship to other witnesses being assessed for inclusion in the programme,” he said.
Moreover, professionals should conduct psychological examinations to gauge the suitability for a witness in the programme and whether there are viable alternative methods of protecting the witness. Officials must also review a witness’ criminal record, particularly with respect to whether he or she has committed violent crimes and is a risk to the public. “When looking at people who are applying to WPPs, we are looking at putting procedures in place to protect them. This can pose a risk to you, the staff that deals with them, and the programme itself. That’s why assessments should be in depth, and I believe it’s necessary,” he said.
Witness Protection Programme Essentials
When conducting a WPP, Jones reiterated the essential point that no witness is bigger than the programme. In order for a WPP to strengthen a judicial process, which is part of its work, it has to protect people who buy into the process. You cannot have someone on a WPP who puts himself or herself at unnecessary risk. “If a witness is not behaving properly and is placing themselves and the staff, or the entire program in danger, they should no longer be in the programme no matter how important they are. You have to have a programme that can stand up to scrutiny.”
“If someone who is on programme is harmed or killed, it will have a significant impact on future court procedures and investigations. As a WPP officer, you really don’t want the public to think you lack the ability to protect witnesses and victims,” he said.
Likewise, it is essential to create comprehensive operating procedures that support legislation. These standard procedures should not be made publicly available, since they are the methods by which a country protects people.
It follows, then, that WPPs need competent people working within them. “Well-trained people are crucial to a functioning WPP. Plenty of information goes into the WPP bubble, but nothing should go out. The minute you start leaking information you have nothing,” he said. The theme of teamwork across government agencies is key, as Jones relayed how protection services for a witness are often times delegated to local police or military forces when that person goes to and comes back from court.
“You also need to have proper external oversight that is separate from the functions of the court, as well as a corruption resistance plan to make sure everyone is behaving properly,” he said. While it is certainly difficult to be in any WPP, it is especially arduous if one is relocated due to safety concerns. When this happens, WPPs must work especially hard to make the witness or victim feel comfortable. The officers must also keep the witness or victim from trying to get back in touch with those from his or her former life.
“People often have to avoid contacting their family and friends when they are relocated. It’s like getting a new life. We want to form relationships with people wherein we can openly discuss difficulties. It’s important to develop a relationship where witnesses can be open with you and tell you the truth,” he said.
That being said, officers are expected to maintain their professional distance: “Witnesses are sometimes totally reliant on you. It’s vital to maintain your professional distance, and for this you need monitoring systems.”
While it is not an easy task to create and maintain a WPP, it is a crucial aspect of Sri Lanka’s path to reconciliation. WPPs strengthen judicial processes and ensure the public’s faith that witnesses will be protected. Sri Lanka certainly has its work cut out for it in inaugurating its own WPP.
