Fair weather, colder mornings over the next few days: Met. Department

 
Dry weather with colder nights and mornings can expect over most parts of the island of the next few days, the Meteorological Department has said.
It said ground frost could be expected at some places in the Nuwara-Eliya district, too, in the early hours of the morning.
Misty conditions can be expected at some places of the island during the morning, particularly in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern and Central provinces, it said, predicting however, ‘mainly fair weather’ would prevail over most parts of the island.
