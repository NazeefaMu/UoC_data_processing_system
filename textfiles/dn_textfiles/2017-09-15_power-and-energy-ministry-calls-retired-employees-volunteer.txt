Power and Energy Ministry calls for retired employees to volunteer

 
The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry has requested retired drivers and technical service providers at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to report to work on a voluntary basis.
Accordingly, those who have retired from September 1, 2014 were asked to report to work in order to distribute essential services consistently.
Volunteers are requested to report to the respective departments in which they were employed last.
Trade unions attached to the CEB are currently in their fourth consecutive day of protest against a number of anomalies.
