Cargills’ agri-good revolution
Yielding farmer entrepreneur successful

Fresh vegetables and fruits hit the shelves of Cargills Food City supermarkets sooner. The country’s largest food manufacturer and retailer, Cargills(Ceylon) PLC, has ensured that fruits and vegetables reach their consumers in all its freshness.
The agricultural products, carrots, spring onions, cabbage, batana, knohl-kohl radish, red onions, long beans, green chillies plantains, beet capsicum, papaya, mangoes, guava, tomatoes, mushrooms, bell pepper spinach, leeks and leafy vegetables are harvested at proper maturity for the sustenance of quality and hygienic post-harvest life.
The products are transported from fields to nearby Cargills collection centers or procurement centers directly from the farms. The Cargills supply chain has reduced the transportation time for fruits and vegetables. The fruits and vegetables arc bought directly from the farmers, and non-farmers are not allowed to sell any agriculture products at the centers.
The company’s efficient supply chain management has set up a system in which the farmers do not become vulnerable to exploitation by middlemen buyers.
The farmers working closely with Cargills Agriculture projects have learnt to capture opportunities and avoid the pitfalls of being trapped in supply chains operated by middlemen.
The company has slashed food wastage through good agriculture practices. Its effectiveness has benefited farmers to maximize their profits.
The transit of vegetables and fruits from farm gates to acquisition centers and from there to the food city markets takes place under good agriculture practice standards.
They come properly packed in fibreboard boxes and wooden crates to the market for the ease of handling.
The collection centers are hives of activity. According to the farmers, this is where they can get the highest value for their agriculture products.
They indicated self-assuredness with respect to being able to profit from agriculture.
Thousands of farmers remain confident today that they can sell their produce to Cargills. “So far, we had a successful ride with the company,” said farmers from Jaffna, Kuruengala and Kilinochchi.
Elimnatnig middlemen
Farming has taken a dramatic turn to a better direction in recent years with the Cargills accessing farming industry with a plan to empower the farmer community. The company approached with a very efficient supply chain management scheme to prevent farmers from being vulnerable to exploitation by those infamous middlemen.
Cargills purchase fruits and vegetables from the farmers at significantly higher prices. Because of their goods in higher demand, the farmers are now in a shape to profit from agriculture. The harvests too are booming with the kind of agriculture assistance they get from the company’s agriculture business agents.
We met those farmers who work closely with these agents at their farms. After talking to them in the Jaffna and Puttalam districts, I realized that the general perception that farmers are simple people lacking any kind of sophistication is just invalid. It is absurd.

You will be pleasantly surprised if you talk to them about their farming activities nowadays, because they will tell you about things like soil management and how they like to diversify their farms for next growth cycle for economic viability and their plans to adopt some new technologies and practices to increases profitability of their farms and to develop efficient biological systems for the sustainability of their cultivations.
These farmers are knowledgeable and resourceful. The Cargills’ agriculture extension work has brought about change to their lifestyle and thinking. Their greater market integration and agriculture activities have apparently changed them into entrepreneurs. Moreover, they are an accepted community in their regions.
The times when the children of farmers felt shy to say that their father is such and such farmer is no longer there.
For teachers have started looking up for the children of farmers when money is needed for some school celebration activity or some physical infrastructure activity, for they have become much respected people.
Today, they talk about having farming enterprises. They are looking at innovative strategies and are receptive to new technologies.
We met the farmers in their fields to discuss their shared conviction of farming for economic growth.
Upscaling
Senanayaka Aarachchilage Shashika Pushpakumara is a guava fruit farmer based in Kalpitiya, Norochcholai of Puttalam. He has grown guava trees in a land of six acres with his friend, Rikaz, who has been his neighbour and childhood friend.
Shashika harvests more than 1,000 kilos of guava from his cultivation three days a week. He has become a popular farmer in his area due to his talent and innovativeness.
Shashika has 20 persons working under him in his farm. Cargills’ agriculture business agents have assisted him from the start up of things and beyond,?” said Shashika. “The agriculture teams led by Cargills Agri Business Group Manager, Haridas Fernando helped me design my farm for profitability.
They passed on many guidelines on fertilization of the plants and the importance of irrigating the land in each production cycle, he said. Further, they advised me on how to protect the trees against diseases and growth deficiencies and to avoid reductions in yields.”
According to Shashika, Cargills Agribusiness Group Manager, Haridas Fernando has played a dominant role toward the context of their success as guava growers.
“We get a fairly good income from the guava fruits,” said Shashika.
“I expect my children to engage in this farming enterprise. I like my children to ensure its continuity after me,” he said. We asked Cargills Agribusiness Group Manager Haridas, a deft hand at agriculture who has been around with the farmers assisting them in their farming endeavours, if the company has progressed in terms of achieving their objectives with their partnership with the farmers as the buyers of their products.
“The company with over 330 Food City outlets covering all the districts obviously needs a lot of food and vegetables. The farmers had yet to meet out demand in full,” he said.
It is not always easy to work with farmers. They often produce crops on their own cultivation plans without a proper understanding of the market requirements. There have been a huge post harvest loss of around 40% due to bad handling. By correct guidance and training we have made them market oriented, and reduced the post harvest down to eight percent. Thereby Cargills have managed to boost the income of the farmers to a great extent.
“Also by the eliminating the middlemen, the company positioned itself to give a better price to the farmer,” he said. “This is indeed a social responsibility process. The government is happy about it, and we are happy that we started it,” he explained.
Empowerment
Cargills buys about 120 tonnes of vegetable every day from the farmers, but it does not have any written agreement with the farmers, which means the farmers are free to sell their products to anyone. They bring their agriculture products to our procurement centers because they get a better price from us than anywhere else.
The company has also established a fund named Cargills “Sarubima” where it gives back 50 cents for each kilogram of vegetables it purchases from the farmers, to them.
Sarubima stands to empower the farmer community with a multitude of benefits. It provides scholarships and educational gifts, such as computers and laptops, to the children of farmer families.
Prasanna Asiri Waduge, is a farmer from the Galgamuwa electorate of Kurunegala. He grows tropical vegetables, such as bitter gourd, snake gourd and eggplant. Waduge has this to say about his relationship with Sarubima:
“Sarubima provides laptops to our children if they pass their grade five scholarships, ‘O’ level or “A” level exams,” he said.
For those children of the farmers who have got selected for universities, Sarubima imparts money to carry out their educational activities. The company helps they helps them foot their tuition fees so that they may do well in their “O” level and “A” level exams.
Farmer families that supply agriculture products to Cargills are thus entitled to many benefits. “We are thankful that we are relieved from the grip of middlemen because of Cargills. The Cargills collection centers pay us at least Rs 10 or Rs 15 more for a kilo of our vegetables and fruits.
“Our produce must meet high quality standards to hit the shelves of Cargill’s Supermarkets. No matter what the size of the produce we bring, the company purchases them if they meet their specific standards,” he explained.
“In the olden days, it was virtually impossible to save any money through the sales of our produce. We were losing money hand over fists, because by the time we have finished buying seeds, plants, fertilizer and other equipment with that money for the next season, there was hardly any money left in our hands,” he said.
“Today, we work with the Cargills bank. Each of us has a bank account and we manage our receipts and payments through the bank,” he said.
As pointed out by the farmers at Cargills Procurement Center in Thambuttegama, A.W.A.S. Abeysekera, A. Ajith De Soza, K.A.Piyal Thusithakumara and U.P.G. Muthubanda, the farmers supplying their agriculture products to Thambuttegama Cargills procurement center are confident and feel financially secure. “The company helps us identify quality seeds and apprise us of modern technologies,” said Ajith De Soyza (48) who is a cauliflower farmer in the main.
“I also grow winged beans (dambala). I grow cauliflower for export. I did not know much about production technology of cauliflower. The company’s extension officers passed down that knowledge to us.”
“About five years ago, cauliflower farming was not a common thing. With the help of Cagills, I was able to grow cauliflower.
With that knowledge, now can grow cauliflower under any weather and climate. Be it 100 kilos per day, I can provide,” he said.
We asked the farmers about their use of agro-chemicals and pesticides on their cultivations. “This is an area the consumers think that we may be using a lot of chemicals to grow our vegetables and fruits, but the truth is that this indeed calls for a lot of money from our part,” said Thuisithakumara.
“We always seek advice from Cargills’ agronomists should our cultivations become affected by pests or weeds, or by extreme weather,” he said.
“The company maintains what is called MRL (Minimum Residue Level). If our products are not compatible with theses standards, they will be rejected by the company.” Cargills’ Manager and agriculture expert Haridas has this to say: “The farmers sometimes had to spray chemicals to mitigate crop damage caused by pests. The problem with the agrochemicals is not in the use but in their dose.”
“Working with us over the years, these farmers today know how to use some of these chemicals successfully. Cargills maintains a policy of preserving organic integrity and vital qualities of the products at all stages of production when it comes to the agriculture sector,” he added.
