Avoid deadly dengue bite

These are the common instructions issued to the public by the Health Ministry, the Epidemiology Unit and the medical experts during recent dengue outbreaks of the country.
Protect yourself
* The people can protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing long sleeves / fully covered dresses during day time.
* Mosquito repellents (the mosquito repellent should be applied on the skin and repeat applying after few hours.
* The most popular mosquito repellent is Citronells oil. It can be applied by mixing with 50 percent of coconut oil or something similar in order to reduce its mild burning sensation.
* Adults can apply both natural and artificial mosquito repellents.
* Mosquito repellents are not suitable for the infants bellow the age of two years.
* Natural mosquito repellents should be used for the children between two and five years.
* Mosquito nets should be used while sleeping both day and night.
* House screening - using nets or similar material to prevent entry of mosquitoes through windows and doors.
* Keeping bedrooms, kitchen and toilets well-lit, ventilated and airy to prevent adult female mosquitoes hiding inside houses.
* Special attention should be paid to destroy and clean all possible dengue mosquito breeding sites which hold water such as gutters, water tanks, refrigerator tray, commode and its water tank regularly (scrubbing them at least once a week is a must).
* All plants in bromeliad family, cut bamboo trees, tree holes etc. should be removed or filled with sand. Wells should be used daily or otherwise they should be covered with a net or similar material preventing the entry of mosquitoes.
* All flower vases with water, ant’s traps, small ponds etc. should be removed from homes.
* Garbage, especially used food containers, tyres etc. should be removed from gardens. Even a tiny pen clip which holds water is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed. Cleaning should be done regularly (at least once a week).
* Since dengue mosquitoes cannot fly few kilometers / miles, the people should pay their attention to keep their homes and surroundings free of mosquito breeding sites.
If a person suffers from fever
* All who suffer from fever should seek medical treatment from a hospital or a qualified doctor without delay.
* Pregnant mothers, infants, elderly and people who suffer from chronic diseases should seek immediate medical treatment for fever.
* Home remedies should not apply for any type of fever even when few family members are suffering from a viral flu.
* All fever patients should take bed rest. They should not attend work, school etc.
* Medications such as Aspirin and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) such as Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Diclofenac etc. should not be taken.
* All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. Other medications cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF).
* All fever patients should not take any red or dark brown food and beverages. It makes difficult for Consultants to diagnose DHF.
* A Full Blood Count should be tested in 48 hours and even the result is normal, the test should be repeated in another 24 hours. The fever patients should not ignore fever even if the fever goes down in a day or two. They must do the blood tests after wards.
If a person suffers from Dengue
* The symptoms of DHF are severe pain in the stomach, vomiting, bleeding from gums, nose, vagina etc, red patches on the skin, coldness in hands and legs, less or no urination, paleness, sleepiness, uneasiness, feeling faintness, dizziness etc. Immediate hospitalization required for the patients.
* Settling of fever alone can deteriorate the nature of dengue. It means that some patients presume that when the fever gets cured, the whole dengue situation has come to an end. Perhaps it is not. The patients have to be more vigilant and go for frequent treatments until it is recommended by a qualified physician.
* If a person has the dengue virus inside his/her body even without any visible symptoms, he or she can infect mosquitoes and when that mosquito bites a healthy person, he or she gets dengue. Therefore all dengue patients must be kept inside mosquito nets all the time.
If you recovered from Dengue
* The duration of rest depends on the person’s condition and how she or he feels.
* The recovered persons should not start their normal routine until they feel normal and energetic.
* Especially the children should take adequate rest.
* The parents should not force recovered children to attend sports, tuition classes etc.
* A person suffered from one type of Dengue and recovered, can get infected with other three types of dengue at any moment.
* All who suffer from fever should seek medical treatment from a hospital or a qualified doctor without delay.
* If a person has the dengue virus inside his/her body even without any visible symptoms, he or she can infect mosquitoes and when that mosquito bites a healthy person, he or she gets dengue. Therefore all dengue patients must be kept inside mosquito nets all the time.
* Since dengue mosquitoes cannot fly few kilometers / miles, the people should pay their attention to keep their homes and surroundings free of mosquito breeding sites.
