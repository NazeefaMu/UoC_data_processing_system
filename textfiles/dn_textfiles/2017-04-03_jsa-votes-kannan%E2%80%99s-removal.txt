JSA votes for Kannan’s removal

The Judicial Services Association (JSA) has unanimously adopted five resolutions seeking the removal of Ramanathan Kannan from the position of High Court Judge.
The resolutions had been passed at a special meeting of the JSA held on Saturday. Sources said the President in a discussion with the JSA has agreed to correct any procedural errors with regard to the appointment.
The first resolution of the JSA states that it requests President Maithripala Sirisena to remove Ramanathan Kannan from the position of High Court Judge as the appointment has no force or avail in law. It states the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) have re-affirmed that the recommendation with regard to the appointment of Kannan has no force or avail in law.
The JSA in its second resolution requests the JSC to recommend the President to remove Kannan from the position of the High Court Judge. Its third resolution requests the JSC to consider not allowing Kannan to function as High Court Judge till he is officially removed from the said position.
The fourth resolution states the independence of the judiciary has been violated by the controversial appointment of Kannan and requests the President and the JSC to restore and uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary.
The last resolution requests the JSC to refrain from recommending nominations submitted to them from the unofficial bar for appointing High Court Judges directly in future. It states the appointment of Judges for High Court from unofficial Bar undermines the knowledge, experience and sacrifices made by the District Judges and Magistrates who work under immense pressures and difficulties for long periods of time in difficult areas during their career.
However, Bar Association of Sri Lanka Secretary Amal Randeniya speaking to the Daily News said the BASL is not in agreement with the JSA’s last resolution. “It is not proper to close the avenue to make appointments from the unofficial bar. We admit there had been procedural lapses in the appointment of Kannan as a High Court judge. There had been no transparency in it. We observe that a proper set of criteria must be adopted when making such recommendations hereafter,” he said.
He said the reaction of the BASL with regard to the JSA resolutions would be made known following its Executive Committee meeting on Wednesday. He said the proposals of the BASL with regard to the matter would be forwarded to the Bar Council.
When contacted by the Daily News, the JSC remained non-committal over the matter. Its Secretary P W D C Jayathilake said the JSC had not yet received the content of the resolutions. However, sources said the JSC could do little at this instance as it could only intervene when there is complaint related to a disciplinary matter.
