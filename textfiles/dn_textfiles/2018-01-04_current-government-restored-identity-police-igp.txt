Current government restored identity of Police: IGP

It was under the Good Governance government that the identity of the Sri Lanka Police was restored to maintain the law and order in the country, said Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara, yesterday.
The main change made to the Police under the Good Governance government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, was to take the Police Department out of the Defence Ministry and set it up as the Sri Lanka Police. “The Police changed its usual cause and was assigned to maintain the law and order in the country,” the IGP said.
He made these observations yesterday morning, during a ceremony held to mark the assuming of duties of the newly sworn-in Law and Order and Southern Development State Minister Piyasena Gamage, which was held at the Ministry premises in Suhurupaya.
IGP Jayasundara further said that after the three-decade curse of conflict in the country, the people wish for peace, and the Police has a significant role in fulfilling the people’s aspiration. He added that the Police, with no doubt, expect that the assistance given by the President, the Premier, and Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake, would be further strengthened with the assuming of duties of State Minister Gamage.
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama, Provincial Councilor Randima Gamage, and Law and Order and Southern Development State Ministry Secretary Pathmasiri Jayamanna also participated the event.
