Disabled benefited only by a fraction of funds allocated to them - DOJF

According to the Disability Organizations Joint Front (DOJF), the government allocated Rs.28 billion per year for the welfare of the disabled but only a fraction of it truly benefit the disabled.
DOJF Advisor Prasanna Kuruppu addressing a media conference to mark the International Day of Disabled Persons yesterday explained that even the allowance of Rs.3,000 per month paid to disabled persons only came up to Rs.1.5 billion per year and thus they were not aware of what happened to the rest of the money.
The Front represented by 30 organizations covering physical and intellectual disabilities has been campaigning for equal opportunities in the field of education, health care, public services, politics, cultural rights, access to public buildings, employment, social security and the legal framework which does not accommodate the disabled.
“Even the Right to Information Act does not have a mechanism to allow a person who is blind or deaf to submit an application”,” said DOJF President Sugath Wasantha De Silva.
According to the Department of Census and Statistics, there are close to 8.7 percent or 1.7 million who are considered disabled in the country. The majority of them, at 57 percent are women.
“They are burdened with the twin challenges of their gender as well as their disability”, said Rasanjali Pathirage, DOJF General Secretary. Many she explained are cut off from public life, have no access to education or employment. Further even if harassed or abused at home, have no way of accessing the authorities to find justice.
Close to 54 percent of disabled persons in the school going age do not have access to education and 71 percent do not engage in any economic activity.
One of the Front’s main demands is that the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act No 28 of 1996 be amended to encompass a wide array of issues faced by the community. In 2003, they had submitted a national policy covering 22 areas and in 2006 a draft new Act was prepared. Kuruppu explained that whilst Cabinet approval was granted for it and the Attorney General’s Department,Social Welfare Ministry and the Legal Draftsman Department took it up in 2008, it has never progressed beyond that.
“The Government thinks they would have to bear a heavy cost in implementing it, but we see it as an investment not cost.”
The Front’s Draft Act more importantly asked for two important mechanisms to be set up; one an agency to coordinate all government services to the disabled and another to monitor and regulate all assistive devices used by the disabled to ensure they are up to standard.
