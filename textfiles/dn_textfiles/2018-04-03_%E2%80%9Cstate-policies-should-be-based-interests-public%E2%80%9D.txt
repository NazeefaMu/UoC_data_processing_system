“State policies should be based on interests of public”

“State policies should be created based on the interests of the public rather than the self interest of politicians,” said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
The minister was speaking at the opening ceremony of the Sayaisurugama reawakened village at Weligama on March 31. Sayaisurugama is the 51st reawakened village to be vested with the public.
“This village provides shelter for 33 families with pure drinking water, electricity and roadways at a cost of Rs. 213 lakhs,” said the minister. “Our aim is to construct 2,500 reawakened villages by 2020 and 650 reawakened villages must be constructed annually to reach the target. We are confident of facing the next general elections after constructing 2,500 reawakened villages. However, our primary goal is to provide shelter for every family in the country by 2025, irrespective of the caste, religion or race.”
The minister granted housing loans worth Rs. 214 lakhs to 205 families. One-hundred-and-fifty pregnant mothers were given nutritious foodstuffs totalling Rs. 300,000. Books worth Rs.100,000 were given to 55 schoolchildren. The minister also awarded spectacles worth Rs. 452,000 to 1,115 persons.
“I undertook this ministry in 2015,” he said. “We did not have the necessary statistics to calculate the housing needs in the country. After conducting a census, we realised that 250,000 families need houses. The powerful men created shelters for their own selves and their families during the past years, instead of creating shelter for the public. But my father’s wish was to give shelter to the underemployed. We follow his vision now and we do our best to make Sri Lanka free of poverty and housing issues.”
The minister pointed out the necessity to fulfil the needs of the citizens.
“We should carry out policies which are beneficial to the public. Schoolchildren must be given uniforms instead of vouchers. The citizens should get fertilizer subsidies."
"The government must provide jobs for unemployed degree-holders. We should build this country knowing the heartbeat of its citizens.”
