Military personnel, families on three-day visit to Bodh Gaya

The High Commission of India had organised a special visit to Bodh Gaya in India for 80 Sri Lankan Armed Forces personnel and their families, recently.
The three-day visit includes travel to and from India on an Indian Air Force C-17 Globemaster aircraft, which was specifically deployed from India to transport the travellers. Apart from a visit to the sacred Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya, various other events and activities, including interaction with their Indian counterparts and a tour of the Officers Training Academy (OTA) at Gaya, are part of the group’s itinerary, which is being coordinated by the Indian Army.
Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu and Sri Lankan Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayake met with the Sri Lankan personnel and their families at Colombo airport on June 24, before the group embarked on their visit to India.
The travellers shared their excitement about their special visit and thanked the Indian Government for organising the programme.
The visit to Bodh Gaya is yet another manifestation of the shared Buddhist heritage of India and Sri Lanka and will help deepen the bonds of friendship and camaraderie that exists between the Armed Forces of both countries.
