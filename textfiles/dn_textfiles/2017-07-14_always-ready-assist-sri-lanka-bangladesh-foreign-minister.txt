Always ready to assist Sri Lanka - Bangladesh Foreign Minister

’Bangladesh will not hesitate to provide whatever assistance or help to Sri Lanka as we have an extremely cordial relationship,’ Bangladesh Foreign Minister A. H. Mahmood Ali said when he met with President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
President Maithripala Sirisena, who is on a three-day State Visit to Bangladesh, met with Bangladesh Foreign Minister at the Hotel Sonargaon.
The Foreign Minister said President Sirisena’s visit to Bangladesh is an important milestone in the long-standing friendship between the two countries.
The President expressed gratitude to the Government of Bangladesh for the warm welcome extended to the Sri Lankan delegation he led.
He said Bangladesh is always a true friend to Sri Lanka and recalled with gratitude the assistance given by the Government of Bangladesh in the recent floods as well as during the past conflict.
President Sirisena said he is not a guest to Bangladesh and as the Environment Minister and the Health Minister of Sri Lanka, he had visited Bangladesh and recalled those worthy memories.
The President appreciated the progress made by Bangladesh under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and emphasised the need to promote investment opportunities and trade relations between the two countries. Minister Ravi Karunanayake, State Minister Wasantha Aluwihare, Deputy Ministers Mohan Lal Grero, Nishantha Muthuhettigama and others participated.
