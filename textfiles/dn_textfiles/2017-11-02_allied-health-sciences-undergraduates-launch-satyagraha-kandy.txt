Allied Health Sciences undergraduates launch satyagraha in Kandy

 
The Students of the Peradeniya University's Allied Health Sciences faculty staged a satyagraha protest in Kandy today.
Peradeniya University Students’ Council President Nipuna Sankalpa said that they launched the Satyagraha protest to demand solutions to the issues arisen during the Allied Health Sciences clinical practices.
He further said that the Health Minister should pay more attention to this matter.
The Allied Health Sciences undergraduates said they would continue their protest until their demands are met.
