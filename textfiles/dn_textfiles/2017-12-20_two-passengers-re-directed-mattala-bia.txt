Two passengers re-directed from Mattala to BIA

Two Sri Lankan passengers who attempted to travel to Dubai yesterday morning from the Mattala International Airport were disembarked. They were requested to go through the Bandaranaike International Airport instead, after officers found that one of the passengers had attempted to travel on the wrong visa category.
The two passengers, 22-year-old W. A. Nalaka and D. K. Shashikala, who were set to travel to Dubai through Fly Dubai Airline, were stopped by the Sri Lankan Foreign Employment Bureau officials yesterday morning at the Mattala Airport. The officers had reportedly informed the passengers that they could travel to the Middle East, if they were to go through the BIA instead.
“The passengers had informed the officers that they were visiting relatives who were living and working in Dubai. They were, however, prevented from embarking and were directed to travel through the BIA.” An official at the Fly Dubai office in Mattala said the officers, upon questioning the passengers, found out that one of them had intended to work in Dubai as a domestic but was travelling in the guise of being sponsored by her siblings.
“One of the passengers said she was sponsored by her sibling and intended to work there, for which she needs a work visa to travel on. Regarding the other passenger, there was a discrepancy in his age, which was contrary to what was stated in the documents provided,” he said. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority Prabath Kularatne told the Daily News that passengers must check the port of origin on their tickets, a mistake many make. “If the ticket says BIA, then they will not be able to disembark from Mattala and vice versa.
They need to make sure their documents are in order. And even still if they are inconvenienced, they are free to complain to the CAA in writing for which the CAA will conduct an inquiry for due investigations.”
