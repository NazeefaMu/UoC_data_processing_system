SLFP will contest LG polls along with other political parties: Amaraweera

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will contest the coming Local Government election as a strong united alliance with number of other political parties, UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said.
He expressed his confidence that the SLFP will be able to record a definite victory at the coming election.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera was participating in the launching ceremony of the Freshwater Fisher Information System - Infish - at the National Aquaculture Development Authority last Friday.
Rresponding to questions on the ongoing discussions between the SLFP and the Joint Opposition, Minister Amaraweera said that several JO members have finally realised where the real SLFP is and that they have been running after a sheer illusion.
“We always attempted not to let SLFP divide. However, several of the JO worked against the discussions between the two groups. I do not believe these discussions be fruitful. Several others think the discussions should continue. What I have to say is that the discussions fell apart because of the some persons' acts.” Minister Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera said some political figures form separate parties but they do not affect the SLFP at large.
“There have been similar attempts before. All those who parted, came back to the main party. What matters to us is our party, not any individuals. The ones who left the SLFP had to come back. Whoever who attempts to walk away from the SLFP now, will also have to come back to the true SLFP under the headship of President Maithripala Sirisena.” Minister Amaraweera said.
Asked if the members of Wimal Weerawansa led Jathika nidahas Peramuna are also joining the SLFP, Minister Amaraweera said not just them, but all who have left the SLFP would realise that people’s power is with the SLFP and rejoin the party.
Asked if the separation gives more advantage to the United National Party, Minister Amaraweera said, "It indeed does, but the victory lies with the SLFP. We wanted this to become a landslide victory. That is why we held discussions with the Joint opposition,” he said.
