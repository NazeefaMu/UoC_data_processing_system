Bridges and Bridge Management in Sri Lanka

There are 4,800 bridges on National Highway Network (A & B class roads) in Sri Lanka. It is important to implement strategic maintenance plan to ensure the sustainability of the large number of existing bridges in order to provide uninterrupted traffic flow for a long time. It is understood that all road infrastructure components deteriorate with time due to the natural and artificial influences. However, it appears that the importance of maintenance and management of bridges has been overlooked for a long time in Sri Lanka.
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has been working with the Road Development Authority (RDA) from 2015 on “The Project for Capacity Development on Bridge Management” (herein after referred as “the Project”) below is brief explanation about the concept of this project and some areas related to bridge maintenance under the project.
As the economy grows and income of people rises, more people desire to have their own private vehicles to commute for their needs. Inadequate road infrastructure to accommodate the increasing volume of vehicles and insufficient traffic control measures lead to traffic congestion on roads resulting in loss of resources. At present there are over 6.5 million vehicles registered in Sri Lanka and more than 70% comprised of motorcycles and three wheelers. There are nearly 3.4 million of motorcycles and around 1.2 million three wheelers in the country. There had been a steep rise in the private vehicle usage in the recent past. The slow movement of vehicles on the roads and emission of smoke mixed with obnoxious gasses harm the environment and health of the people. It is estimated that nearly 500,000 vehicles enter Colombo city daily.

Usage of public transport should be highly encouraged and some restrictions for private vehicles to enter the city during rush hours need to be considered.
The road network has been developed throughout the island since 19th Century by the Public Works Department (PWD). Some bridges constructed on National Highways are over 100-years-old. Although they are very old, a large number of those bridges are in good condition, still functioning and supporting the national transportation system. On the other hand, some bridges which are less than 20-years-old, are in very unfortunate condition. What could be the reason? This is a question to be solved immediately.
The maintenance of bridges is very important, but the problem is how to do it systematically to achieve expected outcome.
RDA and BM &AU
The development and maintenance of roads and bridges are the main tasks of RDA. They are responsible for providing efficient road network to the public. To perform the tasks entrusted to RDA, the organisation have established separate divisions to implement the relevant tasks.
As an example, Engineering Services Division is responsible for design of bridges, Maintenance and Management Division is responsible for maintenance of roads and bridges, and Planning Division is responsible for project formulation including prioritization of requirements and of budgetary arrangements.
RDA operates with a very comprehensive management structure comprised with Provincial Directors under the Maintenance & Management Division of the RDA. The Chief Engineers’ offices and Executive Engineers offices are managed under the purview of each Provincial Director. Number of Executive Engineers offices located throughout the island is 52 and these Executive Engineers are functioning under the supervision of the respective Chief Engineers.
And Chief Engineers report directly to the Provincial Directors. All engineers involve in road and bridge construction and maintenance activities depending on the magnitude and level of responsibility in addition to their other duties. The lack of engineers assigned for maintenance of bridges is a constraint to monitor the condition of bridges.
For the successful maintenance of bridges, knowledge on bridge structures and experience in construction supervision are essential attributes.
Bridge Assessment Unit (BAU) was established in the RDA about 25 years ago for the inspection of bridges and maintenance purposes. After few years from the establishment, BAU was closed down due to the shortage of staff and no division had been made responsible for maintenance of bridges since then, till February 2015, when it was re-established and re-designated as BM & AU at the commencement of this Project funded by JICA.
BM&AU function with a head office and 9 regional offices. It is responsible for inspection, maintenance and repairs of bridges. Capacity building is an essential function of the BM&AU by providing required training for other Engineers in RDA to acquire necessary skills and knowledge in maintenance of bridges.
The task of inspection approximately 1,500 bridges in three Provinces (Western, Central, Southern) has already been completed by end of 2016.
Based on the results of bridge inspection and diagnosis conducted in the three Provinces, it has been identified that more than 10% of bridges are seriously damaged or in a weak condition.
Inspection of bridges in other districts is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2017.
Issues pertaining to bridges and maintenance of bridges in Sri Lanka are detailed below.
- In Sri Lanka, there are few long span bridges. Bridges of length less than 10m account for 60% of all bridges. Only 10 % of bridges are 30 m or more in length.
- Reinforced concrete (RC) bridges account for 60 % while steel bridges and Pre-stressed (PC) bridges constitute 20% and 17 % respectively, 3% is considered as other types of bridges.
- The Inspection was difficult due to the lower head clearance of some bridges located in Colombo and some coastal areas. Damage due to the effect of salt is observed in bridges in coastal areas and this seems to be a critical problem which needs to be addressed with correct remedial measures.
- Many steel bridges are heavily corroded due to poor maintenance for long periods even application of paint has not been carried out regularly
- RDA should have condition report for all bridges, because these data can be a strong base for public asset management.
- Engineers attached to RDA will develop the concept of bridge asset management based on the accurate information on bridges gathered during bridge inspections by the Project and could share the relevant bridge maintenance information with other engineers and technical staff in RDA. This will be a good approach for sustaining the proper bridge maintenance system in RDA.
JICA project and bridge inspection vehicle
In Japan, bridge maintenance and reconstruction of bridges is a serious issue. During the period of high economic growth in 1960-1970, many bridges were constructed. Currently most of them have reached 50 years of existence. Amount of maintenance cost is rapidly increasing.
Under technical cooperation of JICA, bridge maintenance projects were conducted in many countries based on bridge maintenance experiences in Japan. Government of Japan and JICA have recognized the requirement of providing necessary equipment and technical cooperation support to develop the bridge maintenance strategies in Sri Lanka. Consequently, the project was initiated in 2015.
A Bridge Inspection Vehicle is procured through the Project. The bridge Inspection vehicle is a vital requirement for the Project due to the status of most of bridges in Sri Lanka. Bridge Inspection Vehicle is a special kind of truck with a bucket, which allows the inspector to reach the underneath of the bridge. This is unique and useful machinery for bridge inspection work.
Bridge maintenance work entails bridge inspection, bridge repair and maintenance. A series of maintenance work is called Bridge Maintenance Cycle.
After the collection of all data from the bridge, total management condition of the bridge should be assessed.
There are two methods of bridge management. They are Preventive Measure and Proactive Measure.
Proactive Measure means action triggers when the problem has been observed in a particular bridge.
Preventive measure means taking precautions at the beginning to avoid the occurrence of such unfavourable conditions.
Based on accurate inspection results, RDA should choose and decide the appropriate method of maintenance and management of bridges.
