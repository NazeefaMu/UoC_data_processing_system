Bricks hurled at express train, one injured

A passenger on the Meenakaya Express Train from Batticaloa to Colombo sustained minor injuries when unidentified persons hurled bricks at the train as it passed the Thiraimaduy area in Batticaloa on April 17.
The rain was delayed for awhile as it made a brief stopover due to the unexpected incident before recommencing its journey.
