Jewellery, donations stolen from kovil after New Year pooja

 
The Dickoya Kovil was robbed yesterday by unknown persons after a special pooja to seek blessings for the New Year.
Robbers had got away with the donation box and jewellery wrapped around the statue of Goddess ‘Sarasawathi’ during the pooja.
The robbery had taken place after the chief priest had gone to a nearby house to take a rest following the pooja. According to Police the Kovil’s CCTV camera has footage of a person removing the jewellery from the statue.
Investigations are on to identify the suspect.
