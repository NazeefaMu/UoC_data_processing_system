Halt this trend

A very interesting observation was made during a TV talk show the other day by onetime police spokesman, during the Rajapaksa regime, SP Prishantha Jayakody, who, however, was forced to quit his post for not carrying out an illegal order. The former cop said that the police today, for some reason or other, fail to act against unruly supporters of Joint Opposition politicians who are brought before courts or taken in for questioning, before investigation bodies. What is more, these elements are today even invading police headquarters and challenging the authority of the law.
The ex-police officer made special reference to former first son Namal Rajapaksa, who, he said, openly threatened a police officer when he (Namal) accompanied his mother Shiranthi to the CID the other day. He noted that Namal had in a threatening gesture bawled at the police officer that they (the Rajapaksas) will be in power, come December, and that all those police officers who were carrying out orders of the Yahapalanaya government, to persecute the Rajapaksas, will be “looked after” api thamuselawa balagannang.
The former police spokesman said the conclusion was inescapable that the law enforcement officers were harbouring fears that the Rajapaksas will be back in the saddle soon and were hesitant in taking action against those unruly elements accompanying a Rajapaksa family member to court houses or investigating bodies. He noted that the police looked on passively when the Rajapaksa supporters, transported from all parts of the country to express solidarity with the former First Lady, while taken to be grilled at the CID headquarters, behaved in an unruly manner hurling abuse at the law enforcement officers on duty. He said such daring was unthinkable under the former regime and wondered as to why things have taken such a turn, with no regard or respect shown to court houses or the law enforcement agencies. No doubt, a dangerous culture is taking shape, where, very soon the public will come to lose respect towards our courts and treat the premier law enforcement authority in the country with nonchalance leading to the emergence of lawlessness. The police should act firm and nip this trend in the bud before the practice catches on. No individual is bigger than the law, be it a former President or a First Lady, who on this occasion was hailed as Viharamahadevi by the boisterous crowd.
True, the police in recent times have been acting as passive spectators amid acts of defiance. Several court houses have been invaded and desecrated by those in robes, but the law has been helpless to prevent such happenings. Not just with the unruly supporters of the Joint Opposition politicians, the police have also been lenient even with regard to student protestors and other demonstrators. There was once a scene on TV showing a Bikkhu protestor tearing off a court order, banning a demonstration, from the hand of a police officer and stamping on it with his foot. No action was taken against the perpetrator while the court was being held in contempt. There had been numerous other instances where the police were virtually being overpowered by boisterous demonstrators, with little or no retaliation, whatsoever, and the offenders living to fight another day.
The situation can only get worse in the coming days, given the spate of court cases being lined up against the members of Joint Opposition and former VIPs. There are bound to be mass invasions of the court houses and investigation bodies, of the type witnessed the other day when Shiranthi Rajapaksa was brought to the CID headquarters. The police should be prepared to deal firmly with any eventuality, without permitting our court houses and law enforcement premises to be run roughshod over. What, pray, is the use of a police department when it’s own headquarters is lain siege over by the riffraff?
It is time that Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka issued specific instructions to the police to deal firmly with the miscreants who attempt to undermine state authority. Court houses and police headquarters should be declared out of bounds to crowds accompanying politicians. No mercy should be shown against those challenging the authority of the law. This should also include Bikkhus who stir up trouble. Like the former police spokesman observed in the talk show, Mahinda Rajapaksa is precluded from becoming President again. Hence there is no possibility of his staging a comeback to take to task police officers not to the liking of the Rajapaksas. The police should therefore act without fear in enforcing the law. In any event no police officer can be penalized for performing his legitimate duties, whether or not, Rajapaksa will return to power. They have the protection of the country’s legal system.
No person, however powerful, should be allowed to threaten a police officer. It is unclear as to why Namal Rajapaksa was allowed this luxury. The IGP should launch an inquiry in this regard and even take to task the officer concerned, for allowing the authority of the police to be challenged in this manner.
