Contempt of Court action filed against SLMC

The members of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) were yesterday noticed to appear in the Court of Appeal on November 16 to show cause as to why they should not be punished for contempt of Court for their failure to register a student of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe in terms of the Court of Appeal judgement.
Filing a contempt of court action against the SLMC, petitioner Dhilmi Kasunda Suriyarachchi, a MBBS graduate of SAITM  moved court that the members of SLMC be charged for committing the offences of contempt of court by willfully and contumaciously failing to provisionally register petitioner as a medical practitioner in terms of Section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance and thereby disobeying the order of Court of Appeal dated January 31, 2017.
The petitioner stated that to date the SLMC and its members have failed, neglected and refused to comply with the judgment of the Court of Appeal which was affirmed by the Supreme Court and provisionally register her as a medical practitioner.
On September 21, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31,2017 regarding a legal issue pertaining to the SAITM and ordered the SLMC to pay Rs.100,000 as legal cost to a petitioner Dhilmi Kasunda Suriyarachchi, a student of SAITM in Malabe for unnecessarily delaying and refusing to register her as a medical practitioner.
The Court of Appeal Bench comprised Justice (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara.
President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva with counsel Sugath Caldera, Shanaka Cooray and Niran Ankatel appeared for the petitioner.
