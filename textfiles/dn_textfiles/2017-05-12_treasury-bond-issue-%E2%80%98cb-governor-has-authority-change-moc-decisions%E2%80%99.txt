Treasury Bond Issue: ‘CB Governor has authority to change MOC decisions’

The Central Bank Governor has the authority to change decisions taken by the Market Operations Committee (MOC) and the Tender Board, Dr. Nandalaal Weerasinghe yesterday said.
One main allegation against former Governor Arjun Mahendran was that he had taken decisions regarding the Treasury bond issuance on February 27, 2015, which were contrary to what the Market Operations Committee and the Tender Board recommended regarding the matter.
Dr. Weerasinghe was testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue.
Central Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Weerasinghe answered in affirmative when legal counsel Chanaka de Silva asked him if it is his position that a Governor’s approval is sufficient to carry on with the decisions taken by the Market Operations Committee (MOC).
Dr. Weerasinghe said a Governor had the authority to agree with or change a decision taken by the Market Operations Committee.
Commissioner Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardena asked on the same note, could Dr. Weerasinghe say the same on the Tender Board, which is on a similar level of authority as the MOC does.
“So, does the Governor, whoever he is, have the authority to change a recommendation made by the Tender Board?” Justice Jayawardena asked, to which Dr. Weerasinghe answered in affirmative.
The answers came into being when legal counsel Chanaka de Silva questioned the decision making process of the MOC when Ajit Nivard Cabraal was the Governor of the Central Bank.
De Silva suggested that the MOC prior to 2015 has held Repo auctions without the approval of the Governor, to which Dr. Weerasinghe disagreed. He said all the decisions taken by the MOC came under the scrutiny of Governor Cabraal, De Silva pointed out the decisions of the MOC were only sent to the Governor after holding the auctions and not before.
At the same proceedings, when the Attorney General’s panel was questioning Dr. Weerasinghe regarding the February 27, 2015 MOC meeting, DG Weerasinghe expressed his concerns on former Governor Arjun Mahendran single handedly taking the decision to remove the 5 percent penal rate, which is argued as a decision that supports an alleged fraud.Dr. Weerasinghe refused to accept a statement made under oath by DG Ananda Silva to the first COPE subcommittee inquired into the Treasury bond issue. Legal Counsel Harsha Fernando quoting DG Ananda Silva read out a potion of a statement where DG Ananda Silva says, ‘All three of us took the decision to take the Rs.10.5 billion'.
Dr.Weerasinghe initially responding to the quote said DG Silva only mentions about a three individual and there is no names mentioned. Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardena pointed out it is very obvious according to the evidence given before the Commission, that the mentioned three individuals are former Governor Mahendran, DG Ananda Silva, and DG Nandalaal Weerasinghe.
Then, Dr. Weerasinghe said he does not agree with DG Ananda Silva’s statement and that the former Governor gave a firm direction regarding taking Rs. 10.5 billion.
