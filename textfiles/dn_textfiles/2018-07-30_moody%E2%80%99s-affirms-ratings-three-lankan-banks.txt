Moody’s affirms ratings of three Lankan banks

Moody’s Investors Service has affirmed the local currency deposit ratings of Bank of Ceylon (BOC), Hatton National Bank Ltd. (HNB) and Sampath Bank PLC at B1/NP.
The foreign currency issuer rating and deposit ratings of these banks are also affirmed at B1 and B2/NP respectively.
Moody’s has also affirmed the Baseline Credit Assessments (BCAs) and adjusted BCAs of these banks at b1. As a result, their local and foreign currencies Counterparty Risk Ratings (CRRs) are affirmed at Ba3/NP. Their Counterparty Risk Assessments (CRAs) are also affirmed at Ba3(cr)/NP(cr).
The rating outlooks of the banks, where applicable, are maintained at negative.
The rating action follows the affirmation of Sri Lanka’s B1 sovereign rating and negative outlook on July 26, 2018.
The decision to affirm the bank ratings reflects Moody’s affirmation of Sri Lanka’s sovereign rating and outlook, as well as the banks’ stable standalone credit profiles.
Moody’s believes that there is high level of dependency between the creditworthiness of rated Sri Lankan banks and the sovereign mainly because of (1) the high extent to which the banks’ businesses depend on macroeconomic and financial conditions in Sri Lanka, with a low level of cross-border diversification in their operations; and (2) their significant direct and indirect exposures to domestic sovereign debt relative to their capital bases.
Sri Lanka’s credit strength is also a key input in Moody’s deposit and issuer ratings for financial institutions in the country, because it affects Moody’s assessment of the government’s capacity to provide support in times of stress.
As such, the banks are not expected to be rated higher than the sovereign, and the outlook is usually in line with the sovereign.
The decision to affirm the sovereign rating at B1 reflects Sri Lanka’s progress in implementing the planned reform program, which entails fiscal consolidation and a build-up foreign exchange reserves buffers, ahead of the end of the IMF Extended Fund Facility program in June 2019, along with its moderate per capita income levels, and stronger institutions relative to many similarly-rated sovereigns.
