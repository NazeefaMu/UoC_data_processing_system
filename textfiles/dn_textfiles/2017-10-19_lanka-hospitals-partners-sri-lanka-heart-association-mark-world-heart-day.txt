The internationally accredited, multi award-winning healthcare provider Lanka Hospitals Corporation joined the ‘Heart Walk’ organized by Sri Lanka Heart Association, Held in commemoration of the World Heart Day on September 29 and the event is conducted annually in a bid to spread awareness on the importance of healthy living among the masses.

Under the main theme ‘Share the Power’, the Heart Walk focused on the importance of sharing healthy habits while inspiring millions of people around the world to be ‘heart healthy’.
A self-pledge was made to stop smoking, consume more fruits and vegetables, regularly check blood pressure, and lead an active lifestyle, the key determinants for reducing the risk of heart diseases.
People living in the contemporary times lead busy and stressful lives with minimal physical activity, and adopting unhealthy habits. As a result, an unprecedented rise in cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases have been observed in the world, as much as of Sri Lanka. Heart diseases are caused by a number of factors such as unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, smoking, alcohol abuse and drugs in addition to chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes and coronary artery diseases.
However, when it comes to detecting symptoms for heart diseases with precision, only a handful of hospitals in the country can facilitate such modern technology. Due to the lack of infrastructure and resources for conducting sophisticated tests, patients suspected or already suffering from heart ailments are compelled to remain in a long waiting list to undergo essential diagnostic procedures.
The Heart Centre of Lanka Hospital stakes pride in performing the highest number of heart surgeries and Cath Lab procedures in the private sector in Sri Lanka.It has also successfully completed more than 7500 heart surgeries, and is the only private hospital specialized in conducting Paediatric heart surgeries.
