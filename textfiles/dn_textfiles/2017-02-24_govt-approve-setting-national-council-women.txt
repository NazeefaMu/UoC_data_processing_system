Govt. to approve setting up of National Council on Women

As the government faces tough questions at the 66th session of the Committee on the Convention on Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) this week, Cabinet has taken steps to simultaneously approve the setting up of the National Commission on Women- decades after it was first proposed by CEDAW.
The government in the late 90s established the National Committee on Women as per the Women’s Charter based on CEDAW but it did not give it legal, administrative and financial authority to ensure that the state machinery implemented the rights of women as CEDAW had recommended. The Cabinet paper presented by Minister of Women and Child Affairs, Chandrani Bandara observed that an earlier Bill in January 2012 had been drafted to establish a commission but the Ministry of Finance and Planning at the time stated that, “as a strong administrative and legal framework is in effect in Sri Lanka for the empowerment of women and for the protection of the rights of women, there is no requirement for the establishment of a National Commission on Women and that it would be appropriate to strengthen the legal framework and the institutions which are confronted with difficult situations”
The institutions such as the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, Sri Lanka Women’s Bureau and the National Committee on Women which were the institutions with the mandate, however have no legal power to investigate or institute legal proceedings.
The government has not fared well at the present CEDAW Committee review with experts in Geneva questioning: the government’s slow progress in prosecuting cases of sexual violence perpetrated by the armed forces against women during and after the conflict, its delays in tackling the issue of gender based violence in homes, the need to expedite cases of sexual and gender based violence in courts, to review discriminatory provisions in personal laws and to amend the Land Ordinance to allow women to have access to resources.
