Outgoing and incoming SP Governors felicitated

Both, the ex-governor and the incumbent governor of the Southern Province Dr. Hema Kumara Nanayakkara and Marshal Perera, respectively, were felicitated at a ceremony held on Saturday at the Southern Province Governor’s Secretariat Auditorium, with the participation of a large gathering of regional politicians and state officials led by inter-religious dignitaries.
Dr. Nanayakkkara was recently sworn in as the Western Province Governor, while Marshal Perera was the Sabaragamuwa Province Governor before he was transferred to the Southern Province.
Among the religious dignitaries who took part on the occasion, were Western Province Mahanayaka Ven. Akuratiya Nanda Thera, Galle Korale Chief Judicial Sanghanayake Ven. Baddegama Devarakkitha Thera, Galle Kaluwella International Buddhist Centre Chief Incumbent Ven. Kanumuldeniye Chandawimala Nayaka Thera, Galle District Inter-Religious Peace Committee Foundation (GDIRPCF) Chairperson Ven. Kegalle Pannarama Thera, Co-Chairperson Rev. Fr. Nihal Nanayakkara, Thachchina Murthi Kurakal of the Kathiravelayutha Swami Temple in Kaluwella, Galle and Secretary of the Galle District Mawlavi Luthufi Jammiyathul Ulama.
Ex-SP Governor Dr. Nanayakkara, speaking on the occasion, said that during his tenure as the Southern Province Governor, he did not practise political favouritism in serving the people of the South.
“I always advocated and upheld the free will of all state officials and encouraged them to do the right thing. I had no excuses for unfair and illegal acts of state officials. As such, I was at times so strict that I was criticised by my rivals.
However, I am not affected by such allegations as I am an experienced politician,” Dr. Nanayakkkara said.
Southern Province Governor Marshall Perera, PC, in his speech, asserted that in accomplishing his obligations and responsibilities as governor, his priority would be the needs and aspirations of the general public of the province.
“I am ready to work with all people’s representatives cordially, as they are elected by the people of the province. The post of governor is not an ornament for me. I consider it a great responsibility and obligation to work for the good of the people of the South,” he said, "I will pay special attention to fulfilling the aspirations of the President in order to eliminate the poverty in the country.”
Acting Southern Province Chief Minister U. G. D. Ariyathilake, Southern Provincial Council Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame and Sabaragamuwa Province Chief Secretary Herath B. Kularathne also delivered speeches.
Southern Province Chief Secretary R. C. De Zoysa delivered the welcome address and Governor’s Secretary (Acting) W. M. S. Perera proposed the vote of thanks.
