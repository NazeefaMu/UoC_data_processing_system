Beauty guaranteed

Introducing internationally acclaimed benefits of anti-oxidant serum to the Sri Lankan market, the human wellness company, Mega LifeSciences offers VITAVITE – a triple action intensive brightening serum. VITAVITE is a holistic skin care agent that acts as a skin tone lightening and a skin whitening product that also adds brightness to the complexion.
Unlike conventional creams and lotions which possess lower absorption levels and penetrates only the foremost layer of the skin, VITAVITE is a serum that is made up of smaller molecular particles which assist the ingredients to travel deeper into the skin and nourish it from within.
“Anti oxidant serum is a popular product amongst the Hollywood and Bollywood elite as the advanced and inventive technology involved in the manufacturing process makes it one of the most effective skin care and anti aging products available across the world. While the general saying in the international beauty industry is that ‘it’s never too early to start a serum’, middle aged population in particular can seek the comprehensive benefits of anti oxidant serum. Serum reaches down to the deeper layers of one’s skin and nourishes it to fight off age spots, dark spots and helps to retain the radiance and suppleness of the skin” commented Praveen Viswakumaran – Country Manager – Sri Lanka for Mega LifeSciences.
VITAVITE is a serum that contains anti-oxidants, vitamin c, vitamin E as well as bisabolol, an essential oil derived from chamomile flowers. All these ingredients combine well and complement each other to produce a holistic, triple action result on the human skin. Anti oxidants battle the signs of skin aging by providing protection against inflammation and damaging free radicals Vitamin C reduces the excess concentration and deposition of the dark skin pigment called melanin on the skin and thereby lightens dark-spots, sun-spots, age-spots. In addition, vitamin C is a key component of collagen, the substance that binds the cells together and makes for healthy, vibrant and youthful looking skin. Vitamin E components present in VITAVITE are yet another potent anti-oxidant that protects the skin cells from free radical damage. Bisabolol reduces skin irritation and improves the condition of the skin.
“VITAVAITE packs all these benefits with the help of world class technology. We are privileged to be able to offer our clients here in Sri Lanka the same care that some of the world’s most beauty conscious industries trust,” commented Nuwan Wijekoon
