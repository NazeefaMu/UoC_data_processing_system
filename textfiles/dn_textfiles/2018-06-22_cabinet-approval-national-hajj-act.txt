Cabinet approval for National Hajj Act

A National Hajj Act to regulate the number of pilgrims to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage every year was approved by Cabinet on Tuesday.
Muslim Religious Affairs and Postal Services, Minister M.H.A Haleem submitting a Cabinet proposal on the matter had pointed out that 7,000-10,000 Muslims apply to the Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Department for the Hajj pilgrimage annually.
The annual quota given to Sri Lanka however was 3,400 and the selection of pilgrims and travel agents had become a contentious and difficult.
Thus, the Minister had proposed that an Act be introduced to regulate the above. Cabinet approval was granted to request the Legal Draftsman to draft the above Bill.
