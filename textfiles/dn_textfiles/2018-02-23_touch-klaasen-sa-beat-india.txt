Touch of Klaasen as SA beat India

CENTURION, Wednesday: For the second time in his short career, Heinrich Klaasen halted India's cricketing juggernaut as South Africa won the second Twenty20 international by six wickets at SuperSport Park on Wednesday.
Klaasen slammed seven sixes in hitting 69 off 30 balls as South Africa chased down a target of 189 with eight balls to spare.
The win squared the three-match series, taking it to a decider in Cape Town on Saturday.
Both teams had to contend with a wet ball, with drizzle falling during both innings.
Klaasen, who was man of the match when South Africa gained their only win in the one-day series, opened his score with two sixes and didn't look back. JP Duminy played an anchor role before finishing the match with two sixes in an innings of 64 not out off 40 balls.
Virat Kohli praised Manish Pandey and MS Dhoni, who hit 79 not out and 52 not out respectively in an unbeaten fifth wicket stand of 98 off 56 balls to get India to 188 for four after they had been struggling at 45 for three. – AFP
