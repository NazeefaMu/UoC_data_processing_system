New export-oriented cultivations to begin

Work on two cultivation zones earmarked for export-oriented crops by the Agriculture Ministry will be inaugurated by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera tomorrow. The two zones, identified under the Ministry's Api Wawalai-Api Kanne agricultural development project, would be used for the cultivation of pineapples and passion fruit, a press release by the Agriculture Ministry stated.
The release said that under the first stage of the project, which would be implemented by the Ministry's Agriculture Modernisation Unit, 37 acres in Mellagama, Medagama, would be set aside for pineapple cultivation; while another 37 acres in Pelawatte, Buttala, would be used for passion fruit cultivation. The 74 acres would be distributed among 74 farmers as one-acre allotments, and the Ministry would provide them with all the necessary facilities to support their activities.
The facilities provided free-of-charge would include pineapple plants, spray irrigation equipment, water pumps, plastic baskets, passion fruit plants, Galvanized Iron (GI) pipes, wire mesh and other equipment.
