Currency depreciation against US Dollar, common experience faced by many countries:PM
Currency depreciation against the US Dollar is a common experience faced by many countries including India and Pakistan, in recent times, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The PM made this observation in Parliament yesterday, in reply to concerns by the Joint Opposition that the Sri Lankan Rupee had hit a record low against the US Dollar.
“The US Dollar had gained strength in recent weeks, while the value of many currencies have depreciated as a result. The prices of goods had gone up in many countries. We can facilitate a separate debate on the issue if the Opposition requests,” the PM said.
The PM, replying to concerns by JO MP Bandula Gunawardena that one dollar was Rs 167.15 as at yesterday and that it impacts the country’s oil importation costs, said the Government has to tackle the problems created by global trends. He added that the benefits as well as disadvantages of fluctuations in the oil prices of the world market have to be endured.
“Even though the prices of oil had dropped in the world market, the then Government did not reduce oil prices in the local market and thus gained profits. We will not do that,” he added. In the meantime, Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage responding to a question by UNP MP Hesha Vithanage, said the fuel prices could increase again as per the price formula, but however, observed the prices would drop by February - March next year. She also said the Cabinet yesterday, discussed that the vendors who increase the prices of goods when fuel prices increase, do not reduce the prices when fuel prices come down. She said the Ministry would take measures to address this problem.
JVP perturbed over President’s handling of ‘Cashew nuts issue’
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake yesterday, expressed his disappointment over the way in which President Maithripala Sirisena handled the Sri Lankan Airlines issue over low quality cashew nuts served on flights. Rathnayake said that President Sirisena seemed to have forgotten that the responsibility of the National Carrier ultimately falls on him. MP Rathnayake also observed that the bad press cost the Airlines a billion dollar loss.
“The President should have summoned the Chairman of the Airlines and given directions to put a stop to the matter of concern, without announcing it publicly,” MP Rathnayake pointed out.
MP Rathnayake made these observations, joining the Second Reading of the Carriage by Air Bill and the Regulations under the Civil Aviation Act. MP Rathnayaka speaking of the Bandaranaike International Airport, pointed out to Transportation and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, that the Public Hearing System in the Airport complex did not operate properly. According to Rathnayaka, the hearing system is not audible to some parts of the complex. Rathnayake also requested the government to listen to the grievances pointed out by the Immigration and Emigration officers who recently called for trade union action.
MP Rathnayake further questioned as to what inquiry or action would be taken by the Transportation and Civil Aviation Ministry in reference to serious frauds and scams reported in the BIA. He also questioned as to what action had been taken based upon the recommendations forwarded by the Weliamuna Report which inquired into the alleged frauds taken place at Sri Lankan Airlines. Rathnayake also observed that somewhat closer to Rs. 4 MN was spent for the affairs of the Weliamuna Committee.
MP Rathnayake also requested the Minister to provide information to the Parliament Oversight Committee over the process of granting permission to private domestic flight services to operate in the country. He also said that the JVP is not against granting permission to domestic airline services.

MP Bimal Rathnayake raises concern over SLAS exam fraud
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake yesterday, raised concerns over a fraud that had allegedly taken place at the Sri Lanka Administrative Examination. MP Rathnayaka questioned whether the government had taken a decision to cancel or suspend the results of the SLAS examination due to the alleged fraud. If yes, he demanded that the Examination Department take the responsibility of letting such a fraud take place.
“59 persons were recently selected as the highest scorers in the examination. Their personal files had been brought in to the Public Administration Ministry. Meanwhile the government had said that an examination fraud had taken place.
However, there is a significant time span between the date of the examination and this allegation.
Usually, when such a fraud had been revealed, it happens immediately after the completion of an exam. But in this instant, they had even selected the best scorers when this fraud allegation had surfaced.
The government will have to give a clear answer to the public concerning this matter,” MP Bimal Rathnayake further said.

Palaly Airport would not be sold, but handed over to SLAF for developing it:Minister de Silva
Transportation and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva denied Joint Opposition allegations that Palaly Airport would be sold to India. Instead, the Minister said that the government after much deliberation, had decided to handover the responsibility of developing the Palaly Airport to Sri Lanka Air Force. The Civil Aviation Authority together with the Ceylon Tourism Fund, had allocated Rs. 750 MN and Rs. 1,000 MN for this development project, Minister de Silva pointed out.
“This government is very much concerned about the national security of the country. So, we contemplated much before deciding as to whom we would handover the responsibility of developing this airport. Following the development, Palaly Airport would be able to facilitate A320 aircraft. The airport will be able to facilitate international flights as well in the future,” the Minister observed. Minister de Silva also observed that there is a high demand for an airport to facilitate private jets, which would generate a significant revenue to the country.
The Minister made these observations, while commencing the Second Reading of the Carriage by Air Bill and the Regulations under the Civil Aviation Act.
Minister de Silva said that the Ministry would develop the Ratmalana Airport, Koggala and Digana domestic airports as well. He said that they are awaiting a feasibility report for the proposed domestic airport in Bandarawela.
Minster de Silva also said that the government is to call for tenders again with reference to the second runway of the Bandaranaike International Airport. He explained that initially, the government was to come into an agreement with JAICA to develop the said runway, but was not able to support the high expenses. Hence, the government would be calling for tenders again, he said. He said the government is still conducting a study on selecting the land to construct the runway. Minister de Silva observed that the government would take all necessary steps to cause minimum impact on the people living in that area.
The Minister also said that they are to install E-Gates at the BIA, as a solution to decrease the rush at the airport gates by 60%.
In response to certain concerns raised by several JO MPs, Minister de Silva said that no type of privatization would take place concerning any domestic airport.
He also denied allegations that Sri Lanka Flight Information would be privatized.
