Water purification centre to be set up in Kalpitiya

Underground water in Kalpitiya has been found to be contaminated with a high concentration of nitrogen, Minister of City Planning and Water Supply Rauff Hakeem said.
To provide water which is fit for consumption for residents of Kalpitiya, the Minister announced that a water purification centre is to be set up near the Navy camp for which funds have been earmarked and allocated.
“Steps are being taken to desalinate sea water in this area with the assistance of a firm from Germany to provide clean water for the people,” he said addressing a gathering in the area. The Minister added that the Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka will be invited to visit the area to make his own observations of the project.
The Minister also stated that since a large amount of electricity is required for desalination of sea water, steps have been taken to hold discussions with a German firm to generate more electricity through wind power.
Steps have also been taken to commence work on the Puttalam South Water Supply Project. This project will help to provide safe drinking water to other areas of Puttalam as well.
