Empowering Future  Women Leaders  project launched

The joint project Empowering Future Women Leaders was launched recently by the Colombo Plan and the Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association. This will be implemented as a pilot project and later to be expanded into a continuous program, implemented through the Girl Guide Association.
“Among all the projects that we have initiated currently, the Gender Affairs Program is committed to hear the voices of young girls and women all over the world” said Phan Kieu Thu, Secretary General, The Colombo Plan. She also said that all women should be trained well to become future leaders. All the girl guides selected for this program will be able to plan and implement projects.
The Colombo Plan Gender Affairs Program (CPGAP) was implemented in 2014 to expand the gender knowledge and programs in member countries. It supports them in conducting research, to increase the awareness on gender equality, gender development, women’s legal rights and gender issues among the developing member through workshops and trainings.
“This initiative is not limited to urbanize areas but also to rural areas,” Director, Gender Affairs Program, Tooba Mayel said.
The project “Empowering Future Women Leaders” trains, mentors and develops knowledge, skills and attitude of selected women leaders from the girl guides in schools. It aims at empowering 45 girl guides, five from each province through a 16 month time period. The Colombo Plan will be investing 11.6 million rupees on the program. The selections of the girls are not based on their awards and ranks but on their skills. They will also be trained to research and identify development needs and to initiate and implement projects at community level, in their respective provinces, focusing on women’s welfare and empowerment.
“Through this we are making the young women to contribute to the socio, economic and political development of women in Sri Lanka.”
Visakha Tillekeratne, Chief Commissioner, Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association said at the event. She further stated that these trained girls would form the Panel of Young Advisors of the Association in the future and the same program will be continued in the future as well.
