LTTE terrorism defeated militarily

Defence Secretary Maj. Gen. (Retd) Kamal Gunaratne said although the Sri Lankan military had completely defeated LTTE terrorism militarily 10-years ago, the challenge of defeating its separatist ideology still remained as some Tamil politicians were attempting to propagate it in the minds of Tamil people.He said aspirations of majority common Tamil people were different from the ideology of those politicians. “The innocent Tamil people who were battered under LTTE terrorism do not want a separate country but some Tamil politicians want devolution of power,” he said when he met the visiting Zambian Army Chief Lt. Gen. W.M Sikazwe at the Ministry, today.Referring to military expertise that used in the final war to end terrorism in the country, he said the LTTE terrorists were using asymmetric warfare tactics and the Sri Lankan military had to develop its own asymmetric warfare, which reduced the LTTE to merely an ideology after mid-2009.Maj. Gen. Gunaratne also highlighted the lasting relationship between the two nations which dates back to the heydays of the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM).
