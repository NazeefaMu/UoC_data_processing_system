Point of view 
Sri Lankan equities continued the positive momentum created last week as the benchmark index gained 38 points or 0.62% during the week.
The news of the potential return of the EPF to equities boosted sentiments last week and early this week. However, protests against the government by joint opposition created some political tension and the market also reacted with a 8 point loss on both Wednesday and Thursday.
Despite this, the Broad Market Index regained 108 points, recovering from its 17-month low of 6010.23 points last Tuesday. Consequently, YTD loss on ASPI reduced to 4.6% cf. 5.2% loss till last week. Despite the recovery in the Index, Activity levels remained dull throughout the week and the maximum daily turnover of Rs.0.4Bn (recorded on Monday) for the week was also lower than the YTD daily average turnover of Rs.0.8Bn. Following the protest, on Thursday daily turnover hit a 5-month low of Rs.0.1Bn since April this year.
Local HNI and Institutional investors remained inactive during the week as crossing for the week accounted for only 30% of weekly turnover (cf. 42% last week and YTD average of 40%). Lion Brewery dominated the bulk parcel purchases with 53% of the total crossing while HNB accounted for 22%. The foreign equity sell-off on the Colombo bourse meanwhile eased as foreign investors recorded a net foreign outflow of Rs.64Mn during the week cf. Rs.771Mn outflow last week. Markets in the week ahead are likely look for cues from economic and political development.
Domestic and global  pressures push LKR down 5% 
In its latest Sovereign Credit overview for the APAC region, Fitch Ratings noted that although Sri Lanka’s policy framework has improved and supports both macroeconomic stability and rising government revenues, high government debt and a challenging external debt servicing outlook remain risks to the sovereign.
Fitch noted that although Sri Lanka’s projected debt service payments are significant at $15Bn in 2019-2022, its foreign-exchange reserves as at Jun’18 was just $9.3Bn highlighting the country’s vulnerability to external financing pressures particularly in the context of rising US rates. Fitch estimates that GDP in 2018 will grow to just 3.8% before improving to 4.5% percent in 2019 while Government debt as a % of GDP should fall to 75.9% in 2019 (cf. 77.6% currently). The Agency noted however, that progress has been made on critical fiscal reforms (including the approval of an automatic fuel price mechanism effective May 2018) while steps have also been taken to introduce an automatic electricity pricing mechanism and establish a committee to develop a detailed restructuring plan for Sri Lankan Airlines.
However, it noted that ‘deteriorating policy coherence and credibility’ could compromise investor confidence or derail the IMF’s EFF program and thus lead to external funding stress.
The Group added however, that 1) further improvement in external finances (through higher non-debt-creating inflows or a reduction in external sovereign refinancing risks from improved liability management) and ii) continued improvement in public finances on the back of a credible medium-term fiscal strategy remain positive sensitivities for the Sovereign.
