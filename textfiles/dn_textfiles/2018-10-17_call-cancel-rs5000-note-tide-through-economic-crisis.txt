Call to cancel Rs.5,000 note to tide through economic crisis

The circulation of the Rs.5,000 note should be cancelled as for a solution to the economic crisis, said National Movement for Social Justice Convenor Prof. Sarath Wijesooriya yesterday.
He said that there is information on people who have so much of Rs.5000 notes in their possession that could fill even a container. He also said that there is information on several such people who store Rs. 5000 notes in gunny bags. He added this affects the country’s economy.
He made these observations yesterday during a press conference at the National Movement for Social Justice head office in Rajagiriya.
Prof.Wijesooriya added that the some politicians have stored money in such a disorganised manner according to the information received.
He also said during the period when N.M.Perera was the Finance Minister, he cancelled the Rs.50 and Rs.100 denomination notes which resulted hiding and storing such notes being exposed in public. He added that this strategy is more applicable today than then.
He also said that it was far better to cancel the mass scale events organised to build the image of politicians as a means of improving the economy rather than curbing imports.
