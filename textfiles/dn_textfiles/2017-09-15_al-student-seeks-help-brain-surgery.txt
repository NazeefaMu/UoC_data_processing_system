A/L student seeks help for brain surgery

G. G. Deshaja Devmith, a GCE Advanced Level student attending a national school in Colombo, is suffering from an acute brain problem due to the unnatural placement of some veins and needs urgent surgery to save his life according to Consultant Dr. Lakmali Paranahewa and Dr. Nihal Wijewardene.
The surgery is estimated to cost Rs. 1 million.
His father says being a heart patient himself, his family is not in a position to foot this bill due to their financial plight having to care for another sick child. Contributions can be remitted to A/c No. 70427162 at the Bank of Ceylon Borella branch or A/c 100610210625 at the National Savings Bank.
