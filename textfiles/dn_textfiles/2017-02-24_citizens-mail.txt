Citizens' Mail

Polythene free home
Very recently, we came across the news of an attempt of few, including responsible authorities to save a sick elephant who has consumed a deadly amount of polythene. It is one of thousands of innocent animals who become victims of our polythene usage. Unfortunately such incidents have become very common today with rampant littering and just a sigh relieves our shock of reading or watching it.
How long can we live with this numb respond and aren’t we all responsible authorities of this? Once there was an article with consequences of using plastics and how it affects one’s health. However, since we are aware of everything about polythene and its consequences, all such have become just articles/news while polythene is killing all people and animals gradually.
Considering this, I would like to make a suggestion. From today onwards, let’s stop buying plastic items which are poisonous to our mother earth. Let’s say NO to all the polythene bags offered by supermarkets even though they are free. Let’s find an alternative to pack our lunch without using so called lunch sheets. If one can stop at least that contribution to this, pollution will be reduced and it will matter a lot when it is considered as a ‘life’ and even your next generation will take the same path. Also, if you search carefully there is an eco-friendly alternative for everything made out of plastic/polythene and only your concern is needed to find them.
Your role in family can be the father, the breadwinner or the mother, the guiding star or the grandparent, the adviser or the elder child, the example to family or the youngest, the free bird and whoever you are in the family, be the first to initiate “Polythene/Plastic Free Home” concept in your home. Start it today, Mother Earth will appreciate it forever for saving her from this agony and you will be able to die without a guilty conscience one day.
