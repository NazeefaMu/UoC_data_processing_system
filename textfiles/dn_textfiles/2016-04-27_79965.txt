Unprecedented crowds expected at UNP May Day rally

 
 An unprecedented crowd is expected at the UNP May Day rally at Campbell Park, Education Minister and UNP Deputy General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, the minister said the May Day procession of the UNP would commence at Maradana at 11.00 a.m. and reach Campbell park via Punchi Borella and Borella.
He said as the President of the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya, he held discussions with the Trade Unions over the preparations of the May Day rally, adding that there was so much zeal and enthusiasm among them.
Kariyawasam said those against whom there are myriad charges of corruption, bribery and fraud were attempting to use the Kirulopane rally as cover for their wrong doings. He stressed the government would defeat their attempts.
