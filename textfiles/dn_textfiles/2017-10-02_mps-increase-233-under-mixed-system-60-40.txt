MPs to increase to 233 under mixed system of 60 to 40%

The Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system proposed in the interim report on constitutional reform will broaden the voters’ electoral choices, member of the panel of experts appointed by the Constitutional Assembly, legal counsel Suren Fernando said yesterday.
Fernando said with the introduction of the MMP system, each constituency will have a member of parliament. He was addressing a media at a press brief held yesterday at the Government Information Department on the interim report on constitutional reforms.
Counsel Fernando pointed out that the interim report proposes for a Mixed Member Propotional System, “which seeks to ensure proportionality of the end result (allocation of seats), while also having directly elected constituency seats.” In the meantime, the number of MPs will rise to 233 from the 225 at present.Fernando expressed concern over public opinion with regard to the increase and said the public may not receive the increase well.The said 233 seats will be distributed on a 60 to 40% ratio. Accordingly 140 seats (60%) will be distributed on the First Past the Post (FPP) and 93 seats (40%) as compensatory seats required to ensure that the final result reflects proportionality.
Speaking on voting, Fernando said each voter shall have two votes, both contained in a single sheet. Accordingly, one vote will be for the Single-Member Constituency candidate and the other vote for the party. Fernando alerted the neccessity of anti-manipulation rules in the backdrop of introducing the new system.
