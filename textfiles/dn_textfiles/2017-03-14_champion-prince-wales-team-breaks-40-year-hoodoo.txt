Champion Prince of Wales team breaks 40-year hoodoo

Prince of Wales won their Big Match in 1977 after 18 years and it also fell on their Centenary Year.
Pemlal Fernando was the captain of Prince of Wales and Walter Fernando captained St Sebastian’s. It is interesting to note that during this encounter both the captains fell for first ball ducks and to cap it all it was repeated in the second innings as well but not first ball ducks but ducks all the same. Probably these ducks came about due to big match nerves. All this took place not in a pond but on a cricket field.
The scores of that match were as follows, in the first innings Sebastianites were all out for 86 with Munaweera 2 for 27, Sripal Silva 3 for 36, Pemlal Fernando 1 for 10, Suresh de Silva 2 for 6, Professor Sandun Keerthichandra 1 for 2 taking the wickets.
In reply Prince of Wales got 118 for 9 declared; Jayantha Perera 17, Amal Silva 23, Wirantha Fernando 10, Munaweera 33 and Sripal Silva 28. Sebs in their second essay was all out for 70. Munaweera 3 for 15, Gamini Silva 1 for 9, Pemlal Fernando 1 for 14, Sripal Silva 1 for 9, Keerthi Chandra 3 for 4. The target for victory was 39 runs and the Cambrians got 41 for 2 sealing a famous victory. Jayanath Perera-11, Amal Silva 17 n.o. and Wirantha Fernando 13 n.o.
Harsha Peiris (1968-1981) an outstanding Cambrian and a key figure in the business circles of Sri Lanka was the host who felicitated this Cambrian Big Match winning team. Peiris stated that this team deserved recognition and honour as none of the teams played thereafter could achieve a Big Match victory, although the College has produced cricketers of repute. He also adds that this unique achievement was due not only to the talent that was available in this outfit but also to the team work, dedication and excellent captaincy by Pemlal Fernando. Incidentally this team also included Sudath Munaweera whose son Dilshan Munaweera is representing Sri Lanka at present.
Peiris pointed out that perseverance, dedication blended with hard work was the formulae for their success and it richly deserved recognition.
