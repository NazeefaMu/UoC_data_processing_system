Three Tamil Political Prisoners enter 2nd day of fasting

Three Tamil Political Prisoners (TPP) continued their fasting for the second day protesting against the moves to transfer their case to Courts in other districts.
Rasathurai Thiruvarul, 40, of Jaffna, Mathiyarasan Sulaksan, 30, from Karanavai, and Ganeshan Tharsan, 26, of Nawalappiddy are the Tamil political prisoners who had gone into fasting.
The case against them had been conducted with only their confessions as evidence. One of the cases filed with the confessions of the above TPPs were rejected by the Magistrate who heard the case.
In this context, this case also might meet the decision of the other case as hearing had been nearly completed.
If this case is transferred to other Courts, hearing will start from the beginning again, the TPPs say.
“It is like revenging by not punishing but letting to rot in detention,” they say.
