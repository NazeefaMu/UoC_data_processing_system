Development at what cost?

A number of Sri Lankans have become victims of development projects, harassed and their right to live freely been deprived, due to the unplanned development activities that are taking place in Sri Lanka, violating local environmental laws and international conventions.
Although Sri Lankan laws make it mandatory to carry out thorough environmental impact assessments (EIA), before granting approval for large scale development projects, and to adhere to them, it has become common place to use the EIA just as an instrument to get permission from authorities. Most of the EIAs contain false information and projects that are implemented based on these EIAs have devastating effects on communities who are affected by these developments. In the recent years we have seen a number of people, often from the most vulnerable communities, being displaced due to development projects. Why were they displaced? It was because the EIAs had not accounted for them, which in itself indicates that the EIA is faulty. Although the public consultation period (when the public can consult the EIA and object to aspects of it) is an important part of the EIA process, most of the recent EIAs skip this process and this has deprived the people the opportunity to protest or object to any aspects of the EIA.
Failed EIAs
People protesting against Uma Oya in Bandarawela.
Uma Oya multi-purpose development project, Colombo Port City Project, Mattala International Airport, extension of the Southern Expressway to Hambantota, Colombo - Kandy highway project and other irrigating schemes are all examples of projects that have been or will be implemented without a proper EIA. None of the EIAs prepared for these projects have gone through the public consultation process and this has ensured that those affected by these projects will have no forum to voice their opposition. Moreover since the EIAs have not taken into account the compensation that needs to be paid for those affected, a large number of victims have to languish in areas unsuitable for habitation for extended periods of time.
The development project that had displaced most people is the Uma Oya multi-purpose scheme. Due to this project 3,700 families from Welimada, Wellawaya, Ella, Bandarawela and Thanamalwila have been displaced due to the destruction of their farmland and the sources of water they used for farming.
Owners of the properties, (houses, land and farms), taken over by the government to implement this project have not yet been systematically (taking into consideration the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and Land Acquisition Act) compensated. Neither have they been given alternative agricultural lands.
What is most disturbing is the tendency of the state agencies to ignore the protests and lawsuits of those affected by the project. For example, the government has authorized the continuation of the Colombo Port City Project despite the fact that environmentalists have taken legal action against the construction of the Port City. Not only does this project adversely affect the environment but also it endangers the livelihoods of 15,000 fishermen.
Meanwhile settlements and large scale farming projects inside protected areas are continuing although a number of existing legislations explicitly forbid such activities. The creation of settlements in the North and the East, continuation of developmental activities according to the National Physical Plan, construction of expressways, irrigation schemes and handing over large swaths of forest lands to agro-companies like Dole Lanka are recent examples for this. This directly results in communities and small scale farmers losing their water sources that are vital for their survival.
The pressure applied by international financial institutions on the government to adhere to conditions agreed during taking of loans also has an adverse effect on the environment and the people’s rights. Recent moves by the government, to consider water as a commodity, to bring in legislations that turn water into an exchangeable product, to take away the seed rights of the farmers, destroy our seed sovereignty and to lease state land to private enterprises as a way of repaying loans, all indicate that the government is ever willing to follow the instruction of the international financial organisations.
In recent months we have seen the government leasing out forest land to Chinese Companies in exchange for the colossal debts taken from China by the previous administrations. Most of the leased land either belong to small scale farmers, around 1,500 farmers, or were the catchment areas for water sources they used for agriculture.
In other parts of the country the people face immense hardships due to factories that emit toxic waste and are responsible for noise pollution, mini hydro power projects, water bottling factories that tap into ground water and excessive excavation of soil, sand, pebbles, granite and gems.
These have directly affected the people’s ability to live a free and fulfilling life, damaged property and have taken away their water rights.
For example due to the illegal excavation of soil and pebbles a large number of wells have dried out and over 45 people have lost tier lives. The government also used excessive use of force against protestors against Venigros (Pvt) Ltd, whose activities have polluted the water sources of 14 villages, in Ratupaswala. Meanwhile Ambatale water purifying plant has been affected by the release of toxins by Coca Cola Company into Kelani River and the inaction of state agencies have deprived those living near the Kelani River of access to the river water.
We have also noted that there are over 150 mini hydro power projects in operation, without proper permission, and their existence has meant that over 5,000 families are deprived of the access to water and many others are facing the threat of landslides.
