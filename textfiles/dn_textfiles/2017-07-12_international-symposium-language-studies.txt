International Symposium on Language Studies

The English Language Teaching Unit of the University of Colombo will hold its second ‘International Symposium on Language Studies’ in September, this year. Planned under the theme ‘English as a Second Language: Knowledge, Learning and Production,’ this year’s symposium will be held for two full days on September 28 and 29, at the Arts Faculty of the Colombo University.
The rise of English as a global
lingua franca has encouraged more innovative, reflective, and rigorous research into the area of second-language studies in Sri Lanka. The symposium will be held in order to provide a forum for such research and create a discourse around it.
Proposals for papers, poster presentations and workshops are now open, and must be submitted before July 17 for consideration. Proposals can be made under the themes of Language and Education, Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, Innovation in Language Teaching, Translation Pedagogy and Language, and Power and Ideology. Proposals must be submitted in soft copy and hard copy format and a blind review process will be followed. For more information on the preparation guidelines for proposals and registration, please check the website http://arts.cmb.ac.lk/eltu/symposium2017 or email us at [email protected] or call 112 506 705.
All submissions will be acknowledged, and those accepted will be notified by August 7. The final date of registration for presenters will be September 20, while an early bird option is available for presenters and participants if they register before August 21. On-site registration is also available for participants.
The keynote speaker at the event will be Prof. Diane Larsen-Freeman from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA. Prof. Larsen-Freeman is interested in the process of second language development. She researches English grammar, and regards it not only as a set of structural patterns, but also a resource for making meaning and adapting language to the communicative context.
The plenary speakers will be English Language Teaching Centre Director Dr. Ramanujam Parthasarathy and Indian Gudlavalleru Engineering College Senior Professor of English Andhra Pradesh, and Open University of Sri Lanka Language Studies Department Senior Lecturer Dr. Hemamala Ratwatte. Dr Ramanujan’s fields of expertise include curriculum development, materials design, ELT research—especially classroom research—teacher education, and journalism. Dr. Ratwatte’s current research is on the psycholinguistic underpinnings of learning and teaching a second language in Sri Lanka, cognition and bilingualism, and teacher education.
