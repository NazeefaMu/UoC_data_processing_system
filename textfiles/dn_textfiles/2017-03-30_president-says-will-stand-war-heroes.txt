President says will stand by War Heroes

 
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday declared indemnity for War Heroes when he said that no War Hero would be subjected to any inquiry relating to abuse of human rights.
The President said he is not prepared to make any War Hero a suspect on the charges levelled against the Armed Forces and the government on the alleged violations of human rights during the war against terrorism.
He made this statement at the opening of the newly constructed three-storeyed building at the Defence Services School in Kurunegala. The President presented ‘Virisara’ beneficial cards to war heroes at the function held yesterday
The President, pointing out that it is the responsibility and duty of the government to protect the War Heroes who fought for the Motherland and assured that he would always fulfill his responsibility as the President and Defence Minister.
While there is an unprecedented goodwill for Sri Lanka among the international community today and many people question as to what benefit could be derived to the country from this, President Sirisena said. “We are utilising that goodwill and friendship for the protection of the honour and respect of our War Heroes,” he said.
The President added that the most powerful world leaders have assured him that they would stand by Sri Lanka’s independence and democracy as well as on issues pertaining to the members of Armed Forces.
The President emphasised that he would always take the fullest responsibility on behalf of any problem faced by the officers, staff members and war heroes who fought against the LTTE.
He said that however, he was unable to protect those found guilty of acts that are not connected to national security and those who are guilty of killing media persons or sportsmen.
When President Sirisena arrived at the Defence Services School in Kurunegala, he was warmly received by the students. The President unveiled the plaque to vest the new building with the students of the school and awarded prizes to outstanding students and those who excelled in Year 5 Scholarship Examination. Later he inspected the building and its facilities.
The Defence Services School also offers courses to teach English for the students selected to universities and vocational training. Ministers Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, S. B.
