DLB to hold Lagna Wasana draw on Wednesdays

It has been decided to hold the Lagna Wasana, a lotteries ticket of the Development Lotteries Board (DLB), which has won the attraction of the people, every Wednesday commencing from March.
Development Lotteries Board had to take this decision to hold a draw in addition to the draws on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday considering the great demand of this lottery, which presents super jackpots along with many cash prizes. Accordingly a draw will be held for Lagna Wasana instead of the Galaxy Star, which is held at present on Wednesdays.
DLD, the trust of excellence, always looks forward to present more opportunities for winners and therefore DLB invites people to purchase more Lagna Wasana tickets whilst being the partners of progress.
