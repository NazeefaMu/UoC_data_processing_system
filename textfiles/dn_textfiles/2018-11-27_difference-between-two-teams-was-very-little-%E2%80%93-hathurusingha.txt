‘England handled tough situations well’
Difference between the two teams was very little – Hathurusingha

Head coach Chandika Hathurusingha summarising the three-Test series against England which Sri Lanka lost 0-3 at the SSC grounds yesterday said that it was a very closely fought out series especially in the last two matches and fielding was one reason for his team to come second best.
“The difference between the two teams was very little. I thought England handled tough situations well. Ben Stokes was the difference in the last two games I thought when things were going our way,” said Hathurusingha. “He was brilliant with the ball and on the field. He took the game away from us in both games. When we were 173 for one he took the initiative away from us. Our fielding is another reason for us to come second best in this series.”
“We are doing lot of work with regards to fielding. When you are saying fielding, our catching has been a big concern. Certain individuals we have to keep an eye on. Certain individuals when they come to the national set up, they come two weeks before or one month before to us,” said Hathurusingha.
“Doing drastic changes in short course during a series is hard work. We need to put more emphasis on fielding. Especially when we select players we need to think about their fielding as well.”
On the batting front Hathurusingha said: “This is what we have got. Maturity comes with the continuous opportunities we give players. I am hoping that they learn quickly. On these kinds of surfaces it is tough for batsmen. Everyone who got a start got a decent score. Batting second and fourth is tough. While batting we took some wrong options and that is the reason why we lost. Had certain things gone our way, the result could have been different. Moving forward in conditions we will get, I am sure we will show more skill. This is the best batting unit we have.”
On the positive side Hathurusingha said, “I thought in these last two games, given our inexperienced attack due to the absence of Rangana (Herath), we competed well. The big difference is the three hundreds they scored and no hundreds from us. The toss has got a lot to do as well when you are playing on these types of wickets. Of course we should have used the DRS better on hindsight. But all in all, England played better.”
WE HAD ALL BASES COVERED – ROOT
England’s winning captain Joe Root said the beauty of his squad was that they had all bases covered which contributed to their 3-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka in the three-Test series that ended at the SSC grounds yesterday.
“Everyone was in a position where they were fit and raring to go. Whatever team we went with would have given us a great opportunity but those three spinners have dovetailed extremely well, built pressure and not necessarily taken their rewards,” said Root in praise of his three spinners Moin Ali, Jack Leach and Adil Rashid who played a dominant role in the series capturing a total of 48 wickets out of 56 that fell to bowlers.
“Moeen in particular has really stepped up as a senior bowler and led the way. He’s been quite vocal at times on plans and trying to get the best out of the other two guys and he deserved a lot of credit,” said Root.
“The most enjoyable thing about it is that it has been a complete squad effort. I said at the start that it was going to be the case and whether it is guys on their first tour in these conditions or the senior players they have really taken that tag and stepped to set an example for the young guys.
Expressing the feeling of winning a Test series in the subcontinent Root said: “It felt like relief, the way it was going towards the back end. It’s been a thoroughly enjoyable trip from start to finish. The way the group has approached it in general, we’ve done things differently, everyone has bought into that and if they hadn’t we wouldn’t be sitting here 3-0 up.
“From start to finish we’ve planned very well, we’ve obviously had the experience of Trevor (Bayliss) and Farby (Farbrace) in these conditions which was very important and a great learner for us. We found a formula to be successful very early on. Then with the strength of the squad we had so many different options depending on the conditions.”
