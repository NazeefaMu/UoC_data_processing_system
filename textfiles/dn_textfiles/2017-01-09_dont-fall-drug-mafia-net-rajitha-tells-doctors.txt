Don't fall to drug mafia net, Rajitha tells doctors

Doctors should not take money from the drug mafia which is not suitable for their professional ethics, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Dr. Senaratne said only one doctor attached to Maharagama Cancer Hospital is not using the cancer drug imported from Russia, while all other doctors use it without any problem.
"Doctors cannot reject drugs given to patients through free health service," he said at a ceremony at the Beruwala Divisional Secretariat recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the drugs used before introducing the Russian made drug, cost Rs. 280,000 and the drug imported from Russia cost only Rs. 130,000.
"The drug was imported after analyzing their quality by qualified pharmacologists. Two more cancer drugs are to be imported from India," he said.
Doctors cannot reject drugs imported by the government because they take money from the drug mafia. The CID is conducting an investigation in connection with 14 doctors from the Maharagama Cancer Hospital going to Denmark together using money obtained from a drug company, the minister said.
