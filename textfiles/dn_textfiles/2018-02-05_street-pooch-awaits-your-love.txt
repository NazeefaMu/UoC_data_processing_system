A street pooch awaits your love!

Sharing your home with a pooch from the street will reward you with a lifetime of unconditional love and loyalty. If you find a puppy or street dog and you want to take it into your home, make sure you take the animal to the nearest vet to ensure it is healthy and that all vaccinations needed are given.
You can also attend one of Embark’s Adoption Days, held multiple times a month, to adopt a puppy or adult pooch that has been treated, vaccinated, and is ready to find a forever home. It is important to understand the responsibility and commitment that comes with caring for street dog. They are born with the same right to live a life of freedom, safety and happiness as we are. They must not be caged, chained or isolated for prolonged periods. They should be given regular meals, clean water and medical care whenever necessary. They are not accessories, and are entitled to just as much love and compassion as family members.
When you choose to buy a dog from a breeder, instead of adopting, a homeless street pooch is deprived of the opportunity to find a loving home. Breeding for profit is a cruel and unnecessary industry that is growing day by day, which puts many pedigree dogs in danger of being stolen from their homes. Dogs are forced to live in cages as profit machines, in isolated conditions, for your purchase.Please take the time to learn more about the breeding industry in Sri Lanka.
If you would like to adopt your very own Sri Lankan street dog, you are welcome to drop by our next Adoption Day event at Embark Headquarters on 27 January at No. 73, Jawatta Road, Colombo 05 or call us at 0777 740 129.
