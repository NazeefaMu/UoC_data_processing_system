More teacher transfers at month end, says ministry

A batch of 5,473 teachers attached to Grades 6–11 in the same school for over 10 years will be given transfers to other schools at the end of this month, under the third stage of the teacher transfer programme, the Education Ministry said yesterday.
The ministry in a press release said nearly 38,000 teachers are presently attached to 353 national schools and nearly one-third of them, amounting to more than 12,000, have been serving in the same school for more than 10 years.
Although a transfer scheme operated for public servants every three or fire years, a large number of teachers suffered inconvenience due to the non-implementation of a teacher transfer scheme in respect of national schools.
As such, the scheme has been re-activated on the directions of Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and under the transfer scheme for teachers in Grades 6–11, a batch of 4,455 Sinhala-medium teachers and 1,018 Tamil–medium teachers will be subjected to transfers.
They will receive the transfer letters through their principals at the end of this month.
The release said that under the first stage of the transfer scheme implemented at the end of last year, 2,590 teachers in Advanced Level classes were transferred to other national schools; under the second stage implemented at the beginning of the year, 760 out of 1,441 teachers who had completed more than 10 years in the same station, were transferred.
