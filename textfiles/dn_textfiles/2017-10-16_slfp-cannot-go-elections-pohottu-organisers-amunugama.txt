SLFP cannot go for elections with Pohottu organisers: Amunugama

Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugma said the SLFP decided to remove all electoral organisers who were half-heartedly with the party and replace them with new party organisers since the party could not go for an election with people who promote the pohottu party while remaining as SLFP electoral organisers.
Dr. Amunugama was addressing the gathering at the Kandy City Centre on October 14 after opening the first Sri Lankan branch of the Japan's 'Miniso' Institution.
"The Local Government elections are to be held in January next year and the responsibility of preparing nomination lists are vested in the electoral organisers. Only those who are with the party by heart and soul can do the needful but not those who are in toe with a rival party," he said.
Dr. Amunugama said that even party seniors could not be kept as electoral organisers if they promoted rival parties because it was most unwise to keep them in the party any more.
He said foreign investments had begun to flow into the country and the investment in the Hambantota Port alone amounted to Rs. 1.2 billion.
The Minister medium and small scale investors should be encouraged to invest in Sri Lanka and steps would be taken in this regard with the forthcoming budget.
Dr. Amunugama said the Government had to bear a massive debt burden due to an order for eight new aircraft placed during the previous regime without proper planning.
The SriLankan Airlines had suffered because of the certain ill-advised decisions taken by a close relative of the former President who was at the helm of the SriLankan Airlines in the past.
Amunugama said the proposed central expressway would bring massive economic development to the Kandy region by linking it with Colombo.
"People should clamour for the expressway by calling on the Government to speed up the project," he said.
Kandy City Centre Managing Director Thusitha Wijesena, BOI Chairman Dumindra Ratnayake, and a delegation of the Miniso Institute led by its Chief Executive Tina Chen were present.
