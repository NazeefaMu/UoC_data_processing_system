FEATURE: Long march to freedom

Sri Lanka gained independence from the British on February 4, 1948, after nearly 150 years of British rule. That is a fact that everyone knows, but most people tend to forget that the country was subjected to colonial rule for a much longer period. Two other colonial powers held sway over various parts of the country from 1505 onwards - the Portuguese and the Dutch. Like the British, they too were naval powers that went in search of trading posts and colonies. Although Spain and France were also in this business, they did not turn their attention to Sri Lanka all that much.
Sri Lanka's strategic position attracted many invading powers - our history is replete with examples of armies coming from India and occupying various parts of the country in ancient times. Long before the European powers came, Sri Lanka was known for the spice trade and featured on the maritime Silk Route. Indian, Malay, Arabic and Chinese maritime traders did a brisk trade in and around Sri Lanka.
Enchanted
Explorers from Marco Polo to Fa Hsien have detailed how they were enchanted by this little island in the Indian Ocean, called Serendib and Zeylan. What attracted the country to European naval powers later was its prime location, ideal for a trading and defensive post. This is how Colombo evolved as a prime maritime hub in the world in around 500 years.
Sri Lanka's tryst with colonialism began in 1505 with the arrival of the Portuguese, who introduced Christianity to the island. The locals were enamored with Portuguese names, which survive to this day, from de Silva to Fernando. A lot of Portuguese words entered the vernacular languages, from Paan (bread) to Camisa (Shirt) to Vidro (Veeduru, Glass). These are remnants of the Portuguese rule in Sri Lanka which lasted from (or Ceylon as it was called prior to becoming a Republic in 1972).
The first Portuguese sailor to set foot in Sri Lanka was Laurenco de Almeida (1505) who has been immortalized in a local “baila” song as a “good hearted sailor”. Another legend has given rise to the pithy Sinhala proverb “Parangiya Kotte Giya Wagey” (How the Portuguese went to Kotte) which refers to the circuitous route taken by the King's men to take a Portuguese delegation to Kotte, the local seat of power. Although the Portuguese sent reinforcements from time to time to strengthen their hold on the island, they could not gain control of the entire island including Kandy. Nevertheless, they held important maritime cities such as Colombo, Negombo, Kalutara and Galle.
Dutch rule
The Dutch entered the island in 1603. Dutch Admiral Joris van Spilbergen arrived in Ceylon with three ships after a 12-month voyage. Their first port of call was Batticaloa, which the Portuguese never occupied and they established a link to the King who was based in Kandy. However the Portuguese managed to take over Kandy in 1611 and Trincomalee in 1624, followed by Badulla in 1630 which was completely destroyed. They were heavily outnumbered by the Sinhalese Army on the return journey and suffered a massive defeat. The Portuguese rule in Sri Lanka came to an end in 1658, but many of their customs, religious practices and words remain in the island. There is a very small community that speaks a version of Portuguese Creole, which is distinct from the island's two main languages.
The Dutch period in Sri Lanka began in 1658 and lasted till 1796, although there was a certain period in the initial stages when both had a presence in the island. Just like the Portuguese, the Dutch left a lasting impression on the island, from the Burgher community to the Roman Dutch Law. The Dutch were also known to be much more accommodating than the Portuguese, who had ransacked many villages and towns. Many structures they built still stand intact or in parts. The Dutch had a reputation for being traders and in fact, their main trading arm was the Dutch East India Company. The Kandyan King signed a treaty with the Dutch to evict the Portuguese from the island in 1638 and the Dutch captured Colombo in 1656. Note that these events must be seen in a wider context, since all the naval powers were trying to exert their influence over the entire Asian region. For example, the Dutch were also having a foothold in India and Indonesia at the same time.
British dominance
At this time, the British were looking to establish their dominance in the region and Ceylon was a big prize. The Dutch were mired in military and political problems in Europe, which paved the way for Britain to enter Sri Lanka peacefully. Although Britain entered Sri Lanka in 1796, they took control of the entire island only on March 2, 1815. The British also agreed to protect Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the local population.
The British left their mark on Sri Lanka, developing a network of roads and railway lines, introducing tea and coffee plantations and also much of the backbone of the legal, administrative, armed forces, Police, educational and even political systems (Westminster) now in use. Their biggest legacies were the English language, now the country's third or link language and cricket, the sport that has become Sri Lanka's national passion.
They also brought in many British banks and other companies, some of which exist to this day. British Governors from Frederick North to Sir Henry Monck Mason Moore ruled the country until independence. (They still live on in road and place names in Colombo, such as Barnes Place, Maitland Crescent, Torrington Avenue, Campbell Park, Horton Place, Ward Place, Anderson Lane, Gregory's Road, Longden Place, Havelock Place, Manning Town etc)
Many rebellions took place against British rule and some of the local heroes were branded as traitors until very recently, when President Maithripala Sirisena proclaimed them as heroes. There was a massive collective effort to regain independence in line with the independence struggles of neighbouring countries such as India. This newspaper too was in the forefront of the independence struggle, fulfilling the vision of its owner D.R. Wijewardene who campaigned fearlessly for independence. Many heroes sacrificed their lives to regain our independence which we achieved in 1948. Today, Sri Lanka is a sovereign republic that has seen 69 years of freedom.
