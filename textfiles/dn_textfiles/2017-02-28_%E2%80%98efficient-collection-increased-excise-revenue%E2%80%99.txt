‘Efficient collection increased excise revenue’

The main reason behind the increase in excise revenue during the past two years was rigorous and efficient conduct in collecting excise taxes, Presidential Task Force for Drug Prevention Project Director Dr. Samantha Kithalawaarchchi said.
Speaking at a media briefing at the Government’s Information Department yesterday, he said rise in alcohol and cigarettes prices also had directly increased excise revenue between 2015 to 2016. Therefore, saying that rise in excise revenue is a result of the increased consumption of addictive drugs is false, he said.
Speaking at the press conference, Colombo Hindu College Principal T. P. Parameshwaran said the College and Jaffna Hindu College would organise big matches from March 2 to 4 to promote sports programmes free from addictive drugs.
A cricket tournament, a football tournament and a debating competition with the Presidential Task Force for Drug Prevention will be held in this regard, Parameshwaran added.
Hindu College Old Boys’ Association (OBA) Vice President Dr. Prasanna Warun said a thematic walk would be held prior to the cricket encounter instead of a parade to promote the big match free from alcohol and drugs with the participation of Cricket World Cup 1997 champions.
Dr. Warun said schools in Colombo would be invited to join them to increase ethnic and religious diversity of the participants.
A hashtag will be introduced as ‘Do Sports Not Drugs’ along with the thematic walk, he added.
“Sports is a main mechanism to divert children’s attention from addictive drugs and big matches can be used as a platform to say ‘no’ to drugs. We will introduce a new big match culture,” he said.
