Warrant of arrest issued for Grace Mugabe

South Africa issued an arrest warrant for Zimbabwe’s former first lady Grace Mugabe over an alleged assault of a model in Johannesburg last year, a police spokesman said on Wednesday…After the alleged beating with an electric cable came to light in August 2017, the South African government granted Grace Mugabe diplomatic immunity.That immunity was overturned by a South African court this year after the alleged victim, Gabriella Engels, challenged the decision.“I can confirm that a warrant for the arrest of Grace Mugabe was issued last Thursday,” South African Police Service spokesman Vishnu Naidoo said, adding police were seeking Interpol’s help to enforce it.”The incident took place at a hotel in the affluent Sandton neighbourhood when Engels was with two of Mugabe’s sons, according to the model. Grace Mugabe arrived and lashed out at her without reason, she said.
