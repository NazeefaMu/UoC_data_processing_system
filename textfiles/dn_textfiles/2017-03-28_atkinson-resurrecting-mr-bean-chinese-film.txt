Atkinson resurrecting Mr Bean in Chinese film

Rowan Atkinson has proved to fans he’s alive and well hours after being the victim of a sick death hoax.
The actor, 62, is currently in China for the premiere of film Top Funny Comedian which is only being released in the country and sees Rowan playing his infamous Mr Bean role.
While he happily got into character and posed for cameras, elsewhere a fake Twitter account had been set up to look like Fox News was spreading that he had been killed in a car crash.
The tweet – which got his age wrong, read: “FOX BREAKING NEWS : Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) died at 58 after car accident. -March 18, 2017.”
It has since been shared and liked more than 300,000 times.
However website Hoax Alert was soon hot and the case and quickly debunked the rumour.
They stated: “Celebrity death hoaxes are nothing new on the internet yet this one is special in that it managed to be liked/shared over 300,000 times in a short period of time by employing some devious technical tricks.
“The first one is the video player embedded in the site. At first sight this is just a normal YouTube video from a Fox News broadcast (which is about a death but not about Rowan Atkinson).”
The report adds that the scammers were likely to have made money from the cruel prank.
“The scammers are making money by sometimes not showing the video or the share dialog when visitors click but instead redirecting them to pages full of deceptive ads and popups. “It is unclear at this time how much they walked away with but it is probably a substantial sum by now based on the amounts of likes and shares we have been seeing.”
However many fans still took to Twitter to express their sadness.
One wrote: “Rowan Atkinson has died. He’s most known for Mr Bean but Blackadder will always be my favorite. He was always fun to watch. RIP”
And another added: “Absolutely crushed to hear about Rowan Atkinson. One of the few comedians that illicited the same uproarious response from me my whole life” The Sun
