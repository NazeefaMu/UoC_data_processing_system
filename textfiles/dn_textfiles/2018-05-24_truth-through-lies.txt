Truth through Lies

When it comes to the belief writers are neurotic, shy individuals who have precious little to say except when they are writing their amazing masterpieces, Nobel laureate John Coetzee fits the bill perfectly. He is known to be a recluse who avoids publicity so much so that he did not even show up to collect either of his two Booker Awards. As South African writer Rian Malan says
“Coetzee is a man of almost monkish self-discipline and dedication. He does not drink, smoke, or eat meat. He cycles vast distances to keep fit and spends at least an hour at his writing-desk each morning, seven days a week. A colleague who has worked with him for more than a decade claims to have seen him laugh just once. An acquaintance has attended several dinner parties where Coetzee has uttered not a single word.”
He did turn up, though, to receive the Nobel Prize in 2003. Not to make a speech but to read out a short story, a strange, allusive tale called “He and His Man”, seemingly about Robinson Crusoe and Daniel Defoe, but really about doubles, about a character and his creator, a recluse and his busy, worldly reflection; how they were close, yet could never meet. Critics later observed Coetzee’s Nobel performance itself was a sort of doubling. “Here you see J.M Coetzee, the silver-haired old fellow who joins you for dinner,” it seemed to say. “Yet that isn’t the Coetzee you are giving a prize to; you are giving a prize to Coetzee the writer, who perforce cannot be here. I shall read you some of his work.”
This revelation brings to mind Dostoyevsky’s short novel ‘The Double’, where a clerk finds himself edged out of society by another man identical to him in every aspect except that he is popular and clubbable. Here’s the writer standing back and watching the grotesque spectacle of himself being successful in public, him and yet not him. In other words, here’s Coetzee.
Quotable Quotesfrom J.M Coetzee   1. Live like a hero. That’s  what the classics teach  us. Be a main character.  Otherwise what is  life for?”   2. “Pain is truth; all else  is subject to doubt.”    3. “Our lies reveal as much   about us as our truths”  4. “We must cultivate, all   of us, a certain ignorance,   a certain blindness, or   society will not be  tolerable.”  5. “I am not the we of  anyone”     
Coetzee the writer. Coetzee who decided to become an artist when he was 15. As he reveals in one of his essays in Stranger Shores, one afternoon when he was moping around his backyard in suburban Cape Town, he suddenly heard the sound of music coming from the next house. It was Bach, and he was transfixed. After this, he writes, ‘‘everything changed’: ‘‘The revelation in the garden was a key event in my formation’. This was the first time he had felt the impact of great art.
We next see him in ‘Youth’’ where he describes a young man desperately trying to become a writer, even though there is no evidence that he has any literary talent. In fact, the protagonist (Coetzee himself and no other) spends the entire volume, which ends when he’s roughly 23, at a creative and psychological impasse. The book opens with Coetzee at a university in Cape Town, but within 40 pages he has decamped for England. The vision of life in the metropolis, of the romance and exaltation of art, pulls him to London. Needing a job, and having a degree in mathematics as well as English, he finds a position at I.B.M. The work is deadening, but he has other things on his mind: becoming a poet and finding his true love - two elusive goals. He fails in both, is tormented by self-loathing, and everywhere he looks sees the sophisticated beauties of London ignoring him, its bohemians disdaining him, the life he dreams of out of reach. He fantasizes about passing as English but knows he never will, yet is determined to sever all ties with South Africa, the homeland he disdains.
But he seems to realize art is born of suffering, even madness; the true artist must expect to endure ‘‘exile, obscure labor and obloquy.’’ And there is one consolation: ‘‘Because they are creators, artists possess the secret of love,’’ and women, wanting to be brushed by ‘‘the sacred fire,’’ instinctively recognize this. The young Coetzee’s models at this point are not writers whose work he wishes to learn from so much as artists whose life he hopes to emulate: above all, Pound, for his proud endurance of calumny and exile, and Picasso, for his legendary success with women.
Only three moments, in ‘Youth’, hint at his achievements to come. Lying in a London park, he is overcome by an ecstatic sense of unity with nature, foretelling the exquisite sensitivity to landscape that marks his novels. Procrastinating in the British Museum, he begins perusing books on South African history and is soon contemplating a pseudohistory of the early-19th-century frontier, clearly the genesis of the extraordinary second part of ‘‘Dusklands,’’ his first published work. Finally, in a used bookstore, he discovers Beckett’s fiction, undoubtedly the model for his own mercilessly spare style and characteristic focus on the consciousness of a single, isolated character - an influence most evident in his second work, ‘‘In the Heart of the Country.’’
Coetzee built his literary reputation on the eight novels he published between 1974 and 1999. None was less than unusually good, say the critics, but three in particular have carried his work into the realm of lasting things. The first was Waiting for the Barbarians, a parable about the use of falsely imagined enemies for social control. Substitute “terrorists” for “barbarians” and you have a history of Britain and America since 2001. (Coetzee’s book came out in 1980.)It was for his fourth novel ‘Life and Times of Michael K’ that he won the Booker. A third masterwork, Disgrace, won him the second Booker.
In a rare interview he gave David Attwell in 1994 Coetzee reveals that “all writing is autobiography: everything that you write, including criticism and fiction, writes you as you write it.” He continues by saying that when you tell the story of your life, you do so “from a reservoir of memories,” selecting those bits of narrative that get to a plausible truth. In his eyes, there’s little difference between autobiography and fiction. Both forms press forward to achieve what he calls a “higher truth” by choosing facts that support an “evolving purpose.” More recently, in his current book, The Good Story (2015), he takes this view a step further by saying when two people tell each other in conversation their life stories, it is little more than an exchange of fiction, it is in fact, the truth, through lies.
This could be why, unlike other writers, Coetzee uses his work as scathing self-assessments. As critic Nick Romeo points out “Coetzee has articulated so many harsh criticisms of himself and his fiction within his own novels that it sometimes seems the only thing left for critics to do is praise him. He’s already got the negatives covered.”
Yet, what is surprising is that there is some sly humour too, in Coetzee’s work. Young John, in ‘Summertime’, for instance, meets a school friend, who he remembers as not being very bright, although now he appears to be a very big person in marketing. ‘‘What does this suggest about the workings of the world?’’ John muses. ‘‘What it seems most obviously to suggest is that the path that leads through Latin and algebra is not the path to material success. But it may suggest much more: that understanding things is a waste of time.’’
Who would dare disagree with that last line?
