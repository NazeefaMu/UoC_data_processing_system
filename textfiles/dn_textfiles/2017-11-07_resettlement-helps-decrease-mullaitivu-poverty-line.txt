Resettlement helps decrease Mullaitivu poverty line

Poverty of the Northern Province is comparatively higher than other provinces of the island due to the war which lasted for three decades. After the end of the war in 2009, numerous development projects were implemented by the government to uplift the lives of war affected people in the North and East of the country, said Minister of Prisons Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, D.M. Swaminathan.
After 2015, the present government initiated sustainable development projects to uplift the lives of people in the North and East. As a result of the projects which were initiated by the Ministry of Resettlement, Mullaitivu Secretariat indicators shows the poverty line of the Mullaitivu district had decreased from 24.5 percent in 2016 to 12.2 percent in 2017.
Participating in a livelihood distribution programme in the Mullaitivu district, Minister D M Swaminathan said, “This is a rapid development for Mullaitivu district and my vision is to minimize the entire poverty line of the Northern Province by 2019. We have resettled over 75,000 families in the Mullaitivu district and over 80 percent of the lands have been released to the relevant land owners affected by the war. Hundred percent of the private lands in the Mullaitivu district will be released by 2018 and I am certain that I can minimize the poverty line up to eight percent in the Mullaitivu district within the next year,” he said.
He further explained that before 2020 he will be releasing all the private lands in the Northern province and uplifting the people’s lives to the maximum level. The minister said this at a function held at the Mullaitivu district Secretariat Office last Friday evening to distribute self-employment equipment for 600 war affected families and Rs. 60 million million was distributed among them to develop their self employment businesses.
