Dhamma education important- President

President Maithripala Sirisena says an appropriate programme should be implemented to prevent the conducting of private tuition classes on Poya days and Sundays.This should be done with the aim of building a better future generation by providing them with a Dhamma education.
The President further said that to achieve this goal what is more important is that everyone fulfills their respective duties with an understanding of creating a disciplined society rather than constitutional efforts.
President Sirisena made these remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Secretariat on Tuesday about the steps that should be taken to encourage school children to attend Sunday Dhamma school instead of private tuition classes.
President Sirisena said the Maha Sangha, other religious leaders and intellectuals made representations to him regarding this matter for quite some time.
The President said that eventhough many programmes have been implemented at Provincial Council level regarding conducting private tuition classes on Sundays, there is a need for an island wide common programme in this regard.
President Sirisena said that he would talks with the teachers who conduct tuition classes on Sundays, and expects to make a strong request to them in this regard.
Thereafter, the President stated that he would look into the possibility of imposing statutory rules in relation to making Dhamma education compulsory.
Meanwhile, the President Sirisena who pointed out the importance of implementing different programmes which motivate the children in gaining knowledge on religion, guided the officers about the programmes to be conducted to develop the quality of religious education and improve the facilities provided to Daham Pasal. During this meeting, discussions were held on the programmes to be conducted to motivate Daham Pasal teachers.
President Sirisena said it is religious education that nurtures a person with knowledge and discipline.
The President said it is due to the lack of religious knowledge by the young generation that creates a malefic society filled with violence and negligence of parents and elders.
The Mahasangha, who made their representations said that eventhough this topic was discussed with government officials for more than four or five decades, nobody intervened on this matter. The Mahasangha appreciated the effort and concern of President Sirisena as a leader who wants to build a disciplined society with morals and ethics.
