Politicos accountable for inter union rivalry - Railway TUs

The inter-union rivalry and rancour among Railway Department Trade Unions was fanned by politicians who held the transport portfolio in the past, the joint council of Railway Trade Unions stated in a press release yesterday. The council said that although Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva recently claimed that union rivalry had prevented him from filling vacancies in the Railway Department, all former Transport Ministers, including Minister de Silva were to be blamed for creating rivalry and fanning it for their personal political gain.
Administration in the Railway Department had been messed up due to political interference.
The General Manager of Railways was in a helpless situation unable to enroll even a casual employee to the department.
The release said former Minister Kumara Welgama made political recruitments to the department from the Kalutara district only through the consultation of the Sri Lanka Nidahas Dumriya Sevaka Sangamaya while former Transport Minister Madduma Bandara made recruitments from the Uva Province.
