Need for an effective legislature staff

Parliament includes a group of representatives (196 elected, 29 nominated -National list) who have been given a mandate by the citizens to perform certain basic functions. They are representation, lawmaking and the oversight functions. They are also expected to voice and articulate the worries and opinions of the public inside Parliament, debate policies and pose questions to the Ministers.
The President and the Cabinet of Ministers form the Executive. The parliamentarians are tasked with the responsibility of monitoring the activities of the executive while checking the quality of governance. Parliament is responsible to ensure accountability and openness of the government through oversight activities in order to curb corruption and effect good practices. The Parliament also has the power of the purse and the mandate to scrutinize the utilization of public finances and ensure financial accountability.
Parliamentary committees provide better freedom for in-depth analysis for MPs to perform their core functions efficiently. The composition of the Committees will roughly be based according to the proportion reflected in the House. In Committees, the need for consensus building and the requirement for being non-partisan have always been stressed to be more effective and efficient in their decision making. In order for the Committees to be effective, the support staff need to be well-equipped with several core competencies, including excellent writing skills, knowledge in timely and up-to-date manner with regard to current affairs, accurate and well researched information and most importantly the energy, enthusiasm and the desire to perform well. It is also desirable to open the Committee meetings for the general public too.
Committee staff
Parliamentarians of the calibre of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake, A C S Hameed, Ronnie de Mel, Lakshman Jayakody and many more demanded high performance with efficiency from the Secretariat. In order to keep pace with their own objectives, the Committee staff had to improve their capacity and effectiveness in abundance. MPs did not wish to suffer owing to the incompetence of the staff. They refused to tolerate incompetence. They always inspired the staff to do more and more.
They never excused lapses. They created an environment in which we too became effective and efficient performers. They did not permit us to be left behind. Furthermore, we did not leave any room at all for the work to suffer. They expected the staff to be excellent performers. In fact, I am grateful because we became efficient since they guided us always with love and affection too.
In terms of the Standing Orders of Parliament of Sri Lanka (SO 121), the composition of the Committee of Selection is usually announced at the commencement (next meeting day after the first sitting) of the session itself. Unfortunately, this process very often takes a couple of months at present. It will be interesting to find out how (we did that) speedily the nominations were done in 1980s in one day immediately after the ceremonial opening. It must be also placed on record the then Leader of the House and the Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa telephoned the Committee Secretariat from USA (having gone to attend the UN sessions) whether we had taken necessary steps to make the announcement, the nominations of members to various Committees.
This was how the pressure was brought by the then parliamentarians on the staff then. This announcement paved the way for the MPs to get down to business immediately in all these committees. And it was considered as important as well for the purpose of considering the number, function and the constitution (including quorum) of numerous Committees such as Parliamentary Business, House, Public Petitions, Standing Orders, High Posts, Consultative, and the Legislative Standing Committees in order to report speedily their opinions thereon to Parliament.
COPE reports
It is imperative even at present to do it expeditiously without lame excuses. This would ensure parliamentary accountability through the committees if we need to take the country forward. According to SOO, Consultative Committees have been tasked with certain specific functions. Nevertheless, they often take up individual matters pertaining to electorates. Professor Rajiva Wijesinha had said: "The real business of Parliament is done in Committees, where the ideas of others are taken into consideration and consensus sought. But, as we see from what happens in most committees, these are seen simply as places to satisfy local needs."
We must remember our parliament is presently being described as a rubber stamp Parliament. The supremacy by the Executive President, severely self-conscious debates, poor representation of the concerns of the citizens had been considered as vital drawback in the system. It is sad the Executive did not extend the support necessary for the Committees to function effectively. DEW Gunasekera and Wijayadasa Rajapaksha submitted several COPE reports to the Parliament and highlighted issues of corruption, mismanagement, fraud etc. In addition, Janaka Bandara in his capacity as the then Chairman of the Committee on Public Petitions, (PPC), being a beginner, submitted an excellent Report to Parliament, which was considered to be a great job done by him. It was later found that he had resigned. I have no doubt he resigned purely because his hands were not strengthened to take the PPC forward.
I did not see any of the reports submitted by numerous committees taken up for debate and decisions taken by the Parliament in order to introduce remedial measures. It may be necessary to lay down certain guidelines as to what needs to be done after a report is submitted by various committees. It is sad these committees do not have any mechanism for follow up action on their reports. However, Committees have broad powers to send for persons, papers, records etc. in order to perform their duties.
It is heartening the practice that had been there to appoint a government member to chair oversight committees has been discontinued by the present government. It is also encouraging Sunil Handunneththi has been appointed as Chairman of COPE, which is a praiseworthy act.
The Prime Minister who is well aware of the numerous inadequacies has taken great pains to streamline the Committee system which had failed in Sri Lankan Parliament totally. The PM should however remember that SOO too have given necessary strength to run the Committees efficiently and effectively. I do not think the systems backed by rules could develop the Committees and produce the desired results. Let me be forthright that a majority of our Ministers, Deputy Ministers and other parliamentarians do not take Committees seriously at present.
Attendance in Committees has been a perennial problem. The practice to pay an incentive payment for attending committees - attendance allowance, was introduced in order to improve attendance. Nothing has worked so far! Nevertheless, it is very important that there should be a highly dedicated and a fully committed staff too, with good, capable leadership to manage the Sectoral Committee Secretariat, if the present government is keen to achieve its goals and establish good governance and rule of law.
The prolonged civil war marred the pace of economic development which caused insurmountable sufferings for the people in the country. This no doubt is because the formal institutional structure and the political system had failed in checking the unrestrained power and authority of the executive. Parliamentarians also failed miserably to call the government to account using its mechanisms available in the parliamentary system.
Political parties
I have no doubt the PM is making a valiant effort to create good understanding and political space between all political parties with a view to take the country forward in order to achieve sustainable growth and economic development. This is certainly a prerequisite for paving the way to ethnic harmony and strengthen peace benefits to a devastated nation as well.
Our country being a multi-ethnic nation, it requires a political set up which could encourage consensus politics and poly-ethnic co-existence through a more vibrant Parliament. It is fortunate that the free press at present strengthened by a vibrant civil society too demands accountability of politicians and public servants unlike in the past. The Committee system should therefore be further strengthened in order to ensure parliamentary control and help achieving the noble goals of democratic governance of a people friendly government.
A strong Parliament is a pre-requisite to a strong committee system and vice-versa. A strong committee system could always hold a government to account - because numerous committees are the most precious internal instruments of any legislature.
According to the Standing Orders, our Parliament, apart from the Committee of the whole House, has four broad categories of Committees: (1) Select Committees (2) Consultative Committees (3) Standing Committees (4) Committees for Special purposes. And according to the Prime Minister, Sectoral Committees will play a bigger role after abolishing the Consultative Committees in future.
We must never forget that in terms of our SOO, we need to summon Consultative Committees every month and this has never happened very often. The relevant SO has been openly been flouted. If so, how do we ensure running the Sectoral Committees well (unless closely monitored) to achieve the intended goals?
It may also be worthwhile, at this juncture, to explore the need to set up a Committee on Assurances next. The functions of an Assurances Committee will be to scrutinize the assurances, promises, undertakings etc. given by Ministers from time to time and to report to Parliament on the extent to which such assurances etc. have been implemented and to see whether such implementation has taken place within the minimum time necessary for the purpose. This is the need of the hour.
