Teachers at one school over 10 years transferred

Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has taken steps to transfer schoolteachers of national schools who have served at one school continuously over 10 years.
Accordingly, 12,000 schoolteachers were identified and of them, about 3,000 teachers were transferred from October 12. Under the National Teacher Transfer Policy of the Government, these transfers are granted to deserving teachers through the Boards of Teacher Transfers set up at provincial level. Another 9,000 teachers are to be given transfers in January, 2018. Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said about 37,000 teachers are serving in 353 national schools and all deserving teachers would be given transfers in due course.
The Minister intends to recruit another 3,000 qualified sports teacher assistants next year to fill vacancies at schools countrywide to promote sports among students.
