Speech matters
Our hearty congratulations reach out the timely article captioned ‘Art of Proper Speech’ authored by S R Balachandran of Colombo – 06 on August 14. It is quite impartial, intelligent and an educative narrative which every reader should not have missed. More and more articles of this nature, short and sweet, would enlighten the general public on the value of right speech.
I agree wholeheartedly with Balachandran’s opinions and how he proves it. I do have a couple of points of difference, though.
First of all, we must inspect whom Balachandran’s subtle views are aimed at: Parliament, and by established extension, any organ of political body. We must establish the point that Balachandran attempts to drive home. Barring a stunning change in precedent, he defends all kinds of speech, written and verbal, with the exception of offensive wording.
At the midpoint, where speech is simultaneously offensive and legally protected, some of our politicians’ verbal brawls begin spewing disgusting slurs, vulgarities and offences. At this point, Balachandran shall no longer defend the speech. Apparently we can see the pain it brings to those groups and individuals it targets.
What sort of world would it be if verbal offenders got to disrupt and even force the cancellation of speeches without any consequences?
Thank you, Balachandran, for making the public aware on worthwhile issues of the said nature.
