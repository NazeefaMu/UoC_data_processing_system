World’s shortest body builder?

Vince Brasco, from Geensburg Pennsylvania, at 25, has become an Instagram sensation as one of the shortest body builders in the world, standing at just 4’1”.
His Instagram handle has more than 35,000 followers and he goes by the name of Mini Hulk. Vince suffers from a condition called acondroplasia, where the arms and legs are shorter than the average person but the torso is the same size. It is the most common form of dwarfism.
Speaking to Strength Addicts the Instagram sensation said that he started competing with dwarfism because he had seen a lot of people having health problems and he did not want to be like that.
According to Brasco, he wanted to be a role model for others with dwarfism, and wanted to show them that there are no limitations in the pursuit of dreams. Brasco was able to lose a significant amount of body fat after weeks of professional coaching, going on to build his strength gradually.
His role models are body builders Phil Heath, Jay Cutler and Kai Greene. Brasco can bench press more than three times his own weight.
However, while Brasco has successfully competed in a string of bodybuilding competitions, he confesses that he still encounters prejudice due to his size. Brasco – who has had 15 major surgeries to combat health problems associated with his dwarfism – now trains almost every day with a private coach.
In addition to being a bodybuilder, he is also the word’s shortest fire fighter and volunteers at his local fire station for the last four years. ANI
