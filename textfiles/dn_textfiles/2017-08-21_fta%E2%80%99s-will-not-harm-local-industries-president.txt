FTA’s will not harm local industries - President

Free Trade Agreements (FTA’s) which will be signed by the Government with foreign countries will not cause harm in any way to locally manufactured products as the Government’s prime objective is to encourage and protect the country’s own industrialists when signing FTA’s.
President Maithripala Sirisena made this assurance to over 500 local industrialists who were present at the annual CNCI Achiever Awards 2017 ceremony, conducted by Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI). The industrialists who were present at the awards ceremony represented their respective manufacturing and service sectors.
Speaking further President Sirisena highlighted the invaluable role played by the CNCI in the promotion of industries in Sri Lanka and said their contribution to the growth of the national economy was commendable.
While encouraging industrialists and manufacturers for their contribution towards the development of the country’s economy, President Sirisena remarked that certain groups in the country meet industrialists and provide wrong information about FTA’s .
He said their ultimate attempt was to create an image that the FTA’s which will be signed by the Government with foreign countries will badly affect local industries.
“The intention of these elements is to discourage local industrialists and also tarnish the Government’s good work,” he said.
The President once again assured that the Government will never sign any FTA’s that destroy the country’s industries. Highlighting the importance of establishing the National Economic Council the President said both he and the Prime Minister with the help of all stakeholders have a massive plan to develop the country’s economy to a greater extent in the next coming months.
He said before forming the National Economic Council that helps and encourage the country’s small, medium or large industrialists, the Government discussed with officials in the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank and the International Monitory Fund (IMF).
“In addition, we also discussed with local economy experts and Sri Lankan economy experts living overseas before establishing the National Economic Council since this will help to develop local industries”.
CNCI Chairman Tissa Seneviratne highlighted that this achievers awards ceremony encourages and upgrade not only the industrialists and service sector personnel in the country, but also helps to swell the country’s economy to a greater extent.
He said all industrialists associating CNCI are looking forward to contribute in sustainable development plans of the Government.
He also said the CNCI believes the Government keeps the bank interest low and parity rate of rupee with other world currencies in a stable level.
