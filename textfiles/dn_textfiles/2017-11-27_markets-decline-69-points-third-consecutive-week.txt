Point of view
Equity markets continued to lose steam, losing 69 points yet again this week as investors opted to remain on the sidelines amid expectations of amendments to the Budget.
Since the presentation of the 2018 Budget 3-weeks ago, markets have lost a cumulative 208 points, with the ASPI wiping off 69 points in each of the subsequent 3-weeks since the 1st reading of the Budget.
Turnover levels meanwhile, remained broadly unchanged from last week with average daily turnover totaling LKR 0.94 Bn relative to LKR 0.92 Bn last week. Lower retail and institutional participation accounted for the lower turnover levels, with lower institutional and HNI participation in particular resulting in lower activity.
Crossings over the week accounted for just 36% of total market turnover in contrast to the last five weeks when crossings have averaged 50% of total market turnover levels.
Net foreign flows to the CSE meanwhile reverted to a net selling this position as net sales of LKR 1.34 Bn on Thursday and Friday offset the net buying of LKR 0.13 Bn at the start of the week.
Nevertheless, the net selling position on the Bourse was ~46% lower than that of two-weeks ago when net sales for the week totaled LKR 2.2 Bn (cf.LKR 1.2 Bn this week). YTD net foreign inflows to the CSE meanwhile totaled LKR 17.6 Bn by end-week, the highest net buying since 2014 when net buying totaled LKR 21 Bn.
Growing foreign interest in the market has contributed to a 30% improvement in the Daily Average Turnover YTD (LKR .95Bn cf. LKR.73Bn in 2016). Markets in the week ahead are likely to consolidate at the current levels.
S&P revises up Sri Lanka’s credit outlook to stable
S&P Global Ratings revised its credit outlook on Sri Lanka to Stable from Negative citing expectations the country would maintain its reform momentum over the next 12 months while smoothing its higher debt repayments especially in 2019.
The ratings agency also affirmed its ‘B+’ long-term and ‘B’ short-term sovereign credit ratings on the country. S&P cautioned however, that downward pressure on the rating could occur in the event of a more fractious political environment which could derail legislative reform particularly its liability management reform.
The Group also noted that although a higher rating is unlikely in the next 12 months, a significant improvement in the country’s external and fiscal indicators along with a substantive improvement in Sri Lanka’s institutional settings could result in upward pressure on the ratings.
S&P also noted that Sri Lanka’s growth outlook remains robust and expects the country to record a 4.9% real GDP growth rate over 2017-2020. According to S&P, GDP growth will be underpinned by rising tourist arrivals, a uniquely specialized garment sector, strong potential in business process outsourcing, and moderate inflation but stronger growth would require improved institutional settings and a recovery in export markets.
