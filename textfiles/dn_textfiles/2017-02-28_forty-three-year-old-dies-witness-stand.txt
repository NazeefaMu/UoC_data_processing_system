Forty three-year-old dies on witness stand

A 43-year-old man yesterday collapsed and died in the Kantale District Courts, while testifying on the witness stand. The deceased, from Moratuwa, who worked as a driver at the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE), collapsed on the witness stand while giving evidence in a trial. Although officials had taken immediate steps to take him to a nearby hospital, he had been pronounced dead upon admission. A postmortem was to be conducted later in the day.
Kantale Police are investigating.
