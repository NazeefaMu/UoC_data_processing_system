Well updated!

Archt. Varuna De Silva will safeguard your dreams with his style of simplicity and at the end of the day you will have a home that is all about you. Your house will truly be your castle. Arch World brings you the wonder of a simple and beautiful home.
Varuna studied at Royal College and then went to the University of Moratuwa where he did his Bachelors and Masters. And subsequently he started lecturing there. As soon as he finished his studies, he started as a visiting design tutor and then as a permanent staff member. And has been teaching ever since. So basically he is an academic and a practitioner in Architecture, balancing both.
"To me, a house is everyone's dream. In Sri Lanka that is your ultimate goal - to be able to build a house. I create buildings which are very simple. My approach to architecture is, I keep things absolutely simple. I don't do anything that is not needed functionally, structurally or spatially," said Varuna.
A home is a lifetime investment. After all the effort and money put into a project, if at the end of the day it doesn't work for you, then that is tragic.
Commitment
The building happens because of requirements. I don't add on things. A project takes about one year. So it is a commitment of one year or more and I think it is unfair for me and the client if we are not on the same wavelength. If a client comes to me, generally that problem does not arise because they come to me if they have seen my previous houses. It is an investment for life. So I keep it very simple. And I tell my clients when we do the house, after designing the house even the furnishing must be kept absolutely simple."
It seems in simplicity there are challenges that crop up. Which is why hiring a capable architect is necessary. "Because I believe to do simple buildings are very difficult. Because if you do a simple building everything is exposed. Structurally it is exposed. If you do a fuzzy building you can hide things by decorations. Whereas in simple buildings, everything is seen and every mistake is seen, so I believe it is very difficult to do a simple building."
Qualified architect
"It is important to go to a qualified architect. In Sri Lanka more and more people are aware of Architecture and qualified architects. You have to go to a qualified person to get your building designed."
A sense of peace is essential to life. And this sense of peace can be given by Architecture.
"If you look at the photos of my projects, you will see that they are very open spaces. They are extremely open and generally I design on small plots. When I design on small plots what I try to do is to get the inside and the outside together. So I have to minimize walls, minimize doors and windows. And then open the house out from the inside.
Outside? No need to worry
In Sri Lanka we have this problem where you have no control over what is happening outside. Generally what I try to do is, I try to blank off the front where you are not depending on the outside for anything. What I try to do is, I try to internalize the space and completely open it out.
Within the space I try and open out the house. Whatever happens outside, you don't have to worry. So I try to create a space where regardless of whatever happens outside, your internal space is completely open where you feel you are almost in a garden pavilion."
Interaction
A home should interact with you like a living entity - no matter how inanimate it is. That's a sign of a good home - A home that guards you and your interests every day.
"In Sri Lanka you don't need to air condition your homes. You don't have this problem of massive heat. You open the house and you have cross ventilation and that is all you need.
The outside is completely blank and you don't know what is happening inside. So there is the element of surprise because the outside is completely blank and people are not looking into your house.
I take the requirements of the client and I interpret the requirements and how they live, architecturally.
Architecture is a fast changing field with the technology and materials changing. Because I am a University lecturer it keeps me on the ball! It really helps me in my practice. So I am updated on the new trends. So I am aware of these things."
Design Tips
*If you want to build a house go to an architect. It is architecture that everyone thinks they can do. You don't take up the duties of a lawyer or a doctor do you? That is really not a good thing.
*If the building is simple you won't get bored. If you have too many things happening then that is not a good idea. The play of light and how the shadows fall on the walls and how the color changes during the different times of the day- all these factors are important. There is a different kind of ambience and atmosphere within the house and the spaces.
