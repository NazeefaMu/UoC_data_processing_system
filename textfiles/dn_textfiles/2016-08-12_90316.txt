SINGER-Daily News Most Popular   Schoolboy Ruggerite 2016: Gunadheera forges ahead

 
Royal College captain and number eight Nikhila Gunadheera forged ahead and threatened to runaway with the Singer-Daily News Most Popular Schoolboy Ruggerite 2016 contest when he received a surfeit of votes to open up a healthy 830-vote gap following the ninth week of voting.
The two ruggerites challenging Gunadheera’s position are Thomian winger Naveen Heenkankanamge who has taken over the second spot from Vageesha Weerasinghe, the Isipathana College number eight.
Heenkankanamge has 3364 votes to Weerasinghe’s 3331.
The biggest leap this week is by Royal’s scrum half Ashok Wijekumar who has shot from seventh slot to fourth with a total of 3070 votes.
The weekly prize winner on the lucky draw is:
Bathika Ama Ranaweera of 55/D/1, Uruwal Mawatha, Kirillawala, Kadawatha.
The winner will be contacted by Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC to collect the fabulous gift.
