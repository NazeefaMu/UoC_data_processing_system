Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha, who is on an official visit to India, met Indian Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi February 27 in New Delhi.
Two Ministers discussed matters of mutual importance including the latest political developments.

Minister Gandhi shared the Indian experience extensively with details of the proposed national action plan for rabies eradication and stranded dog population management. Minister Gandhi also shared Indian endeavours aimed at preventing cruelty to animals.
Minister Gandhi said India would welcome a team of experts from Sri Lanka to hold discussions with their Indian counterparts and visit the centres established to address these issues. She also offered short training courses for Sri Lankan officials in India.
