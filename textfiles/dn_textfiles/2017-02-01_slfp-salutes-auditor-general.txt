SLFP salutes Auditor General

The SLFP yesterday hailed Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe for withstanding government pressure and working resolutely and intrepidly.
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B.Dissanayake said the SLFP admires the AG for “standing strong for justice and lawfulness amidst threats and intimidation of some sections in the government”.
The minister was addressing a press conference at the ministry mainly to discuss the SLFP position with regard to current political developments.
“The AG was picked to that post by President Maithripala Sirisena. Appointments of Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy as the Central Bank Governor and Sarath Jayamanne as the Director General of Bribery Commission were more examples to prove that the President was correct in his choices” he said.
Dissanayake said the President’s recent interventions could prevent several harmful decisions being implemented in the country.
“The SLFP and the UNP are working together in the government amidst difficulties, for the benefit of the country. The two parties have contradictory policies and the grassroots level party supporters of both parties are unwilling to work together,” he added.
Responding to a question by a journalist, the minister also stressed that there is no move to deprive any member of Joint Opposition of their civic rights.
“It was a tall tale by MP Bandula Gunawardena,” he said.
Commenting on the decision of Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera to be an independent MP, the minister said it was his right and should be respected.
“If anybody tries to expel him from Parliament because of this decision I think it is detrimental to good governance, Sri Lankan politics and people. Ven. Rathana Thera is still working closely with the government,” he said.
