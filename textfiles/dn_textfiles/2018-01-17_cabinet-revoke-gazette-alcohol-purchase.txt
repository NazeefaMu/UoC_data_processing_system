Cabinet to revoke gazette on alcohol purchase

The Cabinet has decided to unanimously revoke the recent gazette allowing women to purchase alcohol, said Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, yesterday.
The minister, addressing a SLFP media briefing held at the SLFP Headquarters on Darley Road said, the gazette allowing extended opening hours for liquor shops was also revoked at the weekly Cabinet meeting held yesterday.
The Finance Ministry on January 10 issued a gazette which overturned an outdated law that prohibited the sale of liquor to women and the employment of the women in places where alcohol is sold. On January 11, they also issued a gazette allowing retail shops selling liquor to be open from 8am - 10pm. Both these moves were criticized by the President over the weekend and he requested that the Finance Ministry withdraw their previous gazettes.
