Kandy Sports Club kings of rugby again

Kandy Sports Club was crowned kings of rugby again when they pushed to the sidelines CR and FC 31-28. The two perennial rivals in local club rugby faced off for one final time for the season at the Race Course for the coveted Clifford Cup.
Both teams were geared up and well prepared for the occasion and they knew that it was an “All or Nothing” battle. In what turned out to be a mouthwatering clash Kandy SC left it to the final stages to edge out CR and FC and deservedly emerge champs for 2016.
A penalty in the dying moments of the game off the boot of Nigel Ratwatte helped Kandy to win the Clifford Cup for the 20th time in 24 years.
If the first half’s play was an indication then CR and FC showed they had all the chances of pulling the game in their favor, but Kandy had them back pedaling and simply smashed them backwards in the second half mainly in the last 11 minutes. Kandy proved that they knew how to win a Cup final.
This grand final was graced by Sports Minister Desire Jayasekara who was the chief guest. Finance Minister Ravi Karunaratne, Ranjith Page Cargills’ big boss and Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya from Dialog, the prime sponsors of sport in the country were also present to enjoy the exciting action dished out by the two teams.
The next scrum will be the inter-club sevens in August.
