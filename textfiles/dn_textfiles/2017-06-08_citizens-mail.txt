Citizens' Mail

Define insurance risk
Insurance sector in Sri Lanka has developed to a commendable level. However the following needs clarification.
In the scope of cover for Risk it is stated “Strikes, Riots and Civil Commotions” ‘Civil Commotion’ means uprising of the people against the Government (like Mutiny). No insurance cover is possible for same.
French Revolution against King Louis the 16th English Revolution against King Charles are the best examples. They were beheaded by the people. JVP and LTTE Insurgencies in 1971, 1987, 1977 cannot be called Civil Commotion but are defined as Act of Terrorism.
Can any professional clarify this matter?
