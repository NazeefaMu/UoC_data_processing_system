Nepalese men face court charges

Three Nepalese men have been remanded in custody over a northern suburbs murder in the UK that allegedly left a Sri Lankan victim face down in a pool of his own blood.
In the Elizabeth Magistrates Court on Monday, prosecutors successfully applied to have the identities of all three alleged murderers suppressed to safeguard the ongoing police investigation. The identity of the victim has also been suppressed—because Major Crime detectives have yet to locate his family in Sri Lanka and inform them of his death.
Police have alleged that a man, 39, was killed at Penfield Gardens, north of Adelaide, on Friday night. They have further alleged the man’s housemate had to flee for his life through barbed-wire fences from a group of up to six assailants. Eye witnesses claim the “distraught and wailing” housemate was found bleeding, and on the verge of collapse, at the front of the property.
