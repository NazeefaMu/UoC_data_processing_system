Two garbage collecting companies to be dismissed: Faiszer Musthapha
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday said in Parliament, that he would take steps to send away the two private companies involved in garbage collection in Colombo or amend the agreement in that regard.
Speaking at the Adjournment Debate, the minister was up in arms against ‘Care Cleaner’ and ‘Abans,’ the two companies to which the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) had outsourced the collection of garbage.
“Since November 1, 2016, I gave directive that all local government bodies should collect segregated waste. The two companies involved in collecting garbage in Colombo, paid additional bonus to their employees for going house to house saying not to segregate waste and instead pay some money to them. There is corruption at all quarters with regard to the collection of garbage. I asked the CMC why garbage collection was outsourced to these two companies for a period of four years. The Commissioner had no answer. ‘Care Cleaner’ and ‘Abans’ recruite employees over 75 years and even disabled persons for garbage collection just to show off they have the required numbers of workers,” he added.
The minister was of the view that the CMC and the Western Provincial Council have to bear the responsibility of the Meethotamulla tragedy to a great extent. “I summoned the CMC thrice. I knew that there was a dangerous situation. I requested the CMC to carry out a proper administration with regard to the manner in which the Meethotamulla dump yard was run. I requested for the use of drones to ascertain whether there was danger,” he noted.
“LG bodies are corrupt with or without politicians running them,” he remarked.
The minister stressed that whoever was responsible for the Meethotamulla incident and all those who fraudulently earn money from garbage, must be brought before the law. “That was one of the reasons why the President appointed a Commission in this regard. A lot of dirty linen would come out from the findings of this Commission,” he said.
Commenting on future measures, the minister said, “I am starting a landfill within 40 days in Muthurajawela. I will take all precautions to see that it would be environmental friendly. Compost plants would be set up in all nine provinces. We are working to solve the garbage issue with commitment. I urge all to take this as a national issue and support our endeavour,” he commented.
Replying to MP Dinesh Gunawardena’s complaints of not holding LG elections, the minister said he had now placed all necessary Amendments to the Act before the Cabinet and now it was up to the Cabinet to proceed.
Public officials should take responsibility for Meethotamulla carnage: Eran
Public officials should take responsibility over the deaths and the tragic incident at the Meethotamulla, said Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne.
He also said the highest officials in the relevant areas should resign from their positions due to their failure to solve this issue.
"The Megapolis and Western Development Minister, Environment Minister and Local Government Minister should find out as to who of the public officials were responsible to this incident," Deputy Minister Wickramaratne said. "If they are unable to find the officials, they themselves should take the responsibility," he said.
The Deputy Minister said Public officials have to take responsibilities. Most of the people come to us ask for government jobs so that they should be able to take responsibility.
He made these observations yesterday, while joining the Adjournment Debate on the Meethotamulla garbage collapse, moved by Opposition Leader R Sampanthan.
However, opposition member Jayantha Samaraweera questioned as to why public officials should take the responsibility where as there are politicians there to take decisions. He said that when the people in Meethotamulla engaged in protests, there were brutally attacked and their protests suppressed.
Gazette Notification on garbage disposal presented in House
The Gazette Notification to declare garbage disposal and collection as an essential service was presented to the Parliament yesterday as per the Constitution.

'Meethotamulla garbage collapse, tantamount to mass murder'
A Deputy Minister and an Opposition member stated in Parliament yesterday, that the deaths at Meethotamulla garbage collapse was tantamount to mass murder.
During their speeches, Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and Opposition member Jayantha Samaraweera said that the deaths were nothing but murder. Deputy Minister Ramanayake said the deaths at the Meethotamulla incident should be identified as a massacre. "Members of the opposition say that they have plans to solve this issue," the Deputy Minister said. They said while they were about to solve the issue the government changed. "Had not the government changed, we would have solved the issue." But the Deputy Minister said that they aggravated the issue while they were in power."
Opposition MP Samaraweera said the government has been failed to solve the issue of garbage disposal. "The Municipal Commissioner and several others have said that they knew that there was a threat of the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsing before hand," Opposition MP Samaraweera said. He said the government has been failed to solve the issue of garbage disposal.
PFCB against granting of tax exemptions to 26 selected persons under ESPA
The Public Finance Committee Bill (PFCB) has recommended that the proposed regulations under the Excise Special Provisions Act(ESPA) to grant tax exemptions to 26 selected individuals, while there were hundreds of persons in the category who have opened letters of Credit (LC) on or before May 26, 2016 to import vehicles not be approved.
Committee Chairman Parliamentarian M A Sumanthiran while presenting the committee's report in Parliament, highlighted that the Finance Minister should make a note in Parliament as to how these individuals were selected and on what basis it was done. He also said that each individual had earned a profit of Rs 4 million due to this special exemption of tax, adding that among those 26 were fathers and sons and several medical professionals as well. He added that they should not be permitted as it was a bad precedence.
Special Force under Field Marshal:
Suppressing of people's rights:Vijitha Herath
The proposal to set up a special force under Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka was an attempt to quell public protests and promote military rule, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said.
The MP was speaking at the Adjournment Debate in Parliament yesterday. He questioned as to how President Maithripala Sirisena who came to power with the pledge of abolishing the Executive Presidency and reviving democracy, could come up with such an idea.
“The Government is going to set up a special force to suppress public protests and thereby to subvert the true issues of the people. When people are lining up against the move to sell the country’s assets, the Government is trying to control public protests. The Government is trying to cover up its inability by suppression. This is a dangerous situation. The President and the Cabinet should take the responsibility of such a move. People are not ready to go back to a military rule. They do not want another Gotabhaya Rajapaksa,” he noted.
“The fall of this Government would not be far, if the it continues to suppress the people’s democratic rights,” he added.
Stringent laws needed against dumping garbage at environmentally unstable locations: Ranawaka
The government should impose stern laws against dumping garbage at environmentally unstable locations in the country, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
He made this observation yesterday in the Parliament, while joining the Adjournment Motion moved by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan on the issue of garbage disposal and the Meethotamulla incident.
He also said that the government had declared garbage disposal an essential service as it had become a serious issue in the country. He also said that the collapse at Meethotamulla was a deep seated collapse. Around 3 million tons of garbage had been dumped at this marshy land called Pothuvil Kumbura now known as Meethotamulla garbage dump, since 1989.
"The responsibility of garbage disposal comes under the Colombo Municipal Council(CMC). There are around 70 engineers to manage that task," Minister Ranawaka said. "But when Meethotamulla is considered, not a single measure had been taken to rehabilitate the dump."
He also said the CMC did not heed to the warnings made in 2015 and 2016 by the Urban Development Authority(UDA).
"Not only the garbage of Colombo is dumped at Meethotamulla, but garbage of Kaduwela, Wattala, Biyagama, Kotte, etc," Minister Ranawaka said. "It became clear only when Kaduwela, Wattala, Biyagama and Kotte faced severe problems of dumping their garbage following the collapse at Meethotamulla."
He also said the garbage had become an issue not only in Colombo, but also in many other parts of the country. "The dump of garbage in Guhagoda in Kandy had a threat of collapse. It would pollute the waters of the Polgolla Reservoir and the Mahaveli River and Gampola, which has an imminent threat of causing water pollution," Minister Ranawaka said. "Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Gampaha, Peliyagoda and Kelaniya too have the same issue."
The Minister said the Meethotamulla garbage dump would be rehabilitated within the next six months. It would be brought to a level that would not collapse. "The garbage from hotels, hospitals and all the other institutions are dumped at Meethotamulla," Minister Ranawaka said. "So this is not only the garbage of the 650,000 people of Colombo, but of the entire country. So garbage management should be brought under a Central Garbage Management Authority, bringing the garbage management across the country."
The Minister said that although power could be generated with garbage, the level of moisture in garbage is to high to do so. He added that Rs 7 to Rs 10 is needed to dry a kilo of garbage.
"Garbage management should commence at the houses and other institutions themselves," Minister Ranawaka said. "Japan has reduced garbage dumping to one sixth by commencing garbage management at house level."
"We should have a different mechanism to dispose electronic wastes and clinical waste," the Minister said. "We should not add them to Meethotamulla or any other dumps of garbage as it could cause serious health hazards."
He added that the government's attempt to dump garbage in Puttalam in 2014 in a lime stone quarry, was stopped based on a report of the Wild Life Department. However, we trying another quarry to continue with the same project. "Nearly 1.3 million tons of lime stone are excavated every year, but only 0.4 million tons of garbage is a accumulated every year," the Minister said. "So we have to take bold steps to address this issue."
Meethotamulla Garbage collapse:
Past and present governments should take responsibility: Opp. Leader Sampanthan
Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, urging the Government to do all in its capacity to alleviate the pains and sufferings of victims of the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse, observed that all past and present governments should take responsibility for it.
Moving an Adjournment Motion in Parliament yesterday, Sampanthan also called for a radical change in the country’s political culture. “Meethotamulla was just the tip of an ice berg. Our country could face even many more greater disasters in several spheres, unless there is a radical change in this political culture,” he noted.
“The culture of politics in this country has become such that no issue however important to the country and its people, could be addressed free of political influence and political meddling. Our political culture is such that anything, irrespective of whether it is right or wrong, moral or immoral, legal or illegal, shall be done to promote their political careers to acquire and retain political power for their own convenience,” he remarked.
He pointed out that contemporary politicians are increasingly becoming unwilling or unable to accept and truly respect the democratic verdict of the people.
“This political culture must change for the better. Those elected by the people are elected to serve the best interests of the country and its people and not to device ways and means or tactics to subvert that trust placed on them by the people for their own political gains and benefits. Claims of alleged patriotism could never be a substitute for action that demonstrates a genuine commitment to honestly serve the country,” he said.
“While partaking in the despair and sorrow of the affected families in Meethotamulla, I urge the Government to take immediate steps to adequately compensate the victims and relocate the affected people and also as a matter of utmost urgency, to come up with solutions to the growing garbage crisis in the country,” he added.
