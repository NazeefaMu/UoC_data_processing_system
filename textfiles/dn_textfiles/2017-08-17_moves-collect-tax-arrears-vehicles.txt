Moves to collect tax arrears on vehicles

Cabinet approval was granted to collect arrears of taxes for luxury, semi-luxury and semi luxury dual purpose vehicles.
Annual tax should be paid for following classes of vehicles for seven years since its registration as per the Finance Act No 16 of 1995. The luxury vehicles include diesel motor cars exceeding 2500 CC and petrol motor cars exceeding 2000 CC, semi-luxury vehicles include diesel motor cars 2201 -2500 CC, diesel jeeps exceeding 2200 CC, petrol cars 1801 – 2000 CC, petrol jeeps exceeding 1800 CC and semi-luxury dual purpose vehicles include diesel cabs exceeding 2200 CC and petrol cabs exceeding 1800 CC.
The first installments of the tax have to be paid to the Motor Traffic Department at the registration and other installments could be paid either to the department or to the insurance company. Omissions of taxes are liable to a 50 percent levy. The total due amount is above Rs. 350 million.
A proposal was made by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva to declare a three month concessionary period from September 1 to November 30 and to charge only 5 percent levy during the period.
