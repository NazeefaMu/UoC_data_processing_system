India’s SC rules privacy is a fundamental right

INDIA: India’s Supreme Court ruled Thursday that citizens have a constitutional right to privacy, a landmark verdict that could have wide-reaching implications for the government’s flagship biometric programme.
Privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the Indian constitution, and the government has argued that India’s 1.25 billion citizens cannot expect an absolute right to privacy.
But in a brief statement on Thursday, Chief Justice J.S. Khehar said privacy was “protected as an intrinsic part of Article 21 that protects life and liberty”.
The Supreme Court set up a special bench to rule on the issue after petitioners challenged the government’s Aadhaar biometric programme, which has recorded the fingerprints and iris scans of more than one billion Indians.
Aadhaar was set up as a voluntary scheme to streamline benefit payments to millions of poor people and cut fraud.
But in recent years it has become compulsory for a growing number of services, including opening a bank account or paying taxes.
Opponents say that its use for what are effectively essential services means their right to privacy is increasingly being violated.
Lawyer Prashant Bhushan said after the judgement it would likely impact the Aadhaar programme.
“Any fundamental right is subject to reasonable restrictions by law. Whether the Aadhar Act imposes unreasonable restrictions will have to be examined,” he told reporters outside the court.
