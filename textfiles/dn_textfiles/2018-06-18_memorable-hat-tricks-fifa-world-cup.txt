Memorable hat-tricks in FIFA World Cup

Portugal's striker Cristiano Ronaldo is a serial record breaker.
The Portuguese ace set a new record this time as he became the oldest player (33 years) to score a hat-trick in a World Cup fixture.
His heroics helped Portugal to a 3-3 draw against tournament favorites Spain.
Here we take a look at some of the most memorable hat-tricks in the FIFA World Cup.
PAOLO ROSSI FOR ITALY AGAINST BRAZIL 1982 WORLD CUP
Paolo Rossi's hat-trick is one of the most memorable ones since he went into 1982 World Cup without playing any professional football for 2 years.
Rossi was banned for 2 years for his alleged involvement in a match-fixing scandal.
But he silenced his critics with a stunning hat-trick against the dominating Brazilians to hand Italy a win (3-2).
GEOFF HURST FOR ENGLAND AGAINST WEST GERMANY 1966 WC FINAL
England's only World Cup title came because of this crucial hat-trick by Geoff Hurst in the 1966 World Cup final against West Germany.
Hurst's controversial extra-time 120th minute goal guided England to a 4-2 victory at the Wembley Stadium in London.
Hurst is still the only player, till date, to score a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup.
GABRIEL BATISTUTA FOR ARGENTINA AGAINST JAMAICA 1998 WORLD CUP
Gabriel Batistuta scored his first World Cup hat-trick in 1994 but it is his second hat-trick which holds a place in the record book.
His performance against Jamaica in 1998 World Cup made him the only player to score hat-tricks in successive World Cups.
The most amazing part is that his hat-tricks came exactly four years apart as both were scored on June 21.
PELE FOR BRAZIL AGAINST FRANCE 1958 WORLD CUP
Pele might be a three-time World Cup winner, but his only hat-trick came in 1958 World Cup when a 17-year old Pele set the grand stage on fire.
He was not only the youngest footballer to play in a World Cup but also the youngest to score a hat-trick.
It came in a crucial semi-final fixture against France to hand Brazil a 5-2 win.
