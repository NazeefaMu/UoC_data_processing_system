Bangladesh off to a fine start

The Bangladesh under 19 gained momentum as skipper Tawhid Hridoy lashed a half century to put them in a strong position against Sri Lanka on the first day of the first Test which began at the NCC Ground yesterday.
The visitors were put into bat after they won the toss, breezed to 209 for 3 in 58 overs at tea. The match was then called off early due to bad weather.
Bangladesh’s openers built a opening partnership of 54 (53 balls) in eight overs before Chamindu Wijesinghe dismissed Tanzid Hasan for 42 runs (31) with seven boundaries and Hasan Joy scored 19 runs batting at number three. Hasan was dismissed by offspinner Sandun Mendis.
Captain Tawhid Hridoy scored 54 runs including 3 fours and 1 six, facing 98 balls and was involved in a 46-run stand with Prantik Nawroz (45).
Prantik was dismissed by Ashen Daniel when he gave a catch to Kamil Mishara. A stroke filled 43 off 64 balls by Shamim Hossain featuring 4 fours and 1 six helped Tawhid to put on a brisk 71-stand before tea.
The match will be continued today.
