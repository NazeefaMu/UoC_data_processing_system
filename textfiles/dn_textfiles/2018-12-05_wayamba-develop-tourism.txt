Wayamba to develop tourism

The newly appointed Chairman of the Wayamba Development Authority (WDA), former PC member Nilantha Supun Rajapaksa told the Daily News yesterday that Kalpitiya will be developed as a tourist destination.
He said Wayamba is still at a basic level and much more has to be done to improve the tourism industry.
Tourist information centres would be set up in Kurunegala, Badagamuwa and Yapahuwa.
Wayamba has archaeological sites, colonial monuments, bird and wildlife sanctuaries and such areas should be developed as tourist hotspots, he said.
Rajapaksa said the main target of the Wayamba Development Authority is to attract foreign as well as local tourists and boost hotel accommodation.
