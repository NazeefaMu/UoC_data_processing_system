To increase capacity by 2,500 seats
MCC unveil new designs for Compton, Edrich Stands at Lord’s

The MCC have released the new designs for the latest phase in their redevelopment of Lord’s.
The new three-tier Compton and Edrich Stands will boost capacity at the home of cricket by 2,500 seats, taking the ground to an overall 32,500-seater.
The proposals will accommodate 11,500 at the Nursery End and will take place over a two-year period between 2019 and 2021, with a walkway linking both stands underneath the Media Centre.
Work will commence after next year’s Test match against Australia, following the Cricket World Cup, with Lord’s hosting the final on July 15.
MCC members will be asked to approve the plan at next year’s AGM.
Seats in the new stands will be in place by the 2020 season, with completion due on the reconstruction work the following summer. The total cost is expected to be in the region of £50m.
The proposals form the next part of the phased Masterplan for Lord’s. Last year, the new £25 million Warner Stand was opened, the first stand to be rebuilt at Lord’s since 1997.
MCC Chief Executive and Secretary Guy Lavender said: ‘MCC is committed to ensuring Lord’s remains the best place in the world at which to watch and play cricket.
‘These new stands will transform the Nursery End, providing world-class facilities, opening up views both to the Pavilion and back towards the Nursery Ground, and adding another architectural enhancement to Lord’s.
‘We are very aware of the responsibility we have to protect everything that makes Lord’s so special, and we are delighted with the positive feedback we’ve already received from our membership.
‘As well as providing a significant improvement to capacity and facilities, the plans for the new Compton and Edrich stands complement beautifully the J.P. Morgan Media Centre, which was designed by Future Systems and is itself an award-winning building, well known to anyone who has watched cricket at Lord’s.’
