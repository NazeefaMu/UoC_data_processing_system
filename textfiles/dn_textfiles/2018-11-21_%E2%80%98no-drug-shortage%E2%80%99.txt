‘No drug shortage’

There is no drug shortage whatsoever in any part of the country, the Deputy Director General of Medical Services-11 attached to the Health Ministry Dr. Amal Harsha De Silva told the ‘Daily News.
“As there is no drug shortage in the Western Province, therefore it is impossible for any provincial hospitals to suffer any drug shortage,” Western Provincial Health Services Director Dr. Anil Samaranayake said.
According to National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) Director General Dr. K. Wickramasinghe, there is no drug shortage in the Colombo National Hospital.
Government Medical Officers’ Association Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda also affirmed that that there is no drug shortage in any state hospital in the country at present.
Some doctors and officials pointed out that artificial drug shortages can be created by people with vested interests by not informing the relevant authorities at the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) of the drug requirements in the drug supply chain and turning back patients stating that the prescribed dug is not available in the hospital.
