Basnayaka Nilame says two kapuwas damaging sanctity of sacred place

The Basnayake Nilame of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya D P Kumarage, alleged that two kapuwas (officiating persons) attached to the Kataragama Maha Devalaya were damaging the sanctity of the sacred place by engaging in various malpractices in their greed for monetary gain.
He alleged that one of the priests who had kicked and damaged the door of his official residence, was participating in pooja activities by force.
Kumarage said so at a press conference held at the Oak Ray Hotel in Kandy on August 23, to put the record straight regarding the tense situation which had erupted at the Devalaya premises which led to the cancellation of the 4.30 am pooja recently.
Kumarage said the present upheaval at the Kataragama Devalaya would be settled within the next fortnight as he would take necessary steps to maintain peace and justice at the sacred precincts.
Kumarage said when there was a team of five persons responsible for pooja activities at the Devalaya, two of them were conducting its activities supported by thugs at the expense of the other three.
The two of them were one Somapala Ratnayake and his nephew. His attempt to take action against the two and bring normalcy, led to the recent tension.
He alleged that the two priests were engaged in this high handed action to pocket a share of the money placed by devotees in (pooja trays) as offerings and collection tills.
These offerings were never being properly audited.
Kumarage said the Police had already launched an investigation into the incident and the footage in the CCTV cameras would prove who was at fault.
