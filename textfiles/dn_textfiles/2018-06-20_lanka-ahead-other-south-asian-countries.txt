Logistics Performance Index
Lanka ahead of other South Asian countries

South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation countries (SASEC) including Sri Lanka could invest in improving connectivity to reduce transport times and increase reliability to major markets, suggests latest Asian Development Banks’ study on Trade Costs, Time, and Supply Chain Reliability.
Sri Lanka is ahead of other south Asian countries in the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI), with Colombo among the best connected ports. But Sri Lanka is behind most South East Asian countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia which are part of multinational corporation global supply chains. “We consider the reduction in each SASEC country’s trade costs with the US if it were to reduce its international transport time to that country to the same level as the PRC’s international transport time to the US.
The results indicate that the gains could be substantial: by just over 5% for Bangladesh, by 2.7% for Bhutan, by 1.5% for Maldives, and by 0.5% for Sri Lanka.
India’s and Nepal’s international transport times to the US are already lower than what is observed for the PRC; however, we caution that these results do not seem plausible and possibly reflect severe reporting problems in those countries.
“These numbers show that potential welfare and efficiency gains from improving international transport times are economically significant.”
“Although we have not simulated trade effects, existing results in the literature, such as Djankov, Freund, and Pham (2010), suggest that an extra day of transport time tends to reduce bilateral trade by about 1%. Given that the differences we are finding are large in proportional terms, the potential to boost trade significantly by improving international shipment times is substantial.”
In policy terms, ADB results suggest that SASEC countries need to concentrate additional
resources on boosting connectivity. This means having infrastructure of sufficient quantity and quality that international shippers have an incentive to put in place a direct linkage. Indirect linkages and the need for transshipment significantly increase time, cost, and uncertainty, and can act as a drag on trade.
Although some international gateways in SASEC countries perform well, none of them are close to the world technological frontier.
