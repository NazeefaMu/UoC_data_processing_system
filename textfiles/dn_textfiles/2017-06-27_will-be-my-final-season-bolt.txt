This will be my final season - Bolt

Ostrava: Jamaican sprint star Usain Bolt insists this “emotional” season will indeed be his last, bringing the curtain down on a glittering career which galvanised track and field at a time of doping and corruption scandals.
Bolt has won eight Olympic and 11 world gold medals in his career, but importantly was the outgoing, larger-than-life personality on whom athletics administrators could rely for a positive slant, an athlete widely recognised globally. Asked whether he might carry on after this season, Bolt said: “No, I don’t think so!
“It’s just been a great career, I’ve really enjoyed the ups and downs, all the experience I’ve gathered, all I’ve been through, the happiness and the sadness.
“It’s been a wonderful career and I’ve done everything I’ve wanted to do and it’s coming to an end and I’m fine with it.”
Speaking ahead of Wednesday’s IAAF World Challenge meet in the northeastern Czech city of Ostrava, Bolt admitted that the season was an emotional one. Bolt, 30, confirmed that he would not be competing in the 200m in London, but left the door open to a further finale being added to his programme.
“For sure I won’t be running the 200m” at the worlds, he said. “People keep asking, but no.” AFP
