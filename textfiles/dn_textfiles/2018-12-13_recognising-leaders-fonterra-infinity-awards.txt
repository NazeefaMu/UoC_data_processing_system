Recognising leaders at Fonterra Infinity Awards

Employees across the dairy supply chain were in the running for honours as part of the Co-operative’s Fonterra Infinity Awards 2018, held recently to recognise inspiring and emerging leaders, among thirty other top performing individuals and teams.
Human Resources Director of Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka, Dinusha Jayamanne, agrees. “As part of our organisation’s commitment to shaping extraordinary destinies for our people, we recognise the importance of building great leaders with the right capabilities and mindsets.”
“This year, we have made multiple strides by building new capabilities that will help us become a future-ready organisation, able to take on the macroeconomic challenges of tomorrow. We’ve been recognised as a global talent hub that provides growth and development opportunities. The Fonterra Infinity Awards are the annual appreciation of our teams’ hard work throughout the year and a chance for us to celebrate their extraordinary achievements,” said Jayamanne.
“Last year’s leadership award winners have gone on to make great strides in their careers, and we have no doubt that this will continue for the top performers and leaders recognised this year.”
The Fonterra Inspiring Leader award honours an outstanding senior member of the team who has inspired their colleagues to grow and demonstrated leadership traits, while keeping Fonterra values at the core.
This year’s award was presented to Thilanka Jayathilake, Fonterra Brands Lanka HR Business Partner. “Amongst many inspiring examples throughout the year, Thilanka has inspired mindset change and built capabilities within the sales function, one of our largest teams, to help it undergo a complete transformation,” said Jayamanne. “She enabled this smooth transition by building a new sales structure, acquiring new capabilities and up skilling existing teams in anticipation of future growth.”
Speaking about her experience, Thilanka said, “Leading authentically and with passion becomes a positive influence on your team and colleagues. Being myself and looking at the positive side has always enabled me to make a difference to individuals and help them realise their potential.”
The Co-operative also presented the 2018 Fonterra Emerging Leader Award to Shehani Liyanage, Brand Manager.
Shehani was responsible for launching key innovations for the business, rallying her team members across functions and showing all the signs of a Fonterra leader in the making.
