Shani Diluka performs at Virtuosi in Concert

 Shani Diluka, who has thrilled audiences in Sri Lanka with her virtuoso piano playing, will return to perform with the Symphony Orchestra of Si Lanka on March 15 at the Ladies’ College Hall.
Shani, described by Piano Magazine as “One of the greatest of her generation,” has been playing with major orchestras and legendary conductors in many countries, including Europe, UK, Japan and Russia. Shani has released more than 10 internationally acclaimed recordings. Her recordings of Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Grieg, released on Mirare/Harmonia Mundi, have earned her many awards. This season, Shani Diluka will be appearing in France, Germany, Japan, Austria, Russia, touring with Natalie Dessay, and in solo Recital at La Roqued’Anthéron festival, in Théâtre des Champs Elysees, Vienna Konzerthaus, Salzburg Mozarteum, Ravinia Festival in USA, Paris Philharmonie, Folle Journée Festival in Nantes, Japan and Russia.
This will be her first performance with the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka.
Acclaimed musicians, Gabriel Le Magadure and Valentin Erben, will join Shani in performing Beethoven’s Triple Concerto with the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka.
Ebène Quartet violinist Gabriel Le Magadure is widely recognized by international critics as an outstanding musician full of sensitivity, with a warm, deep sound and an exceptional capacity to listen. Gabriel Le Magadure has performed at some of the world’s most prestigious music halls, including New York’s Carnegie Hall, Berlin’s Philharmonie, London’s Wigmore Hall, Amserdam’s Concert gebouw and Vienna’s Musikverein.
Valentin Erben, an Austrian Cellist, was a former member of the prestigious Lucern Festival Orchestra conducted by Claudio Abbado. He was also the co-founder of the international string quartet, Alban Berg Quartet, which performed for almost 40 years. Valentin and Shani released a recording of the complete Beethoven works for cello and piano in the fall of 2016.
Virtuosi in Concert, sponsored by the People’s Bank, will be directed by Japanese conductor Keiko Kobayashi. Guest conductor of the SOSL for many years, Keiko has established a reputation for her dynamic and animated presence at the podium. Her forceful presence draws out the best from the musicians and elevates their performance to great heights. The highlight of the evening’s program will be Beethoven’s Triple Concerto, performed by the SOSL and the three foreign soloists. The program will also include Rossini’s Overture to the Barber of Seville and Malcolm Arnold’s Inn of the Sixth Happiness Suite.
Beethoven’s Triple Concerto was composed around 1804. Beethoven took up the challenge of writing a concerto, for piano, violin and cello soloists, which was unheard of at that time. Although it is rarely performed, it remains in the repertoire and has delighted many audiences with its “grand, tranquil, harmonious and lively” music.
The Overture to The Barber of Seville, is one of Rossini’s most well known and recognizable, with its exciting and lively music. Although this overture had originally been composed as the introduction of a tragic opera and used again as the overture to a historical opera it functioned perfectly and remained as the introduction to a comic tale, which was the essence of the Barber of Seville.
Malcolm Arnold composed numerous film scores, of which the best known is his Oscar winning Bridge on the River Kwai. His film scores rank among the finest composed for that genre. The film score for Inn of the Sixth Happiness, a film which featured Ingrid Bergmen, won him the Ivor Novello Award in 1958. Celebrating the 60th year of performance, the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka presents this special program as the first concert for 2017.
