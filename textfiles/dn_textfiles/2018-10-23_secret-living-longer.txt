Secret to living longer?

Eating a piece of citrus fruit every day could help us to avoid cancer, heart disease, dementia and even wrinkles
We all know vitamin C can help fight a cold but it turns out eating a piece of a citrus fruit a day could help to fend off more serious illnesses – including cancer and heart disease.
In their book ‘Eat Better, Live Longer: Understand What Your Body Needs to Stay Healthy’, nutritionists Dr Sarah Brewer and Juliette Kellow say citrus fruits are key for a long life.
They say we should aim to eat at least one orange, mandarin, satsuma, grapefruits, lemon or lime a day. The best way to eat the fruits is raw and at room temperature, as they release more juice when they are warm.
The pair also claim that the peel contains considerably more antioxidants than the juice, so we should use the grated zest to add flavour to our food.
ncluding more vitamin C in our diet has various benefits.
It can be used to make collagen, which helps repair tissues, heal wounds and makes our skin look smoother. The nutritionists point to one study of American women that found high intakes of vitamin C reduced wrinkles by 11 per cent.
Vitamin C has also been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease – one study of almost 115,000 adults found that people with the highest amounts of citrus fruits in their diet had a 28 percent reduced risk of stroke.
Citrus fruits can also help to lower cholesterol levels in humans, though Brewer and Kellow recommend eating the whole orange rather than just the juice as most of the hesperidin, the substance thought to lower cholesterol, is found in the white pith and peel.
“Numerous studies show diets high in citrus fruits protect against many diseases, including cancer, arthritis, heart disease, cataracts, and diabetes. The evidence suggests citrus fruits may help reduce the risk of cancer of the oesophagus, mouth, larynx, pharynx, and stomach by 40-50 per cent. The protective nutrients of citrus fruits – fibre, vitamin C, potassium, folate and flavonoids – are located in different parts,” the nutritionists said.
