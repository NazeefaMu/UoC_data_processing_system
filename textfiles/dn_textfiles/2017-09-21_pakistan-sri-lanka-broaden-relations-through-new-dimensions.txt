Pakistan, Sri Lanka to broaden relations through new dimensions

Pakistan and Sri Lanka, while agreeing to broaden their historic relations through a new dimension, Pakistan's new Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi pledged his country’s continuous support to Sri Lanka.
This was during a meeting held between Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and President Maithripala Sirisena on September 19 to coincide with the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. While recalling the two countries’ historic bilateral relations, the two leaders reiterated the importance of further strengthening their bonds and friendship. President Sirisena recalled the cooperation extended by the Pakistan government during the war and in the aftermath of natural disasters in Sri Lanka. President Sirisena admired the support extended by former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during his tenure as the Prime Minister and said he is one of his close friends.
Pakistan and Sri Lanka, while noting their huge potential for deeper and broader ties in defence, trade and economic ties, decided that both countries need to explore new avenues for enhanced cooperation.
President Maithripala Sirisena expressed his gratitude to the Pakistan government for extending its support at the UN Human Rights Council.
The two leaders agreed to work together to promote the tourism industry and to further strengthen defence cooperation between two countries.
