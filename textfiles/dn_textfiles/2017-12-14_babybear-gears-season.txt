Babybear gears up for the season

Babybear® Boutique is offering all clients a savings of 20% up to 40% for the season in celebration of their first Anniversary.
Babybear® comprises a wide range of baby essentials needed to care for your baby or toddler such as clothing items, toys, diapers, travel strollers, feeding gear, swimwear and extensive range of baby-proofing products. The exquisite baby and toddler products available at the store are sourced from Australia, UK, Europe, America and are all designed to offer maximum comfort, safety and quality for your baby.
One of the most popular product ranges at the store is their exquisite bedding sets found at the world-renowned ‘Babies R Us’ stores and the educational toys section. The linen, pillows, customised cot mobiles, cradles and carrycots that come matched with all the accessories have also been a sensation among parents-to-be. Babybear®’s latest addition is a complete party solutions section that has everything from loot bags, cartoon-themed party needs to glow-in-the-dark accessories. A range of early education toys and books are also on offer to help parents develop their children’s reading and motor skills from the earliest possible age.
“Babybear® has become a cut above the rest through delivering the ‘Awe Factor’ as our clients, experience wonder and amazement that all the exquisite amenities they usually only see overseas or on TV or read about in magazines is actually available right here at the most affordable rates at Babybear®. This has been one of the keys to our success as people spread the word about our internationally acclaimed products that come at reasonable prices,” says Babybear®’s Managing Director/Co-Founder, Rae Devadason.
Babybear® also has plans to extend their stores to other areas of Sri Lanka in the near future through a franchise model and has eagerly been looking for partners to take the brand to more areas.
