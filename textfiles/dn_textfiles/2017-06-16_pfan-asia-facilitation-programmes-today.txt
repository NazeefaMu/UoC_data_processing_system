PFAN ASIA facilitation  programmes today

PFAN ASIA, the private finance advisory network operational in the Asian region has now taken the initiative to launch its facilitation programmes for Sri Lanka as the Asia Forum for Climate and Clean Energy Financing, AFCCEF8 Road Show, to be held in Sri Lanka today (Friday) at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.
PFAN is a promotional agency to bring together developers of renewable energy projects and potential investors.
There is no charge made by PFAN for this facilitation process. RE project developers of Sri Lanka have participated in their programmes previously and believe that this is an opportunity that the RE developers in Sri Lanka should explore.
PFAN is now accepting proposals from the South and South East Asian Region for participating in the Eight Asia Forum for Clean Energy Financing (AFCEF-8) Business Plan Competition.
The Forum is due to commence at 4.30 pm with the participation of renewable energy developers and consultants in all the sectors including biomass, wind, solar, biogas, minihydro, and more.
