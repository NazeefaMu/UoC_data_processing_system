Ven. Sobitha makes his last journey today

The cremation of Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera who crusaded for a society where justice and fairplay reign supreme, will take place today at the parliamentary grounds.
Ven. Sobitha Thera who fought tirelessly for justice was admired and endearingly respected by people of all walks of life for his fearless views on socio-political issues confronting the country.
The Thera was committed to ushering peace and reconciliation in the country by maintaining a close relationship with the clergy of other denominations. His entire monkhood was devoted for the resolution of issues faced by the country from time to time.
The Thera was among the first who rushed to the terrorists threatened villages in the North and East with lorry loads of relief items during the height of terrorist activities. He provided assistance to people of all communities living in those villages.
The Thera pioneered a change in the political system to ensure that democracy, good governance and the rule of law prevailed in the country. Thousands of people kept streaming in to the Naga Viharaya to get a final glimpse of this erudite monk who left an indelible imprint in the annals of the country's history.
