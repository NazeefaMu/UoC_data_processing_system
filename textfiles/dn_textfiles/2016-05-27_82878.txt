Colombian    saxophonist    to serenade  guests

 
Talented Colombian saxophonist Dumbira Lippez is all set to entertain guests at The Lattice of Taj Samudra, Colombo’s stylish lobby lounge. Dumbira will perform at the Lattice from 6pm to 10pm from Tuesday to Sunday and 1pm to 3pm every Sunday during the Brunch at the Latitude.
Inspired by the most evocative and expressive of wind instruments Dumbira grew up swooning with her saxophone. Since then it has been a successful journey in the music industry for the vibrant, young, lively and talented saxophonist. Dumbira has performed at many prominent hotels in South America, Europe, US, Middle East and India. Her most recent stint was at the Taj Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad, India.
Being quite a crowd pleaser, Sri Lankan music lovers can look forward to her music of popular yesteryear hits such as Careless Whispers, Baker Street, I Just Called to Say I Love You and Nothings Gonna Change My Love For You as well as modern hits.
Dumbira will perform Tuesday to Sunday in the evenings. The Lattice is a perfect venue to meet friends, hold informal business meetings or to enjoy some soothing music while having a relaxed evening with family. At the lobby lounge guests are spoiled for choice with a wide range of coffees and fine Sri Lankan teas, beverages along with an array of delectable snacks. The large and spacious area lit with natural light also has an elaborate English Tea service with a Sri Lankan twist along with a bar serving a variety of cocktails. The casual but chic venue is open daily from 9am to 11pm.
