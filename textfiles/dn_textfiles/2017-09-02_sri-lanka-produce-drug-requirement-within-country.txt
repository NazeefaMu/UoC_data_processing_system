Sri Lanka to produce drug requirement within the country

Sri Lanka expects to produce 100 percent of its drug requirement within the country by 2020, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, 85 percent of the country's drug requirement will be produced within the country by 2019. A total of 38 companies have already signed agreements with the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) to produce drugs in Sri Lanka. He was addressing the gathering after opening the second drug (antibiotic injection vials) manufacturing company in Sri Lanka at Horana recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the drugs produced jointly will be purchased by the Government for a period of 15 years and the drugs produced independently will be purchased by the Government for a period of 10 years. The first drug manufacturing company opened in Kandy and this second company produces injections.
The additional drug production of the country will be exported. The project will save a lot of money for the country.
The new company is a good example against the accusations made by the opposition stating that this Government does not carry out development work. The Government has offered the the people an opportunity to live freely even while criticizing the Government. Some people see this `Maithree Governance' as something wrong, this idea will change soon. The President and Prime Minister will create a `Maithree Governance', he added. Navesta Pharmaceuticals has invested Rs. 1.4 billion for the project under BOI approval. It has created around 100 direct employment and around 500 indirect employment opportunities. Annually it will supply around 50 million injection vials to the state health sector.
