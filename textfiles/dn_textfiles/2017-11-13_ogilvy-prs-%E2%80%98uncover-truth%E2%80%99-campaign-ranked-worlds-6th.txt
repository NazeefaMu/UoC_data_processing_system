Ogilvy PR's ‘Uncover the Truth’ campaign ranked world's 6th

The Holmes Report has ranked Ogilvy Public Relations Sri Lanka‘s ‘Uncover the Truth’ campaign for Transparency International Sri Lanka, as the 6th best PR campaign in the world for 2017, after it won a Gold Award at the SABRE Global Awards, held in Miami, USA recently.
The SABRE Global Award recognised the 40 top public relations campaigns of the year out of 5,000 entries submitted from around the world and ranked the campaigns according to their effectiveness from numbers forty to one.
A month ago, the campaign topped the SABRE Asia Pacific Awards, a first for a Sri Lanka PR agency, when it won the ‘Best in Show’ Platinum Award. It further won a Gold Award in the ‘Charities and Not-for-Profit’ category at the SABRE Asia Pacific Awards and two Certificates of Excellence at the APAC In2 SABRE Awards.
The agency’s globally recognized campaign for Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), focused on educating the Sri Lankan public on the Right to Information Act, which came into effect on February 4, 2017, after nearly two decades awaiting parliamentary sign-off. The PR campaign titled ‘Uncover the Truth’, was executed in partnership with the Neth FM radio station and its online channels, to promote the Act’s usage among Sri Lankans.

We are extremely honoured by this recognition and are proud to have won this accolade for the country.”
