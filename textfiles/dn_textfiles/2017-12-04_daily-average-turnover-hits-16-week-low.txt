Point of view
Equities closed flat this week as investors adopted a watchful stance in the absence of any major economic/market developments and as concerns over delays in LG polls and the lack of clarity over certain policy measures weighed down sentiment.
The broadshare ASPI closed the week largely unchanged at 6411.8 points (6413.6 points last week) as an 11.9 point loss on Tuesday was mostly offset by a 10.1 point gain over the rest of the week.
Dull activity however, pushed turnover levels to a 3-month low, and daily average turnover levels fell to a paltry LKR0.46Bn this week, the lowest since August when it hit a low of LKR0.45Bn. Low HNI and Institutional participation also contributed to the general sluggishness, with crossings for the week accounting for just 31% of total market turnover cf. last week’s 36%. Markets over the month of November have fallen 3.1%, wiping off the 2.8% gain in October and the 0.7% gain in the Index in September.
Flat earnings performance over the September quarter along with policy uncertainty post the national budget have contributed the Index’s weaker performance in November.
Corporate earnings of 95% of the market totaled LKR60Bn in the Sept’17 quarter, unchanged from the LKR60.2Bn recorded in the Sept’16 quarter. Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain largely unchanged as they continue to consolidate at the current levels.
Exports surpass $1 bn for third consecutive month 
Exports in September surpassed the $1Bn mark for the 3rd consecutive month, driven by i) stronger textiles/garment exports and, ii) the re-export of petroleum products which rose both due to higher price and volume.
Export gains were minimized however by higher imports, which grew at double digit levels for the third consecutive month on the back of higher fuel imports (for thermal power generation) and base metals (for cement & construction).
The trade deficit consequently widened in September 2017 to $656Mn (cf. $610Mn in Sept’16) and pushed up the cumulative trade deficit during the first nine months of 2017 to $6840Mn from $6125Mn in Sept’16.
Performance in other major inflows to the current account meanwhile remained lower in Sep’17 as lower tourist earnings (-2.3% Y-o-Y) on the back of lower tourist arrivals and declining worker remittances (-16.7% Y-o-Y) on the back of slow growth and geo-political instability in the Middle-East dampened inflows.
Financial flows to Sri Lanka however, continued to remain strong over Sept, with foreign investments in G-secs continuing strongly for the 7th consecutive month and helping offset the impact of the net outflow from the CSE on the back of a one-off transaction in secondary markets.
Gross official reserves at end-Sept consequently increased to $7.3Bn (ie: 4.2 months of imports), helping the LKR stabilize and record a relatively modest depreciation of 2.5% YTD against the USD.
