Lanka Tiles expand operations to India

Lanka Tiles recently entered into a successful strategic partnership with an Indian tile manufacturer Ambani Vitrified to meet the rapidly growing demand for wall and floor tiles in the local market.
The successful venture has seen Lanka Tiles placing a large order with the expectation of releasing more quantities of 24” x 24” tiles to the market in order to meet the escalating market demand. These tiles will also be complied with the standards imposed by the Sri Lanka Standards Institute and will pertain the SLS mark.
Lanka Walltiles and Lanka Tiles Managing Director Mahendra Jayasekera said to keep up with the increasing demand they have decided to partner with one of the best tile producers in India. The tiles will be produced in India but they will be sold under our brand name Lanka Tiles”.
Jayasekara said they have stationed a few of our employees at the plant based in Gujarat to ensure that the tiles are produced according to our strict guidelines, specifications and standards.” Accordingly, the key objective of the new venture between Lanka Tiles and Ambani Vitrified is to bridge the gap between the supply of good quality tiles and the demand for same in the local market and to ensure Lanka Tiles meets the rapidly growing market demand.
