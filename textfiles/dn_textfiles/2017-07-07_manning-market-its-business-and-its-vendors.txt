Manning Market: Its business and its vendors

Mohamed Saleem Mohideen sat with his chickens at Stall No. 505, at Manning Market. A few metres away a truck loaded with more crates of chicken was preparing to take off, its contents squawking and ruffling their feathers. He filled in a balance sheet.
This is the rhythm of Mohideen’s days: Buying chickens, selling chickens and butchering chickens. They are the actions that make up the billions of rupees that flow through the markets of Pettah every day, the economic heart of Sri Lanka.
“I’ve been here ten years,” Mohideen told me, as he put down his pencil. “Business is very good.”
Discovering Pettah
Pettah began as a market outside of a Colonial Fort, which was built by the Portuguese and then taken over by the Dutch and later the British. The name comes from the Tamil word pettai, which means literally, the town outside the Fort. Much of the Fort had been demolished over the years, but the market had only grown.
Today, the historic buildings of the Fort are being rehabilitated, housing new luxury hotels and restaurants. But Pettah remains a place for different types of people. You could buy pretty much anything or everything in Pettah, from cell phones, to textiles, to whole sides of beef.
I arrived in Colombo last week from the United States. In the cities I have lived back home, we don’t have big open-air markets such as the ones in Pettah. My fellow reporters said I had to go see it. So I left my news desk at the Daily News on Monday afternoon to explore Pettah for myself.
Getting there was very tough for a clueless Suddha. I had to dodge buses and trucks, while disappointing a few tuk-tuk drivers. I followed men hunched over heavy loads of onions and egg plants as they plunged through crowds. The streets began to get more and more clogged and I began bumping into people clumsily. At the traffic’s thickest choke point on Olcott Mawatha, I turned into Manning Market, Pettah’s main food bazaar.
It was 11 O’clock in the morning and the early rush was over. Still, people bargained over prices, and trucks squeezed through the narrow streets, driving fresh meat and produce out to restaurants, food stalls and grocery stores of Colombo.
In a cool store room, Asoka Dalpadadu was selling a little bit of everything. He walked me past bags of beets, limes, carrots, and mangoes.
“It’s better here than the Food City,” he told me, showing off a huge bundle of leeks.
Dragging on a cigarette, he tried to get me to buy a whole kilo of eggplants.
Through Asoka’s shop, Manning Market winds backwards and is organized by types of food. I followed a line of pineapples to a row of green onions. Behind them were bananas, kilos and kilos of them stored in a warehouse to stay fresh for tomorrow’s market. Workers misted the bananas, which were lying around in varying shades of ripeness, with spray bottles. One banana seller told me that they sell every day of the week, all year long, except on Poya days: the Buddhist holiday that falls on the full moon of each month.
Best chicken around
Passing the bananas, I met Mohideen and his fellow chicken-sellers. They occupy the back corner of Manning Market. There are five of them and they are all Muslims, he told me. They butcher the chickens Halaal-style, cutting the throat and draining out the blood of every hen.
Mohideen said he sells his chickens throughout the city. Some might be sold in other markets, some might be made into chicken curry at local food stalls, called “hotels” because of the late hours they keep.
Mohammad Fais, another vendor, came over from two stalls down for a chat.
They insisted that all chicken sellers were friends of each other. For an American, this is hard to understand. I can’t imagine five shop owners in Boston or New York, all selling the same thing, at the same hour, every day of the week, not trying to undercut the others’ business.
“We all have our own clients,” Mohideen said. “We are all friends.”
The heat of the day was climbing and the chickens were getting hot. Eranddani Wijesinha, who works with Mohideen, doused the birds with a bucket of water.
I decided that I too needed to cool off.
A city of contradictions
I left Manning Market and walked back onto the main road. Across the street, I watched people take off their shoes to enter a Buddhist temple. The temple was next to the Federation of Self-Employees market, another sub-market of Pettah. A gleaming white Buddha statue sat on the temple’s roof. Below him, vendors sold an assortment of watches, cell phones, pants and bags.
I walked down the street further, passed a shop where men bet on horse races and turned into St. Philip Neri Church. The old Catholic church was painted in faded colours, in contrast to the bright pastels of other shops. About a dozen people sat in its dim sanctuary looking silently ahead. Six candles burned on the front altar. Towards the back of the church, a man was making an offering to a statue of St. Anthony.
Somehow, amidst all the noises and heat of the markets, people found a space to pray.
I stepped out of the church and into bright sunlight. Across the street from me, the glimmering, half-constructed blossom of the ultra-luxury Lotus Tower shot high above the stalls of Manning Market. Pettah teemed all around me.Buses blew hot wind across my face, the sounds of their engines mixing with amplified voices of men calling selling lottery tickets.
To me, all these sensations seemed contradictory, since business and worship, hot and cold, shouting and smiles. And yet Pettah’s markets run day in and day out just like this, fuelling the life of Colombo.
It is a city I do not know. But I hope to know it better. So I walked back to office, opened my computer and began working.
