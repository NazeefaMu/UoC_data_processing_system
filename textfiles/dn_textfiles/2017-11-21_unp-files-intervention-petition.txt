UNP files intervention petition

United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Kabir Hashim yesterday filed an intervention petition in the Court of Appeal of Appeal against the writ petition filed by six electors who challenged the legality of the Gazette Notification issued by Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government on the Delimitation Committee Report with regard to the boundaries in respect of Local Authorities.
This petition was filed through Counsel Naveen Hettiyadurage, seeking the Court’s permission to intervene into the writ petition. The petition is to be taken up again on November 22.
Six electors representing several Local Government institutions have filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal, challenging the legality of a Gazette Notification dated February 17, 2017, amending the boundaries, number of members and the constituents in respect of Local Authorities.
