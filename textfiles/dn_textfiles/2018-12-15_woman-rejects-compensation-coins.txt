Woman rejects compensation in coins

A woman was given a Rs. 5,000 compensation in coins by a suspect against whom she lodged a complaint in the Wennappuwa Police that he had attacked her.
Wennappuwa police sources said the woman had lodged a complaint that a man had attacked her while they were disputing on a issue.
The accused, in the preliminary inquiry, had agreed to give her a compensation of Rs. 5,000 the following day.
When she arrived at the police station to collect the compensation, the suspect had given her a sack of Rs. 2 coins in the presence of the Wennappuwa Police OIC.
She, however, rejected the sack in shame. The issue was settled when a businessman who arrived at the police station had accepted the sack and gave her a Rs. 5,000 note.
