Over 1,500 in Bandagiriya sans drinking water

Nearly 1,506 farmer families in Bandagiriya settlement scheme in Hambantota have fallen into dire straits due to the lack of safe drinking water.
They say the water supplied through the Bandagiriya community water supply scheme is brackish and cannot be used for drinking proposes.
Moreover, their pots and pans, and clothes are soiled when washed in the water supplied.
Although the Hambantota Divisional Secretariat had taken steps to deploy a bowser to distribute water, residents in one section of the scheme had not received it.
They request authorities to provide them with water from the Ruhunupura project.
