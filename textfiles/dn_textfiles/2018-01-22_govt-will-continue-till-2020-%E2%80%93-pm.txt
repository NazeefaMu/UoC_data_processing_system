Govt. will continue till 2020 – PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that regardless of the challenges, the unity government will continue until 2020.
While noting that persons involved in corruption and malpractices in the past were trying to change the Good Governance government, the Premier said that they will never be able to realise their goal.
“The Wanni Hathpaththuwa Development plan will also be launched this year,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister was speaking at a UNP election rally at Nikaweratiya town yesterday.
The Premier said the Sinharaja Range Development project too would come into operation soon. He said the Wanni Hathpaththuwa development plan would be implemented through the Wayamba Development Ministry.
“If the large area reserved in Galagamuwa for an elephant habitat proved insufficient to tackle the wild elephant menace causing undue pressure on the people of Wayamba, more elephant zones will have to be demarcated to find a solution to it. Tourist Zones could be developed around such elephant zones,”the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister who promised to provide necessary funding for dredging neglected tanks and reservoirs in the Wayamba, said that drip irrigation systems too should be developed in the region.
