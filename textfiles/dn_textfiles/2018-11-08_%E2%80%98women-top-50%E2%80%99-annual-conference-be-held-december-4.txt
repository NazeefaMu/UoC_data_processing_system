Only less than 20% of women are occupied in the government administrative positions and less than 10% are engaged in the senior management, said Sulochana Segera, Founder/Chairperson, Women in Management (WIM).
However in the private sector more women are get involved in the decision making process of companies.
The ‘Women Top 50’ Professional and Career Women annual conference will be held on December 4, 2018 at the Galle Face hotel, Colombo. The conference is organized by the WIM under the theme ‘Price we pay for successes.
“Through these conferences we are hoping to increase women participation in the administrative sector of the country.”
She said that the conference will not only be limited to women but for both genders. “It is also open for not only the women who are on top but for young ladies who are newcomers to their career.” The conference includes eight sessions with topics chosen by various researches conducted by Universities. “Even in our history the earliest queens of the world are from Sri Lanka and even the first woman Prime Minister is also from our country. This shows that Sri Lankan women have good leadership qualities,” said Ajith Rohana, DIG Traffic and Road Safety.
He also highlighted that at the time of origin of the Sri Lankan Police, Women were not recruited.
After 1957, Women were recruited to the Police with arising of the need. “I expect that there is a huge possibility to appoint a woman Inspector General of Police in Sri Lanka within 15-20 years of time”. Currently women Police officers are not limited to police stations but are working in the field now. They have been given the training required. “Although 51% of the Sri Lankan population are women, their engagement in business administration is still not up to potential”, said Kasturi Chellaraja Wilson, MD Hemas Pharmaceuticals Diagnostics and MD Hemas Logistics and Maritime Cluster .
She further said that the real stories behind the success of the women who are to be recognized at the conference will be revealed. Through this they wish to make a huge impact on the society.
