Institution Heads urged to provide creche facility for breastfeeding mothers

The Heads of some state institutions do not understand that their breastfeeding employees need a creche facility. Some mothers give up breastfeeding on misinformation and feed their infants with milk powder, Health Services Acting Director General Dr. J.M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing the media at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said some state institutions have provided creche centre facilities for their breastfeeding employees. Creche centre facilities are available in some private banks. Only the State sector offers 84 working days of maternity leave, he said.
According to Dr. Bandara, a request has been made by the Health Ministry from estate sector authorities to provide creche facilities for their breastfeeding employees.
"When a country moves forward, it needs to protect and develop human capital. This is why we need to ensure that every infant gets breast milk which prevents diseases and ensure immunity," Bandara said.
