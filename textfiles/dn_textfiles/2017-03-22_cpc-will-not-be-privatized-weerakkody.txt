CPC will not be privatized: Weerakkody

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation will not be privatized. As a minister representing the SLFP, I will not stand on the side of privatization, said Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody.
Addressing a press conference in Galle, Minister Weerakkody said they have driven efficiency and transparency into the management of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, enabling it to register a profit of Rs. 80 billion for the first time in its history, in 2016.
Several other measures were also underway to further uplift the Corporation into a profitable entity. A fuel supply modernization programme is currently underway. Four new machines had been imported for this purpose, and tenders will also be called for the modernization of the aviation fuel dump too, he said.
