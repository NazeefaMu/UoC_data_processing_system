Kareena launches her  signature line of makeup

Wearing makeup is one of the most personal things we do. What we wear and how we wear it, conveys a lot about who we are and what we’re portraying. Makeup is an integral part of our lives.
It could be our favourite shade of lipstick, the way we line our eyes or highlight our cheekbones – it’s more than just a beauty ritual, it’s an everyday thing.
And Kareena Kapoor Khan has taken this every day ritual and left a bit of her in it. How? Kareena Kapoor Khan and Lakmé got together and co-created Kareena Kapoor Khan by Lakmé Absolute – a range of makeup that’s bold, fun and oh-so happy! This season’s theme ‘Shades of a Diva’ comes alive in each product.
This is Kareena’s first makeup line and she has co-created and curated this fabulous line of products. This line is very personal – each shade of lipstick reflects parts of her personality – each product is made keeping a bit of Kareena in mind – this range is bold, beautiful and oh-so Bebo. And, this line includes a range of new products such as cheek contours, face contours and pout definers – products that Lakmé has introduced for the first time ever. Vogue
