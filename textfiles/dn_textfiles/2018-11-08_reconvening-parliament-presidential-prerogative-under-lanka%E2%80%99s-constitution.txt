“Lord Naseby’s statement is “objective” and “non- interfering”
Reconvening Parliament, a Presidential  prerogative under Lanka’s Constitution  - Veteran foreign news analyst Mohan Samaranayaka

Veteran foreign news analyst and critic Mohan Samaranayaka yesterday said no international state has the right to tell Sri Lanka to reconvene its Parliament.
“If any foreign state, institution or lawmaker called on the Head of State of Sri Lanka to reconvene Parliament, they are intervening in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of Sri Lanka,” said Mohan Samaranayaka,”“They are acting in a manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.”
Samaranayaka said this on being asked his take on the recent statements issued by The Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland and the US Department of State’s Spokeswoman Nauert Heather and some embassies, calling on the Sri Lanka’s President to reconvene Parliament as soon as possible.
He said it is the nature of the hegemonic powers to use their privileged positions to influence weaker countries subtly rather than forcefully in their interest which they do through cultural means and economic power, and rest on a mixture of consent and coercion.
“Hegemonic powers spread their influence masquerading as the international community,” he explained.
“Of those statement made by lawmakers and leaders of those hegemonic organisations, which often exercise their hegemonic influence on countries, I must say,the statement issued Tuesday by Lord Naseby, Michael Morris, Conservative Member of the House of Lords, former MP in the UK Parliament, has been the only objective and non-intrusive statement come into being so far,” he said.
Naseby has said that it was not for foreigners to to interpret the Sri Lankan Constitution.
“He went on to say that he was sure that President Maithripala Sirisena, as the Executive acted in the best interest of the country,” Samaranayaka said. “He had said that as far as he could see nothing unconstitutional has happened and it is unusual.”
He had further said they had had unusual things in the UK and that they had a five year fixed term which was cut short in his tweeted video.
Samaranayaka said that Lord Naseby was just about right.
Asked why he thinks that hegemonic countries act in their interest over issues affecting our country, he said, “ They have their economic, geopolitical, trade and cultural agenda which they usually set up subtly than forcibly.”
“Where were these countries when the previous government of sacked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was dragging its fet and preventing the holding of Local Government and provincial elections in the country?” he asked.
“Did they say anything against when they established an opposition with 16 members as against 52 members in Parliament?” he concluded.
