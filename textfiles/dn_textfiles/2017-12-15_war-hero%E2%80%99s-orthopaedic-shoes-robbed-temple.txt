War hero’s orthopaedic shoes robbed at temple

A pair of orthopaedic shoes belonging to a disabled war hero has been robbed when he visited the Horana Raja Maha Viharaya to pay homage to the Bodhi, recently.
The war hero, named Piyal Jayasinghe, a resident of the Dombagoda War Hero Village, earns a living by driving a three wheeler transporting schoolchildren.
He said he was disabled during the Mullaitivu battle after stepping on a Johnny mine. After retiring from service, he had to wear orthopaedic shoes to overcome his disability.
However, he had bought a three wheeler to earn a living by transporting schoolchildren. When he visited the Horana town, he had made a trip over to the Horana Raja Maha Viharaya to pay homage to the Bodhi there. He had removed his shoes at the entrance and gone into the bodhi premises to pay homage. After returning to board the vehicle, he had found that his shoes are missing.
He is disheartened to think that unscrupulous people did not spare even a disabled war hero in their mad rush to make a fast buck.
