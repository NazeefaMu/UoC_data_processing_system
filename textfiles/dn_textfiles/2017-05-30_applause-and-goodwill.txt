Applause and goodwill

Last week Cinnamon City Hotels hosted a party at Cinnamon Grand. It was a party to show their goodwill and appreciation towards the loyal clientele of Cinnamon City Hotels for the years of trust they have placed in the services offered by one of the most loved hotel chains in Colombo.
The party was attended by a host of clients and it was a night to remember with music and dancing and of course fantastic food and drinks.
Sector Head Cinnamon City Hotels Rohan Karr was present enlivening the audience with his witticism and charm.
“This will truly be a fantastic evening. I truly appreciate all of you being here. This is a party to say thank you for all the support you have extended throughout the years for Cinnamon City Hotels.
What makes me so proud is to have your loyalty towards Cinnamon Hotels. All of you have contributed towards the success of Cinnamon City Hotels in one way or the other. For that I sincerely thank you. You guys are our partners.
And I would love to see you contributing towards our success in the future in a bigger way. This is your evening to say thank you so much.
The way we run this business is going to change and the industry is going to change, the business clientele in this country is going to change with more and more competitors coming in and that for sure is a good thing. There are a lot of international brands coming into Colombo.
It gives me great pleasure to say that Cinnamon City Hotels will still be the best even with all these guys around. So this is an opportunity to say continue your support for Cinnamon City Hotels. You will be working with the best in the City. We will do things better. Our products and services will get better,” said Karr.
