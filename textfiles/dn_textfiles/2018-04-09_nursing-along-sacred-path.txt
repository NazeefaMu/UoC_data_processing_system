Nursing along the sacred path

An influx of Buddhist and other devotees were witnessed at Sri Pada during the recent long weekend. St. John’s Ambulance Association and Brigade of Sri Lanka together with the National Hospital Accident Service, school children, teachers and volunteers held a health camp to tend to the young and the old who fall sick on the arduous trek to the sacred footprint and the shrine.
The place is venerated by Buddhists, Hindus and Christians alike. Daily News Staff Photographer Sulochana Gamage captured moments of this valuable service.
