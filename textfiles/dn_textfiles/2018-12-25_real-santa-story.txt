The real Santa story!

What are the perennial symbols of Christmas which comes on December 25 every year? If you answered Christmas trees and Santa Claus, you can be forgiven for forgetting that Christmas is actually the day we celebrate the both of Jesus Christ, Son of God.
A recent survey conducted in the USA found that a large number of children actually think Christmas marks the birthday of that jovial character clad in red, riding on a sled pulled by a herd of reindeer, distributing gifts among well-behaved children: none other than Santa Claus. Even in Sri Lanka, which does not experience any kind of winter, one can see a good number of Santas wandering about in shopping malls and other areas.
Who really is Santa Claus? Is he a completely mythical character or someone who actually existed once upon a time? There is a healthy debate on this point, though there is no doubt whatsoever that he adds an element of colour and amusement to the festivities. What we do know is that region he is supposed to come from - Lapland – actually exists. Lapland is Finland’s northernmost region, a sparsely populated area bordering Sweden, Norway, Russia and the Baltic Sea. It is known for its vast subarctic wilderness, ski resorts and natural phenomena including the Midnight Sun and the Northern Lights. And oh, the official animal and symbol of the region is naturally the reindeer, Santa’s trusted work “horse”.
Santa’s Village
The Finnish Tourist Board says that “Rovaniemi is the capital of Finnish Lapland and the hometown of Santa Claus”. There is a Santa’s Village in the region which you can visit. Children worldwide write to Santa at this address and even come here from all over the world to witness Santa’s official departure on December 23 every year to distribute gifts. “Santa Claus spends his time at the Santa Claus Village every day of the year to take care of his mission in life; to enhance the well-being of children and the kindness of grown-ups, as well as spreading the message of love and goodwill and the Christmas Spirit across the globe,” says the Finnish Tourist Board.
With that out of the way, we can dwell further on who Santa Claus is. This is the standard textbook definition of Santa that I came across in several websites while doing research for this article: “Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, Kris Kringle, Father Christmas, or simply Santa, is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of well-behaved children on Christmas Eve and the early morning hours of Christmas Day.”
To answer our question on whether Santa Claus was a real person or at least based on a real person, the answer is “yes”. The legend of Santa Claus can be traced back hundreds of years to a monk named St. Nicholas. It is believed that Nicholas was born sometime around 280 A.D. in Patara, near Myra in modern-day Turkey. Much admired for his piety and kindness, St. Nicholas became the subject of many legends over time. It is said that he gave away all of his inherited wealth and travelled the countryside helping the poor and the sick. Over the course of many years, Nicholas’s popularity spread and he became known as the protector of children and sailors. His feast day is celebrated on the anniversary of his death, December 6. By the Renaissance period, St. Nicholas was the most popular saint in Europe.
Saint Nicholas
The name Santa Claus evolved from his Dutch nickname, Sinter Klaas, a shortened form of Sint Nikolaas (Dutch for Saint Nicholas). In 1804, John Pintard, a member of the New York Historical Society, distributed woodcuts of St. Nicholas at the society’s annual meeting. The background of the engraving contains Santa images including stockings filled with toys and fruit hung over a fireplace. Stores began to advertise Christmas shopping in 1820, and by the 1840s, newspapers were creating separate sections for holiday advertisements, which often featured images of the newly-popular Santa Claus. In 1841, thousands of children visited a Philadelphia, USA shop to see a life-size Santa Claus model.
Then stores began to attract children with the lure of a peek at a “live” Santa Claus. In the early 1890s, the Salvation Army needed money to pay for the free Christmas meals they provided to needy families. They began dressing up unemployed men in Santa Claus suits and sending them into the streets of New York to solicit donations. This was a great success that continues to this day.
In 1822, Clement Clarke Moore, wrote a rather long Christmas poem for his three daughters entitled “An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas.” Moore’s poem is largely responsible for our modern image of Santa Claus as a portly figure and the supernatural ability to ascend a chimney. Although some of Moore’s images were probably copied from elsewhere, his poem helped popularize the now-familiar image of a Santa Claus who went from house to house on Christmas Eve, preferably via the chimney.
Modern image
“An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas” created a new icon. In 1881, political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore’s poem to create the first likeness that matches our modern image of Santa Claus. His cartoon, which appeared in Harper’s Weekly, depicted Santa as a rotund, cheerful man with a full, white beard, holding a sack laden with toys for lucky children. It is Nast who gave Santa his bright red suit trimmed with white fur, North Pole workshop, elves, and of course, his wife, Mrs. Claus.
And if you have ever heard the song “my grandma got run over by a reindeer” you know that Santa has some super fast friends for his delivery side of things. But there were only eight in the original herd – the ninth and the most famous one was “born” much later. The red-nosed wonder was the creation of Robert L. May, a copywriter at the Montgomery Ward department store. In 1939, May wrote a Christmas-themed story-poem to help bring holiday traffic into his store. Using a similar rhyme pattern to Moore’s “‘Twas the Night Before Christmas,” May told the story of Rudolph, a young reindeer who was teased by the other deer because of his large, glowing, red nose. But, When Christmas Eve turned misty and Santa was thinking how to deliver gifts, the red nosed reindeer saved Santa by leading the sleigh by the light of his red nose. Rudolph’s message - that given the opportunity, a liability can be turned into an asset - proved very popular. Apart from the one I have mentioned, there are many songs about this red-nosed delivery expert.
The next time you see a Santa somewhere, just remember that he is literally a legendary character who has done a lot more than distribute gifts among the world’s “good” children. Yes, today Santa has become very much a symbol of commercialism that sometimes overrides the very religious nature of Christmas in a money-oriented world, but one cannot disagree that he brings happiness to millions of children – and adults – in a world that needs a little bit of fun and frolic.
