Midwives’, PHIs’ uniforms to be changed

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has proposed to change the current uniforms of midwives and Public Health Inspectors' (PHI), a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the Minister had proposed to change the current outdated uniforms of these two categories of health staff to a uniform to suit present requirements.
The Midwives' Association has handed over their proposals in this regard. The final decision on the two new uniforms will be taken by the Health Minister after receiving proposals from all trade unions and holding discussions on the proposals, he added.
