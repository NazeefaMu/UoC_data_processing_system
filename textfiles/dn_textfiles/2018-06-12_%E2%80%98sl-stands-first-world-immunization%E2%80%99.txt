‘SL stands first in the world in immunization’

Sri Lanka stands first in the world when it comes to immunization, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, Sri Lanka’s immunization programme has achieved a success of 99.9 percent. USA stands just below Sri Lanka, achieving 99.2 percent.
The Minister was addressing the gathering after opening the new Child and Maternal Health Clinic in Warakagoda, recently. The facility was built at a cost of Rs. 10 million. The clinic will serve 3,500 people in the area.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that UNICEF reports show that Sri Lanka’s infant and maternal mortality rates are significantly low and in parallel with two rich countries in the world, USA and Kuwait. This is because of the development of the primary health care service in Sri Lanka.
Today, there is no limit to the expenses made for cancer patients and all required drugs are provided to them. This is the real meaning of free health service. But in the past, the value of human life was measured by rupees and cents and there were limits to the expenses made for cancer drugs and treatment, the minister added.
