Anthonian and Colts stalwart Ranjith Samarasekera no more

Former St Anthony’s College sportsman and stalwart of Colombo Colts Cricket Club Ranjith Samarasekera passed away in Colombo yesterday following a brief illness at the age of 76.
Samarasekera lost his memory and was confined to bed after suffering from a fall in his bathroom two years ago. He was unable to communicate with people and his health gradually deteriorated.
Samarasekera was an outstanding sportsman at St Anthony’s College excelling at athletics and cricket being one time Public Schools javelin champion. He was the first recipient of the Double Eagle award (athletics and cricket), the highest prize presented by the school for sports.
At cricket Samarasekera was an all-rounder. He bowled left-arm leg-spin and was an excellent close in fielder in addition to his batting. He was a contemporary of ACM Lafir, the former All-Ceylon cricketer and opening bat and represented his school from 1955-58.
“Ranjith came to St Anthony’s from Maris Stella Negombo and gave his heart and soul to the old boys’ welfare activities at school and went out of his way to organize events,” said Lafir in tribute to a former team mate. “He even at times neglected his business to attend to school activities. He was a loyal Anthonian.”
Samarasekera was a stalwart at Colombo Colts CC whom he represented after school and was a live wire at all the clubs activities. He was coach, president and patron of the club. He was also a national cricket selector and during his period three former Anthonian cricketers played for Sri Lanka in Test cricket – Muthiah Muralitharan, Piyal Wijetunge and Ruwan Kalpage.
Samarasekera is best remembered for the role he played in the Saints Quadrangular – the flagship event of the Old Boys of the four premier Catholic schools in Sri Lanka - St. Anthony’s College Katugastota, St. Benedict’s College Kotahena, St. Joseph’s College Colombo and St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya.
Samarasekera, a pioneer member of the inaugural organizing committee in 1963 was a pillar of strength to the Saints Quadrangular convincing the OBUs of the four schools subsequent to the inaugural event to make it an annual event. He was present at every organizing committee since then.
At the 47th Saints Quadrangular in 2014 Samarasekera was honoured when a trophy named ‘Ranjith Samarasekera Challenge Trophy’ was donated by Old Peterites Sports Club to be awarded to the winners of the Rugby Sevens in recognition of his commitment and excellent service rendered by him towards the success of the tournament.
Samarasekara is survived by his three children – two sons and daughter.
His remains lie at AF Raymond’s funeral parlour Borella and his funeral takes place tomorrow at Borella Cemetary. – ST
