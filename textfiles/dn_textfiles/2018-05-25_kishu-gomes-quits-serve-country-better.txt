Kishu Gomes quits to serve country better

Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Chevron Lubricants Lanka Kishu Gomes who resigned from his post said that he did so as he felt that he could do more for the country in a different role.
Gomes said he was with Caltex for over 18 years and made the company from a less known entity to a household name.
“Within a short time I increased the revenue from Rs. 600 million to 3.5 billion with a complete Sri Lanka management.”
He recalled that he first joined the multi nation Coca Cola and severed it for 11 years.
“While I was serving I saw a vacancy ad and decided to apply for Caltex and I was impressed in the manner in which I was interviewed for over two hours by a foreigner in a five star hotel.”
Soon after the interview I was told that I was selected and after two weeks I joined Caltex even though my financial package was lower than what I was getting. My family also supports me moving to the new job as they felt it was a challenge for me and I would be successful.”
He said that within a short period he rose up to the top slot of the company and remained there for over 18 years becoming the youngest and longest serving Managing Director of a multinational in the Sri Lankan history.”
My hard work was recognized and during that time there was a saying in the corporate sector that Kishu was Caltex and Caltex was Kishu.”
Gomes who has won several business awards including the best Sri Lankan in the business sector by Lions International.
He said that one year ago too, he wanted to resign but decided to stay on until last week. “I am proud of my history at Chevron and the fact that I was able to successfully manage it without any foreign management.”
Today Sri Lankan corporate brings down foreign CEOs and administrators to work in Sri Lanka and pay them around Rs. Six to 20 million monthly while sending Sri Lankan house wives and unskilled workers overseas for jobs for around Rs. 40,000. “I am the shining example to say that Sri Lankans does not need foreign CEO to manage local businesses.”
Though Sri Lanka boasts of a 95.5% literacy rate the education is not focused towards fulfilling the requirements of the current demands of work. The education syllabuses are outdated.
“For this the politicians of successive governments are responsible as they have not fine-tuned the education sector to meet neither the present nor future employee demands.”
Gomes emotionally pointed out that about 25, 000 schoolchildren in Sri Lanka in rural areas have to travel round 10 kilo meters per day to school.
“Out of this number 25% of children walk barefoot to school and don’t have a luxury to eat in the morning. They only have their first meal at 3 30 p.m.”
He said that the country cannot expect politicians to create a better tomorrow for them as successive governments since independence have failed in this regard.
“I am hoping to actively get involved in helping to change this scenario in the future.”
Chevron said that Rochana Kaul will be replacing Gomes with intimidate effect in an acting capacity.
