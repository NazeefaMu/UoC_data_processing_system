New importance to the Message of Mihintale

The Poson Festival stands out as the beginning of a new civilization and culture in this country based on the teachings of the Buddha. The more than one million Buddhists who travelled to the several important shrines to participate in religious rituals, listen to Bana preaching, and worship at these shrines show the importance of Poson in the cultural being of Sri Lanka.
In the context of the crises the country has faced in recent times, and the necessity to overcome situations that lead to such crises, both social and political, as well as be ready to face up to natural disaster that has been in focus in recent weeks, there is a major expectation from the Poson festivities. It is the hope that the Poson Festival observances would not be confined to rituals, but lead to the stronger infusion of Buddhist thinking into society, in a manner that would enrich our social values, bringing about a sea change of attitudes that would cover individual life styles, as well as the tasks of politics and governance in the country.
Many have observed that we are going through a phase in society when religious teaching is increasingly confined to rituals and day-to-day practices of convenience, with less of the deeper and richer meaning of Buddhist teaching. The significance of Poson is in reviving the acceptance of Buddhist teaching and values brought by the Arahat Mahinda that will help enrich our society and culture, as it did when this historic change took place more than 2300 years ago.
President Maithripala Sirisena in his message to mark this Poson festival said: “We commenced our journey through a new civilization on the day King Devanampiya Tissa ended the game of deer hunting in Mihintale. With the king who relinquished the bow and arrow on that day, our nation accessed into a path of a new life guided through the concept of Panchasheela, non-violence, compassion and loving-kindness.
“On that day we not only received the heritage of a new doctrine, but also the gift of an enriched civilization, education, literature, architecture, agriculture as well as the livelihood traditions of the contemporary Mauryan Kingdom of Bharat”.
This highlights the contribution made by Buddhism to the enrichment of Sri Lankan society, with the impact it had on our education, literature, architecture, and agriculture, together with the livelihood traditions of the then Maurya Kingdom of Bharat.
This underlines the necessity for the true values of Buddhism to be further embraced and promoted in our society today, as a means of facing up to the demands and challenges of the modern world, including economics, development and governance, as well as good relations with our neighbours.
In the context of the situation the country faces today, in social organisation and governance, the aspects of equality, reconciliation and peace building in the post-terrorist situation, and the necessity to strengthen ethnic relations and overcome the challenges to good ethnic relations being faced today, and the unfortunate involvement of those in yellow robes in this new challenge; it is the strongest hope that this Poson festival will help in the stronger restoration of Buddhist thinking in our society, and help us move away from the irrationalities and unrealities that seek to divide our society, leading to the dangers of disunity.
Post shake up
The inability of the Gazette notification that will lay out the functions of each minister after the recent Cabinet Reshuffle, points to both the major differences that prevail in the coalition of “National Unity” as well as the lack of organisational thinking before the re-shuffle was announced. This is regrettable because this shake up took a long time coming, with many postponements, and was finally pushed through in the post-Vesak period. There is no doubt that many ministers would like to keep what they consider their “favourite” subjects or institutions, even after changing of portfolios. But this is certainly not the stuff of a good re-shuffle. We have seen in the past in this country, as well as in other countries that have electoral democracies, how ministers handling what are considered “important” or “powerful” ministries are moved on to ministries of lesser importance, without the fuss that we see in this post shake up politics in Sri Lanka today.
What is necessary is for the ministerial functions in the shakeup situation to be announced, with the absence of situations where those who have moved to new ministries carry with them departments, corporations and other institutions that have no relation to the new portfolios they hold, and have sworn to accept. The shake up having come almost in sync with the recent floods and landslide disasters, there was certainly a clear delay in the proper and speedy addressing of the needs of the crisis due to the internal or personal disagreements on the assigned departments and functions. This needs to be solved with no more delay, if the role of government is to be effective in the months ahead that will require addressing many issues that are more important to the people than the offices and functions held by various ministers.
The delay in allocating these functions, has also led to the situation of “room” availability for deputy and state ministers who are also involved in this shake up, This is also a matter that has to be resolved with speed, because what these disagreements do is to deepen the rifts within the governing coalition, leading to more public expressions of the disagreements between the UNP and SLFP within the government. This promotes the forces of those ranged against the government, whether in the Joint Opposition and/or the rapidly spreading racist and ethnic divisive forces that will be posing a major threat to governance in the coming months, with the heating up of the politics and discord in the country.
Ethnic and religious violence
An important aspect of this dangerous trend in the country is the task of arresting the growing trend of religious violence in the country. With a clear delay in the Police taking necessary action to curb this trend, despite various circulars being issued by the IGP and many statements made about the commitment of the Police to carry out this necessary task, it has now become necessary for President Sirisena to state that the Army could be brought in to arrest those who perpetrate these crimes.
The President said this when he met Government Ministers and MPs on Wednesday, when he asked why government MPs do not tell the people who were really behind these incidents of violence, and that they were being carried out by a group backed by the Opposition. He was responding to UNP MP Mujibur Rahman’s complaint that the government had failed to arrest those who promote religious and communal hatred.
The situation is certainly more confusing and dangerous with the Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, telling the media at Wednesday’s post-Cabinet briefing that it would be a difficult task for the Police to arrest the Bodu Bala Sena leader Galagodatte Gnanasara Thera, on whom a warrant has been issued, if he was being protected by a Minister.
The President’s statement of the possible necessity of bringing the Army to carry out this task, as well as a Cabinet Spokesman’s comment about a minister protecting the BBS leader, for whose arrest a warrant has been issued, certainly shows major confusion as well as contradictions within government, on how this matter has to be addressed, and the roles of both those in Government and the Opposition in this matter. Such contradiction certainly does not help to resolve this issue, and restore communal harmony in the country, which has already moved to international concerns over inaction on this.
The country that is slowly recovering from the recent natural disaster and the related overall disaster unpreparedness of the government authorities, and, seeing the confusion on governance following the Cabinet shake up, certainly does not deserve to be pushed into a state of communal and/or religious clashes of any scale or nature. The battle against Tamil federalism that expanded to separatist terrorism due to many wrongs, flaws and delays on the part of previous governments, should be a lesson to the present government on the necessity of keeping to the principles of national unity that saw the major electoral change in the country in January 2015.
The “Maithri Paalanaya” or Government with Maithri or Loving Kindness is what the majority of people voted for, bringing unity among Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. The efforts to bring about new antagonisms in the country with the current activities of the promoters of communal and religious hatred certainly need the strongest response from the government, whatever the threats or warnings given by those who participating and encouraging this new wave of communal and religious hatred. Such action for unity with Maithri is certainly the strongest message that this Poson Festival must give.
