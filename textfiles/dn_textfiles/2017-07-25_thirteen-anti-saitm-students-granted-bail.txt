Thirteen anti-SAITM students granted bail

Thirteen medical faculty undergraduates arrested for allegedly engaged in a Satyagraha campaign at Lipton Circus against the SAITM in violation of a Court order were yesterday ordered to be released on bail by Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
While ordering the suspects to be released on cash bail of Rs.500,000 each, Additional Magistrate Jeyram Trotsky advised them not to behave in an offensive manner.
The students who were engaged in the Satyagraha by building a temporary shed, were demanding the protection of state education and the abolishing of SAITM.
On Sunday evening, the officers of the Police Riot Control Unit who arrived at Lipton Circus, fired water cannon to disperse the students engaged in the Satyagraha, ignoring the Court Order. Counsel Ravindranath Dabare appeared for the suspects.
