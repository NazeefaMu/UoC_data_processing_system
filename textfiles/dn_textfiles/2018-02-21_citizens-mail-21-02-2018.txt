Government’s priority list
Now that the UNP government has received a considerable mandate amalgamated with smoke signals, they should maintain a list of priorities.
Priority number 1 is to catch the thieves and fraudsters. For that, they need to hear the cases as quickly as possible without dragging on for years. Best is if they could finalise everything within a period of one month. The fraudsters, if found guilty, should be sent to prison and not the hospital. Let them serve the sentence like any other criminal.
Priority number 2 is to inform the people of the details of crime done. For instance, spell out how much they had robbed from us, the general public, and recover that money immediately and produce proof.
Priority number 3 is to begin with the Rajapaksa clan and conclude each case within the period of one month without dragging it. Doing otherwise will only show that the UNP government has struck secret deals with the Rajapaksas. We know that it is not so, though.
Priority number 4 is to inform the public immediately. Who are the thieves, murderers? Who gave orders for the murders? As far as we know, take over all that Basil Rajapaksa, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa robbed through commissions and expressways. Fill us with the necessary information in simple language.
Priority number 5 is to retrieve revenue details of very important people such as Rohitha Abeygunawardana, Mahinda Aluthgamage, Johnston Fernando, Kumar Welgama and Keheliya Rambukwella. They were simpletons prior to the political entrance, and now they belong to the affluent party of this country. How have they managed to acquire such colossal amounts with a peanut salary that an MP is entitled to?
Priority number 6 is to initiate a new legal process and see how the tide will turn.
The people have sent a red warning to the government. We the people are not fools. We have killed time for three years. Although development drives of major scale have been initiated, nothing satisfactory has happened with regard to catching thieves.
What were you up to when you held that esteemed position of Justice Minister, Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe? You are a lawyer but did not take a simple step in favour of justice. It took some time for the government to see Dr. Rajapakshe’s true nature? It only shows how old-fashioned our legal system is.
Priority number 7 is to modernise the legal system, finish off all these 84 cases pronto within the period of one month and ensure that corrupt prison doctors too are sent home for issuing bogus medical reports.
Priority number 8 is to recover what former First Lady, Shiranthi Rajapaksa, spent on that hotel in Paris. If Bangladesh and Egypt can expose the political scandals, why cannot our government do it?
