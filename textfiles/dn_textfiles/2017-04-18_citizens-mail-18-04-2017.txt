[CITIZENS' Mail - (18-04-2017)]

Yahapalanaya, in true sense of the word
I am quite amazed and encouraged to observe that the present government under large-hearted President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has been successful in offering solutions to the crucial problems of Tamils and Muslims related to restoration of their own lands, religious buildings and other rightful possessions in the North and East.
President, in his eminent role as the executive head of Sri Lanka kept his word, following proper consultation with Prime Minister. Other cabinet ministers, including Muslim and Tamil, also joined this long-awaited task. Muslim and Tamil organizations have shouldered this task with a sense of peacefulness and harmony.
We can now afford to rejoice as President and Prime Minister both have fulfilled their election pledges. The Tamil and Muslim voters can now rest assured, as the bulk of their problems are being addressed to.
As representative of the Muslim community, I humbly appeal to the President and Prime Minister to keep up good work.
