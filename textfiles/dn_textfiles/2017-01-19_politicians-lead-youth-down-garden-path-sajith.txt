Politicians lead youth down garden path: Sajith

The youth in Sri Lanka have become a political football since decades. They followed the path shown by the politicians and were misled and remained jobless, Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
The minister was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stone to a youth centre at Lunugamwehera. Minister Premadasa said creating a better future for the youth is the duty of the Yahapalana government. When building construction is over, the government will allocate Rs.500,000,000 for its activities and maintenance.
He said the previous regime used the youth to gain political mileage and not for the benefit of themselves. He said instead of politicians creating a future for the youth, they were compelled to create a bright future for the politicians.
