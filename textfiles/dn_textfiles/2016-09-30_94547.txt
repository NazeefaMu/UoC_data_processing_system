Royal College captain and number eight Nikhila Gunadheera has virtually cemented his place at the top of the Singer-Daily News Most Popular Schoolboy Ruggerite 2016 contest by opening up a 2000 plus votes gap between him and Isipathana College number eight Vageesha Weerasinghe who occupies the runner-up spot.
Gunadheera occupies the top spot with 11,922 votes in comparison to Weerasinghe’s 9911.
Weerasinghe retained his position despite pressure coming from Royal College vice-captain and scrum half Ashok Wijekumar who is trailing him by 196 votes.
In fact Weerasinghe has increased the gap by a further 110 votes from 86 the previous week.
The rest of the positions remain unchanged with votes continuing to be received only for the top six ruggerites.
The weekly prize winner on the lucky draw is:
Mrs. Nayanee Niwunhalla of 41/5, Adagala Road, Kurunegala.
The winner will be contacted by Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC to collect the fabulous gift.
