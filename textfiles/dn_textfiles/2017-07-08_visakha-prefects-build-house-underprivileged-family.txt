Visakha Prefects build house for underprivileged family

The Senior Prefects’ Guild of Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo under the guidance of Principal Sandamali Aviruppola and Deputy Principal Kalani Suriyapperuma, supported in building a house for an underprivileged family in Hemmathagama, Mawanella.
Thamara Priyanka Kumari, 34, was expecting her third child when she lost her husband on June 21.
She is a mother to two daughters, Chanchala Kumari, 14, and Paboda Kumari, 7. She left to live with her mother after the tragedy. Thamara only had a Samurdhi payment of Rs. 3,000 per month.
The foundation stone was laid on March 15 and the house was completed in three months, fully furnished with the support of the Security Forces Commander West Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe along with the Commander 583 Brigade Brigadier Nihal Amarasekara and War Heroes.
This project is part of the centenary celebrations of the school.
