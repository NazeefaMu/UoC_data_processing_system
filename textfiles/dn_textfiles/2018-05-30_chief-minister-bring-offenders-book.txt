Errant teacher appointments in NWP
Chief Minister to bring offenders to book

A number of permanent graduate teaching positions vacant in the North Western Province (NWP), had been given to certain graduates who are permanent residents of the Northern Province and the Mannar district, while many graduates in the NWP still remain unemployed.
“The said appointments had been made using falsified certificates issued by certain Grama Niladharies. These GNs have misled the government and certain politicians were reported to have been involved in this racket as well,” NWP Provincial Council Chief Whip Amal Chintaka Mayadunne said, while addressing the recently-held monthly meeting of the PC held in Kurunegala, last week. Accordingly, Mayadunne requested NWP Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake to look into the matter immediately.
The graduates who had thus received teaching posts had arrived in the NWP as refugees, Mayadunne added.
Chief Minister Dassanayake had promised to appoint a committee to look into the matter, notifying that he had received the names of the 11 such individuals who were given the said posts.
