Sand fly infection likely to spread island wide: Dr. Wickremasinghe

A sandfly has infected 2,500 people in the North Central Province and the Southern Province. It can be spread to other region as well, according to the Peradeniya Medical Faculty Parasitology Department Head Dr. W.D.S.J. Wickremasinghe.
He said the infection, first reported in 1992, is now rampant in the Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Hambantota, and Matara districts. This sand fly called “leishmaniasis’ is identical to the dengue mosquito. It feeds on human blood. The skin infection it caused is difficult to cure. Although it only affects peoples’ skin in Sri Lanka, it had harmed people’s inner body parts in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.
Few such cases including several deaths caused by the infection were reported here as well.
Sand fly is much more difficult to be destroyed than that of dengue mosquito and the best way to safeguard is to cover the body as much as possible and use a mosquito net when sleeping.
