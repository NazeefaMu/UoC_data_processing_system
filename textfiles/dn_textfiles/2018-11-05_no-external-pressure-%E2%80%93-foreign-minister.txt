No external pressure – Foreign Minister

The international community has not exerted any pressure on the country as portrayed by the UNP, Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
The European Union has only requested the Government to resolve the current problem in the country democratically and that cannot be taken as exerting any pressure, he said, when he called on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates at their respective Viharayas in Kandy and received their blessings on November 4 morning.
Dr. Amunugama said he was capable of taking forward the Government’s foreign policy by gaining the confidence of the international Community.
He said when there was a crisis between the Executive and the Legislature, it should be resolved through Courts through an interpretation of the constitutions. The UNP was not going to courts because it knows that the President had acted in accordance with the constitution. According to powers vested in the President, he could prorogue Parliament for two months. This was done by President Premadasa when he was in power.
“Although the international community could not exert pressure when action had been taken according to the Constitution, the government had given thought to the possibility of unfavourable repercussions if this situation led to violence and bloodshed. This was because the media was so powerful today that even a minor incident could be taken to the world in a matter of seconds,” the Minister said.
He said the President had already summoned foreign diplomats and briefed them on the true situation in the country and he too had briefed diplomats of SAARC countries. He said Arjuna Ranatunga’s irresponsible entry into the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation premises had ignited a clash resulting in an unfortunate death due to shooting.
This was portrayed internationally as a death due to the political crisis which was a complete travesty of the truth.
He said Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa had no problem in showing a majority in Parliament and anyone who wanted to secure the post should show a majority in Parliament.
