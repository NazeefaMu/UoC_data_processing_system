No regrets!

She has improved by each project. The grapevine has been abuzz with news about her too. However in recent times her profile and any gossip linked with her were missing from the picture. However after a considerable break Chathurika Peiries is back shooting for two teledramas. Here she shares the news about her upcoming projects and changes in her personal life with Daily News TnC.
Q: What kept you involved during your absence from the limelight?
A: Gayan and I opened our own clothing store, Bobby House, in May last year. It is located in Thalawathugoda Road, Kotte.
It houses ladies and gents clothing and goes under the tag line ‘Fill all your glamorous needs.’ We are also building a new house in the same area. It is currently in its finishing stages so I had to look into that work too.
There are less teledramas made these days because most of the air time is taken up by Indian tele serials dubbed in Sinhala.
Therefore there are only a few time slots available for local productions. However I started shooting for two teledramas recently. I am also spending time with Gayan’s elder son, Nethusara. His youngest son was also with us but left to be with his grandparents for a short span.
Q: Out of all the characters you have portrayed so far which character is the closest one to your heart?
A: I love my maiden role, Viveka, from ‘Sooriya Daruwo’. She is so carefree and just like me. I did not have to act much to give life to that role.
She made me a household name. My role as a dancing teacher in ‘Sepalika’ is quite different.
I also did a role of a mother with four children in ‘Malathi Malak’ in 2006. ‘Athma’ saw me in a double role and one of them is a negative character.
Those were refreshing so I love the diversity in them.
Q: If you could give life to any historic character in a film, who would you like to portray?
A: From the local context I would love to portray the role of Viharamahadevi because she is a very courageous woman. Internationally it would be the character of Princess Yashodhara, the wife of Prince Siddhattha.
She is an emblem of unconditional love. Hearing that her husband was leading a holy life, she emulated him by removing her jewellery, wearing a plain yellow robe and eating only one meal a day.
If I get a role in a production from the western film industry I would like to portray a character which engages in ancient martial arts.
Q: One acting advice you would like to share with another.
A: It is a very simple advice but I think it will shape their future. Do everything after being updated about it. Most of the time we get artistes trapped in similar roles these days.
It is tiresome to see them playing one character in the morning and getting into the shoes of a similar role in another production in the afternoon. Have more diversity in your roles.
Q: What is your most treasured possession?
A: I actually do not have such a possession! (Laughs) I go with the belief that we lose everything someday so why should we cling to possessions?
Q: What kind outfits suit you best?
A: Jeans and tops, long dresses and short dresses look good on me. I go for pink, red, yellow and pastel shades.
Q: If you could have a day off, how would you like to spend it?
A: I love the outdoors so we would have a day out. I would spend the whole day with Gayan, Nethusara and our dog, Alpha, playing in the park.
Q: What is your signature dish?
A: (Laughing) Actually, I do not cook that much... (Goes silent for a while and looks slightly embarrassed) Gayan loves this healthy sandwich that I make. It has a filling which includes carrot, bell pepper, egg whites, non fat cheese, onion and tomato with a dab of margarine. It is yummy and low calorie as well. So there you go... (Looks pleased with herself)
Q: If you had access to a time machine, where and when would you go?
A: I would travel back to the time that I did my G C E Advanced Level examination at Musaeus College, Colombo. I studied mathematics and accounts and I excelled in my studies. However once I got into acting I could not continue my studies. If I can go back I would like to do further studies in accounts.
Q: If you could pick three international actors to be your co stars in an action movie, a romantic movie and comedy, which three actors would you choose?
A: (Laughs) If I was given a choice I would choose Gayan for all three roles! I know that he has the capacity to do all three and he and I share great on screen chemistry.
So no need for any international actors for me! (More laughter) But if I could choose to star in any movies from these genres I would pick the action movie first and the comedy next because I have done plenty of romance before. (Giggles)
Q: What is the nicest thing that another person had said or done for you?
A: (With a faraway look in her eyes) This happened in August last year. I stepped out a bit and when I returned into the room I found Gayan’s sons deep in conversation.
Then they approached me and said “Sudu Ammi, instead of calling you ‘Sudu Ammi’ shall we call you ‘Ammi’?” I was surprised and after a pause I asked me who had instructed them to do so.
Then they said that they spoke among themselves and came up with that idea all by themselves. (Emotionally) I was so touched with that episode.
Q: What is your favourite ice cream flavour?
A: Oh, nothing beats chocolate. Yum! Gayan likes both vanilla and chocolate flavours.
Q: What is the most difficult choice you had to make in life?
A: There is no ‘difficult choices’ in my life. You make ‘difficult choices’ if you are not sure whether you are making the correct choice or not.
I have always thought deeply before making my decisions so there were no difficulties in taking them.
A free mindset matters a lot to me. I do not like to be burdened by problems. So no regrets!
Q: Artistes compering programs is a popular trend now.
A: I am not interested in presenting programs because I believe that there is a separate profession called television presenters for that. It is a special job category and they are professionally trained for that. I did present ‘Nugasewana’ during the early days of my career but turned to acting full time later. I also believe that if the fans see artistes often on the screen they would have enough of them. Too much of anything is good for nothing.
Q: More and more actresses are also competing for beauty pageants. Wouldn’t you like to try out your luck in that sector?
A: (Laughs) No! That too if off limits for me because it is so time consuming. I do not have the patience to set aside time for such a long process. Even a photo shoot is so grueling for me. Time is a crucial factor in my life. Freedom matters for me.
Q: What is the question you get asked frequently these days?
A: (Giggles) When is your marriage going to take place?
Q: You seem to be postponing your marriage every year.
A: (Defensively) We had to because things kept getting in the way. Shooting took up our time. Then we had to complete work in our house.
Now Gayan’s sons have joined us and they need time to settle in.
You cannot plan a wedding in a hurry. It is not like planning a tea party. It takes time since you have to look into a lot of details. However we are hoping to tie the knot in 2017.
Q: What are your hopes for 2017?
A: Our wedding is at the top of my list.
We are also hoping to start work in our own production. The teledrama has around 60 episodes and about 25 episodes have been scripted. Once the groundwork is done we hope to start shooting towards July.
