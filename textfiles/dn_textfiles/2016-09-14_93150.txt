West Indies name ‘A’ squads for Sri Lanka tour

Kemar Roach and Rajendra Chandrika have been picked in the 14-member West Indies’ A squad for the tour of Sri Lanka starting in October.
Roach, who spearheaded the West Indies attack ever since he made his Test debut in 2009, found himself out of favour after failing to take a wicket in Australia in January this year, while Chandrika was dropped after his dismal show in the first two Tests of the four-match series against India.
Kieran Powell, the left-handed opener, has also found a place in the squad. The 26-year-old hasn’t represented West Indies since 2014 and also tried his luck with Major League Baseball last year. Shamarh Brooks, the middle-order-batsman, will lead the side.
Incidentally, for the 50-over matches, Jason Mohammed will captain the team. Veerasammy Permaul, Chadwick Walton, Delorn Johnson and Andre Fletcher are all part of the setup.
West Indies are slated to play three four-day matches and three 50-over games during the tour.
First-class games squad: Shamarh Brooks (captain), Vishual Singh (vice-captain), Rajendra Chandrika, Kieran Powell, Evin Lewis, Shimron Hetmyer, Damion Jacobs, Rahkeem Cornwall, Gudakesh Motie, Kemar Roach, Keon Joseph, Delorn Johnson, Reynard Leveridge, Jahmar Hamilton
List-A games squad: Jason Mohammed (captain), Andre Fletcher (vice-captain), Ronsford Beaton, Kesrick Williams, Kyle Mayers, Rovman Powell, Kyle Hope, Chadwick Walton, Andre McCarthy, Assad Fudadin, Veerasammy Permaul, Jon-Russ Jaggesar, Damion Jacobs, Delorn Johnson.
