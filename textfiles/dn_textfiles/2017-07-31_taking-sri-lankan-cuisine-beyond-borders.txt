Taking Sri Lankan cuisine beyond borders

Uga Escapes represented Sri Lanka’s gastronomic prowess at the Sri Lankan Culinary Experience, in Munich, Germany recently. Approximately 50 participants were present at the event, including German travel enthusiast consumers, travel agents and journalists. The practical and hands-on session was aimed at personally engaging with Sri Lanka’s expansive culinary background under the guidance of one of Uga’s executive chefs from Residence by Uga Escapes. Rare, the highly sought-after fusion cuisine restaurant is housed here.
The event consisted of a combination of multiple cookery demonstrations, which included Sri Lankan highlights such as isso baduma and dhal curry, followed by a bona fide, sumptuous Sri Lankan dinner. Some of the other dishes featured include Sri Lankan chicken curry, coconut sambol, mango chutney, and to sweeten things up, kalu dodol, kiri toffee and thala rolls.
Guests and invitees were particularly astonished to discover the wide spectrum of colourful and flavoursome spices used in Sri Lankan cooking, and perhaps more so loved the layers of piquancy found in each dish.
Sri Lanka has typically incorporated a plethora of spices in its dishes for centuries, a majority of which is grown and produced on home soil. In fact, the island’s precious spices was one of the main attractions that drew the colonial powers to it many years ago, with cinnamon being one of the most coveted.
