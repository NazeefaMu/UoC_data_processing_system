Scarcity of doctors hinders health maintenance

The lack of a sufficient cadre of doctors had hampered the efficient maintenance of the health service in the Uva Province, Provincial Ministry of Health, Indigenous medicine, Probation and Childcare, Social Welfare and Womens Affairs Secretary Anil Wijesiri said.
He said there were 127 doctor vacancies to be filled in Provincial Hospitals in Uva to facilitate their efficient running.
He said this at a meeting convened by the newly appointed Provincial Health Minister Anura Vidanagamage to ascertain the status of the Health service in the province recently.
Wijesiri said the Health Ministry was a Ministry which needed quick decisions to cater to the needs of the people in the region. It had a cadre of over 110 officials surpassing all other ministers in the province as it concerned the health of the people.
It had to contend with complex situations like dealing with a plethora of health unions.
He said there were 6 base hospitals in the Province. Welimada Base Hospital, which needed a cadre of 42 doctors had to contend with 20 doctors and four out of them had gone on maternity leave. Doctors recently launched a strike saying they were unable to cope with the work due to lack of staff.
Except health staff assistants, attendants and drivers, all other appointments were given by the line ministry. According to 2013 statistics, there was a shortage of 258 nurses and this may have further increased today. A section of the Mahiyangana Base Hospital had been closed.
Although 10 machines were fixed at its Kidney unit, only 4 or 5 were in operation due to lack of staff.
The line ministry and all other sections had been made answer of this situation last year, they asked for 100 additional nurses, but the Ministry sent only 20 after promising to send 75 nurses.
A group of 28 nurses qualified for inter-provincial transfers have been stagnating as they were not released due to existing shortages.
