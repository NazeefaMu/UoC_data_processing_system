Former Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) Director Arjun Aloysius was notified to appear before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) a short while ago.
The PCoI issued the notification to record a statement.
It was revealed today that Arjun Aloysius has received sensitive inside information from a ‘powerful friend’ on the February 27, 2015 Treasury bond auction, through the recovered PTL telephone recordings.
