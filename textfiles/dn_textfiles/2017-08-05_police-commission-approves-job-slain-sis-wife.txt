Police Commission approves job for slain SI's wife

The Sri Lanka Police Commission confirmed IGP Pujitha Jayasundara's recommendation to offer a job to Kumudu Premachandra, wife of SI Hemachandra who was shot dead while trying to protect the Jaffna High Court Judge, Illancheliyan Manikavasagar.
Kumudu Hemachandra was working as a police constable. She left the job after her first child was born. The Police Commission said she was on vacation of post for six years.
Kumudu Hemachandra was offered a job by IGP Pujitha Jayasundara after her husband was killed in the shooting incident.
