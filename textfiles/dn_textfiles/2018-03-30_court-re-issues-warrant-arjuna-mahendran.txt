Court re-issues warrant on Arjuna Mahendran

The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday re-issued a warrant written in English for the arrest of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, in connection with the Central Bank Bond issue.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had issued warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, the first suspect in the case, since he failed to comply with the court order. The Attorney General’s Department informed court that the CID is in the process of obtaining red notices from Interpol against former Central Bank Governor.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till April 12 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by the defence were not sufficient enough to consider bailing them under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with the criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda with Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the CID.
Defence Counsel Kalinga Indatissa PC with counsel Jeewantha Jayatilleke appeared for the suspects.
