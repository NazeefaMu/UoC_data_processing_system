Singapore Airlines takes delivery of world’s first Airbus

Singapore Airlines (SIA) has taken delivery of the world’s first Airbus A350-900ULR (ultra-long-range) aircraft from Airbus. It is the first of seven A350-900ULRs on firm order and will enter service on October 11 operating the world’s longest commercial flight between Singapore and Newark Liberty International Airport.
SIA is the launch customer for the new A350-900ULR, which is capable of flying up to 9,700 nautical miles (nm), or over 20 hours non-stop. The flight to New York will cover a distance of approximately 9,000nm (16,700km), with travelling time of up to 18 hours 45 minutes. The aircraft is configured in a two-class layout, with 67 Business Class seats and 94 Premium Economy Class seats.
“This is a proud moment for both Singapore Airlines and Airbus, not only because we have again strengthened our partnership, but also because we have pushed the limits with this highly advanced new aircraft to extend long-range flying to new lengths,” said Singapore Airlines CEO, Goh Choon Phong. “The A350-900ULR will bring more convenience and comfort to our customers and will enable us to operate ultra-long-range flights in a commercially viable manner. It will help us boost our network competitiveness and further grow the Singapore hub.”
The A350-900ULR is designed for a more comfortable travelling experience with features such as higher ceilings, larger windows, an extra wide body, quieter cabins and lighting designed to reduce jetlag. Its carbon composite airframe also allows for improved air quality due to a more optimised cabin altitude and humidity levels.
With the delivery of the first A350-900ULR, Singapore Airlines now has 22A350-900 aircraft in its fleet, with 45more on order including the sixadditional ULR variants.
