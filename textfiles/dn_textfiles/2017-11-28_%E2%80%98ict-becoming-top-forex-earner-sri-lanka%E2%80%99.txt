‘ICT becoming a top forex earner for Sri Lanka’

The Sri Lanka ICT sector landscape is fast changing and the industry is moving to be a top foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, said Jayantha De Silva, President and CEO, IFS Sri Lanka.
At a media briefing held in view of their 20 years of operations in Sri Lanka, he said that when they started, Sri Lanka’s ICT-based export revenue was around US$ 20 million and in 2015 it has gone passed the US$ one billion mark (Sri Lanka's IT/BPM sector vision for 2022 is a US$ 5 billion revenue, 200,000 direct jobs and 1,000 start-ups.)
De Silva also stated, “IFS has been a key player in driving the IT/BPO industry in Sri Lanka towards building capacity. We pioneered many innovative concepts in the industry and initiated concepts such as the ‘scholarship scheme’ offered to A/L students with the objective of supporting the industry to build capacity. To date, over 300 scholarships have been awarded and it has now become an industry standard.”
“We will continue to expand our scholarship program while working closely with major universities to develop our future generation, encouraging them to be a part of this dynamic industry. We are now a complete Resource Centre catering globally and have achieved significant milestones within the ICT industry as we celebrate two decades of excellence.”
The Sales and Consulting unit for IFS in South Asia operates from its Colombo office and markets, implements and supports IFS applications in companies within the South Asian region.
The company currently supports more than 120 companies across Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand, Seychelles, and Uganda. "We ensure that our customers have a trouble free experience, a vital element in our relationship with our customers.”
He said that have introduced several software to the tea, apparel and other sectors and also to large foreign and local corporates.
Alastair Sorbie, CEO at IFS, commented: “Consistent and stable growth has been the secret of our success around the world, which would not have been possible if IFS could not attract and retain top talent. The importance of building the best team of industry experts is no more pronounced than in Sri Lanka – not only is Sri Lanka home to the largest number of IFS employees, but the local team is also key to the success of so many fundamental parts of our global business.”
“Fuelling our global growth from Sri Lanka has been one of the best decisions we have made.”
