Reason for the season
‘Tis the time to gift happiness

The pall of gloom brought about by the political crisis in the country was lifted just at the right time when Sri Lankan Christians were on the threshold of celebrating Christmas.
There was much trepidation among the Lankan Christians if Christmas this time was going to be a dull and somber affair, given the enormity of the crisis that began exactly two months before Christmas. Thankfully things have resolved themselves in the nick of time and the spirit of Christmas is almost tangibly felt with the usual bustling activity associated with the festive season very much in evidence
Whatever the gloomy picture, Christmas cannot be separated from the age old merriment and it is doubtful if things would have changed much even with the crisis on .The spirit of Christmas is all pervasive and the season of Yuletide is looked forward to with much anticipation, even during the darkest spells of history in the Christian world.
The run up to Christmas, as always, is a hive of activity in many homes. The colour washing is done even as early as October and as December approaches it is time to get started on the traditional Christmas cake. Shopping is an integral part of the Christmas agenda and the school holidays makes it that much fun .As usual at this time of the year the streets are choked with milling crowds. Yuletide perennials blare forth from shops which are gaily decorated with Christmas trappings. Scented cypresses are lined up for sale on city pavements in their profusion brining the Christmas atmosphere very much alive.
It is also the time for big business.Rubicund cheeked Santa Clauses beam out from shop windows advertising the latest brands. Special Christmas hampers are laid out at supermarkets and luxury stores. It is holiday time for school and the offices with employees taking their annual leave in bulk. Peoples’ faces mirror a general air of gaiety and joy filled with a sense of anticipation.
Present day Christmas celebrations have changed over the years in tempo and form. Christmas shopping in the past was a leisurely affair unlike today’s mad scramble. Though salaries were small compared to the present day there was always plenty in reserve for Christmas. The lavish bonuses dished out by many mercantile firms helped fuel the Christmas cheer.
Shoppers also had their favourite stores unlike today when everything could be bought under one roof. Alas, most of these landmarks are no more although old timers still speak of them with a sense of nostalgia.
Christmas was also a much looked forward to event in the now almost extinct Burgher community which dominated many pockets in the Colombo city areas such as Hulftsdorp, Princess Gate Grandpass and Kotahena. For them Christmas was all about merriment and revelry with no expenses spared. The Bachchanial roister that began days before the great event will progress well into the New Year.
Preparation
In the good old days the preceding weeks were devoted to stocking up where the stores were conveyed in the then ubiquitous rickshaws. Central to the run up to Christmas was the preparation of the Christmas cake for which the assorted ingredients were preserved in jars months ahead. Carols were another feature sung with gusto to perfect harmonising by members of the family and extended family in all Burgher homes.
In the weeks preceding Christmas it is also common to see carol singers parading the streets in groups donned in fancy attire visiting every home collecting in the process a substantial purse invariably spent on binges. All this culminate in the midnight mass where the church overflows with the pious and the ‘once a year’ church goers.It goes without saying that Christmas is a universal festival celebrated across different faiths, cultures and ethnic boundaries. No matter what gloom has descended the Christmas spirit cannot be dampened. This is why even amidst the worst economic depressions to hit the Western world s ago Christmas was celebrated without let or hindrance..
But is Christmas that marks the birth of Christ, the saviour of mankind observed in the way it should? Is this great event heralding peace, joy and salvation to the world being abused and distorted? Sadly amid the babel and humdrum surrounding the Christmas festivities the underlining message denoting the true meaning of the event is lost. Christmas today has been associated with unbridled commercialism and the cacophony of the market place.
Nay, Christmas has today become a commodity in the hands of multinational behemoths to rake in the shekels. Greed has overtaken the true message and meaning of Christmas which is sacrificed on the altar of mammon.
It is all too evident that Christmas today has been hijacked by business interests. It has become an occasion to bolster trade and business connection. Expensive hampers and other goodies are exchanged for favours in return - all in the backdrop of Christmas.
The contrast with the humble birth of the Christ Child in a manger surrounded by poor shepherds cannot be more glaring. Even the grandeur in which the Christmas mass is celebrated is at variance with the circumstances of the birth of Christ. Symbols such as the Christmas tree, the crib are only tokens for unbridled jollity. Sadly even the Church today has failed to get across the true message of Christmas to its flock. Nay, some its actions tend to betray shades of commercialism.
As a result, the spirit of giving, sharing and caring for the poor which is the essence of Christmas is subsumed in glitter of the festivities and merriment.
The level of commercialization of Christmas can be seen by the giant structures of the Nativity scenes adorning the frontages of supermarkets and shopping malls, the epitomes of luxury, ostentation and profiteering. Santa Clause is but a clownish figure doing his thing opposite shops and store fronts. Christmas should be rescued from the grip of mammon and made to revisit its true origins and hallowed message.
True meaning
Buried in all the joy and gaiety is the true meaning of Christmas with Christians tending to overlook the message of the birth of the redeemer two millennia ago in a cold stable surrounded by cattle and sheep. Instead the accent is on the outer trappings.
Christmas is called the season of giving and sharing, but mostly this giving and sharing is among the rich who have the capacity to return the favour. This is a distortion of the theme of Christmas which is today being used as a convenient tool to trade favours.
Hence it is vital for all Christians to hearken to the spirit of the message delivered by the birth of the redeemer and make Christmas a meaningful and spiritually fulfilling one. True, celebrations are in order for the great gift of God in sending his Son to this world to cleanse and purge all souls of the stain of sin. But the underlying message of Christmas should not be forgotten. Those who splurge on Christmas goodies should spare a thought for the orphans, the deprived and those in the numerous homes for the elders, the prisoners, the terminally ill and those on the verge of death, refugees fleeing oppression. Christ moved among the poor and the deprived and expects His followers to traverse in His footsteps.It should be rescued from the status of a commodity and salvaged from exploitation by the unscrupulous for profit and gain. A huge responsibility lies with the church and its guardians to redeem this most hallowed festival from its current decadence.
The underlying message of Christmas should be dinned into the faithful with more emphasis and vigour so that they will be enriched and inspired by the universal message of that far away first Christmas.
