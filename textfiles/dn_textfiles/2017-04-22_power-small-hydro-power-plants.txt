Power from small hydro power plants

A discussion on generating power using small hydro power plants, was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat on Thursday.
Attention was drawn to issues such as identifying the possibility of increasing the 340 megawatt added to the national electricity grid by small hydro power plants to 550 megawatt, recognising the challenges faced by the Small Hydro Power Developers when implementing development strategies for the respective field, ascertaining the new methods to achieve national goals of generating renewable energy and implementing the development activities ensuring environmental balance. President Sirisena said the utilisation of modern technology should be considered when issuing licences for small hydro power plants.
He said steps should be taken to solve issues by appointing committees in State institutions after identifying projects with problems.
Officials, including Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary Udaya R. Seneviratne and Small Hydro Power Developers Association members participated.
