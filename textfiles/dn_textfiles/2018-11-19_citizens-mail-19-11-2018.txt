[CITIZENS' Mail - (19-11-2018)]

Let peace and harmony exist
The attention of the entire nation has been drawn towards the Sri Lankan parliamentary structure. The common man isn’t concerned much about those changes, he bothers about how to live peacefully by feeding his children and giving his children a good education. If those motives are fulfilled, they are quite satisfied. If not, at least let a government act wisely. It is better not to take off the powers given to a President by the Constitution. When we look at this act it seems dictatorial but it never becomes dictatorial as the President is elected by a vote of a thumping majority.
It would have been more democratic if Ranil Wickremesinghe cared to answer a questionnaire on where he had gone wrong and what action he had taken for his defence. Unlike in other countries, most of us are Buddhist by birth. We strongly believe in five precepts, values and virtues of an ancient tradition. What prompted Ranil’s exit? The association with Arjuna Mahendran, making him the head of the Central Bank and allowing him to leave the country are the offences that Ranil is legally bound to answer.
As a devoted and dedicated Buddhist, President Sirisena exercised his sympathy on Ranil for so long without taking any side. Thanks to his patience, there is no bloodshed in the country. However, we fervently hope that this exercise won’t continue further and may not hinder the peace-loving people of the island.
