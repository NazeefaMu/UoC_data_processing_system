Troops arrest split of canal bank

Army troops of the 16 Gajaba Regiment (GR) of the 143 Brigade of Colombo-based 14 Division under the Security Force Headquarters - West (SFHQ-West) were deployed to the flood-threatened Moriyakulama area in Karuwalagaswewa to prevent an imminent burst of the Moriyakulama agricultural canal bank by stacking sand bags atop most vulnerable patches.The danger of bank’s split prompted troops to consult Irrigation Department officials for their assistance on remedial measures. Troops were also supported by villagers during the operation.
