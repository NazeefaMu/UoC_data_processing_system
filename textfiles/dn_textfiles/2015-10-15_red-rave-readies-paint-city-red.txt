Red Rave readies to paint the city red

Opening their walls as galleries for local art, the lean luxury Cinnamon Red is now ready to cover more ground as a unique hotel that gives prominence to local artists and their distinctive creations.

As part of the hotel’s first year anniversary on September 1, Cinnamon Red called out for aspiring artists to send in their creativity via their Facebook page in early August, to join hands to further the ‘art drive agenda’ of the hotel. Within 20 days, the hotel received over 100 inquiries from interested parties with the final selection being among 61 creations.
Even though the initial announcement was that five best artistic creations will be rewarded with the opportunity to make the Cinnamon Red walls more vibrant, along with a cash prize each and a night’s stay at the hotel on full board basis, the overwhelming talent of the artists drove the judges to pick five more, rounding up the final count of winners to ten.

The distinguished panel of judges were John Keells Holdings Deputy Chairman Ajit Gunewardene, Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts Sector Head-City Hotels Rohan Karr, Cinnamon Red General Manager Terrence Fernando and Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts Head of Marketing Communications City Hotels Tharika Goonathilake.
Yogya Thalagala, Joel Manoraj Paul and team, Kavindu Abeysundera, Supen Zetter Ravisanka, The Hermits, Lishni Tilakarate, Stefan Packianathan, P413 Mob, Samithira Sriranganathan Sami and Udani Samaraweera were the chosen ten.

Terrence Fernando recently hosted these artists for an evening of fellowship at the hotel, enabling the artists to examine their spaces of work and asses their work plan. The wall art will be ready for public viewing by end October.
