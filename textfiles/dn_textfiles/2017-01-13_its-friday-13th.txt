It's Friday 13th

One in 20 of us is so superstitious they say they will not leave the house this Friday the 13th – to minimise the risk of bad luck. A survey found 80 percent of Brits consider they are superstitious, with many having rituals. The most common superstition is lucky socks, worn by 36 percent, followed by touching wood and lucky pants both at 35 percent. A lucky coin wards off bad luck for 23 percent and 22 percent told Mecca Bingo they keep fingers and toes crossed.
Claire Taylor, 31, of Hastings, East Sussex, called herself “very superstitious” and plans a duvet day following the last Friday 13, last May, when she crashed driving back from the shops then dropped a bag and “two wine bottles smashed all over my kitchen floor”.
Taken as a whole of the UK’s 60 million adults, that means around 3 million people are not planning to venture outside this Friday.
Several of those quizzed in the poll for Mecca Bingo said they had even booked the day off work on holiday to avoid having to leave the security of their own home.
The top five lucky rituals and charms Brits rely on to ward off bad luck were voted as:
1 Wearing lucky socks - 36 percent
2 Touching wood - 35 percent
3 Wearing lucky pants - 35 percent
4 A lucky coin - 23 percent
5 Keeping fingers and toes crossed - 22 percent.
The fear of Friday 13th stretches back to the story of Easter, when Jesus and the disciples sat 13 to a table for the Last Supper. Since Victorian times, a belief in bad luck on this ominous date has grown and research published in 1993 by the British Medical Journal found that there is actually an increase in road accidents on Friday 13th.
The top 10 moments when Brits are at their ‘most superstitious’ and use lucky rituals are;
1 When sitting a test/exam
2 When buying a scratchcard/placing a bet/playing bingo
3 During a key life moment e.g. purchasing house/proposing/getting married
4 When looking for a new job
5 When it’s Friday 13th or Halloween
6 When getting on a flight
7 When playing games or sport
8 When going for a health check at the doctor/dentist
9 When taking a driving test
10 When trying to land a promotion
