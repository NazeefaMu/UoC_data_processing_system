GMOA strike between May 3 and 5

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) along with around 100 other trade unions and organisations will launch a countrywide strike against SAITM between May 3 and 5, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Zoysa said the Government should present an acceptable, practical and realistic solution to the SAITM issue by May 9. If the Government fails to do so, a date will be fixed on May 9 for continuing the countrywide strike.
The Government should take over SAITM and declare it as a public property on behalf of the safety of the patients’ lives.
“The people have started to dislike the way judiciary functions in the country and they are losing confidence on it. Political pressures are being exerted on independent supreme bodies such as the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). The University Act and the Medical Ordinance are being openly violated. The people do not approve the unethical and inappropriate conduct of the Higher Education Minister and the Health Minister, Dr.De Zoysa added.
