The origins of the Dalada Perahera date back to the time of king Kirthi Sri Meghavanna who received he sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha, brought from India by Princess Hemamala and Prince Danta, during his reign in Anuradhapura. The king Commanded that the relic be taken around the city once a year with pomp and pageantry. It is this tradition that is continued, though it may have been interrupted due to wars and invasions.
During king Kirti Sri Rajasinha's rule in Kandy, the Dalada Perahera joined with the four Devala Perahera of the Natha, Vishnu, Kataragama and Pattini on a request made to the king by Maha Thera Upali from who came to revive upasampada.
