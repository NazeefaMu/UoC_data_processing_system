Woodcarvers' woe

It is amazing to watch a woodcarver with a wooden hammer and a chisel sculpt an elephant within few minutes. We found an amazing wood carving artist while traveling along the narrow zigzag path that echos the hammering and chiseling sound of the traditional woodcarving village, Bope-Poddala Nagarukkaramaya situated four kilometers away from historical city of Galle.
"I learned the craft from the elders of the community. They taught me the basics such as how to hold a chisel. When I could hold the chisel correctly I had to seek more experience," says Abeyratne, now a master woodcarver.
"We never look at a sample design when we do woodcarvings. The art of woodcarving takes the carver to a whole new world of amazing self-discovery that includes creativity, technique, imagination and an inner harmony of accomplishment," he said.
R A Abeyratne has been in the woodcarving industry for 40 years. He believes that the carver delights at the process of shaping wood, into a pre-envisaged mental image of the subject being carved.
"Even if we have a clear mental picture or a sample model in our mind, yet we know that as we carve towards that model it will become our own through creative performance," He explained.
Villagers in Nagarukkaramaya have been engaged in the woodcarving for many generations. A wide range of quality products available here bears enough evidence to the skill and dedication of the villagers. They are skilled in the craft of turning wood into beautiful and useful products. You come across amazing statues made out of rough timbers with the craftsman's spirit.
It's easy to understand why woodcarving in Sri Lanka is such a highly specialized skill when you consider just how much complex, detail goes into every item created. Whether it is a tiny wooden elephant or an enormous wooden structure, the sheer professionalism of the craft cannot be faulted.
This rare timber is fashioned by master artisans known as 'Hadakaraya' into even more miniature elephants used as keytag souvenirs. Thinking shadow, Fisherman and various religious effigies like the Buddha statues, Hindu Gods Lakshmi, Krishna and Ganesh are also formed from this sweet-smelling wood that highlights beauty and grace. More than the basic elephant shape, another one called the 'Hada Aliya' is also sculpted with a larger trunk and a broader arch.
Several stages are required in order to carve such masterpieces. The primary stage is skillfully creating the image that is in the mind of the artisan and then fine tuning its intricate details with special tools. Thereafter, sandpapering and polishing is done to display its finer attributes making it attractive. Every stage of craftsmanship is vital in bringing out the best of the masterpiece so that it is a collector's item when it goes on sale, elaborated Abeyratne.
S A Pradeep Kumara, a young wood artisan from Bope, has been in the field since childhood. He explained how they look forward to a good income during the tourist season. However off season brings trouble as the products lack a proper market. "Earlier we used ebony for our carvings. But today we cannot do that, as ebony is rare and expensive," E K D Wimalasiri, the owner of Wimalasiri woodcarving workshop and showroom, said.
"Now we use red and white wood like 'Pare Mara', 'Mahogani' 'Nadun' and 'Alastonia' and some even colour the wood black to resemble ebony as a last resort," he added.
"We have to face various hardships to find a good market for our products. Only the mediators could get a big profit by buying and selling our products. Sometimes they buy a Buddha statue for Rs 40,000 and resell it at Rs.400,000. Earlier we used to give our products to Laksala. But today we do not, as we have to wait for about six to seven months for payments," Wimalasiri noted
When contacted with reference to this complaint, a senior official from Laksala said that it is a self-funded institution and it is really difficult to buy these products for an advance payment.
"We have to maintain a stock of products worth Rs 400 to 500 million. So without selling these stocks we cannot make payments. Woodcarving is a seasonal business. There is a good market for these products during the tourist season. Off season, it's really difficult to sell these products. Market demand is also varied from product to products," the official said.
National Crafts Council Assistant Director (Southern Province) K M G Kamal said that most artisans work from dawn to dusk and try to sell these products daily as it is the only means of living to them. The mediators come and collect their products daily at a low price. The National Crafts Council provides opportunities to sell their products through trade fairs, but these artisans do not participate as they cannot maintain a stock of carvings.
Even today, despite the shortcomings, Galle's woodcarvers are more involved in taking up after their forefathers and the love for this art handed down from generations remains true in their hearts.
