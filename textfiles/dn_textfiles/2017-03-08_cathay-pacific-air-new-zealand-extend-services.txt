Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand extend services

Cathay Pacific will introduce a new seasonal service between Hong Kong and Christchurch from December 2017, directly linking the two cities by air for the first timeand complementing the airline’s existing services to Auckland.
The non-stop Christchurch service will operate three times per week, departing Hong Kong on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays using technologically-advanced Airbus A350 aircraft,highlighting the airline’s commitment to New Zealand, a country it has served since 1983, and providing a welcome boost for tourism to Canterbury and the South Island.
Subject to regulatory approvals, the new service will operate between 1 December 2017 and 28 February 2018 and will complementCathay Pacific’s current seasonal double daily flights to Auckland as well as strategic partner Air New Zealand’s daily service between Hong Kong and Auckland.
Cathay Pacific Director Corporate Development and IT Paul Loo said the new Christchurch service will meet customer demand for travel to New Zealand throughout the southern hemisphere’s peak summer months, as well as provide a convenient option for South Island-based travellers looking to fly on Cathay Pacific to Asia and beyond via the Hong Kong hub.
“We are an airline that puts the needs of our customers at the heart of every decision we make. Christchurch, and indeed the South Island as a whole, is a magnificent part of the world, so we are really excited to be able to connect this new and breath taking destination direct with our Hong Kong home,” said Loo.
