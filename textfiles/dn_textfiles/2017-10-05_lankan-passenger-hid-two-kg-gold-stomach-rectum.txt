Lankan passenger hid two kg  of gold in stomach, rectum

VISAKHAPATNAM: Around two kg of gold was recovered from the stomach and rectum of a Sri Lankan passenger who was detained by the Customs officials on his arrival at the Vizag airport. The doctors of King George Hospital, where the passenger was kept under observation for more than 24 hours, recovered 16 packets of gold weighing around 125 gm each.
The passenger boarded a SriLankan Airways flight on Colombo and landed at Vizag airport at around 9.30 am on Sunday. Growing suspicious over the ‘awkward gait’ of the passenger, the Customs officials detained him. He was shifted to KGH for full body scanning and the reports confirmed that he was carrying gold in his stomach and rectum.
A team comprising a radiologist, a general surgeon, a physician and other doctors recovered the gold packets from the stomach of the passenger through natural excretion method by administering laxatives.
According to the sources, the customs officials recovered two gold packets from the passenger on Sunday itself. On Monday and Tuesday, the KGH doctors recovered 14 gold packets.
Asked about how the accused managed to carry the gold packets, KGH superintendent G Arjuna said,” The passenger seems to be a professional smuggler. He might have cut the gold bars into small pieces of 1 to 1.5 inch each and packed them in 16 black polythene packets neatly stitched with a sliding tape which might have helped him swallow them. The sliding tape also ensured the free movement of the packets through the stomach and rectum.” - THE NEW INDIAN EXPRESS
