Parliament, now a building complex with a HSZ - Abeygunawardena

Parliament is now a building complex covered by a High Security Zone (HSZ) with several circles of Security Forces, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Podujapa Peramuna (SLPP) Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday, he said that in Parliament he saw for the very first time in history, a vote taken for the Parliament Select Committee. “The UNP Leader is now trying his best to cover up his mistakes by using the ‘Parliament tele drama’. The people are waiting eagerly to watch the next episode,” Abeygunawardena said.
According to MP Abeygunawardana, all media institutions should provide evidence in connection with alleged great bank robbery of Sri Lanka where the Central Bank of Sri Lanka was robbed by a Singaporean citizen brought to Sri Lanka by the former Prime Minister, appointed by him as the Central Bank Governor and taking over the Central Bank in order to hand it over to the robber. There are records on how the former PM tried his best to white wash the former Central bank Governor using three lawyers.
The UNP Leader says Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated twice while he himself (UNP Leader) was defeated on over 30 times. Now the alleged conspiracy launched to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is now gradually unfolding. We request the Government to conduct this investigation properly. Sometimes, some husbands kill their wives by strangling them and then they hang on to the bodies,” he added.
