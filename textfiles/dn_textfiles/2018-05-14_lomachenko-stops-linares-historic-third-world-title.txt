Lomachenko stops Linares for historic third world title

New York, Sunday : Vasyl Lomachenko stopped Jorge Linares in the 10th round on Saturday to claim the World Boxing Association lightweight world title and a slice of boxing history at Madison Square Garden.
Ukraine’s Lomachenko survived a sixth-round knock-down to set a record in claiming a world title in a third weight division in just his 12th professional fight.
Lomachenko finished off the tightly contested bout with a fierce burst in the 10th, capped by a left to the body that sent Linares down.
The Venezuelan got to his feet, but referee Ricky Gonzalez waved it off at 2:08 of the 10th to give Lomachenko a victory by technical knockout.
Lomachenko improved to 11-1 with nine knockouts, while Linares fell to 44-4 with 27 wins inside the distance.
Lomachenko, whose storied amateur career included two Olympic gold medals, added the WBA lightweight belt to a stellar resume that includes a victory over Gary Russell Jr. for a featherweight world title in just his third pro bout. In his seventh fight, Lomachenko moved up to super featherweight and knocked out Roman Martinez to take his belt and set the record for fewest fights needed to win a world title in two weight classes.
Coming into Saturday’s fight he had made four successful defenses of that title -- with all four challengers quitting on their stools. - AFP
