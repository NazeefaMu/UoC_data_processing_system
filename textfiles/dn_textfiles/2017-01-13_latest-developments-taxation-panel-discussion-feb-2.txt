While the Budget 2016 proposals presented in Parliament on 20th November 2015 in relation to certain taxes have still not been implemented completely, the 2017 Budget proposals were also presented in the Parliament on 10th of November 2016. The VAT Amending Act No.20 of 2016 and NBT Amending Act No.22 of 2016 were certified by the Speaker of the Parliament on 1st November 2016, thus introducing certain key changes to the indirect tax regime of Sri Lanka.
