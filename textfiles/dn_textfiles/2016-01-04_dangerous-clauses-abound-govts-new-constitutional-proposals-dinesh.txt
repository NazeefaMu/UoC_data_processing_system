Dangerous clauses abound in govt.'s new constitutional proposals - Dinesh

The government's proposals for a new constitution have several dangerous clauses, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader and UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena said.
Speaking to the media in Colombo yesterday, Gunawardena said that government members were trying to hide these clauses while only highlighting popular proposals such as changes to the executive presidency and the existing electoral system.
He said that some proposals in connection to the unitary state, giving prominence to Buddhism and the 13th Amendment to the Constitution were highly questionable.
On the two matters, Buddhism and unitary state, Gunewardena said that there was no clear reference in documents presented by the government.
Gunewardena said that the government should tell the truth to the people about these without just trying to hide behind the two popular slogans - executive presidency and a new electoral system.
