Is a collaboration between Christina and Britney coming?

If you're on social media, you would know that some say that it is negative and promotes more harm than good.
However, not Christina Aguilera. She believes that it has the power to promote 'good', and can even help squash 'beef' between people.
During an interview on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live', she said that she wished social media was around during her day so she could clear the air that there was no bad blood between her and Britney Spears.She even added that they should have done a song together to help squash the rumours. Jimmy Kimmel then asked if a duet was still possible, to which 'Xtina' replied: "It’s probably not too late for that. … If her reps say okay… Hey, I’m down.”
No news on whether Britney is down for a duet, but if she is, we're guaranteed that it will be a chart-topper.
