Two suspects in Galle abduction case arrested

The main suspect in the abduction of an entrepreneur at Pilana, Habaraduwa, Galle together with another accomplice was arrested by Galle Police. They had taken a Rs. 5 million ransom to release the businessman.
The suspect is an ex-commando combatant, a resident of Habaraduwa, attached to the tourism field in its construction sector, Police said.
The suspect who can speak English fluently had fraudulently sent an invitation to the businessperson for a deceptive opening of a tourist hotel and as he was on his way to the function, the suspect had abducted and led the entrepreneur to a lonely place to take the ransom, police said.
The businessperson is a leading supplier of building materials to mainly foreigners who are setting up tourist villas in the area. He had gone to the function believing that the invitation was from a foreign client, Police investigations revealed.
The businessman had travelled along the Warabokka road near Koggala Oya in Habaraduwa in his luxury car when two persons on a motorcycle had stopped him at an isolated location and got in to the vehicle in the pretence of leading him to the function.
They had later blind-folded the entrepreneur and taken him in a separate vehicle leaving the luxury car in Akmeemana and informed the victim’s brother, a business person, about the kidnap. They had demanded Rs. 40 million to release his brother.
Following negotiations, the suspects had reduced the ransom to Rs. 5 million. The victim’s brother withdrew the required sum from a bank at Koggala and kept the cash at a spot as instructed by the suspects. The suspects after receiving the ransom had taken the entrepreneur blind folded on a motorcycle and dropped him near his residence, police said.
Galle Police arrested the main suspect at Welikonda, Habaraduwa with nearly Rs. 2 million, while another was arrested at his residence in Matale with Rs. 1.9 million.
Investigations are on to arrest one more suspect, police said.
