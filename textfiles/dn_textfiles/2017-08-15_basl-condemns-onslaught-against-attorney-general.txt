BASL condemns onslaught against Attorney General

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) yesterday strongly condemned several accusations leveled against Attorney General’s department by certain individuals following their role at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Bond Issuance.
BASL President U.R.de Silva told a press conference held in Colombo that any person accusing the Attorney Generals department should provide evidence and materials through a proper forum, instead causing damaging the reputation of the Department.
It was alleged that officers of Attorney General Department had aggressively questioned former Minister Ravi Karunanayake but were reluctant to prosecute large scale frauds committed under the the previous regime.
The BASL President, however, accepted the fact that there is a delay in the disposal of cases by the Attorney General.
“Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Bond Issuance is vested with the power to control the behaviour of any official during hearings. if anyone criticizes the commission and the Attorney General department from outside, it would undermine the authoritative power of the commission and public could lose their trust in the Attorney General department,” he added.
