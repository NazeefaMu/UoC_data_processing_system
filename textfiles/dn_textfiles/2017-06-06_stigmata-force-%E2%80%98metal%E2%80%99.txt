Stigmata : A force to ‘metal’ with

With the advent of Stigmata two important things happened. It gave hope to the band members and more importantly it gave hope to Sri Lanka's music fans. Stigmata became a rallying point due to the incredible vision of its founders; Suresh De Silva and Tennyson Napoleon. It gathered a group of followers that believed in the bands’ music as much as the band members believed in the music they made. Daily News speaks to Band Leader of Stigmata Suresh De Silva and under his leadership Stigmata has touched lives through the power of its music.
“What we do is called Pure Sri Lankan Metal, that is the brand name for the music that we make. But if you break down the blue print of what we do, it's fundamentally Heavy Metal and Hard Rock music, although we incorporate multifarious elements of Jazz, Baila, Fusion, Funk, Progressive Rock, Delta Blues, Power, Thrash & Death Metal, Folk and even Classical music. We have a very heavy eastern sound and we are the only Heavy Metal Band across the spectrum to utilize Baila, although we do incorporate Eastern rhythms and 'Wannam' and 'Pappara’ based stuff. So it is a very holistic formula. Some of the parts that make it a whole are different genres of music. But essentially we are a proud and loud Heavy Metal band, but it is Pure Sri Lankan Metal because the style and genre of what we do, our own formula cannot be found in any part of the world,” said Suresh.
The band was formed initially by Suresh and Tennyson, then Andrew Obeysekere (but he recently left) joined to form the nucleus of the ensemble.
“As the founders, we kept the band rolling for a long period of time. But we have had a lot of serious issues during the last couple of years, from mismanagement from my part to the unit as a collective lacking the drive and motivation to steer the vessel out of stormy seas as it were, a Band is a family and a team, if everyone lacks the same vision and spirit of motivation then it cannot progress and evolve further. The last couple of years have been a very tough time for us as we got played out by a tour promoter in New Zealand and there were problems where certain corporate conglomerates locally acted unprofessionally pertaining to sponsorship agreements which affected our last album launch and the cycle that followed. Tenny and I ended up in a situation where the two of us were left on our own to tackle all of the issues and to resolve the aforesaid problems a day at a time. 2017 has been a true period that has tested our endurance and faith in what we do, but thanks to the stringent support we received from our fans, families and a handful of our friends, we were able to literally rise from the ashes.
When certain members of the band began to not find fulfillment playing our kind of music, when music becomes a monetary endeavor as opposed to an artistic one - then it becomes difficult to share a common vision.
Being in a band in this time & age is not an easy role, it is really hard. Stigmata is not our bread and butter, it is our life’s passion. We all have professional vocations and we established early on that the music we create in Stigmata is not a commercial venture to seek fame and fortune. It is not something we do for mass appeal or to make money. I know it sounds cliché saying we don’t do music for money but with us it is the truth. We do it for artistic value,” stated Suresh,” stated Suresh.
This year is their 17th year of creating music.
“In terms of playing original music, we are the first Heavy Metal and Rock band in Sri Lanka to have persevered and endured like we have. We have four albums out. A number of EPs and even 1 DVD. We have released a myriad of singles and have been blessed to tour around the world at many festivals in Australia, Dubai, India, Malaysia, Maldives, New Zealand and Bangladesh. We have had our albums picked as year end favorites with our last one "The Ascetic Paradox" receiving global acclaim in the US, France, UK, Italy, Middle East and over Asia.
If everybody does not share the same collective vision, it can be very difficult. This is not me casting stones at anyone who is not in the band anymore, but there were a lot of issues that made us disintegrate as individuals and who and what we were to each other. I realized that the state of the Band and the divisions forming plunged me into a very dark and perturbing place. I believe I hit an all- time low and a level of depression that made me very volatile and abrasive during the last few performances. You must understand that for Tenny and myself Stigmata is more than a therapeutic sanctuary.
Tenny and I never lost focus. We never lost the focal point of what Stigmata means to us and what we wanted to achieve. Tenny and I, as the chief songwriters of the band have been chiseling and churning out some amazing new music that we hope to share with our fans soon. As the foundation/pillars of the band we need to ensure that we have the right people involved. Not just talented players, but reliable, honest and down to earth people that are committed and psyched like we are to create new music," explained Suresh.
Suresh feels that we are living in very difficult and tough times in the music industry.
“The entire infrastructure has changed with technology. Artists are finding it very difficult to survive in order to make this a commercially lucrative endeavor. There are artists in the world out there that have made it really big, like Metallica, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Guns & Roses - but they made their mark in a different time, a different era entirely. But you have to understand that Stigmata is not a mainstream band. We have never conceived music for mass appeal. We would rather be a Picasso on someone’s wall, than be a Coca Cola in everyone’s fridge,” explained Suresh.
Suresh emphasizes and stresses that for them their music, message, the lyrics and evolutionary standpoint and artistic integrity means much more than making money.
“What's important is that Tenny and I have not lost that spark and fire. We are still as excited as we were 17 years ago to create new crushing music. We have carved a legacy of Stigmata that we believe in. For better or for worse we have become a part of the fabric of Sri Lankan Arts and Culture. We were featured on the BBC on the Daily Arts Show last year which has 56 million listeners. We were not given any publicity here locally because we are not a mainstream act. I don’t think there are too many artists in Sri Lanka that can say they have been featured on the BBC and we are also the only Asian based band to be featured on the Discovery Channel twice. We have performed for a full house at the prestigious Forum Theater at the Melbourne Arts Festival and played for 300 people at Clubs and Pubs overseas while performing for close to 40,000 at the famous Dhaka Army Stadium in Bangladesh. We take great stock in getting our nation recognized for powerful and evocative music and we will spread our unique brand of organized chaos wherever they welcome us.
Suresh works as the English Creative Writer at Q & E Advertising while Tenny who is married and has a beautiful baby boy is the Art Director at JGSW.
“Despite all our responsibilities and everything we have to be accountable for, all our priorities and obligations we still find time for Stigmata. This is more than our therapy and sanctuary. The moment music or art becomes a cash cow endeavor sometimes it can lose its magic. With all our hard work we believe Stigmata can preserve its dignity and integrity, and we ensured that, without having to compromise our art, music, image and our musical direction,” informed Suresh.
“Music means different things to different people. Look at the world today, look at the Manchester bombing. Absolutely senseless. Mostly children affected. Look at the floods and landslides in this country. You'd think after a year necessary precautions would have been taken to anticipate another catastrophic episode. Look at the indirect racism that is springing up. Pitting one set of people against the other. We are really living in hard and dark times. Music is something that can make people laugh, cry or smile. Music can be sensual. Music can make people angry and make them think of issues.
Regardless of race, religion, creed, personality or so called heritage, all those things cease to matter, when it comes to music. Music should bring people together. So my message is forget about being Burgher, Muslim, Sinhala or Tamil, think about being Sri Lankans. Think about being human and being united -that is the power of music. We have so many evocative themes. We have dealt with everything from war and social degradation to economic strife, personal and emotional loss, psychological paralysis, spiritual pain to the human condition. We have dealt with life and death, and apathy and indifference. Whatever it is we like to offer a platform for people, not just to be at peace but to feel liberated. And also so they can really get something out of it. People are really passionate about the message and the music while others appreciate just one or the other. At the end of the day as long as it is therapeutic and it touches people and triggers a reaction that is fine,” summed up Suresh.
Stigmata will give an exclusive performance at this year’s Comicon on August 26 at the S.L.E.C.C
