I requested the SC to clarify my term of office: President

Adressing an election meeting at Tissamaharama, President Maithripala Sirisena said he requested the Supreme Court (SC) to give clarification on his term of office. He said that he would accept the decision of the Supreme Court, whatever it is, and added that it was the proper procedure followed by previous presidents as well.
“Certain people who want to derive a political mileage out of this request of mine, is using it to sling mud at me in order to tarnish my image,” President Sirisena said.
The president further said certain people even took the fertiliser shortage to sling mud at him and his regime, although they knew that such shortcomings occurred even during previous regimes. He added that when the acute shortage of fertiliser occurred, he rang up the Pakistani Prime Minister to provide him with a consignment of fertiliser. The Pakistani Prime Minister then dispatched a quantity of 75,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser to Sri Lanka the following day. Currently, there is no fertiliser shortage and the farming community is satisfied that they got the consignment of fertiliser when they needed it the most.
President Sirisena said three years of his tenure at office was spent on wining the the international community that was not on good terms with the previous regime. The international community placed their faith in him and 193 countries that come under the purview of the United Nations (UN) are now good friends of Sri Lanka. The leaders of those countries now have soft corners in their hearts for our country and pledged to extend their support at any time when we are in need of their assistance.
The President added that decent people should be elected to Local Government institutions in order to develop the respective villages and towns they represent. Wrongdoers among the elected would be severely dealt with according to the existing rules and regulations. The country had enough corrupt chairmen in Local Governments during the previous Rajapaksa regime, and it was they who defeated Mahinda Rajapaksa. It was the duty of the people of the respective Local Government areas, to elect honest, hard-working representatives sans corruption and malpractices. Addressing the rally further, President Maithripala Sirisena said he was duty-bound as the President of the country and the people, to rid the country of corruption and malpractices. He said he was not power-hungry and he was prepared to give up the presidency even today, without any hesitation. Corrupt politicians are not an asset or a legacy to a country, but a liability, the President added.
