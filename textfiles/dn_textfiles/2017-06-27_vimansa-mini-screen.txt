Vimansa on the mini screen

Vimansa, a romantic comedy is telecasting on week days at 8.35 pm on Rupavahini. It is a step away from the kind of teledramas we find on the screen these days. Nethu Priyangika, Anusha Kodikara, Buddhadasa Vithanarachchi, Cletus Mendis, Kamal deshapriya and others star in the teledrama which is scripted and directed by Kanishka Bandara Meghasooriya.
