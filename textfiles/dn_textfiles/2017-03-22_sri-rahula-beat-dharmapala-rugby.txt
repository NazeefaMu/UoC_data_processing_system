Sri Rahula beat Dharmapala at rugby

Sri Rahula College Katugastota who has been making a great impact in the schools rugby field during the recent past created yet another sensation when they beat Dharmapala College by 59 points (5 goals 4 tries) to 5 (1 try) at the Peradeniya Campus grounds.
The lads form Katugastota looked a good side in this game as they transformed themselves into a fighting outfit.
They were fast on the field for the entire duration of the game.
They proved superior to their opponents in the forwards play and were hounding the loose ball like tigers let loose.
Their tackling too was terrific which brought the losing side’s attacking machinery to a grinding halt.
Referee: Asela Niyadagala
