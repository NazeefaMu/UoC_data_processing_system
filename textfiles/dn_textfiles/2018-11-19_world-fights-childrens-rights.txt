World fights for children's rights

United Nations’ Universal Children's Day will be celebrated tomorrow, Tuesday November 20. It was first established in 1954 to promote international unity and awareness among and about children worldwide. UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, promotes and coordinates this special day, which also works towards improving children's welfare.
The occasion also allows the discussion of children's rights in conjunction with the sustainable development goals. Goals such as poverty reduction, health, education, sanitation and equality are all important not only for sustainable development but also for children's rights and well-being.
In many developed countries, children have never had it so good, with access to education, health care, the internet and much more. But millions more are facing unprecedented upheaval. More than 50 million children have been uprooted from their homes due to conflict, poverty and climate change while millions more face violence in their communities.
According to the UN, around 263 million children do not attend school and last year some six million children under five died from mostly preventable diseases.
True, not all of us can look back on our childhood as the most joyous time of our lives. The more privileged among us are perhaps unaware that millions of children in our own nation as well as in many undeveloped countries elsewhere are subjected to untold hardships from the time they come squealing into the world. Their parents too in many parts of the universe struggle with their own problems such as lack of health care, financial insecurity and abuse.
The idea of a Universal Children's Day was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1954 to protect children working long hours in dangerous circumstances and provide all of them with access to an education.
The theme for this year's celebrations: Stop Violence Against Children! According to UNICEF, every year millions of children around the world become victims of untold violence. Children in every country, every culture and at every social level face various forms of abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence.
The abuse takes place at home, in school, in institutions, at work, in the community, in armed conflict and natural disasters. Much violence against children, such as corporal punishment and sexual abuse, remains legal and socially approved of in many countries. The violence children face takes many forms, such as exploitation and abuse, trafficking, physical and humiliating punishment and harmful traditional practices. Growing up with violence and abuse seriously affects a child's development, dignity, and physical and psychological integrity. Nearly 25 years ago, the world made a promise to children.
That we would do everything in our power to protect and promote their rights to survive and thrive, to learn and grow, to make their voices heard and to reach their full potential. In spite of the overall gains, there are many children who have fallen even further behind.
Old challenges have combined with new problems to deprive many children of their rights and the benefits of development. To meet these challenges, and to reach those children and helpless elders in society who are hardest to reach, we need new ways of thinking and new innovative strategies. There is much to celebrate as we mark the 26th anniversary of the Convention, from declining infant mortality to rising school enrolment, but this historic milestone must also serve as an urgent reminder that much remains to be done.
And what about the children we have sworn to nurture and protect? Are we focusing enough on child labour, which refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school and that could be mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful?
Forced labour in general takes different forms, including debt bondage, human trafficking and other forms of modern slavery. The most vulnerable victims are young women and girls forced into prostitution, migrants trapped in debt bondage and sweatshops or farm workers kept there by clearly illegal tactics and paid little or nothing. Children everywhere hold the key to the future of a country. It is the responsibility of every single person to safeguard children.
Anything you do to support kids and parents can help reduce the stress that often leads to abuse and neglect. By educating yourself - and others - you can help your community prevent child abuse and neglect from happening in the first place. The behaviour of children may signal abuse or neglect long before any change in physical appearance. Get involved. Advocate for services to families. Help to establish parenting groups in your community. Ask your community leaders, clergy, library and schools to develop services to meet the needs of healthy children and families. If you suspect or are aware of abuse or neglect occurring, report it. UNICEF estimates that over half of the 30,000 child sex workers in Sri Lanka are boys. Does this not sound the alarm that we are increasingly on the way to earning the shameful reputation of becoming a nation of perverts, pederasts and paedophiles? It is because of our silence that these depravities will continue. All Sri Lankan voices should be heard to boom with outrage against such abuse of our children. Remember that our children should be considered more precious resources than the nation's gold reserves.
Here in Sri Lanka a senseless conflict which raged for nearly 30 years has taken a devastating toll on thousands of families. Now with the war nine years behind us there must be a concerted effort to help this unfortunate segment of the population to ensure their basic survival. Have we given a single thought to the orphans of war and the victims of natural disasters who have never felt the touch of a mother's love? Or of a family which has lost its breadwinner father and protector and is struggling to survive?
Everyone, regardless of their sundry spiritual beliefs, should reflect on the needs of these dispossessed widows, children and the old and infirm from both sides of the ethnic divide.
That is because they have all been pursued by the remorseless furies of terror, bereavement, bloodshed and brutality. Among them are the swarms of orphaned children, those forsaken waifs and strays of war whose predicament should inflame the empathy and heartfelt emotions of every decent soul.
