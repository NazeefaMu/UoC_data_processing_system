Spanish spread from Chef Carlos

Colombo Supper Club together with Jetwing Colombo Seven will be hosting Chef Carlos from Barcelona. The event will take place at 7pm on October 4 at Restaurant - 57 of Jetwing Colombo Seven.
With close to10 years of culinary experience, the 28 year old Head Chef will be responsible for curating the menu and overseeing daily operations at Esquina. “Esquina is a charming space that really reminds me of the vibrant tapas bars back home and I am very excited to be a part of it. I have always loved the process of creation and with this opportunity, I hope to bring a part of Spain I grew up with to the menu at Esquina” Chef Carlos said.
With a background specializing in European cuisine and pastry, Chef Carlos has spent time developing and mastering innovative preparation techniques under the tutelage of highly respected chefs including the Roca brothers from the three Michelin star and recurring number one on the prestigious World’s 50 Best Restaurants list - Celler de Can Roca (Spain), and Chef Hilario Arbelaitz from 2 Michelin star restaurant, Zuberoa (Spain). Further establishing himself in the dining scene, he spent three years honing his gastronomic craft as a sous chef at the Michelin-starred haute Catalan restaurant, CINC Sentits (Spain).
Colombo Supper Club is a venture founded by former lawyer, travel enthusiast and passionate foodie Naserah Tyebally, a Singaporean who now calls Sri Lanka home. She aims to use her multiple platforms to uplift the culinary scene in Colombo and showcase global trends in wining and dining around the world.
Jetwing Colombo Seven is the newest addition to the renowned chain, marking its first venture into the capital city. Its fusion restaurant - 57, boasts intriguing dishes created from the finest local and international produce. Burgers to decadent desserts, all served with Jetwing’s hospitality, have made this a strong contender to be a city favourite for wining and dining.
