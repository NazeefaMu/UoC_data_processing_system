Asalanka resists for Sri Lanka with 81

CAMBRIDGE: A second day of rain prevented England U-19s’ bowlers from making significant headway in their efforts to force victory here on Thursday.
The Sri Lankans lost four wickets in a truncated day’s play - leaving a draw looking the likeliest result.
Sri Lanka had started day three at Fenner’s on 96 for 2 with Charith Asalanka and Avishka Fernando looking to build on yesterday’s steady start at the crease.
George Bartlett, who had complained of a knock to his hand during the warm-up, dropped a chance on 110 for 2, but quickly redeemed himself holding onto a low catch at short midwicket to dismiss Asalanka for 81 which included 12 boundaries.
Durham pace bowler Josh Coughlin also made his first impact on the game dismissing Fernando for 45 giving George Hankins at second slip an easy catch.
The afternoon session was lost to rain but after play resumed at 5pm Amar Virdi took his second wicket of the match - dismissing Shammu Ashan on 51.
Sri Lankan keeper Navindu Vithanage was dispatched in the next over - Coughlin’s second wicket of the day - being caught one handed by an outstretched Pope.
But bad light then intervened, forcing the players from the field again. Sri Lanka will resume tomorrow on 235 for 6.
Scores:
England U-19: 500-9 decl;
Sri Lanka U-19 : 96-2 contd. 235-6 at close (D Jayalath 22, C Asalanka 81, A Fernando 45, S Ashan 51, A Bandara 21 n.o., J Coughlin 2/19, A Virdi 2/57)
