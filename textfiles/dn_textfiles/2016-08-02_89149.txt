K-POP rocks in Sri Lanka

Shaping your mind and body to appreciate a foreign culture is one thing, but shaping your voice to sing in another’s language or to fight in another’s traditional martial art form is another.
Singing in a language other than your native tongue can be a daunting task for any singer. It takes more practice than singing in your own tongue. There will be many words you will find difficult to pronounce or articulate. You have to focus on syllables and sounds, might as well have to break down each word in order to learn its diction. It necessitates application and training. The end result is going to be that you will realize that you have participated in another’s culture. The reward is the joy that you actually lived in it.

Such joy has been experienced amid much appreciation for Korean culture by all who participated at the Korean Cultural Festival 2016 on Saturday (July 23) at Musaeus College Auditorium, Colombo.
The festival consisted of Korean Ambassador’s Kukkiwon Cup Taekwondo Championship and National Preliminary Selection Round for Korea’s K-Pop World Festival 2016. Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara, President of the Sri Lanka Taekwondo Federation Harshana Rajakaruna were chief guests.
When Sri Lanka’s K-poppers for national selections hit the stage they absolutely raised the roof. They delighted a full- packed house with an estimated 1500 people at Musaeus College Auditorium with some of the hottest K-pop songs.
Nineteen candidates were in the line for K-pop international selections, having been selected out of hundreds of candidates who had applied for the selection process. Boy dance groups, girl dance groups, beat bands and female and male singers were among the selected group of nineteen.
These artistes and dancers got the audience on the feet in no time. Some of them seemed nervous and others seemed excited. All in all they all gave an all–encompassing exciting K-pop evening that evening. They dazzled the audience with dance-pop, pop ballads, slow rock, electro-pop, R&B and hip hop. They love what they did and enjoyed it thoroughly.

They brought to life South Korean pop on stage. It saw two cultures in embrace and perfect pitch. K-pop spread with excitement and fun. The local boys and girls stunned the audience with their singing and notably their diction of Korean language. They were singing and dancing in a professional environment. The vocalists delivered some signature K-Pop singles by top K-pop artistes. They also sang what are billed as hot favorites of K-pop.
The five male lineup Lalith Dance Group won the grand prize, a trip to Korea courtesy Korean Air. They are to perform at the K-Pop World Festival 2016 which will be held in Changwon, Korea on September 30. They put up a winning act, not only in terms of power and energy they threw during their performance, but also dramatic intensity they created on stage.
Dishad Lankesha Weerasinghe of Ananda College and Harini Diaz were declared the Best Singers and were given awards of excellence and trophies.
Dishad and Harini were indeed outstanding. They sang with power, vocal agility, good technique, natural vibrato and in perfect pitch. Moreover their Korean articulation was extremely good.
Korean Ambassador to Sri Lanka Won-Sam Chang who made K-pop, a successful event in Sri Lanka, had these words to share with the audience and the contestants:
“We have received so many applications from Sri Lanka for the K-Pop festival this year. Although some were not elected for the event’s national preliminary round of the festival, I must say they were all impressive and possessed with special skills. If they work harder and practice from now on they may be able to secure a place for the selections next year.”
“I believe that music and dance are art forms that can express one’s inner self. I know that remembering words and phrases of a foreign language and execute their diction while singing is not at all an easy task. Hence I greatly appreciate the effort and the commitment of those who will sing today at the festival.”
“I hope that this event has given you opportunity to learn about the Korean culture. I hope that Sri Lanka-Korean relations will grow as a result of events like this. The Korean Embassy is at the ready to organize similar events for this purpose.”
