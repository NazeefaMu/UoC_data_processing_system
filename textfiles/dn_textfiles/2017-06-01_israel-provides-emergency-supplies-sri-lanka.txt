Israel provides emergency supplies to Sri Lanka

In the wake of the recent floods and landslides which have affected hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans, the government of Israel is providing Sri Lankan authorities immediate disaster relief supplies. Just as they did after the floods of 2016, the Israeli people show their solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka in words and deeds.
From as early as 1958 - when the young, emerging State of Israel sent supplies during the Ceylon Floods - and to this day, Israel has continuously demonstrated its longstanding friendship with the Sri Lankan people.
Carrying a letter from the President of Israel Mr. Reuven Rivlin to the President of Sri Lanka Mr. Maithripala Sirisena, expressing Israel’s sympathy with the people of Sri Lanka, Ambassador of Israel Daniel Carmon said:
“Last week, celebrating Israel’s National Day in Colombo, I stated that ‘Israel is Sri Lanka’s all-weather friend’. Unfortunately, these are storm ridden days. I am proud to be able to provide these supplies to our Sri Lankan friends. I am convinced our partnership will continue to grow when the clouds have cleared.”
Ambassador Carmon delivered the supplies and the letter from President Reuven Rivlin to Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Foreign Affairs Ministry.The emergency supplies provided by the Israeli Embassy include strong power generators, drinking water, high power light sources, and other emergency first response supplies. The generators, which were in high demand, were immediately taken to the affected areas which have sustained the worst damage by the floods and landslides in South Sri Lanka.
