GSP+ possibly next week: President

 
President Maithripala Sirisena has said Sri Lanka would probaby regain the Europe Union’s GSP+ trade concessions next week.
President Sirisena made this announcement in Kandy today.
Sri Lanka applied to regain the European Union’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) trade concession in June 2016.
The European Union withdrew access to the EU market in 2010, during the last government, citing an absence of tangible and sustainable progress on a number of outstanding issues.
