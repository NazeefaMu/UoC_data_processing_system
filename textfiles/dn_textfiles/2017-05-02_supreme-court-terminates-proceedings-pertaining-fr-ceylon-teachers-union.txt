Supreme Court terminates proceedings pertaining to FR by Ceylon Teachers Union

 
Additional Solicitor General Indika Demuni de Silva appearing on behalf of the Education Minister and Public Service Commission informed Court that the respondents would not act contrary to the service minutes and cabinet memorandum pertaining to the matter.
 The petition was filed by the CTU, CTU Vice President Rasika Lakmini Handapangoda and CTU Secretary Joseph Stalin. The petitioners cited Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Education Ministry Secretary and 24 others as respondents.
 The petitioners alleged that the respondents have made recommendations to grant reliefs for those who were allegedly victimized on political grounds in violation of the service minutes of the Sri Lanka Teachers’ Service, Sri Lanka Principals’ Service and Sri Lanka Teacher Educators’ Service.
 The petitioners alleged that the respondents have taken measures to grant promotions, salary increments, to resolve retirement issues for those who served in public sector and politically victimized.
 They said Ministry level committees that were appointed to investigate appeals have investigated 11,262 appeals and have made recommendations pertaining to 4,013 appeals.
 The petitioners stated that where there is evidence that a person has suffered due to political reasons, the petitioners have no objection for relief being granted to the same, subject to the fact the law and the prevailing service minutes are not infringed.  
 The petitioners have sought an interim Order directing the respondents to refrain from taking further action to grant reliefs to those who served in above services, who have been allegedly subjected to political victimization, until the final determination of this petition.
Counsel Upul Kumarapperuma appeared for the petitioners.
