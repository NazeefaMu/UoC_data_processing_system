e-Voting imperative: Why democracies need to modernize their polls

With much of modern society already embracing technology, the great question is how elections have largely been left untouched by automation. This is not for lack of role models -- there are pioneers such as Belgium, Estonia and the Philippines, countries which have transitioned to automation and have since been reaping the benefits of fast, transparent, and credible elections. Yet a sizeable number of democracies have not yet taken their electoral process to the digital age, and are still to realize the tangible benefits that automation offers.
Manual polls involve a tedious process of writing each candidate’s name on a ballot which is a nightmare for voters who were expected to write as many as fifty (50) candidate names.
The hand counting and tallying of votes are known to take weeks and sometimes months to finish, and were prone to inaccuracies.
Since manual voting leaves many parts of the process to the discretion of poll workers, and since human intervention is inherent in the process, poll workers in the precincts are vulnerable to intimidation and violence.
Automation, however, changes everything. A precinct-based Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Machine, for instance, allows voters to cast their candidate options directly into the machine, eliminating uncertainty and human subjectivity in interpretation. Complex, multi-contest elections are easily handled on the screen, making voting easy and intuitive for the voter. After the polls close, the machines count the votes automatically with 100% accuracy, and transmits them to canvassing servers almost immediately.
E-Voting offers speed unheard of under the manual system, and observers are hailing such improvement as crucial to the quick dissipation of political tension, with many candidates already being proclaimed just hours after the polls close, and many others conceding thereafter.
Credibility, political stability
Generally, voters surveyed after an e-Voting exercise report being very satisfied with the process, and many of whom say that they are unwilling to go back to the old manual system.
It helps when the poll authorities institute steps to make the whole process more transparent. Most countries who’ve moved towards election automation have conducted a series of confidence-building measures, such as enabling lawmakers and the press to witness critical points in the preparations: source code reviews allowing stakeholders to review the machine instructions, and performance of a battery of tests and audits.
Another key factor for the increase in credibility and Voters’ Trust is the capability of the Election Technology to generate the Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), which are vote receipts generated by the machine upon the casting of the vote, and subsequently verified and deposited by the voter in a secure receptacle. This trail allows the performance of audits and re-counts, comparing the electronic count with a manual audit of the paper.
In the case of the Philippines, a random manual audit confirmed a 99.9% match between the electronic and the manual counts.
This level of transparency has had a positive effect on trust. A post-election survey conducted by the Social Weather Stations (SWS) after three automated elections revealed that 88% of Filipinos want their future elections to be automated, 81% are satisfied with the automated polling and 74% expressed big trust in the results of the elections.
Clearly, automation imbues electoral processes with a degree of transparency not possible in manually-run polls making e-Voting much more credible.
Savings
Countries who have automated their elections have shown that a well-managed e-Voting system could be a financially sound investment for governments, generating significant savings over time.
The big story is how the voting machines are made to be used in multiple elections over the span of several decades, resulting in a long-term savings for the government.
It is never easy to break free from preconceived notions about anything, let alone myths about elections which might have already hardened in the mind. Yet elections being the bedrock of democracy, poll authorities would do well to open their minds about technologies that could improve the speed, accuracy, reliability, transparency, and credibility of their electoral exercises.
