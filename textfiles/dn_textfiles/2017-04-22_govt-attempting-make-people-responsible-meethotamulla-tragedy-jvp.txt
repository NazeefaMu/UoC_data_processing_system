Govt attempting to make people responsible for Meethotamulla tragedy: JVP

The government that dumped garbage in densely populated areas in Colombo is trying to make the people responsible for the tragedy at Meethotamulla, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Parliamentarian Vijita Herath said yesterday.
He said the two main political parties which governed the country for 69 years did not find a viable solution for the garbage issue.
He made these observations at a press conference at the JVP Political Head Office in Pelawatta, Battaramulla yesterday. "Garbage dumping in Meethotamulla began in 2008 by the then government," Herath said. "Until then, garbage in the Kolonnawa Municipal Council was dumped at Meethotamulla," he said.
Herath said Gotabaya Rajapaksa threatened the people using Police and dumped garbage at Meethotamulla. "The garbage dumped by Rajapaksas is at Meethotamulla," he said.
He said it was only the JVP that objected the motion of the Kolonnawa Municipal Council to dump garbage of Colombo at Meethotamulla.
He said the garbage management was managed by the JVP at the Tissamaharama Pradeshiya Sabha when it was in power. He said the Rajapaksa government disrupted it.
