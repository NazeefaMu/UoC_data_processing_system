Adele’s  earnings boosted  by $21 million

Singer Adele raked in $21.5 million (£16.5 million) last year (16), following the success of her third studio album 25.
According to editors at British newspaper The Sun, the album, which spawned hit singles Hello, When We Were Young, and Send My Love (To Your New Lover) gave the 29-year-old a pay rise of $13 million (£10 million) - taking her earnings to almost £16.5 million or the equivalent of $60,000 (£45,200) a day.
The singer is reported to be worth $135 million (£100 million), a figure which will increase in 2018 once the income from her tour is added to her fortune.
A source told the publication: “The Adele success story just rumbles on and on. It’s an incredible amount of money, more than you’d think she’d ever need.
“And she has always been very careful with her earnings so there’s no chance she’ll waste any of it.”
Adele’s third release, which debuted in November 2015, sold 20 million copies worldwide. And paperwork signed by the singer said: “The company will continue to exploit existing recordings and the director expects the turnover to remain strong.”
The singer’s earnings are expected to soar next year as they will include monies from her 121-date world tour, which crossed three continents. Music News
