Thajudeen murder : Shiranthi, Yoshitha to be grilled today

Former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa and Yoshita Rajapaksa have been summoned to the CID today (15).
CID sources speaking to the Daily News said they have been summoned with regard to a jeep owned by the Siriliya Saviya Foundation.
The jeep was donated to the Foundation by the Red Cross.
Summons had been previously sent to the two members of the Rajapaksa family on July 27-28 but both failed to show up citing various health reasons. It was alleged that the jeep in question had been used in the abduction and murder of rugby player, Wasim Thajudeen in 2007.
Questioning now has been directed to find out whether Shiranthi Rajapaksa knew of the incident and whether Yoshitha had used the jeep on that fateful night.
Thajudeen who met with a deadly car crash was first deemed to have been an accident but was later proven to have been tortured and murdered.
