Reforms, resolutions and democracy

Tamil radicals say “Sri Lanka has always rejected the advice council monitoring and adjudication by foreigners and promised to do it on their own. But they never did anything, except lied, cheated and continued to commit even more bloody crimes against the minorities. The present government appears to be heavily influenced or threatened or bribed by the Rajapaksas and their goons.
Putting on a facade of less public violence does not change their attitude against the minorities as crimes continue behind the scenes. Nothing has in fact changed or improved for the poor people of the north where land grabs, displacement and rape continue. There appears to be an underworld force coupled with the troops who are controlling various aspects of the country.
The country has lost its way and the climate of hatred and racial discrimination prevails. The few exceptions quoted by some do not make the rule. Buddhists destroyed Hindu temples and built far too many Dagabas in the north, outnumbering the Buddhist citizens living there!” Obviously this cannot be the whole truth as there is a committed movement in the south fighting for equality, autonomy and the right of self determination of Tamil people. However it is serious and should get proper attention.
Future generation
The capitalist world is in turmoil and all countries are themselves facing calamities of their own and they are far too preoccupied with their own issues to spent time on Lanka, if the government is wasting time and solutions are delayed. Tamils therefore should work closely with the anti fascist southern forces rejecting the view “utterly helpless and out on their own to either save themselves or self destruct. Tamils are virtually doomed within Lanka. Nobody understands this.”
It is true that the fascistic Mahinda Chinthanaya is spreading a toxic culture in Colombo and other areas. Those who are affected are immune to scandal and ignore everything around them even if it affects and influences their children negatively. They are breeding a horrible future generation. For them the good guys finish last so they all have become bad. The time that criminals, embezzlers, crooks, rapists murderers who should be in jail are freely roaming the streets and travelling overseas are over. Under the present government struggle is continuing to end corrupt lawless state.
Less violent, less corrupt
It is very depressing to see very corrupt people still free. However we have no choice as this Yahapalanaya is less violent, less corrupt than the previous lot. We have a space to fight. The pressure of fascist makes the government slow in redressing the problems of the Tamils. However we have no choice as this capitalist government is less racist and more accommodating than the previous fascistic lot. It is wrong to assume that west will come to help Tamil liberation.
Hence pathetic dependence on them is of no use. It is true that the west has made some interventions such as removing DSP+. EU, Regulations lays down the modalities of the Union’s Generalized System of Preferences, which is meant to improve developing countries’ access to the EU market by means of granting them preferential treatment for their export products.
In February 2010 GSP+ preferences to Lanka were suspended due to serious breaches in the application of UN human rights instruments, especially the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN Covenant on the Rights of the Child, the UN Convention against Torture and the ILO Core Labour Conventions.
After the democratic mass uprising the Yahapalana government of Lanka took some strong steps towards improving human rights. This includes the government’s decision to co-sponsor Human Rights Council (HRC) Resolution 30/1 in October 2015. However the government’s reform efforts, including those that directly relate to the GSP+ criteria, have not yet delivered substantially to comply with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Convention against Torture, and the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
On the other hand ILO delegation of Experts has identified a number of shortcomings with ILO Conventions 87 and 98, including the insufficiencies of the Industrial Disputes Amendment Act 56 of 1999, which is the only existing legislation that relates to ILO Convention 87.
Human rights activists have indicated that the process of repealing and replacing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) has not yet been accomplished. If a new Act replaces the PTA it must not include a broad definition of ‘terrorism related’ offences, and limit the risk of forced confessions through torture. They argue that the existing rise of breaches of Human Rights in Lanka concerns about the appropriateness of granting GSP+ status while there is inadequate real progress according to international bodies. Clearly the Lankan government is suspected of not adequately tackling the culture of impunity by rewarding military officials accused of human rights violations with government positions.
Peace, reconciliation and stability
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lanka on February 10, 2017 concluded that the measures taken by Lanka since October 2015 have been “inadequate to ensure real progress”, and the fulfillment of commitments has been “worryingly” slow by two months on January 23, 2017. Considering all this they propose to instruct its President to forward this resolution to the Council and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
The slow pace of transitional justice in Lanka and the lack of a comprehensive strategy to address accountability for past crimes, risk derailing the momentum towards lasting peace, reconciliation and stability.
Everybody acknowledges that there have been positive advances on human rights and constitutional reform. “The Government has advanced on constitutional reforms and showcased some positive developments on the broader human rights agenda. The fulfillment of transitional justice commitments has, however, been worryingly slow, and the structures set up and measures taken during the period under review were inadequate to ensure real progress”.
Office of Missing Persons
Of course they also recognize some advances on constitutional reforms, on crucial issues like land restitution and symbolic gestures towards reconciliation, as well as legal reforms and the design of an Office of Missing Persons.
The laudable, inclusive work of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanism, appointed by the Government, has also resulted in an incisive report, which was issued in January this year. But it is very necessary to do what was promised and cleverly indicate to the democratic masses all over the world that Lanka is beyond fascism and racism.
It is necessary to counter the often directed criticism: “Party politics, including the balancing of power between the different constituencies of the coalition in the run-up to constitutional reforms, have contributed to a reluctance to address difficult issues regarding accountability or to clearly articulate a unified position by all parts of Government.
Unclear and often contradictory messages have been delivered on transitional justice mechanisms. Public messaging around transitional justice and reconciliation has been generally confusing and at times contradictory”.
