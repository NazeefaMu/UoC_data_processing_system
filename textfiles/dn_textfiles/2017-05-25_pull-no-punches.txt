Pull no punches!

His technique proficiency is amazing at the game. This and a lot of hard work and dedication helped him move up the ladder to reach the number two spot in Asia and the 15th place in the world. He is also Sri Lanka’s Cadet Karate team captain for 2016 and a Peterite Karateka.
Randev Athukorala has started karate when he was six years old. His father, Dr Rohantha Athukorala, influenced him to take up the sport since he too has done karate from a tender age. 
“I too wanted to engage in a sport to keep fit. So karate seemed a good option. Little did I know that I would excel and make it to the international level in the sport,” Randev said with a smile.
He notes that quite a few students took up karate along with him. The numbers have increased with the years along with the popularity of the sport. Today, karate is the second most popular sport in Sri Lanka.
Randev says that the general perception towards karate is as a ‘blood sport’ but it actually requires a lot of technique, proficiency and is a real art work. It can be practiced as a self defense or a combat sport. It emphasizes on self development.
“Karate means ‘empty fist’. Therefore it basically involves hand combination kind of techniques. Judo is more about throws while taekwondo involves kicks. However karate is a mixture of all these though the emphasis is on the hands,” he explained.
Randev had taken part in his first tournament when he was seven years old. It was a district event. Then he went on to win the provincial tournament and later he got into the national tournaments.
“I did not win the nationals in my first tournament but after many more practices I managed to emerge winner at the event at the end of 2008,” he said.
He has won gold medals at tournaments like the Nepal International Karate Tournament which was held in Dhangadhi, Nepal, and the South Asian Karate Tournament which was held in New Delhi, India. He had bagged silver medals at the Silent Knight International Karate Cup, Malaysia, Iran International Karate Tournament held in Teheran, Iran, and the Asian Milo Karate Championship held in Malaysia. He won his black belt which reflects the highest degree of competence in the sport last year. He was awarded the Outstanding Sportsman and Coloursman by St Peters College.
Queried on what makes a good karate player Randev was quick to note that it is mainly determination that is the key to excelling in the sport.
“You need focus and good self discipline as well,” he added.
The battle maybe with only one opponent at a time but Randev notes that this makes the task more difficult.
“You get points for the attacks that you do. There are roughly about seven attacks but there are beyond 30 to 40 techniques that you can use to eliminate your foe.”
He notes that meditation is important for warming up and cooling down. It helps players focus and be attentive in situations.
“Since I am preparing for my G C E Ordinary Levels the number of days that I engage in my training sessions has reduced. I used to practice every day in the past. Now my schedule includes practicing twice with the national team and three times with my personal trainer. I also train one day with my father. My training sessions normally last for around four to two hours,” Randev said adding that the last international tournament he took part in was the South Asian Championship in October, 2016. He will be taking part in the South Asian Karate Tournament which will be held in Sri Lanka in August.
The talented karateka has trained under Shihan Hiroshi Ota (8th Dan Black belt), Shihan Allan Campbell (6th Dan Black belt) and Shihan K Gopalan (10th Dan Black Belt). Randev’s formative training was under Sensei D M D Nimal and Sensei Safraz. National coaches Sensei Jurangpathy and Sensei Kalyani is training him for the upcoming South Asian Games 2017 and Olympics 2020. His father is his manager. The Rector of St Peter’s College Rev Fr Trevor Martin, Sports Coordinator Rev Fr Thilina Pathum and his family priest Rev Fr Lakmin give him spiritual guidance.
Recalling his moments of glory during his tours Randev notes that he felt accomplished after taking part in the South Asian Karate Championship which was held in October 2016. The event was held in India and Randev was the captain of the seven member cadet team.
“However my most memorable tour was the Indonesian tournament because it was unlike all the previous tournaments that I have taken part in. The standards of the events were on
par with the internationally acclaimed tournaments. There were opening and closing ceremonies. There was a dinner after the tournaments for the players. Many of the top ranking players were present at the event,” he said adding that karate is going to be a part of the Olympics in 2020.
Randev says that it has been tough in the beginning to balance his studies and sport but he gradually developed his own discipline and adapt to a schedule.
“Every day is challenging and I ask myself whether I would be able to run things smoothly. You need to be update about everything in the game because the rules keep evolving as the sport had gained more popularity during recent years. I succeeded mainly because of my family and teacher’s support,” he expressed.
Randev’s father, Dr Rohantha Athukorala, is a marketer at World Bank. His mother, Roshani, is a teacher at St. Peter’s College. His brother, Rehan, is in grade two and is also engaged in karate.
Randev says that as one grows more serious with the sport and takes on more tournaments, one’s diet needs to be changed as well to suit the requirements. Randev had to take in more protein as he excelled in karate.
He admires the karate number one ranker Rafael Aghayev of Azerbaijan. He notes that he looks up to him because Aghayev took karate to a different level.
“He changed his fighting techniques while following the rules of the game. His fighting techniques are not those you would expect from a normal person. He changed the mindset of other
players by taking the sport to different standards,” he enthused.
Randev likes to listen to soul and pop music during his free time. He also enjoys reading books. His loves spending time with his family and loved ones. The family’s recent passion is going on safaris. They have been to Yala and Wennapuwa for their holidays.
Randev wants to follow his G C E Advanced Levels in the Commerce stream and become a marketer like his father.
“Life is too short to restrict yourself. Be outgoing. Do not hesitate to push yourself. Put studies first but try to strike a balance between them and your other activities. A person who does not waste his time but put it to good use will become successful in life,” he opined.
