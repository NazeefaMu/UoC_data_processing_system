Namal’s Gowers case hearing on Sept. 18

A case filed against Hambantota District Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and five others for their alleged involvement in laundering money amounting to Rs.30 million through Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited was yesterday fixed for September 18 by the Colombo High Court.
Three accused Namal Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Nithya Senani Samaranayake and Sujani Bogollagama who functioned as the directors of Gowers Corporation Pvt. Ltd were present in court when the case was taken up before High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe.
However, the second, forth and sixth accused Indika Karunajeewa, Iresha Silva and Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited were not present in Court but represented by attorneys.
Meanwhile, the High Court deferred for September 18 to lead evidence in terms of Section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code to proceed the trial in the absentia of second, forth and sixth accused in the case.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had served indictments on three accused regarding this money laundering case.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Karunajeewa, Sujani Bogollagama, Iresha Silva, Senani Samaranayake and Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited on 11 counts under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.30 million in a company (Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited) owned by Namal Rajapaksa between 2013 and 2014.
It was reported that Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited of Colombo 5, is providing coordinating services to SriLankan Airlines.
The FCID had initiated investigations into this matter following a complaint by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited while being an MP from the Rs.125 million earned through illegal means.
President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for Namal Rajapaksa. President’s Counsel Anil de Silva appeared for the third accused. Counsel Sampath Mendis appearing for the second accused informed Court that he was appearing for the absconding accused.
