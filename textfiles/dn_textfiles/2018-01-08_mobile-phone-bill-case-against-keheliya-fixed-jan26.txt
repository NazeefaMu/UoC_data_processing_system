A corruption case against former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and the former State Printing Corporation (SPC) Chairman for allegedly causing an unlawful loss of Rs.230,984 to the government was fixed on January 26 by Colombo Chief Magistrate, today.
The former Minister is alleged to have paid his mobile phone bill using SPC funds, while he functioned as the Mass Media Minister in 2012.
The order regarding the objections raised by defense over the maintainability of the charge sheet is to be delivered on the next date by Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had induced the CPC chairman to pay his mobile phone bill from March 15, 2012 to April 14, 2012 causing an unlawful loss to the government, while serving as the Mass Media Minister.
