Religion to lead youth on right path: Ruwan

Youths’ ties with religion should be strengthened through Sunday Schools, to protect society from all immoral and illegal activities, as they are increasing at an alarming rate, State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said on Sunday. He was addressing a foundation stone-laying ceremony for the construction of a three-storeyed dharma shalawa at the Galagane Purana Viharasthanaya in Molagoda, Kegalle.
“Today, more youths are getting addicted to drugs and engaging in other crimes,” State Minister Wijewardene said, adding that the government, with assistance from the police, had taken measures to control the situation. The state minister said that the issue could be controlled if youth were to attend Sunday School at a young age, instead of going to tuition classes.
“Sunday School is the place where a child is made a righteous and a virtuous citizen,” State Minister Wijewarden said. “Tuition classes would impart knowledge on children, but they are not enough to build a righteous and law-abiding society.” He added that the Central Cultural Fund would provide Rs.500,000 for the construction of the building, while an additional sum of Rs.1 million would be provided for the Gamperaliya programme, under the direction of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Galagane Purana Viharasthanaya in Molagoda, is the temple where the 20x15 square-foot Hathara Korale flag which was offered by King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe, was placed for protection.
Galagane Purana Viharasthanaya Chief Incumbent and Sabaragamuwa Palath Pradana Adikarana Sanganayake Ven. Hettimulle Siddaratha Thera presided over the ceremony. Kegalle District Parliamentarian Sandith Samarasinghe participated as well.
