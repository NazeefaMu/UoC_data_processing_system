CC unanimous in approving President’s nomination for cj

The Constitutional Council (CC) yesterday unanimously approved President Maithripala Sirisena’s recommendation of Supreme Court Justice Nalin Perera as the next Chief Justice of Sri Lanka.
The CC sent its decision to the President to make the official appointment.
The CC chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya met yesterday for the first time with the newly appointed members.
However, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, MP Bimal Rathnayake, former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa and Dr.Jayantha Dhanapala were absent for the meeting.
The CC had received only one nomination from the President for the post of CJ and the CC approved that nomination. “The CC considered the fact that Justice Perera will be the first career Judge to be appointed as Chief Justice after 30 years.
The last was Chief Justice Parinda Ranasinghe who rose to the top most position after being appointed a Magistrate initially,” sources of the CC said.
He is the 46th Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. Nalin Jayalath Perera was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Maithripala Sirisena in 2016.
Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala and Civil Society representatives Ahmad Javid Yusuf and Naganathan Selvakkumaran attended the CC meeting.
The 10-member CC is the apex decision making body that recommends the appointments to the Independent Commissions and high ranking positions such as the Attorney General, Auditor General, Parliament Secretary General, IGP, Chief Justice and superior court judges etc.
