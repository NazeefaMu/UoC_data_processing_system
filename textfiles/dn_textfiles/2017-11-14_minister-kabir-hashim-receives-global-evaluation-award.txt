Minister Kabir Hashim receives Global Evaluation Award

A national evaluation policy will be established through and Act of Parliament next year to ensure that there is accountability and flexibility regarding every cent invested on development projects by the government said Enterprise Development Minister and UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim.
He said this at a press conference held after receiving the Global Evaluation Award from President Maithripala Sirisena at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday.
He received this award for being the first Parliamentarian who lavishly contributed to advance the culture of evaluation in the context of sustainable development goals, emphasised on the need for national policies and extended support for global Parliamentarians in his capacity as the President of the Global Parliamentarians’ Forum.
Kabir Hashim who said that he was discussing this measure with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe added that this evaluation policy would be a framework to oversee investments made by the government to ensure that maximum results were obtained from every cent of public funds invested.
He said certain projects implemented did not bring results sufficient even to settle their loan installments.
Although loans amounting to billions of rupees had been received by the country since independence, there was a doubt as to whether the desired results have been obtained through investments made with such funds.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was also present when Minister Kabir Hashim received the award form President Sirisena.
