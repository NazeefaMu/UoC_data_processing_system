Chinese firm to operate  China iCloud accounts

It has contacted customers based in China, advising them to examine new terms and conditions.
They include a clause that both Apple and the Chinese firm will have access to all data stored on iCloud.
Apple said it had made the move to comply with the country's cloud computing regulations. iCloud accounts registered outside of China are not affected.
The Chinese cyber security rules, introduced in July last year, include a requirement for companies to store all data within China. The firm, Guizhou on the Cloud Big Data (GCBD), is owned by the Guizhou provincial government in southern China. Guizhou is where Apple opened a $1bn (£738m) data centre last year to meet the regulations. (BBC)
