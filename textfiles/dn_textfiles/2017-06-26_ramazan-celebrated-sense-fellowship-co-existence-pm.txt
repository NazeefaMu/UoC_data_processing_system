Ramazan celebrated with sense of fellowship, co-existence: PM

 
The Ramazan Festival is celebrated by Muslims with a deep sense of fellowship and co-existence in countries throughout the world, states Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a Ramazan message. The message adds. “Ramazan ends a time of fasting undertaken as a period of reflection and religious observances, marked with alms giving and sharing with others.
“The fasting associated with Ramazan encourages mental and physical commitment to the faith and also enables families and communities to connect with one another and renew values sacred to Islam.
“Eid Mubarak to all Muslims in Sri Lanka and throughout the world.”
