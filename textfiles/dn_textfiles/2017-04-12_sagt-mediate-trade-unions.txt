SAGT to mediate with Trade Unions

South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) Chief Executive Officer, Erwin Haaze says that they are extremely dismayed at the negative impact of the current trade union action.
For nearly a week now terminal operations at South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) continue to be well below the world class standards we deliver to our customers.
This “Best in class” operational performance has attracted multiple independent globally recognized “best practice” awards consecutively in the last two years.
The disruption is influenced by worker disgruntlement over the annual bonus.
“We are extremely dismayed at the negative impact this action has caused our customers.”
The bonus was paid last week in accordance with the collective agreement (CA) which was concluded only about six months ago.
The bonus structure payment represents a number of months’ salary and was the highest paid in SAGT’s history to date.
The company has taken a stand against this unjustified and illegal disruption of holding the company to ransom. “Although this could mean that there is no quick solution, we are doing our utmost to bring resolution as soon as possible by exploring other options including mediation also.” “We are in close operational collaboration with the two other terminals in the Port of Colombo, who have in turn extended their fullest support in ensuring minimal impact to the port’s customers.”
