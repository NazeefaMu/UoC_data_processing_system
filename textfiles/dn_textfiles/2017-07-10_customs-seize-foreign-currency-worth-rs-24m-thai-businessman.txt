Customs seize foreign currency worth Rs 2.4m from Thai businessman

Foreign currency valued at Rs 2.4 million was seized from a Thailand bound businessman by Sri Lanka Customs officers at the Bandaranaike International Airport yesterday. The seized currencies were in US Dollars and Swiss Francs.
Sri Lanka Customs spokesman and Deputy Director Sunil Jayaratna said the notes of the contraband currencies were detected from the businessman’s baggage in the wee hours. The suspect was caught while he was undergoing airport check-in and security clearance. His flight TG 301 was to take off at 1.20 am. He was arrested just minutes before the flight.
He had 15,600 US Dollars and 200 Swiss Francs in his possession, said Jayaratna. The Customs took steps to forfeit the money. The Customs released the businessman after severe warning, he said.
