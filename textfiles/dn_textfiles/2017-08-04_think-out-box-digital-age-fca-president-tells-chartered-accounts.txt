Addressing the FCA Convocation at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka), its President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that they should take greater responsibility in shaping the profession to meet with increasing stakeholder expectations.

The distinguished FCA designation was conferred to 201 chartered accountants by the institute, elevating them to the highest stratum in their professional career. The new fellow members of CA Sri Lanka included high profile corporate leaders.
“The world we live in is moving fast and amidst this fast paced change, we are also witnessing a technological revolution, and this revolution is having a great impact not only in the way we live, but it also impacts all professionals, including ours,” he said.
Wickremasinghe said that gone were the days when everyone relied on conventional ways to carry out operations and the technological revolution has changed everything, including the way business is done and the manner in which people communicate.
“This revolution has also had an impact on our accounting profession, where certain methods which were considered an inherently human process, are today being automated,” he said.
He explained that this was why it was important for chartered accountants, including the new fellow members to think out of the box and be ready to embrace change, as well as know how to convert challenges into opportunities and continue to be at the helm, in driving organisations to success. Chairman of the CA Member Relations Committee Thivanka Jayasinghe, said that the fellow status, more commonly known as FCA, is given to members as its highest level of membership. “This premier status of the accounting profession in Sri Lanka will provide you with greater responsibility now. The professional standards that are expected of a chartered accountant, are extremely challenging and I am sure the FCA status will give you even more strength to maintain this standard,” he added.
University Grants Commission Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva disclosed that the Independent Quality Assurance and Accreditation Authority Bill will be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for approval and this would be the way forward to develop Sri Lanka’s higher education future.
