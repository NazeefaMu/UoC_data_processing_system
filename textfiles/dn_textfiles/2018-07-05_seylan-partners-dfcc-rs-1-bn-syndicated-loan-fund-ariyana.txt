Seylan partners DFCC for Rs 1 bn  syndicated loan to fund ARIYANA

Seylan Bank PLC has arranged a syndicated credit facility of Rs 1 billion to Home Lands Skyline (Pvt) Ltd . Seylan Bank PLC was the lead bank for the syndicated loan along with DFCC Bank PLC.
Home Lands Skyline expects to fuse the loan capital to gear-up the accelerated construction of their recently launched project and Sri Lanka’s first ever resort apartment complex ARIYANA Resort Apartment Complex. ARIYANA is an apt residential solution expected to hinge several long prevailing gaps in the domestic residential real estate market.
The syndicated loan agreement by Home Lands Skyline (Pvt) Ltd, between Seylan Bank PLC and DFCC Bank PLC was recently signed at the Seylan Bank headquarters, with the participation of the top management of the company and senior officials representing the two banks.
