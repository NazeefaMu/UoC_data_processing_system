Cycle Wassa winners receives foldable bikes

The ‘Scan Jumbo Peanuts Cycle Wassa’ initially began as a consumer promotion campaign in the year 2014. With success at the first event, the ‘Scan Jumbo Peanuts Cycle Wassa 2’ took place in 2015 as well.
Acknowledging the continued success of the campaign, the Management of Scan Products decided to hold the event for the third time and the campaign took place early this year. The promotional period for the campaign was held from January 20 to March 11.
An objective for the succession of this campaign was to celebrate and give back to loyal customers who have continued to favour Scan Products over the years. The initiative oversaw promotional awareness, which was extended to 98 towns during the course of the campaign’s time period.
An award ceremony was held on June 20, in Colombo and the winners of the ‘Scan Jumbo Peanuts Cycle Wessa 3’ were presented with their mountain bikes.
The product is marketed by C. W. Mackie PLC Group’s Imports, Manufacturing and Marketing/Distribution arm of branded FMCG products.
