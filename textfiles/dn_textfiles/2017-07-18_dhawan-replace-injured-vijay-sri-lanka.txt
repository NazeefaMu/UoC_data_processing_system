Dhawan to replace injured Vijay for Sri Lanka

A wrist injury that had troubled M Vijay during the home series against Australia has resurfaced to rule him out of the upcoming Sri Lanka Tests. He has been replaced by Shikhar Dhawan in the 16-man squad.
Vijay complained of pain in his right wrist while playing a preparatory match and the BCCI medical team has advised him to continue his rehabilitation program.
Dhawan was originally left out of the squad for Sri Lanka despite his impressive form in the Champions Trophy last month, making way for back-up opener Abhinav Mukund. The two left-handers and KL Rahul, also returning from a shoulder injury, will be India’s opening options for the three Tests beginning July 26 in Galle.
