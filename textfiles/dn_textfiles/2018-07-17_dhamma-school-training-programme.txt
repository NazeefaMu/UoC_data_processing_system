Dhamma school training programme

A training program was conducted to educate teachers of Dhamma Schools in the Central Colombo area. The event was organized by the Sasanarakshaka Bala Mandalaya and the Faizer Mustapha Foundation at the Sri Somananda Temple, Colombo recently.
Minister of Provincial Council, Local Government and Sports Faizer Musthapha distributed certificates to the Dhamma school teachers. He said Dhamma education is required to protect the culture of the country.
“Today we see that parents forget about religion and show their children that they are only interested in their studies. Without proper knowledge of Dhamma education, it can not be given to the next generation. A Dhamma school teacher is responsible for giving the Dhamma education to increase the literacy of the children,” he said.
He added that he has launched a massive program for the Daham Pasal teachers in the Kandy district by centering the Malwathu and Asgiriya temples.
