Yoko Ono Talks John Lennon, Art and Paul McCartney's Complaints

Ono on what she and Lennon learned from each other. Plus she responds to McCartney's comments about Beatles songwriting credits.John Lennon made drawings before he met Yoko Ono in 1966, but it was only after he started a relationship with Ono—at the time a rising art star—that he really came into his own as an artist. Over the course of their time together, the Beatle went from rendering cartoons influenced by British absurdist humor to a simple but elegant style that was indebted to both contemporary minimalism and traditional Japanese painting. His modest, intimate portraits of Yoko and their son Sean provided a fitting visual accompaniment to the music he made about their lives together.
How are you?
You know, busy. That's good.
You have this exhibit opening soon.
I know. I'm really happy about that, because this is John's 75th this year, so I wanted good representation of John in many places. And this is one that's very good.
What in particular makes you excited about it?
When John was alive, he wanted to do an art exhibition, and somehow there was such a heavy prejudice at the time, that one person in one field, that they should always stick to it and never go out of it. So he was, you know, he was not getting his due.
It seems like he's had more recognition as an artist since then.
Yeah. After John's passing, the first thing I thought was... well, I have to finish Milk and Honey [eds. note: the album she made with Lennon]. But after that, I thought we should do something about John's artwork. So I got these professional people who create that kind of program, and that worked very well. Now his work is shown in many places.
Both you and John were musicians as well as visual artists. Did you draw a distinction between the two, or were they two sides of the same creative process?
We didn't have any plans about it. When John did artwork, he just did it, and I did things that way, too. It worked very well that way.
It seems that the two of you learned a lot from each other. What did you learn from John, as an artist, and what do you think he learned from you?
Well, I don't know what he picked up from me. I think that the fact that we were together did something, probably, but I wasn't doing the kind of artwork that he was doing, and he wasn't doing the kind of artwork that I was doing. That was very lucky. [Laughs] We didn't fight about it.
Are there different aspects of his personality that came through in his visual art, rather than his music?
I think so. Rock 'n' roll is a different animal. There's a kind of macho element that they tried to bring out. He did create many beautiful, sweet songs as well. Actually, when he did something really macho it was great. [Laughs] With John, he just liked to [make art] like he was a little child. Actually, when he was a little child, he did incredible, cynical stuff that most people would never think was done by a child. He was extremely developed in that way already. You could put it in a newspaper or something like that. When we met and we were together, he was mostly very happy about the fact that we were together. Then Sean was born. All that affected him. He really felt, I think, good about it, and that comes out in his work. But also, there was still some little cynical stuff in there, too. It was very, very interesting watching that.
You and Sean are the subjects of a lot of his pieces. In John's music at the time, it seemed like he was really striving to find some sort of happiness, but in his artwork, there's a feeling of contentment already.
I was kind of embarrassed that we were almost the only subject matter. Something was coming out of him very naturally at the time, so I wasn't going to stop it. Many artists before him and after him have used their wives or children as subject matter. Because they were together, and it was very easy. I think that he just felt that he wanted that side of him to come out—his love for his life, which he didn't have very much of before we were together. He was celebrating that.
How do you choose which pieces of his to show or publish?
I always think that I have to choose something that would really represent John, in a way. But it's all that. I just realized that he was, not just prolific, but so good. When he was doing something, he just did it, but extremely fast. I enjoyed watching it over his shoulder. Anything I chose to put in an art show, or something like that, I was really in love with that particular drawing or serigraph or whatever. The reason why I could just love his work, hands down, was because the way he created artwork was so different from me. We had very different kinds of formats. Like I said before, there was no competition. I just loved the things that I could never have done.
Paul McCartney recently told Esquire UK that he's a little dissatisfied with the way that Beatles songs are all credited to Lennon-McCartney, even if John didn't contribute to them. What do you think about that?
Well, I'm sure he has so many painful memories. Somebody who was very close to him as a partner passed away. At the time, John was only 40, and none of us thought he was going to go. That must have been a great shock to Paul as well. I think that he's also a very sensitive artist, so instead of expressing his sorrow in a direct sort of way... He just wanted to say some things that he didn't want to say, probably, but he just said it.?
