Power supply continues despite Norochcholai breakdown

A generator malfunctioned in the Norochcholai coal power plant yesterday, the Ceylon Electricity Board said.
The malfunction will not affect the overall power sup ply, a spokesperson for the CEB said. He said the breakdown was caused due to a technical failure in one of the boilers and it will take at least a couple of days to rectify the defect.
