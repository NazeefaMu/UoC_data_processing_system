Cabinet approves 12.5 percent bus fare hike

 
The Cabinet of Ministers approved to increase bus fares by 12.5 percent a short while ago.
 
Accordingly the minimum fare will hike from Rs. 10 to Rs. 12.
 
Earlier this month the Cabinet of Ministers approved to only increase bus fares by 6.56 percent due to the recent fuel price hike.
 
But taking into account the Lanka Private Bus Owners demands to further increase bus fares (to increase the minimum fare to Rs. 15), the government decided to hike bus fares only by 12.5 percent.
