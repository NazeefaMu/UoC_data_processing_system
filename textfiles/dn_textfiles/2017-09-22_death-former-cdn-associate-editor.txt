Death of former CDN Associate Editor

The death occurred yesterday of veteran journalist N.R.J. Aaron (87), a former Associate Editor of the Daily News, after a brief illness.
Aaron served the Daily News for an unbroken 41 years prior to his retirement, holding various positions in the newspaper including News Editor (for more than 10 years), Deputy Editor and Associate Editor under several editors-in-chief.
During his years of service, he was the live wire of the newspaper, working nearly 18 hours a day. He oversaw many editorial and technological changes in the newspaper, the flagship publication of Lake House.
Born on December 28, 1930, Aaron was educated at Carey College, Colombo, within walking distance of his Punchi Borella residence. He joined Lake House as a trainee reporter soon after leaving school where he rose rapidly through the ranks at the Daily News. Aaron had a remarkable nose for news and as a news editor, guided his reporters to write lead worthy stories. He had an impeccable command of the English language which enabled him to rewrite even the most mundane stories in a way that captured the readers’ attention. He was a mentor to young reporters at Lake House and encouraged them to initiate their own stories.
He received the Lifetime Achievement for Long and Distinguished Service to Journalism in Sri Lanka from the Editors’ Guild of Sri Lanka a few years ago. He is survived by his sister. The remains are at A.F. Raymond’s Funeral Parlour, Borella and the funeral will be held on Saturday (23) afternoon at the General Cemetery Kanatte.
