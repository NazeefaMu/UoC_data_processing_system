Thenuwara took three wickets off the last three balls of one over and followed it up with two wickets off the first two balls on his next over to finish with figures of 5 for 28 in the Kalutara Vidyalaya first innings of 80.
He followed this fine bowling performance by top scoring with 77 in Tissa Central’s first innings of 162.
When Kalutara Vidyalaya batted a second time Thenuwara was again to the fore capturing a further three wickets. Tissa MMV won the match on first innings.
