Blood bank Director transferred out

The acting Director of National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) Dr. Rukshan Bellana has been removed from his post from yesterday.
He had been transferred to the Health Ministry, Health Ministry sources told the Daily News yesterday. Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) members attached to the National Blood Transfusion Centre launched a strike on Monday demanding his removal as acting Director.
Meanwhile, Health Minister and Co-cabinet spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said he had ordered an inquiry against Dr. Bellana over his actions, but he was not happy with the punishment given by the Public Services Commission earlier, in demoting him by only two grades for insulting the President.
“I summoned them for a discussion and asked them what the punishment given was? they said he would be demoted by two pay grades, I told them, so if you insult the leader of the country, you have a demotion of two pay grades, if it is the Prime Minister one? And if it is a minister is it just a stern warning?”.
Strongly critical of the inquiries into public officials who have insulted the Heads of State, the Minister said an inquiry into another government official who had called the Prime Minister a mental patient, had not yielded results even after a year.
“Over a year and no report. This is the state of the government”, he said.
The Health Minister stressed that amidst strong opposition from him, the former Ministry Secretary and the Health Services Deputy Director General had gone ahead with the appointment.
He said he had to even seek the President’s assistance to have the acting director removed from his post yesterday.
