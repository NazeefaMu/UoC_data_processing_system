Coordinated effort to overcome drought in Wilpattu

The prevailing drought in the northern and central region of Sri Lanka has had an adverse effect on wildlife.
One of the most affected areas has been identified as the Wilpattu National Park. As a result of the drought almost all of the waterholes in the park have gone dry causing great suffering to the animals inhabiting the park area.
The critical situation and urgently required relief measures were the main topics of discussion during a meeting between the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, Gamini Jayawickrema Perera,Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga, senior officials of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority and representatives of the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO).
During themeeting held at the office of the Minister of Tourism Developmentlast afternoon, SLAITO volunteered to fill up the dried up waterholes by transporting water in large bowsersin order to provide relief to the animals. SLAITO was represented by its Ex-Co Members Nalin Jayasundera, Nishad Wijetunga and Anuruddha Bandara.
It was revealed that 30 water bowsers could fill up the 8 water holes for a week. SLAITO agreed to facilitate the transportation of water by bowsers to these waterholes on an urgent basis. Minister Jayawickrema Perera welcomed the move and directed the Director General of Wildife to make necessary arrangements to expedite the process.
Minister Amaratunga called for a continuing dialogue among the parties so as to ensure proper coordination of the relief efforts. It was also decided to close the park for visitors during the low season months of May and June in order to carry out maintenance work at the Wilpattu National Park.
Based on a proposal by Minister Jayawickrema Perera it was also decided to strictly enforce zoning restrictions whereby tourists and other visitors will be allowed to only visit designated zones in the park.
