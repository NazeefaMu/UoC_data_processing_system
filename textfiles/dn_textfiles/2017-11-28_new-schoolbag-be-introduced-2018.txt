New schoolbag to be introduced in 2018

A new schoolbag will be introduced next year with the intention of protecting school children from scoliosis, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, consultant doctors have already pointed out the need of introducing a new schoolbag for children with less weight. Minister Senaratne was addressing the gathering after taking part in the walk that took place in Colombo recently to educate the public on scoliosis.
Minister Senaratne said that financial assistance can be provided from the Health Development Fund to seek medical treatment from foreign countries for the children severely affected by scoliosis. The relevant surgeries required for children suffering from scoliosis will commence in Sri Lanka soon.
The extreme weight of their school bags have significantly contributed towards developing scoliosis in school children. A total of 523 children with scoliosis have been registered with the health authorities up to now, he added.
