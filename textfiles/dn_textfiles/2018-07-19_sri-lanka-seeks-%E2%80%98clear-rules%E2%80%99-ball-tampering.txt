Sri Lanka seeks ‘clear rules’ on  ball tampering

Sri Lanka’s sports minister called on the International Cricket Council to establish “simple, clear rules” Wednesday after skipper Dinesh Chandimal was punished for ball tampering.
“Laws governing the offense / act of altering the condition of the ball are somewhat vague and lack clarity,” Faiszer Musthapha said in a statement.
“I invite the ICC to revisit the applicable laws and ensure that a set of simple, clear and certain rules and procedures are put in place.”
He did not elaborate but the statement came after Chandimal, coach Chandika Hathurusingha and manager Asanka Gurusinha were sanctioned following a tampering scandal. - AFP
