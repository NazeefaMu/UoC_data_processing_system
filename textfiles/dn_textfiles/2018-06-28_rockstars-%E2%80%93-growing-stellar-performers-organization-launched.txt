The evening ended with an address by Dr. Pujitha Silva, a co-author of the book and the author of the P3 GROWTHS Model, who spoke about the journey of bringing the book to life, and pledged his gratitude to the people who had been part of that journey. He concluded his speech with the story of a lab-technician he met at the University of Moratuwa where he is a lecturer, and inspired the audience with how an ordinary man can leave behind a legacy as a RockStar. The P3 GROWTHS Model, which is the model upon which the book has been written, was highlighted throughout the launch, and the ideas within the model on growing as people, and growing people was discussed in detail during the panel discussion.
The human body was presented as a leadership model, drawing parallels from the principles of the P3 GROWTHS model and the functions of our bodily organs.
At the end of the launch, the authors also presented a diagnostic tool, “Transformational Quotient” (TQ), a questionnaire that can help a leader ascertain their level of readiness to bring about transformation in their work.
This tool is based on insights from the P3 GROWTHS Model as well.
