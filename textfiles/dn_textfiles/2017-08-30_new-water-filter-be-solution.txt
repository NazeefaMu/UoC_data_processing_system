New water filter to be the solution

The Health Ministry, in league with B. R. J. W. Enterprises, is conducting research on the possibility of utilising a water filter machine introduced by a British firm to resolve the acute water scarcity problem in Sri Lanka and combat the kidney disease fast-spreading in Raja Rata and several other parts of the country.
B. R. J. W. Enterprises Director Darren Weerasinghe said successful test runs carried out in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Medirigiriya, Dehiattakandiya, Mahiyangana and several other areas have proved that this water filter can be provided to these areas for use for the consumption of safe drinking water.
The filter had been successfully used in several other countries facing acute water problems, including Afghanistan. They had decided to introduce in Sri Lanka too, as a gesture of supporting President Maithripala Sirisena's sincere efforts to combat the kidney disease spreading in the NCP. Before introducing the filter, they met President Maithripala Sirisena and held a practical demonstration of the filter and the President was amazed about its working which helped to turn contaminated water into pure drinking water in a moment.
This water filter produced by Life Saver Company had been imported from Britain.
No financial burden is involved in operating this filter machine which can purify 18.5 litres of water at a given time. One filter can serve about 10 familities as it does not involve any electronic operation. Only the filter has to be changed after purification of 20,000 litres. Using this filter machine is more economical when considering the massive Rs. 124 billion spent annually by the Government to provide pure drinking water to the people.
The British firm Life Saver Company had already introduced this machine to Afghanistan and the Arab world.
A family of four may have to spend a meagre 50 cents per day for using this machine as no fuel or electricity is needed for its operation.
Regional Manager of the Life Saver Company Stewert Ellson said it is being planned to supply this filter machine to people free of charge or at a nominal subsidised price.
