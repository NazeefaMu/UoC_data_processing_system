[APPRECIATIONS - (15-05-2017)]

Lionel Fernandez
Honest man
It is with great sadness that we announce the passing away of Lionel Fernandez. Lionel was the loving husband of Wilma Fernandez for 49 years. He leaves his wife, two sons, Mike and Dave, daughter-in-law Purvi (Dave’s wife), granddaughter Angelina, older brother Gabo, younger sisters Kamala and Bridget, several nephews and nieces and numerous other family members and friends.
He attended St. Benedict’s College in Sri Lanka and was regarded very highly for his athletic and academic achievements. Lionel, known as ‘LPS’ amongst his friends, was an accomplished athlete throughout his school career in sports such as track and field, soccer, hockey and cricket. His team mates in athletics were Godson Vincent Perera, Aldo Abeysena and Maxwell Zoysa. Football mates were Godson Perera, Eric Perera, Nithi and Sampooran Nicholas, Mark Kronemberg and 'Bana' Rajaratnam. Lionel excelled in athletics, winning the 400 and 880-metre events at the Public Schools Athletic meet.
After arriving in Canada with his wife in 1974, he started working for a company which he remained loyal to throughout his working years. He also continued to show a love for sports by coaching his sons’ soccer teams for many years where he demonstrated leadership and was a role model for many kids. As he grew older, watching sports such as baseball, basketball and soccer with his family continued to be a big part of his life.
Over the past 2 ½ years, Lionel was battling an illness that he ultimately succumbed to on Thursday, March 23.
Throughout his life, Lionel exemplified kindness, honesty and a passion to spread joy to those around him. Although he will be sorely missed by his family and friends, he would not want us to mourn his death, but rather, celebrate his life.
May he rest in peace.

Monica De Alwis
Humble matriarch
Monica Marion Phyllis De Alwis peacefully clasped the blessed hands of the almighty god, though unexpectedly, after a livelihood of 96 years on April 6, 2017. She was the precious life partner of the late senior attorney-at-law Lucian A.P. De Alwis JPUM.
Monica De Alwis was the third of twelve siblings in the family of the departed well-known criminal lawyer Chevalier C.L.W. Perera and the late Esther Perera of Kurunegala. Amma was the doting mother of five sons and six daughters. She was also the fond grandmother to twenty five children, as well as adorable great grandmother of fourteen kids.
Amma was the doyen and matriarch of a wide and extended family circle comprising of Doctors, Lawyers, Engineers, Bank and Mercantile Executives, IT Professionals and Entrepreneurs. She hailed from a lineage of gentility and repute in a conservative ardent catholic background. Amma was always simple and humble, modest and elegant in attire, religious and zealous with no false airs and cultivated demeanours. Her gracefully and pleasing ways were the hallmark of her interactions in society with relations, friends, clergy and colleagues.
She was faithful and loyal to her late husband and supported him in all endeavours, be it family matters, professional needs, solutions to problems and in all aspects of living. They were attached to each other, heightened by understanding, trust and hope. The upkeep and bringing up of a large family were no burden to them. Amma actively joined Thaththa in providing the necessities and requirements of the family ranging from nutrition, medication, clothing, counselling, education, music and sports. She maintained a spic and span household with order and decor. Her domain was of course the kitchen, where she prepared balanced and healthy food with care and attention.
Amma’s culinary skills were prominently displayed on important and significant occasions with a well-laid out, grilled and garnished table carrying sumptuous dishes. Featured among them was her appetising Beef Smore and the delicious Seeni Sambol.
The highlight of the marriage of Thaththa and Amma was the celebrations of their Fiftieth wedding Anniversary in 1994 at the Mount Lavinai Hotel amidst family, relations and friends, with joyful toasts and felicitations and bands and music beginning with a mass of thanksgiving. The golden era continued further for five years and ended in 1999, with the demise of Thaththa. Consequent to her husband's death, Amma lived in prayer, remembrance and gratitude for eighteen long years with love, care and support, surrounded by grateful family.
Amma nurtured a pleasant outdoor environment with cultivation of exotic plants, paying special attention to flowering varieties. Befittingly, her bier was adorned with clusters of varies hues of fragrant Roses and Dahlias. Her prowess with the needle was the exponent of a unique talent. Her nimble and swift fingers transformed colourful and designed creations of embroidery handiwork, which attracted the admiration of many for their execution, neatness and presentation. The image of Santa Claus impressed in thread on chair covers are yet exhibited at Christmas. The bedspreads meticulously worked out in patterns of appropriate designs and motifs are still preserved as family heirlooms.
Another aspect of Amma's profound standards was her respect, regard concern, friendship and assistance to others, including orphanages and elders' homes. It was in consideration of others wants as well as an acknowledgement of their success, she moved among people sincerely with ease and freedom, not forgetting their birthdays and anniversaries. Amma also took intense pleasure in presenting gifts and memorabilia at appropriate times. Unforgettable are the splendid Christmas get-togethers when Santa Claus called our names to hug us with a present.
Amma's departure from the earthly shores marked an innings of accomplishments in love and fidelity, in care and concern, in goodwill and sincerity, in charity and assistance, in praise and trust in God.
Thank you Amma for the memories you have left and for the good times we have shared.
The obsequies were conducted by Rev. Fr. Bonnie Fernandopulle and Rev. Fr. Sriyan Ranasinghe OMI and her mortal remains were laid to rest in her husband's grave at Mount Lavinia Cemetery.
May Amma be at Peace!

Raja Raja Kuruppu Kuruppu
Benevolent soul
Raja came to Royal Prep School from ‘Galendale,’ Bandarawela, which was a branch of Royal Prep during the world war years. Having entered Royal Prep as a matter of course, he joined the main College in 1947. From then onwards, he was a member of the Royal College 47 Group. The 47 Group celebrated its 70th anniversary recently, being 70 years since its members left Royal College, in the years of either 1955 or 1956. In the Prep School, we had a dedicated group of teachers and when we left to join the main College, our Head Master was the late H.D. Sugathapala. At that time, respect for teachers and good discipline among students was taken for granted and there was no breach in those values. The College calendar was divided into three phases. The first term was devoted to study in our new class and the Royal-Thomian Cricket match. The next term had the Royal-Trinity Rugger match and the main event in the last phase, which was the examination term was the College prize-giving.
Raja was a good student and had an interest in being an economist. In sports, he had a passion for swimming, but he could not participate in swimming as the College at that time did not have a swimming pool of its own. The only swimming pool was at St. Thomas’, Mt. Lavinia, which was not accessible to us students. He played a leading role in the Debating Society of the College in both, the Sinhala and English languages and he won the Best Speakers Prize for Sinhala.
Raja did not play cricket, but he was always busy organizing the fun and frolic associated with the Royal-Thomian Cricket match. One year, he got the bright idea of getting an old crock for us for the Royal-Thomian cricket match. Raja had the initiative to interview the late Richard Pieris and succeeded in obtaining an old crock for us to travel to the match. The car was decorated with blue and gold flags and we travelled to the match in it from Royal College. At that time, there was no cycle parade. As the big match fever subsided and the new term arrived, we began preparing for the Royal-Trinity Rugger match. The focus was on the match at Kandy. We travelled to Kandy by train, but had no accommodation in Kandy. Our normal practice was to appeal to the police to give us a place to sleep for the night. The team stayed at Trinity College. That year, Trinity had a strong team and Royal was badly defeated. The Bradby shield remained in Kandy and we had to travel back from Kandy shouting ‘What’s the matter? Minor matter.’
The third was the term that we had to face examinations. Though we were not brilliant students, we passed examinations without a problem. We entered the Peradeniya University and our Hall of Residence was Jayathileke Hall. Raja occupied a room adjoining my room. I had to face a viva to gain entrance to the University. Raja advised me to name Palmistry as my hobby in my application form, as he said that the interview would be easy as he was sure the professors would like to get their palms read as a part of the interview. He produced details about the palms of the professors which he had gathered from others who had faced the viva with palmistry as their hobby. As he predicted, I spent much time reading the palms of the interviewers at the interview.
Our university days were spent in study and fun associated with university life. The ‘rag’ was PT in the morning at the quadrangle in our hall of residence and singing songs to entertain the seniors at night. There was no sordid ragging of freshers at that time. During our University days, a sad event took place when a student from our hall was drowned in the Mahaweli. His funeral was in Batticaola and some of us went to see the last rights performed.
The exams were nearby and we were preparing for them. In each room, they were discussions as to the examination questions that could be expected. We came upon the bright idea that the best way to get the questions would be by ‘tumbler-talking.’ The dead student’s room had been unoccupied for quite some time. Raja and a few of us entered this room at night and commenced ‘tumbler-talking.’ To our surprise, the tumbler moved and gave us some questions, but those questions, to our dismay, were not in the examination paper! We then abandoned ‘tumbler-talking.’ Post University, both, Raja and I belonged to the Jayathilake Hall group that met regularly every year in Colombo. At the last get-together, Raja gave a talk from the head table on 'The Life of Sir D.B. Jayatillake,' in whose honour the hall of residence was named.
Raja joined the Public Service and his first appointment was at the Port Cargo Corporation. Later, he moved to various other positions in the Public service and occupied a prestigious position in the General Treasury prior to retirement. Raja belonged to that band of dedicated public servants who executed policy decisions with integrity.
The Young Men’s Buddhist Association (YMBA) attracted Raja’s attention. He became an active member and finally became a Vice President. The various organisations of the YMBA such as the Gamini Matha Home for Elders’ for instance, had his support and assistance. He was the moderator at many of the Buddhist Panel Discussions held at the YMBA. He was a frequent panelist on Buddhist discussions in English involving the Dhamma, both, on television and the radio. His knowledge of the Buddha Dhamma was very deep and he lucidly communicated the Dhamma to people of all faiths. A regular visitor to ‘Metharamaya,’ he contributed much to the Buddhist programmes at ‘The Maithri Hall’ to disseminate the Dhamma.
The Royal College Union was another organization that he served with devotion. He was it’s Secretary for many years. Finally, he was Vice President of the Union and at his funeral, the Union paid him a just tribute. Though born to a politically active family, Raja did not indulge in the hurly burly of electoral politics. He had a good knowledge of political affairs which he displayed when a few of us met at the regular luncheon meetings organized by Raja every two months at his favourite Chinese Café, the ‘Moon River.’ Perhaps a shrewd politician for his political survival must be able to ‘truthfully invent falsehoods.’ Raja would never do that.
Raja’s life was well spent. It was a good mix of religion, dedication to his Alma mater, servant of the public in many important capacities and last but not least his love and affection to his family. On one occasion, Lord Buddha mentioned that three types of persons are born into this world. The first, is very selfish and thinks only of one’s self; the second, does everything for others and neglects himself; the third does good to others and good to himself. Raja belonged to the third category, which the Buddha said was the best of the three. As the curtain fell on his octogenarian life, our condolences go to his brother Upali, his wife Sakunthala and the rest of his family. There is no doubt that he shortened his journey in Samsara during his life spent in this world. May he attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana.
