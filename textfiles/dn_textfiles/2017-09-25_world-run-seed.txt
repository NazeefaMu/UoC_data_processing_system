a world run to seed

All this was years ago, but how could I forget
the first thing I did when you finally left me
was grow distinctly unlike myself—so distinctly unlike
 
That when help was offered I took it. Those kind hosts
my Canadian cousins—if cousins they were, and at what
distant remove from me I no longer remember—
invited me out for a slice of their black sheep life
 
Which had come to the good: ten luxy days in Vancouver
and ten so absurd I Was Wondering: am I myself
or what? This one’s the big surprise, they told me,
This one’II really leave every trouble behind—
 
And I found I was thousands of feet up the Rockies
expected to horse-trek. Horses! I’d sooner be called
a coward. So every morning, while they would be
tinkling and giggling and shouting goodbye in the distance
 
I would be left as I wanted, free to wander alone.
The mountains were everything everyone said,
but the village . . . Looked down on, it seemed that a flock
of herring gulls had landed and suddenly atrophied:
 
Rough slate roofs like wings stuck out, white clapboard walls
mottled with green, and all deserted but ours
ours had stayed as a holiday home for anyone
thinking they ought to refresh themselves with the sight
 
Of a world run to seed, and a scruffy mine
which was famous, exhausted, and left to decay. The mine
itself was a ship with its side stoved in —a huge hull
criss-crossed with ladders and platforms running
 
Wherever I chose to look, but mostly drawing me down
to a plug of dirty cement where the shaft began.
I never went close, but my morning walk to the pines,
which began where the village stopped, would show me
 
As much as I wanted to see. for days I imagined this
was the view that I would remember: this I decided
would float through my head when I thought of the time
I was telling myself to forget you. It seemed enough.
 
But just as my visit was ending, and I was up there
under the pines of a morning as ever, brooding,
someone appeared at my side who made me believe
I was wrong. He emerged from the trees with no more
 
Than the prickly crack of needles and Well . . .
Good day . . .
— a figure who when I was squinting up to him
into the sun, and glimpsing tangled hair, a tartan shirt,
 
I thought might be insane, or a beached hippy—
someone who might be expected to sell me a ring
from a tray of bent-nail jewelry. All he wanted,
in fact, was to reveal what he called Our treasure.
