Ranawaka calls for national dialogue on priority development projects

A national dialogue is necessary with regard to which development projects should be given priority, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
He said during the previous regime, priority had been given to many projects that were not beneficial to the country. It would be better if the roads and public transport service were developed rather than spending a large amount of money on expressways.
He made these observations at the groundbreaking ceremony held to construct a building for the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation in Keravalapitiya.
Minister Ranawaka said even now the government attempts to continue some of those projects but the time is ripe to identify the most important projects that should be implemented.
He further said that even now there is a concern on the Uma Oya project, Gin Ganga and Nilwala river projects to provide water to Hambantota.
“However, there is an issue of providing water to Colombo and Gampaha districts from 2020 as a new water project or reservoir had not been constructed to provide water to these two districts," said Minister Ranawaka.
“On the other hand, the expressway being constructed from Kurunegala to Galagedara saves only 25 minutes. However, it requires around Rs. 200 billion to construct these 39 km expressways including Rs. 144 billion for the constructing company, land acquisition etc. If the same road is developed into a four lane road, the expenditure is only Rs. 10 billion.” Minister Ranawaka said the control of overflow of Kelani River, Kalu River and Attanagalu Oya and road development should be given priority.
He added that garbage management should also be given importance. The minister said the Treasury should allocate money for garbage management. “If it is not addressed, it would become a menace again,” Minister Ranawaka said.
“We have more work including low land development, urban housing development, control of flood waters, land development, water management etc. So we can’t attend to the garbage issue if the money is not allocated for the same.” Land Reclamation and Development Corporation Chairman Asela Iddawela, its acting Director Roshan Gunawardena and General Manager Srimathi Senadheera were also present.
