Fed announces US rate increase

The US central bank has said it will raise its benchmark interest rate citing a strengthened economic outlook.
The Federal Reserve said it had decided to raise the rate by 0.25% to a target range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
Policymakers also signalled they would increase rates twice more this year, while raising the forecast for rate hikes in 2019.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome “Jay” Powell also sounded a warning about rising trade tensions.
The Trump administration recently announced steel and aluminium tariffs and is weighing sanctions against China, actions that have led to threats of retaliation.
Powell said some Fed members are worried about the possibility of a trade war, referencing conversations between central bankers and business leaders.
“They’re seeing it as a risk to the outlook,” Powell said at a press conference at the close of the Fed’s two-day meeting in Washington.
Members of the Federal Open Markets Committee, which votes on rates, predicted the US economy will grow by 2.7% this year, faster than the 2.5% predicted in December.
Officials are also expecting slightly higher interest rates in 2019 and 2020 than they did in December, according to projections released after the meeting, which reflect the median of estimates by committee members.
