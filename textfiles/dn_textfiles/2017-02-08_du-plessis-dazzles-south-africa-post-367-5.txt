Du Plessis dazzles as South Africa post 367-5

CAPE TOWN Faf du Plessis hit his second century of the series as Sri Lanka’s struggling cricketers found themselves on the end of another battering in the fourth one-day international against South Africa at Newlands on Tuesday.
Du Plessis hit a career-best 185, only three short of the South African record, as South Africa piled up 367 for five.
Du Plessis made his runs off 141 balls and hit 16 fours and three sixes. He was caught at long-on off the first ball of the last over trying to clear the boundary with a hit which would have taken him past Gary Kirsten’s long-standing South African best of 188 not out, made against the United Arab Emirates in Rawalpindi during the 1996 World Cup.
Du Plessis shared century partnerships with Quinton de Kock (55) and captain AB de Villiers (64).
Sri Lankan hopes flickered briefly when Hashim Amla was caught at first slip off Lahiru Kumara for one and South Africa were able to score only four runs in the first three overs.
