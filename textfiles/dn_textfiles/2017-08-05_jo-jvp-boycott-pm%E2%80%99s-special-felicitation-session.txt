JO, JVP boycott PM’s special felicitation session

The Joint Opposition(JO) group and the JVP yesterday boycotted the special session in Parliament held to felicitate Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as he comples 40 years in Parliament.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya presided over the two hour special sitting from 10.30 am to 12.30 pm. The motion to felicitate the Premier was presented by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella and was seconded by Opposition Leader R Sampanthan.
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader and Minister Rauf Hakeem expressed his dismay over the lack of decency of the JO and JVP members to boycott the felicitation debate.
“The decency we as the MPs should observe on solemn occasions like this has sunk to the lowest level with some of the Opposition MPs boycotting this felicitation debate. This is a very sorry state of affairs.
 In my 23 years of Parliament life this is the first time I see the essential Parliamentary decency has sunk to the lowest level. Some of the Opposition MPs have compromised their principles for the sake of cheap political expediency,” Hakeem noted.
Speaking at the debate, UPFA Parliamentary Group Leader and Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva pointed out the importance of shedding vituperous politics and joining in congratulating the senior politicians as they reach important political milestones. “Today it is Wickremesinghe and tomorrow it could be TNA Leader Sampanthan, JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake or MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena. It is unacceptable for you to refuse to participate in an occasion like this just because of the rival political views you hold,” de Silva said.
A large number of visitors were seen in the public gallery to watch the proceedings. Prior to the commencement of the sittings, the Secretary-General of Parliament and his staff had organised a “Bodhi Pooja” to invoke blessings on the Prime Minister.
