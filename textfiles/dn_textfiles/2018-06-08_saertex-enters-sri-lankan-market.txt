SAERTEX enters Sri Lankan market

SAERTEX Group, the global market leader in the manufacture of multiaxial fabrics and core materials for the production of advanced composites has recently entered the Sri Lankan market through local distributor Lanka Composites (Pvt) Ltd.
With 14 manufacturing plants worldwide and a presence in over 50 countries, the group has entered into a strategic partnership with Lanka Composites through its wholly-owned subsidiary SAERTEX INDIA. SAERTEX multiaxial fabrics, in glass, carbon & aramid, also known as non-crimp fabrics (NCFs), are relied on by customers in the around the world – in Asia alone the advanced composite market is growing at a CAGR of 20% every year, with the growth mainly in the wind, aerospace, automotive, sports and boat-building industries
Founded 10 years ago in Pune, SAERTEX INDIA is the group’s wholly-owned regional subsidiary and currently the market leader in India while also exporting to Europe, USA and even China.
“By entering the Sri Lankan market through Lanka Composites and offering value-added products we are adding tremendous value to the local boat and ship building industry, as local builders are still largely using traditional woven material which is old technology and more expensive in terms of the final product” said Dr. PKC Bose, Vice Chairman & Managing Director of SAERTEX INDIA, who was in Sri Lanka recently to meet leading boat builders.
“With the government’s national export strategy including boat building as a priority sector we are confident that this is the right time to bring this product to the local market, especially as SAERTEX products are DNV-GL and Lloyd’s Registry certified, something that is important not only for the export market,” said the Managing Director of Lanka Composites, Kalim Iqbal.
Sri Lanka is a growing market for boat building and the timing is ideal for SAERTEX to offer its technologically advancedyet cost-effective range of products – uniquely in the industry, SAERTEX can offer more than 5,000 customizable styles of multiaxial and unidirectional fabrics for different applications. Some of the biggest local boat builders already use SAERTEX NCFs and with a local distributor maintaininginventory it will be easy for the entire industry to access this product range.
