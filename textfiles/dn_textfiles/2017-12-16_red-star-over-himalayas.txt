Red Star over Himalayas

A red star has arisen over the Himalayas, the top most mountain range of the world. Nepal, which gave the world the first armed revolution of the 21st century, has now consummated the transition from a feudal monarchy to a modern secular federative republic.
Communists of Nepal, having abandoned their sectarian division formed a coalition comprising the Unified Marxist – Leninist Communist Party of Nepal (CPN – UML) and the Communist Party of Nepal – Maoist. This coalition has won a landslide victory at the Parliamentary and Provincial Assembly elections held in two stages on November 26th and December 7th, 2017.
Interestingly the elections were held under a hybrid system under which 275 members were elected to the Lower House of Parliament called the House of Representatives in which 165 or 60 percent were on a first-past-the post system and the rest 40 percent or 110 under proportional representation. In the Upper House called the National Assembly 56 will be elected from Provincial Assemblies and Executive members of village and Municipal Councils. Another three members will be appointed by the President making a total of 59 members.
PR vote counting concluded on Friday and by the time this column was being written it was clear that only five parties--UML, NC, CPN Maoist, FSFN (Federal Socialist Forum Nepal) and RJPN (Rastriya Janata Party Nepal), --are likely to secure parliament seats under PR category. Electoral law has a provision to allocate parliamentary seats under PR category only to those which garner three percent of the total votes cast in the elections.
The fact that Nepal, a country of nearly 30 million people and 92 living languages and more than five major religions including Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Kirant, could arrive at a consensus on a new constitution after several years of deliberations in an elected Constituent Assembly is in itself a rare and laudable achievement. Though Hindus comprise nearly 82 percent of the population and Buddhists could claim the country as the birth place of the Buddha neither of them demanded a privileged position or arrogantly claimed superiority over others.
Nepal also provides an example of a hitherto unitary state under a Monarch transforming itself to a federative republic. It could also overcome pressure by imperial powers and world bodies dominated by them to derail the reconciliation between the erstwhile warring parties in the 10 year civil war that left over 17,000 killed.
The election victory of the Communists gives the country a fair degree of stability so that development could proceed untrammeled. However, a huge challenge faced by the new Government would be to balance its foreign policy as the country is sandwiched between two Asian giants - China and India.
The victory also proved wrong those who prophesied after the fall of the Soviet Union that Communism would be a word unknown in the 21st century or declared the ultimate triumph of capitalism and the end of history.
The election result could strengthen Sino-Nepalese cooperation and India will have to evolve a new strategy to guarantee that Nepal would remain ‘friendly’ without becoming a satellite state of China.
Trump’s Jerusalem decision boomerangs
United States president Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem has boomeranged as the world community has openly criticized it in no uncertain terms.
French President Emmanuel Macron said: “I do not agree with this decision and I disapprove of it because it contravenes international law, it contravenes the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council...”
The 57 member Islamic Cooperation Council (IOC) in a statement said, “we consider that this dangerous declaration, which aims to change the legal status of the city [Jerusalem], is null and void and lacks any legitimacy.”
Chinese Foreign Ministry in a statement said: “China fully supports and advances the Middle East peace process. We support the just cause of the Palestinian people to restore their legitimate national rights and stand behind Palestine in building an independent, full sovereignty state along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.” Turkish President Erdogan said that President Trump’s decision throws the region into a “ring of fire.”
Meanwhile Cuba in a most comprehensive statement has expressed solidarity with the Palestinian struggle. In view of its comprehensiveness we reproduce it in full below:
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba expresses its deepest concern and rejection for the unilateral declaration by the President of the United States of the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which constitutes a serious and flagrant violation of the Charter of the UN, of International Law and of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.
This intention of the United States Government to modify the historic status of Jerusalem violates the legitimate interests of the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic nations, will have serious consequences for stability and security in the Middle East, will further increase tensions in this region and will impede any effort aimed at resuming peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.
Cuba calls on the Security Council to fulfill the responsibility given to it by the UN Charter in the maintenance of international peace and security, to adopt the necessary decisions and to demand from Israel an immediate end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories and of aggressive policies and colonizing practices, as well as compliance with the resolutions adopted by that body on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian issue.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs ratifies that Cuba will continue to support a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on a two-State solution that allows the Palestinians the right to self-determination and to have an independent and sovereign State, with its capital in East Jerusalem and the pre-1967 borders.”
