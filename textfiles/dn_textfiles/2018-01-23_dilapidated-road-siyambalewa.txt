Dilapidated road  to Siyambalewa

In the village of Siyambalewa, in the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat, lives a man named A. H. Kapuwa. The road to his village is an arduous one and filled with potholes making travel extremely difficult.The slightest of rains turns these potholes to ponds and this has been the road he has taken home for many years now.
Very few politicians or government officials however paid heed to the problems of these villagers and their road, thus Kapuwa fed up with official apathy, decided to take things into his own hands.

A. H. Kapuwa who is fixing the Siyambalewa road full of potholes on his own.
“I am 60 years old now. And instead of just sitting around at home, I thought I would do something good and earn some merit in my golden years”, he said.
It has been two years since he started work and for two years he has been fixing the big as well as small potholes on the road.
“I don’t have vehicles or backhoe machines to do this, so I fill up my wheel barrow with soil and use my shovel to cover up the holes. Thus far I have filled 2km of this Siyambalewa road. I have a few more kilometres to go. I plan to complete it during my leisure hours", he said further.
School children, monks, those who set off for government jobs and pregnant women use this road. But this road is no longer in a state useful to anyone. The massive potholes on the road are used as ponds and children play with paper boats in them. At the same time, when it is the dry season, the whole area is filled with dust.
So I thought that when I had some time, I would fill these holes up. My wife too helps me out when she has time. They are cutting a canal in front of our house, I use the soil from that. I don’t mind the heat too much and my time is now mostly spent covering this holes, said Kapuwa.

“My husband engages in repairing the roads and filling the potholes whenever he has time. The villagers often say that there is no need to do all this as the road will be carpeted. But for more than four years we have been told that that the road will be carpeted and that it would be done very soon but we have not seen any initiatives being taken towards that”, she said.
The government buses that run on this road have also resorted to taking alternative routes as the road is severely dilapidated.
Only after my husband repaired the roads that the buses are taking the normal route and travel passing our house, she added.
The vehicles cannot travel smoothly because of deep potholes and hitting a pothole with the vehicle can cause a great deal of damage to the vehicle,
“So, I too help my husband to move the soil to the road. We do whatever possible to earn some merit. If we take a pregnant woman on this road, I am sure she would deliver the baby on the way. We have almost finished the repairs on the road. As we have filled the potholes using soil, the vehicles are able to travel smoothly”, she said.
Kapuwa’s determination to finish the road is fuelled by his desire to complete the job and his strength which motivates him to do it. During election times, as officials visit every home promising a better future and local government, he has shown that one man alone can change things, with a wheelbarrow in one hand and a shovel in the other.
