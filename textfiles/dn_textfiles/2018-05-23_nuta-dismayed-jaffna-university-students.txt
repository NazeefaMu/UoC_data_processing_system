NUTA dismayed at Jaffna University students

The National University Teachers Association (NUTA) has written to Jaffna University Vice-Chancellor Prof. Ratnam Vigneswaran expressing their dismay and displeasure over involvement of students from the university at the “Mullivaikkal” Rememberance Day observances.
In a letter to Prof. Vigneswaran, Vice-Chancellor of the University, they observed that “greedy politicians were pushing the misguided youth to another reckless programme. We feel that they are abandoning the golden opportunities presented to them. We do hope that you would take our letter seriously and discuss this matter with senior responsible academics in the University. Offer guidance to Jaffna University students and teach them reconciliation and harmony.”
The association cites in their letter that the Jaffna University students “were acting like unofficial private army of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran and transgressing the law of the country by commemorating members of a banned terrorist organization.”
They add that people in the South hold intelligent youth of the northern province in high esteem however their recent behavior showed that they are being misguided by crafty racist politicians such as CV Vigneswaran. The letter which is signed by Secretary to the Association Prof Channa Jayasumana adds that these ‘misguided youth should be “thankful to the political leadership and Sri Lankan forces that ended the armed conflict and made it possible for them to reap the benefits of higher education freeing them from battlefront.”
