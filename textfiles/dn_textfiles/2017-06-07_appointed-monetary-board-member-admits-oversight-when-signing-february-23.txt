Appointed Monetary Board member admits to oversight when signing February 23, 2015 Board Paper

The appointed member of the Monetary Board,M.Ramanathan said that it was an oversight on her part to have signed the Board Paper of the Monetary Board meeting held on February 23, 2015.
Ramanathan said so, while she was testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday.
Questions have been raised as to whether there was a solid decision made at this particular meeting regarding the issuance of 30 years bond.
"There was no concrete decision to issue 30 year bonds at the particular meeting,"Ramanathan said. Following her statement, Commissioner Supreme Court Justice P.S. Jayawardena asked the witness, if that was the case, as to why she signed the minutes of the Monetary Board meeting held on February 23,2015.
The Commission questioned her, if that was the case, why she signed the Board Paper without even making a note of concern regarding the matter. Ramanathan said it was an oversight from her part to have signed the Board Paper in question,and that she thought the officers of the Central Bank are responsible not to alter the minutes of the said Monetary Board meeting.
A disagreement occurred between Senior Solicitor General Dappula de Livera and Legal Counsel Harsha Fernando, when the latter drew the attention of Ramanathan towards a handwritten note taken down by the Monetary Board secretary H.A. Karunatilake at the meeting at matter.
De Livera said Fernando is ‘confusing’ the witness by presenting only a portion of document, to which Fernando said, the other portion was already dealt with by the state council. Fernando alleged the Attorney General is selectively leading evidence. “Mrs.Ramanathan was a attorney-at-law when I was just one year old.
So I am sure I am not confusing her with my questions.” Fernando said, to the much amusement of those who were present at the proceeding.
However,the witness was requested to leave the Commission building until the two lawyers discuss and come to an agreement regarding the presented document.
When the witness was requested to return, Fernando took Ramanathan through the personal notes taken down by the secretary to the Monetary Board at that time, in comparison to the draft minutes the board secretary had prepared and the changes made to the same by Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri.
Fernando suggested that alterations have been made to draft minutes of the Monetary Board, prepared by board secretary Karunaratne, in many occasions by DG Samarasiri because they lacked proper wording.
Fernando read out a portion of a personal statement made by Ramanathan on the clear, meticulous and decisive minute keeping of DG Samarasiri, with which Ramanathan agreed to have said.
