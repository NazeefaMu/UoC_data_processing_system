Devapriya urges government to hold PC election on electoral level

Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya on Wednesday, urged the government to hold the Provincial Council election on an electoral level, if the government is ready to hold the Local Government election in the same manner. Even the next General election can be held in the same manner and this will save state money and resources.
"We did not agree with some of the features of the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution as it violates the 13th Amendment. According to the Amendment, Parliament will take over the existing powers of the Chief Minister and the President.
Therefore, we with the support of all political party members in the WPC formulated a set of proposals to be included in the 20th Amendment. Accordingly, we are not opposing the holding of elections in all Provincial Councils on the same day.
But, parliament should not be allowed to decide on the date of the Provincial Council election except the proposed forthcoming election.
The proposals of the Western Provincial Council (WPC) in connection with the 20th Amendment have been forwarded both to the President and the Prime Minster. The government has already accepted them.
Therefore, we will forward our proposals to Parliament when the 20th Amendment is presented to Parliament,” he added. The Chief Minister also said that attention has been paid to commence free health clinics in schools to diagnose cancers among school children. It has been revealed that childhood cancer is on the rise.
"Therefore, we request the parents to be vigilant about their children and seek early diagnosis and treatment,” he added.
