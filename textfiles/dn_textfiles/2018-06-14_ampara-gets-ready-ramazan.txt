Ampara gets ready for Ramazan

Muslims in the Ampara district are getting ready to celebrate Ramazan festival on a grand scale this year. The people in the district are shopping and are busy purchasing their requirements.
Shops in Ampara, Addalaichenai, Akkaraipattu, Kalmunai, Sainthamaruthu, Maruthamunai, Pottuvil and Sammanthurai are open till late night for the convenience of the people as they have to fulfill their religious obligations during the early part of the night in mosques.
The towns have turned into a hive of activity. Large numbers of pavement hawkers from other districts have come into this district and are selling goods at cheap rates. Both sides of the main roads in area are illuminated with bulbs by payment hawkers to attract the crowd.
