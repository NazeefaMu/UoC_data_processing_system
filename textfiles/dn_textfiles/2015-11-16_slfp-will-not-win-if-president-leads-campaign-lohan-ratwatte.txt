SLFP will not win if President leads campaign - Lohan Ratwatte

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party will not be able to win the upcoming local government election if the campaign is headed by President Maithirpala Sirisena, Sri Lanka Freedom Party Pathadumbara Organizer and Parliamentarian Lohan Ratwatte said. SLFP grassroot level members oppose the chairmanship of President Sirisena as they believe that he is responsible for the SLFP's debacle. Ratwatte also invited SLFPers holding positions in the Yahapalana government to come and work for the victory of the SLFP. He said each parliamentarian should represent the government or opposition. But presently more than 50 parliamentarians do represent none of these and hope to take a decision with regard to this in the future.
