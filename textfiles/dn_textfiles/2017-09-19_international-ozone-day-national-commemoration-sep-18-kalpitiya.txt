International Ozone Day National Commemoration on Sep 18 at Kalpitiya

The World International Ozone Day will be celebrated in the Kudawa Grama Niladhari Divison, Kandakuliya, Kalpitiya from 9.30 am on September 18 under the patronage of Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne.
The National Ozone Unit will launch a programme marking the day to cultivate 2,000 mangrove plants with the participation of schoolchildren.
Researchers have proved that mangroves absorb the UV-B in the UV rays that is harmful to living beings. Mangroves store more carbon, 10 to 50 times, more than tropical forests do. They release carbonic materials to the sea thereby providing food for worms and small fish varieties. Furthermore, the mangroves act as a natural filter between the land and sea and block the silt, metal slag and various other chemical waste reaching the sea.
