Affixed with a stamp

There are four main divisions in Kandyan dance. They are Ves, Nayandi, Udekki and Pantheru. Ves dance occupies a very important and prominent place. With the passage of time, Vannam was included in it. There are altogether 18 Vannams. Hence the total categories of Kandyan dance are five.
Kandyan dance is very popular among the Sinhalese population of Sri Lanka. The traditional Kandyan dance is a pure Nirtha dance firmly based on Thala, Laya and Thandava Karna stances, and rhythm. The dance is still practised in Buddhist temple festivals, street processions or peraheras, public entertainment events to welcome political leaders, visitors and foreign dignitaries.
Rigorous and social
Most of the Indian and Sri Lankan classical dance forms are based on Natya Sastra, but these dances developed and were influenced by religious, cultural and social traditions of each region. Kandyan dance appears to have grown and developed out of Natya Sastra, as there are discernible similarities between the classical dance forms of India and those of Sri Lanka.
Kandyan dance form was protected and fostered by the Kandyan gentry who managed and maintained the dance troupes.
Anything printed on the national stamp is regarded as a great honour and state recognition. In the past, stamps played a more important role than today. In modern times, electronic mail or email, WhatsApp, Viber or Facebook are quite popular. Still, the postal mail system is very much needed for certain important purposes. Stamps are not only used for posting letters but also for numerous other purposes including legal documents.
The Ves dance started as a ritual dance form traced back to KohombaKankariya which was also a ritual dance form among the Sinhalese. Earlier, 64 ornaments were worn for the Ves dance, but now less than 34 ornaments are worn.
Unique make-up
Today Ves dance is considered to be based on religious and social values. The Ves dancer's costumes and make-up are unique in nature. Ves dance depicts Thandava stands, jumps, twists, and beautiful masculine and vigorous stands and vast gaps between the legs.
Both the dance forms adopt circular movements and the knees are spread out from one another. They adopt the martial arts techniques. Ves is totally based on pure Nirtha. Ves dance is performed at religious processions, ceremonial and other social occasions.
Males are the dominant artists of these art forms. The drum Geta Beraya is used in Kandyan dance. The word 'Adavu' is used in Kandyan dance which is a pure Nirtha aspect of dance. In the Kandyan dance, the sitting position and stretching the hands at shoulder level are very common. The Ves dance is also based on Natya Sastra.
Earlier it was said that KandyanVes dance had nearly 12 Hastas.
Kathakali dance
In the Ves, dance ears are covered with an ornament called Todu Patti. The ear-ornaments are almost like those used for Kathakali dance.
In Kandyan dance, the Ves dancers wear a chest ornament. It is called Avul Hera. In KandyanVes dance the ornament is tied to the bare body. Shoulder Kavasams are also worn in Ves.
Among all the Sri Lankan traditional classical dances Ves dance occupies a prominent position. First, the Ves dancer’s image was printed and published on a Sri Lankan stamp in 1950. The value of the stamp was four cents.
Later another image of a Ves dancer appeared on numerous other Sri Lankan stamps. It is worth mentioning here that the image of the Ves dancer was the same in different stamps, but the colour of the stamps differ from one another. The same Ves dancer’s image was printed on the stamps in ten different colours. The value of the stamps also differs from one another.
The value of dark brown Ves dancer stamp is Rs. 1, peacock blue Ves dancer stamp is Rs. 2.
