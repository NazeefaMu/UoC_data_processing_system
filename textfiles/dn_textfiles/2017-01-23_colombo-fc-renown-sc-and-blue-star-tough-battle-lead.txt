Colombo FC, Renown SC and Blue Star in tough battle for lead

The ongoing Dialog Champions League soccer tournament is becoming more intensifying each day with a tough contest forming between Colombo Football Club and Renown SC for the lead in the Super Eight round.
Renown SC recorded a convincing 4-0 win over Solid SC and climbed up in the points table with 9 points while Colombo FC claimed top spot with 10 points after they beat Army SC.
Kalutara Blue Star SC also entered the battle for supremacy obtaining eight points after they beat New Youngs SC 1-0 yesterday at the Kelaniya Football Stadium. A. Jibola booted the winning goal for Blue Star SC in the 25th minute.
Army’s Ashukur Rahuman who received two yellow cards in last week’s match was found at fault again in the match against Renown SC and consequently the Match Committee of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) imposed a three-match ban for the soldier while awarding three points to Renown after cancelling the Army’s 3-0 victory. The Match Committee came to the decision following a protest lodged by Renown SC.
Renown took an early 2-0 lead over Solid SC in the first half with goals from M.I.M. Mujib and Mohamed Fazal. Even in the second half Solid SC did not pose a challenge and Mohamed Rifnas and Job Michel added two more goals in the 61st and 74th minutes respectively.
A rare incident occurred in the match between Colombo FC and Army SC where goal keepers of both teams were issued with red cards by the referee G. N. Robes for their bad conduct. Both teams had to play the match with substitute goal keepers. Mohamed Yapo tactfully converted a free kick into a goal in the 26th minute claiming 1-0 first half lead for Renown SC. Bandara Warakagoda booted the equaliser for Army in the 62nd minute, but soon after Mohamed Sarwan netted the winning goal for Renown SC in the 83rd minute. The soldiers were unlucky as Mohamed Issadin’s two easy scoring attempt were declared offside.
