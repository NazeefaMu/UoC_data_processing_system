Flood affected residents receive free services, repairs from Abans Service

Due to the adverse impact that the recent floods and mudslides have imposed on several communities, Abans Service has undertaken an active integral role in providing assistance to flood-affected areas.
The Company is currently conducting a full-scale initiative that offers humanitarian relief to residents located in worst-afflicted regions including Kaduwela, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Galle, and Matara.
Abans Service jas dispatched more than eight mobile service vans to these regions to conduct free services for affected homeowners.
Abans Environmental Services steadily worked to remove debris and waste materials scattered by flood-water, and clean up several public spaces such as hospitals, police stations, and schools.
Abans Environmental Services has also offered personal clean-up services free-of-charge to homeowners who have been affected by the floods to help render their homes both livable and usable.
The Abans Service has always striven to provide significant contributions towards the well-being of the Sri Lankan community at large.
By conducting these free services, Abans Service aims to mitigate the damage inflicted by the immense flooding as well as spearhead the process of recovery and rehabilitation for flood-affected residents.
