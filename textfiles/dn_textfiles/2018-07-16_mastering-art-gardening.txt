Mastering the art of gardening

Humans have always had a symbiotic relationship with the natural world of plants. Plants have always been our simplest way of living and sustenance. Daily News spoke toDistrict Agriculture Instructor, Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office, K. N. K. Jayathilake on Home Gardening and its value. “Throughout history as agriculture evolved, man has learnt the value of cultivating in his land various plants for consumption, beautification (aesthetic needs), medicine and economic benefit.
These include vegetables, fruits, timber/wood, spices and medicinal plants,” said Jayathilake.
Humans have being the one species that has reached out to the natural environment and changed it to suit his desires- the domestication of plants and animals.
“As man progressed through the ages he understood the need and importance of self- sufficiency and began to modify his environment to suit his needs. As societies evolved, home gardening started to make sense because it was a way where ones livelihood could be supported. It was a way where so many needs could be addressed in one plot of land and it was a way where one could make sure that one’s lifestyle was healthy and there was no shortage of nutrition. It was a way of ensuring productivity. It was a sustainable way of living,” explained Jayathilake.
Also decades back society was different and there was no space problem and one could grow the crops without any hindrance and there was no obstacle when it came to health and nutrition.
“The crops would not be exposed to insecticides and one’s health would be looked after. One could make sure that his/her family would be able to have a balanced diet. One could also ensure that the plot of land one had, could be utilized to the maximum,” said Jayathilake.
Also household waste could be used as compost to make the soil rich, in other words soil management. The crops can be plucked fresh from the garden and there is no need to store them in a refrigerator. It is easily accessible throughout the year.
“The next generation needs to learn this way of living because it will benefit them. This knowledge must be passed down. They need to be educated about the benefits of home gardening. Every generation needs to be enlightened on why Home Gardening is so important. Home Gardening also makes the environment around you more comfortable because of the coolness and is pleasing to the eye. We know that trees consume carbon dioxide and supply the environment with oxygen. Home Gardening makes your garden livable and it becomes a paradise,” pointed out Jayathilake.
Home Gardening is also easy on the wallet. With the cost of living going up, the value of having a good home garden is great.
“When you have an excess in vegetables in your garden, then one can have the option of selling them in the market. There is no need to depend on the market because you have everything you need to eat at home. This benefits your savings and budget since you don’t need to buy vegetables and fruits from the shop. It is clean and you need not worry about your health,” stated Jayathilake.
Peace of Mind is something we all aspire to. Life is not just about trials. It is about the quality of living, since you get to live life only once.
“It does wonders for you terms of security and peace of mind. The satisfaction you get by operating your own home garden is indescribable. It makes you happy because you are able to get rid of mental stress. It soothes your mind.
With the evolution of societies tension became a factor that contributed towards negativity in life. But because of the simplicity of a home garden this factor is not there. But now with the emerging of urbanization and the ever increasing complexity of life and because of the rat race, life has become so hectic and people are becoming stressed out.
They are also physically inactive. We have also got used to buying vegetables in the market some which have been exposed to insecticides. This is why we need Home Gardens,” explained Jayathilake.
It is true that because of this rat race we have very little time to devote to home gardens but we need to make the effort and make the time for our home gardens. Home Gardens must be popularized for everyone’s sake in this country.
“Also you have the pleasure of working in your garden which is good for your physical health and is a very beneficial way of spending your time. Our daily intake of fruits must be around 200g. And our daily vegetable intake 175 – 200g, must be given important consideration for a healthy lifestyle. It is essential that the vegetables and greens are not exposed to chemicals,” said Jayathilake.
Your home garden must be organized according to your unique desire. Just like people are different a home garden will also differ according to the personality of its owner.
“That is why the Home Garden should be made a part of our household, and various spices need to be grown in limited amounts in the garden.
Also when deciding which crops to plant we need to select those that are suitable to the environment we live in. It must be suitable to the climate. We also need to think about family patterns e.g. number of family members, age range in a house, nutrients that they need to consume, likes and dislikes when it comes to taste,” said Jayathilake.
It is also important to give priority to diversity. We need to look at where to grow these crops in the garden because some crops are sun loving crops and the crops have their own sunlight requirements.
Some crops are shade loving crops. Crops are not only for food but to beautify the environment. Also bee- keeping is another recommended activity in a home garden in order to make the home garden a success and in order to provide a good lifestyle.
