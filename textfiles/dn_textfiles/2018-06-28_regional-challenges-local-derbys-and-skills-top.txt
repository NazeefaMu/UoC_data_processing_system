Regional challenges, local derbys,  and skills on top!

 
June has proved to be more than competitive and a fair share of drama in the middle ...especially at home with the Milo Knockouts and hemisphere wide with some grinding performances by the world’s elite rugby nations.
Not much doubt about the depth and bench power of this new look All Blacks squad that is way past incredible.
Their 2nd half impact and clinical intensity, too much firepower for the expensive French revolution.
The Blacks intimidate from the Haka threat to the 80th minute. Ipso facto a blackwash v the French and bragging rights for many years to hail from the Eiffel Tower. The All Blacks really stride quite alone at that elusive altitude of pure adrenaline power.
Ireland stunned Australia and England won their last test v the resurgent Springboks ....Eddie Jones ambition for the IRB World Cup, very much a work in progress...
I believe Japan are still seeking consistency with their team on the summer circuit and huge interest in Asia about whom the world will welcome next from our corner of planet rugby.
It’s still a risky toss up to rate Hong Kong or South Korea making that grade and scaling up the international ladder.
Closer to home it’s an All Saints Milo Knockout final under floodlights at the delightful Racecourse in Colombo 7.
Joes, the defending champions have grown in stature and confidence, and are very much the force to beat in this remarkable competition.
St Peter’s on the other side have been a few metres short all season.
The final we be relentless in every sense of the word...and given their league encounter, will go right down to the wire.
Both coaches ...Martis and Ibrahim, more than capable, but probably quite annoyed about the wafer thin line that separates the teams.
On the day ...in the middle, who will be more efficient and motivated?
Will it be blue blood defence to the front or Bamba running skills that fly the flag?
Leadership and decision making will be under the microscope...in fact will Peters repeat the league error in fighting shy to kick at goal...or will there be added kicking power via the FIFA World Cup and silky skills to inspire magic ...without the drama diving to win penalties?
Looking forward to the confrontation and improved crowd control and behavior from the thousands of local faithful.
The Racecourse needs to be secured so all genuine rugby hearts can kick back and really enjoy the enthralling Milo Knockout 2018 final.
Experts will be seen and not quoted ...? As it really boils down to whose got more fire in the belly....these Maradana defenders or the Bamba attackers?
What splendiferous options of possibilities...what nerve wrenching opportunities....
It’s a magnificent start 6.15pm.under lights on June’s penultimate cycle.
Much rhetoric and contemplation will be wasted on referees and anticipated whistle power...it must be said, and as a quiet aside .....we must arguably be the only playing nation on planet rugby that talks about referees and assistant skills, more than the team, players, strategic opportunities, psychology, injuries, prodigies and ground conditions....
Let’s hope that changes ...where cheers and compliments replace ...jeers and insecurities.
Pressure on the TMO to get it right for a cracking finish.
Sri Lanka Rugby have a heap on their plate and desperately need to get our islanders performance platform absolutely right on the button.
There are huge priorities to be acknowledged and delivered as we strife boldly to tournaments around the globe.
On the very note let’s hope our 7s trip to Paris, sharpens our game power and running skills before our Asian series expedition.
Time we confronted the Hong Kong ghost and exorcise that elusive force in the middle.
I for one join CEO Priyantha Ekanayake on that special victory platform...with the right intensity of prep and top opposition , our islanders understanding and performance under pressure....grow from being intimidated, to confidence, skill and finishing power....
It’s everything to plan and implement, rather than hesitate and speculate.
The future is 7s and lots more skilled islanders winning for Sri Lanka.
Bula bula the islanders away from home and magical skills to elevate our world 7s ranking.
Vive la Sri Api!
