Batticaloa unemployed graduates protest unemployment

 
Graduates in Batticaloa protested unemployment yesterday (12), by organising a procession that began at Gandhi Park and ended after circuitous route back at the Park.
The graduates will begin 21 days of sathyagraha demanding job opportunities from the government.
They said they would not end until they get a favourable response from the government.
