[APPRECIATIONS - (02-10-2017)]

A. H. M. Azwer
A devoted friend
It was in 1967 that my husband, the late S. L. M. Shafie Marikar, became the principal of Zahira College, Colombo. He had a few friends visiting him every week in the evenings to enjoy the buns and roast bread baked at the Zahira bakery. A. H. M. Azwer was one of them.
He visited us when my husband’s brother, Dr. Karahi, passed away. It was to send the obituary to a newspaper. My son was a little boy and he told me ‘wappa’ has good friends. Haji Azwer was very fond of my son and brought gifts for him whenever he went abroad.
He was a very busy person, as a result of which he was very forgetful.
The most interesting episode was when Lokubandara had to attend a function at a leading hotel in Colombo. They went to all the hotels, but could not find their crowd anywhere. So they bought some hoppers and went to Haji Azwer’s house. There they had dinner and left the remaining hoppers on the table. In the morning, his wife inquired about the hoppers and he said, “That is what Lokubandara bought for dinner.” My eldest sister-in-law was very fond of listening to his election speeches during the time of President Premadasa
Haji Azwer was close to my husband at the Muslim League and The All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference. Even after my husband passed away, Haji never failed to visit us during the month of Ramazan with a box of dates.
This year, we were not at home when he came. So he gave the dates to my neighbor who handed it over to us.
When my husband passed away in 2007, Haji Azwer wrote many articles about him. His friend is no more to write about him. This prompted me to write this article.
May he attain Jannathul Firdous.

John Blair
He was a servant of God
I was saddened with the news of the demise of John Blair, better known to us as ‘uncle John’. I was equally saddened by not being able to pay my last respects, which was prevented due to medical advice having undergone surgery at the same hospital that he spent his last days in. However, I am composing this at the scheduled time his remains were expected to be at the graveside.
Uncle John was truly a good servant of God, having helped many a Sri Lankan including my own parents, expounding the word of God clearly and wisely. He had been doing this service for 56 years in Sri Lanka, always wishing to end the journey of his life here, having left the luxuries of his parental home in New Zealand. I remember visiting this home in the mid 1970’s and meeting his mother and brothers.
I have many memories of uncle John, such as to mention a few, how in the early 1970’s when I visited him and his companion in their camp in Balangoda, they were after their lunch having had a few Durians which was his favourite fruit. He had installed a Windmill for the folk there, cannibalizing mainly from motor car units, for the purpose of cultivation through lift irrigation. Perhaps this was one of the first windmills to have been installed in Sri Lanka for such a purpose. Also, perhaps in order to cut on travel costs, he converted a sunbeam car to run on kerosene, which caused those around to smell his arrival and departure in addition to the noise! In the late 1980’s, he laid the foundation stone at my request for the Open University Guest House in Bandarawela and after completion of the building, on my invitation, he was among the first occupants as my guest to the bungalow. He was very kind and firm on his wise counsel and was liked by both the young and old. I will always remember his constant advice to me ‘Do your best and leave God the rest, the merciful Lord will be the final judge!’
May his soul rest in peace. Dayantha Wijeyesekera
Indrani Senanayake
A woman with sterling qualities
I first came to know Indrani as a schoolmate at Visakha Vidyalaya and thereafter, have been close friends for over sixty years. Having got the top rank at the final examination of the Government Training College, Maharagama, in 1963, she was appointed to Visakha Vidyalaya as a Physics teacher during its golden era under the stewardship of S. G. Pulimood.
I too joined the staff a little later as a Chemistry teacher and we both resided in the school hostel as the youngest resident teachers. Our enthusiasm to give the best to our students knew no bounds and the results were excellent.
At all times, we were available after school for any additional work in the school office or hostel, allocated by Pulimood. It was a pleasure. Our duties at the golden jubilee celebrations of the school held at the racecourse, brought great joy. It was almost dawn by the time we were dropped back at the hostel by Pulimood herself.
Indrani’s brilliant students at the time, to name a few, were Professor Anula Wijesundera, the late Professor Malkanthi Balasuriya and Dr. Savithri Wijemanne, who still remember her with much gratitude and affection.
After her spell at Visakha, being the only child, she was forced to get a transfer to her hometown Horana to be with her ageing mother, where her marriage to Leslie Senanayake also took place. She continued her services at Sri Palee College Horana with great dedication. Thereafter, it is strange that we both came to reside in the same neighbourhood after her early retirement where she devoted all her time for numerous meritorious activities which were greatly supported by her husband, Leslie.
They donated their residence at Maharagama to the Dhammadeepa Foundation which is well-utilized under the guidance of Most Ven. Thalalle Chandakiththi Thera.
Indrani was involved in various religious activities organized by the Narada Centre in Colombo 7, the Dharmayathanaya as well as Mahamegharamaya at Maharagama throughout. She also travelled widely with her husband, visiting friends and relatives and also on pilgrimages overseas.
Her sudden illness one and half years prior to her passing away on July 3 was a great shock to me and many others. Even though she was handicapped during the period, the attention and tender care rendered by her husband was admirable. He left no stone unturned where treatment was concerned and her cousin Damayanthi was a pillar of support at all times.
Rev. Chandakiththi, while having his own disability, never failed to see and bless her frequently during this period of illness which I am sure would have given her great solace.
Indrani, in any emergency or illness, day or night, you were always there by me and I now miss your company very much.
May all the merit you accrued during your lifetime help you attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana in the shortest possible time!

Timothy Wickremasinghe
An effervescent individual
Be still,
Close your eyes,
Breathe,
Listen to my footfall in your heart
I am not gone, but merely walk within you!
How many times have these words echoed in my mind during the last eleven years since that eventful day on September 16!
If life could be built on memories, then Timothy’s life could fill the vacuum of this vast universe and beyond and the tears that we have shed will surely fill the mighty oceans. As I reminisce the past, from the day he came to this world and the joy he filled the hearts of his parents with and everyone dear to him. With his boyish and puerile behaviour, he taught us so many lessons that we cherish today. But sadly, only memories remain!
From the timid and coy boy who walked the corridors of his alma mater, St. Josephs College, to the adolescent and the effervescent youth, Timothy, undertook every challenge thrown at him whether it be in the academic sphere or in the sports arena. However, amidst this backdrop, he was still the fun and home-loving individual that he was. Taking everything he undertook in his stride, he was able to mix the stress of his work with the pleasant joys of his extra-curricular activities like a seasoned bar tender-mixing a smooth margarita!
Nothing comes close to the pride that parents feel when they see their child growing up to be the epitome of how a loving son should be. This is when parents feel a sense of gratitude towards life and destiny for giving them a son whose upbringing has been worth all the sacrifices that they have made in their lives.
Timothy was our first-born and we still remember that little wrinkled face which has not filled out, but even then, he was the most beautiful thing we had ever seen. Certainly, both of us were so proud of him (as generally parents are and we were no exceptions!) The day he was born we vowed that we would do everything it took to give him the best in life possible. I think to a great degree we fulfilled those dreams to lavish him with our unstinting and unselfish love to meet his boyish dreams. Being the first grandson on both sides, he also had the love and care of his grandparents who showered on him equally, his desires. But amidst all these attention, he was never spoilt and always had his priorities straight, whether it be his studies, sports or his close circle of friends and relations.
But as God has it, his life was cruelly cut short amidst the very people he adored and loved–his wife and sister, Natasha. His elaborate plans for his future with so much hope was shattered within a matter of minutes which dawned on his family an era of uncertainty with his demise.
It’s indeed difficult to forget the death of a loved one, but though it is said that time is the best healer, on the contrary, time has really accentuated our loneliness at his absence.
His sweet smile, his laughing effervescence no longer bring joy to our lives, but instead has replaced it with an never-ending stream of tears, but joyful with the hope that we shall all be united one day with the creator.
As we stand by his graveside,
I can hear the echo of his voice:
Don’t stand at my grave and weep;
I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow;
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain;
I am the gentle autumn’s rain.
When you awaken in the morning’s hush,
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft star that shines at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry.
I am not there, I did not die.
Your ever-loving Dadda and Mamma

Tribute to a dear departed
No flags or fluttering drapes white
No tears flooding sympathies pouch
Let there be no fuss or bother
And noisy ostentation detestable
I know not whence I came
I know not whiter I am bound
What benefits the men derived
From the life I led I enjoyed the loving caress
The ecstasy of comforts kiss
I had my share of impediments
Despair and heartaches
I know not who I was
I know not my kith and kin
Little I knew of my wife and children
Far less my relatives and friends
I had been a stranger to most
They have been aliens to my soul
For a fleeting moment of time
We have smiled and talked for a while
Here I go I know not where
No vacuum shall remain anywhere
“Dust thou art
And unto the dust thou return ”
Let there be no rambling orations
Sermons moronic and dreary
Let the obsequies be brief and simple
And hasten the disposable
Upon my tombstone, if there be one,
Let epitaph be writ well and clear
“Here lies a person honest and
forthright”
All he had was a conscience clear.
Parakrama Jayasuriya
