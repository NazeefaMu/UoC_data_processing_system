Jumbo attacks in Sammanthurai intensifies

Elephants invade Sammanthurai and adjoining areas regularly affecting the boarder villages the most and people in the areas live in fear throughout the day not knowing how to protect from jumbo attacks.
Herds of elephants destroyed several houses on the last weekend and damaged fences around their gardens. They then invaded paddy mill and ransacked the paddy in the gunny bags. The villagers somehow escaped from the jumbo attack, a resident said.
UNP Sammanthurai Organiser M.A. Hassen Ali visited the Aalwakkarai villages and promised them that he would take actions to resolve the issue.
The villagers say elephants normally enter the villages. "But recently, they invade the villages more often and destroy crops and assets," they said.
