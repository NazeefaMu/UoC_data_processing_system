Home is where your mom is?

Things may not be all peaches and cream for these three working mothers, but when they let go and decide do whatever (and whoever) they please, they really take it to the limit.
Much of the film’s charm rests on Mila Kunis’ shoulders, with her character being the most developed. She freaks out one day, when she finds out that her husband has being having an affair with a woman over the internet, via video chat. Her two friends are complete opposites of each other, but after a night out on the tiles, the three of them agree - and also bond over the fact - that being a good mother is not exactly the easiest thing in the world. They know they’re far from perfect. Unlike the local alpha-woman Gwendolyn (Applegate), who comes across as leading a picture perfect life and seemingly in complete control of everything. It’s not long before Gwendolyn sees an increasingly empowered Amy as a threat to her, especially when Amy tries to become the PTA president. Both Amy and Gwendolyn try to undermine the other’s social standing, to hilarious results.
Wardrobe makeover
The humour incidentally, is quite bawdy, with the vast majority of the raunchy lines reserved for Carla. For example, the first step in her solution for getting Amy’s life back on track is for the latter to head to a bar, meet a guy and then head back to one of their places for some no-strings-attached sex. Carla also takes it upon herself to get Amy a wardrobe makeover in order to increase her sexiness quotient.
Bad Moms sometimes falters when attempts at mushy sentimentality are made. That being said, as a buddy flick, it delivers the goods, with a good amount of laugh-out-loud moments too.
Some of the attempts to make the movie look awesome are so evidently desperate, it hurts to watch them. There’s a scene where the ladies, drunk, go grocery shopping to Icona Pop playing in the background. The excessive use of slow motion and propeller fans to blow wind into their hair for such a stupid scene causes huge second-hand embarrassment.
Heavy judgment
But giving credit where it’s due, the movie’s heart in the right place. It advocates moms’ right to cut themselves some slack. We, sitting in a third world country, cannot really comprehend the heavy judgment middle and upper class mothers in the US have to face like not punishing kids, not saying no to kids, feeding kids organic food, not hiring a nanny, not leave your job and still manage to look like a supermodel at the end of the day. Bad Moms tries to give these moms a voice.
Only if it was enjoyable to watch as well.
Kunis is back after the unforgivable Jupiter Ascending and her performance as the way-too-good-looking mother is ordinary. The onus of making the movie funny did not rest on her but on Katheryn Hahn entirely and that woman is an underrated gem. After Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wigg, I trust her to take the baton of female comedy in Hollywood forward.
