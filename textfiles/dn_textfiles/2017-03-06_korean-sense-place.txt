The Korean sense of place

A few years ago, while on a writers’ residency in the south of France, I took the train to the Frankfurt Book Fair, where I came across a well-known Korean literary agent. Once he realized that I was an author, he told me, “please write Korean things. Since those are the most universal things”. His comment mystified me: he couldn’t, I thought, mean fiction stuffed with kimchi and makgeolli and jeong and han.
But there are senses in which our literature is distinctly Korean. Naturally, I’m no spokesperson for Korean literature, but at times I can’t help acting as a kind of representative. When an American journalist interviewed me once, she asked what I thought about North Korea. I was born in 1982, and for those of my generation, the North Korean issue, and especially the relationship between North and South Korean literature, is impossibly complex. I simply looked dazed, and she asked instead about the possibility of a Korean winning the Nobel Prize for Literature. This time I was able to answer easily. Because that – at least for me – was not at all an important issue. Korea’s young writers, as far as I know, have no particular interest in the Nobel Prize. But over the past few years, we have begun to think about what it means to have a national literature.
Literary language
This year is the hundredth anniversary of the publication of Yi Kwang-su’s Heartless (Mujong), known as the first modern Korean novel. I’ve read it many times, and it’s always made me wonder about the linguistic confusion that Korean writers active at the beginning of the twentieth century must have felt. During the Japanese colonial period, from a young age Koreans had to absorb Japanese as the official language, and Korean as their mother tongue, along with Western modern culture; intellectuals, moreover, would have had to study Western languages such as English, French and German. What could their literary language have been like? I’m also interested in the fact that most of the characters who appear in the fiction of the time are unable to find a place for themselves, a destination towards which to direct their energies both physically and psychologically. Such a place fundamentally does not exist. To understand the essence of Korean fiction, one must read Heartless; at first sight, its protagonist Yi Hyeong-shik is similar to Julian Sorel from Stendhal’s Le Rouge et le noir in that, with nothing but his mind to rely on, he dreams of climbing the social ladder through romance and marriage. But Yi Hyeong-shik has a different goal, which lies in nationalism; he believes that Koreans require liberating from colonization through enlightenment. So in the final scene Yi and the two women with whom he has formed a love triangle go to study in America. Yet, the realities of the time mean that this journey is only possible in their imagination; in actuality, they never leave Korea.
Korean War
Had Jules Verne been Korean, he could never have written Around the World in Eighty Days. And while in the West, the novel was established as a genre over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in Korea this happened 100 years later and much more rapidly, via Japanese translations of European and anglophone literature, and through the filter of the Korean War. The experience of the colonial period and the Korean War left the protagonists of Korean fiction stuck fast.
Choe In-hun’s novel The Square (Kwangjang, 1960) also takes the sense of place as its subject. It ends with the protagonist Lee Myeong-jun, feeling unable to go either south or north after the peninsula’s division, choosing a (non-existent) neutral country. In more recent Korean fiction, too, movement never appears easy. From the ICF crisis of 1997, the sub-prime disaster of 2007, and the low growth that has continued ever since, to the recent breakdown of national politics, our protagonists are confronted by a fate that restricts their lives.
So what are Korean authors writing today? One issue with which we are grappling is how to rescue and revive female autonomy, which has been trampled in the literature of the past hundred years. The time has come, it seems, to settle the detestable legacy of patriarchal society. This is not the first time feminism has appeared as a subject in Korean literature – Na Hye-sok, heralded as both the first female professional painter and the first feminist writer in Korea, was one of Yi Kwang-su’s contemporaries, active from the second decade of the twentieth century. But whereas the voice of women had previously been treated as peripheral, in recent decades it has begun to take the centre ground, in the short stories of Oh Jung-hee, the poetry of Kim Hyesoon and the novels of Han Kang, to mention only those in English translation. It is because Yi Hyeong-shik and Lee Myeong-jun are male that they at least have choices, whether America or some “neutral country” – even if these are only countries of the mind. Under Korean patriarchy, women have always had far fewer opportunities to receive education or enter into society, so for them such things could barely be expressed; in fiction, too, women lacked agency, even when they were the protagonists. For the most part, women appeared only as supporting characters, flimsy beings who featured simply to make the male characters more concrete and real. So my interest, and that of many of my contemporaries, lies in determining the factors that make movement either possible or impossible for women in fiction.
And so, even if it is not what that agent meant, it is true that Korean literature is approaching something universal. It is tapping into an international shift towards the re-examination of canonical works from a feminist perspective, especially those writers who dominated the early twentieth century: Kim Dong-in and Hyun Jin-geon, and the Japanese authors Natsume Saseki and Kobe Abe, are just a few.
On each old bookshelf, misogyny blooms like a poisonous mushroom. In the midst of that, Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own is being read again in the context of women’s writing, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Yellow Wallpaper, which was obstructed by men, is being read now in the context of gaslighting. And the female Korean writers who appeared over the past hundred years only to disappear again are being reevaluated. Now is the time for women to heed the final line of Goethe’s Faust, “the eternal feminine draws us on”, for our own sake. The eternal feminine will draw Korean literature on. Korean literature is now on the brink of such a transformation.
