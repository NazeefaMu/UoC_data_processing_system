67th Anniversary :
Air Force reaches out to people of Sri Lanka

The Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) celebrated its 67th Anniversary on March 02 without much pomp and pageantry, instead reaching out to the people of Sri Lanka, whom it serves, to let them see and experience what the Air Force is doing, what it was capable of doing, and where it is heading. Equal emphasis was given to fostering reconciliation and unity and assisting those whose needs the Air Force had the wherewithal to fulfil.
The main event was the Air Tattoo 2018, a continuation of the programme that was started last year, on the 66th Anniversary, when an Exhibition and Tattoo was held in Ratmalana and again in Vavuniya.
Based on the recommendation of Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy, the event was organized in the East, to reach out to the people of the Province, having successfully reached out to the people in the capital and the Northern Province previously. Accordingly, the SLAF Station in the Eastern town of Ampara was selected as the venue for the Air Tattoo 2018.
The event was declared open by Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne, PC, on March 03. Replete with air shows, aerobatic displays, parachute displays, a display by Regimental Special Forces, an air dog show, a band and drill display, a cultural show and a musical extravaganza each day, the Tattoo was held on three consecutive days, daily drawing large crowds of over 45,000, who came braving the threat of inclement weather.
The entrance was free, encouraging all to experience and enjoy, and large numbers of children enjoyed the exhibits and the displays.
Guwan Papedi Sawariya
Another significant event of the celebration and yet another endeavour to connect with the people of Sri Lanka in the spirit of unity and amity, the annual Guwan Papedi Sawariya was flagged off from opposite the Air Force Headquarters in Colombo, immediately after the formal parade, to mark the 67th anniversary on March 2.
The race etched its way through a rigorous route covering 124.9km on the first day finishing in Puttalam, 173km on the second day finishing in Hingurakgoda, and then covering 149.9km to finish in Ampara town. A separate women’s race was flagged off at Batticaloa on the morning of March 4 to also finish in Ampara town.
Cyclists from all around the country, as well as from other countries, participated in this race covering a total distance of 458.6km. Madushanka Fernando of the SLAF won the overall championship, while the team event was also won by the Sri Lanka Air Force Cycle Team. The women’s race from Batticaloa to Ampara was won by Shyamali of the Civil Security Department (CSD), while Niroshani Perera (SLAF) and Sandya Kumari (CSD) finished second and third respectively. The women’s team event was won by the Sri Lanka Air Force Women’s Cycling Team.

Future goals
Looking back on the journey that started with its modest beginnings in 1951 as the Royal Ceylon Air Force, under the leadership of its first Commander, Group Captain Graham Clerke Bladon, the Sri Lanka Air Force has much to celebrate. After 67 years, today, it is a battle-hardened, proven and experienced force. Looking back on the successes and failures, achievements and sacrifices, all airmen, young and old, feel a sense of achievement and pride. Fifteen commanders have led and steered its course to make it what it is, and today, its controls are in the able hands of Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy.
“While taking pride in its achievements, the SLAF is ever looking forward, ever evolving to face the threats and challenges that emerge daily,” said Air Force Spokesman Wing Commander Gihan Seneviratne. “The changing world order and the geopolitical landscape, or more aptly the skyscape, requires that we look at evolving faster, changing our paradigms, and setting our sights further than we have in the past. Today, our responsibility is not restricted to defending the skies above Sri Lanka alone. Nor is it confined to the traditional role of air power in the conventional scenario. Today, we have a role to play in the securing of our maritime boundaries and fulfilling our national obligations as a player on the world stage. Our increased involvement in UN peacekeeping missions contributes to the national economy as well. We are stakeholders in the promotion of aviation in Sri Lanka. Within our own boundaries, we take an active role in deterring the spread of narcotics and preventing the destruction of our invaluable forest cover and our ecological balance and bio diversity.”
“As our roles and functions grow, we are taking proactive measures to ensure that our inventory and our skillset evolve and grow. For if we fail to do so, or even if we are too slow to do so, we run the risk of become ineffective in playing our part in the development of our nation. Therefore, as always we train and we strive to fly, fight and win,” he said.
