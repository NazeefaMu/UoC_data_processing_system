Kate Middleton and little prince George enjoy a day at the museum

It's the kind of moment that melts your heart. And this one as a royal doozy! Kate Middleton leaned down to son Prince George in the Natural History Museum in South Kensington on October 22, giving her little tyke his first lesson in dinosaurs. The future king of England looked dapper as ever, rocking a crisp collared shirt paired with a navy blue sweater and perfectly quaffed hair.
Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge donned Audrey Hepburn inspired capris pants, the perfect outfit for their casual date. Middleton's attire is quite different from her red carpet look at the James Bond Spectre premiere. The Duchess was surprisingly braless for the event, sporting a risqué low-back gown!
But Kate kept a low-profile while wandering the Natural History Museum, as onlookers say they barely noticed the Duchess and her two-year-old son. She was holding George's hand, showing him around and talking to one of the people who worked there," museum-goer Rimi Rahman said.
The museum later confirmed the visit, stating: "We were very happy to welcome Natural History Museum Patron HRH the Duchess of Cambridge for a private visit last Thursday." - Radar Online
