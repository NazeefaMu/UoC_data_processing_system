Solar and wind energy the way forward - JLanka Forum

JLanka Technologies, together with The Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB), successfully concluded a forum and networking reception aimed at promoting the second phase of the public power-generating programme ‘Surya BalaSangramaya’ (SBS).
The event titled The Key Aspects of Utility Scale Solar PV Project Planning’, was facilitated by the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy of Sri Lanka, the Ceylon Electricity Board and the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority, with an objective to clarify how to successfully develop, finance, construct and operate utility-scale solar PV power plants. Ajith P. Perera, Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy was Chief Guest at the event.
In this second phase of the SBS, the Ministry of Power & Renewable Energy of Sri Lanka together with the Ceylon Electricity Board opened international competitive bidding by announcing the Request for Proposals (RFP) for the establishment of 60 solar power plants of 1MW across the country. JLanka Technologies, the premier solar solution provider in Sri Lanka announced the company’s offering of expertise and professional services for prospective project developers and investors.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera, while commending Sri Lanka’s evolution in terms of energy generation, emphasized on how crucial this renewable energy project is for the future of the country. Initiated by the Government, the Deputy Minister went on to state that the 60MW project is not only an opportunity for business diversification for any investor, but also an avenue for creating new businesses and jobs, as they see an increase in similar power plants in the near future. Ensuring decreasing unit costs per solar and wind power unit, the minister encouraged everyone, especially local businesses, to invest in and benefit from the opportunity.
Yoni Ziv, the Vice President of Sales and Founding Member of SolarEdge Technologies Inc. of Israel also addressed the forum on the technological advancements of solar across the world today. SolarEdge, a global leader in photovoltaic (PV) inverters and power optimisers, is an emerging forerunner in smart energy management. With the Government’s positive encouragement and approach, JLanka too offers smart technologies such as the SolarEdge DC Power Optimizer and other latest solar equipment, the know-how, and partnerships to support all interested parties in venturing into solar power generation.
JLanka also provides comprehensive support services for prospective developers who are required to design, finance, procure, construct, commission, operate and maintain the solar PV power plant.
