83rd Battle of the Saints at P Sara Oval

The 83rd Battle of the Saints annual cricket big match between St Peter’s College and St Joseph’s College is scheduled for March 3 and 4 at the P Sara Oval.
In this year’s encounter the Peterites will be led by that dashing prolific batsman and former national youth player Lakshina Rodrigo and the Josephians by strike bowler Harin Cooray.
Speaking at the media conference held at Kynsey Hall Jetwing Hotel, Colombo 7, Rev. Trevor Martin, the rector of St. Peter’s College said, “The Battle of the Saints between St. Peter’s and St. Joseph’s, two of the leading Catholic schools in Sri Lanka has a long and rich history of tradition and camaraderie spanning over eight decades.
The joint Organising Committee has worked very hard over the last few months to ‘raise the bar’ and enhance the fun and excitement for Peterites and Josephians both young and old. I am sure both teams will play positive cricket. I wish both schools the best.”
Rev. Father Anton Ranjith vice rector of St. Joseph’s College said, “The Big Match between our two schools is one of the most looked forward to events in the Sri Lanka schools cricket calendar and this year too will be no exception. I wish both the schools the very best to deliver two days of exhilarating cricket. I would also like to thank the main sponsor Dialog Axiata.”
St. Joseph’s leads the series tally with 12 wins and their last win came under the captaincy of Ruwantha Fernandopulle in 2008. St. Peter’s won the contest last year under Vinu Mohotty bringing their tally to 10 wins.
