Avery Dennison Lanka organizes  CSR Project in Anuradhapura

At a time where many organizations around the world integrate social work into their business in order to attract their stakeholders, Avery Dennison Lanka (Pvt) Ltd considers Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as an innate aspect of the company’s process to develop a sustainable existence for all the stakeholders.
Clean drinking water is one of the four basic human needs. Avery Dennison visited the village of Kahatagasdigiliya in Anuradhapura district and identified many a villagers who are deprived of that fundamental resource of clean drinking water. Kidney disease, identified to be increasingly common in the North Eastern Province, bringing death and suffering to thousands.
A significant number of people have fallen victim to the disease, since the drinking water polluted with heavy metals is suspected to be the principle cause of this condition, more would follow the same path, unless steps are taken to remedy the situation. Children of school going age are also not spared from the threat.
Avery Dennison Lanka has taken steps to build a tube well that will provide seven tap lines distributed through the area of Kahatagasdigiliya. The project was initiated on October 1, will supply around 50 families with life giving them clean water and a ray of hope for the future.
This is just one amongst several projects conducted by Avery Dennison Lanka, targeting the wellbeing and development of the community. Being an integral part of our business objectives, these CSR ventures are much more than ‘charity projects’.
These projects are designed annually, with a view to drive our commercial and brand value, at the same time giving back something worthy to the society, improving the quality of life of the people.
