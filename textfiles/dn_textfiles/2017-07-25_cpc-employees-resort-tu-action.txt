CPC employees resort to TU action

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) employees are engaging in a strike since last midnight in protest of tendering the Cabinet paper to lease out the Hambantota Port Oil Tank complex to the Cabinet of Ministers today, the Petroleum Trade Unions Collective said.
Convenor D. J. Rajakaruna said they staged a strike earlier on handing over of the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm and Hambantota Oil Tank Farm to the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and modernisation of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery.
“It was revealed that a Cabinet paper is to be placed today on handing over of the Hambantota Oil Tank Farm and bunkering facilities to a Chinese Company,” Rajakaruna said.
“The authorities did not give us an opportunity to discuss the issues.”
