Enforced absence of govt Ministers at today’s rally: Keheliya

Although several ministers and MPs in the government were billed to participate in today’s Joint Opposition rally at Nugegoda, they have been asked to keep away from attending the rally temporarily, Kandy District Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella said.
However, all parliamentarians in the Joint Opposition will be attending the rally, he said. Rambukwella said it was regrettable to see the government which professed super democracy obstructing its members from joining the Joint Opposition group. Rambukwella said holding rallies, protest campaigns, press conferences and participating in political debates was a prime duty and role of an Opposition.
The UNP had to languish in the Opposition benches for nearly 20 years because it failed to perform this role while in the Opposition. He said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Parliamentarians Chamal Rajapaksa, Vidura Wickremenayake would definitely attend today’s rally.
The LSSP and other Parliamentarians in the Joint Opposition would also attend the rally.
Basil Rajapaksa will not be attending the Nugegoda rally,” he said.
