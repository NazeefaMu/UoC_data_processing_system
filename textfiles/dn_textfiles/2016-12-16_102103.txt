Youth Asia Cup: Unlucky Nepal lose to Sri Lanka by one run

Sri Lanka Under 19 recorded a face-saving one-run win from the jaws of defeat after Nepal spearheaded by a spectacular 90 off 99 balls (9 fours) by Dipendra Singh Airee nearly pulled off an improbale win in their opening game of the Youth Asia Cup cricket tournament at the NCC grounds yesterday.
Although the Lankans scraped through to an exciting win it was an ominous sign that the host will have have to improve almost in all departments of the game when they encounter tougher opposition like the other three Test playing nations – India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Nepal were set to make 227 to win in their stipulated 50 overs, but were all out for 226 in 49.3 overs.
The absorbing contest swung vigorously from side to side and tilting more towards the visitors most of the time. In the last over Nepal needed eight runs to win with a wicket in hand. But Jayawickrema who was entrusted with the last over trapped Dipendra Singh Airee leg before wicket after compiling a monumental 90.
Sri Lanka who were invited to bat lacked conviction while batting and the penetrative qualities while bowling which enabled the Nepalese to cruise along.
Lankan youth who were invited to bat were off to a bad start losing opener Chaturanga with no score on the board. But Raven Kelly and Boyagoda batted steadily to added 68 for the second wicket in 14 overs. But the rest couldn’t make much headway amidst a steady Nepal attack who forced the Lankan batsmen into errors.
Besides two useful innings by Arachchige (28) facing 47 deliveries with two fours and K. Bandara (48 n.o) facing 47 deliveries with five boundaries the rest were unable to consolidate and Sri Lanka finally ended up with 227 for 8 in their 50 overs. K.S. Airee took 3 for 43 for Nepal.
