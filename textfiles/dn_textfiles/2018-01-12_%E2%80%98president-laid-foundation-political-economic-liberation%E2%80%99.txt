‘President laid the foundation for political, economic liberation’

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa came down to the level of a parliamentarian, and now, he is at a Pradeshiya Sabha level. That was the result of a self-destructive act; defacing one’s own political image, said Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He further said, “No matter what attempts the former President makes to regain power, he is legally barred from becoming the President again; he does not bear any chance of becoming the Prime Minister either. As such, all political transactions made hoping for a bright and promising future with the former President, are futile and not practically possible.”
He said so addressing a Local Government election meeting held at Medawachchiya.
The SLFP general secretary further said President Maithripala Sirisena has successfully laid the foundation for the country to move forward in order to achieve political and economic emancipation sans corruptions, wasting of public funds, cheating, and misappropriation, which hindered the country’s development progress.
His dedication to this was reflected in the act of appointing a Presidential Commission to inquire into the controversial Central Bank’s bonds issue, Dissanayake added.
“Being a national government, we have started work to develop the country in conformity of the wishes of the people. The main objective of the good governance government, based on an integrated module, is to empower people-friendly reforms that a single party government has so far, failed to achieve in political history. Some politicians and their followers don’t understand this positive and practical theory; they pretend in order to get their own political agendas fulfilled and to gain power,” he said.
“During previous eras, major political party rivals used to make all efforts to topple the government by opposing its policies to gain power; hoodwinking, misguiding, and agitating the masses. Today, we have passed this parasitical barricade and are heading towards our goals,” he added.
He said because he was holding a strong portfolio in the government, he was in a position to support his voters without asking them to wait until an SLFP government come into power. This new political, people-friendly, and progressive trend ensured peace, co-existence, understanding among communities, sympathy and respect towards us, internationally.
“When Mahinda Rajapaksha was in power, he encouraged amateur divisional-level politicians by saying that they had the opportunity to hold the presidency of the party, if determined, but he blocked the path of a rising politician from entering into Parliament by contesting the last General Elections in the Kurunegala district,” he said.
“Is it reasonable or justifiable? Where is the so-called second row of SLFP politicians being promoted as Mahinda Rajapaksa once uttered? Now the candidates of G. L. Peiris’s new political party campaigning for the elections, exhibit Mahinda Rajapasa’s image at the forefront while canvasing for votes. I appeal to voters to think: would Mahinda Rajapaska pass funds to renovate rural roads or to construct culverts in villages, being in the present position he is in? Intelligent voters should condemn and reject hypocratic politicians and should not fall prey to baseless and vituperative political slogans,” Minister Dissanayake said.
“You could question from your own conscience, whether or not President Sirisena and his government have saved our country from political disaster, international wrath, nepotism, economic destruction, terror and violence, after he gained power three years back. Hence, reject all evil forces at the forthcoming election and find the most suitable candidate among the cluster of them to hold the responsibility of your village,” the minister added. A range of religious rituals were observed recently before the historic Katu Seya chaitiya in Mihintale, for evoking blessings of the deities and the triple gems for whole country, President, and the government. At the ceremony, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake offered a symbolic gold hoe to the Katu Seya.
