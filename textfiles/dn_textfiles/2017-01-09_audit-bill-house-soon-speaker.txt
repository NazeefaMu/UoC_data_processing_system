Audit Bill before House soon: Speaker

The Audit Bill will be presented to Parliament soon, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
The Speaker said this legislation would help enhance Parliament’s control over state finances, while creating the environment necessary for State Audit officials to work resolutely for the country.
He made these comments addressing the Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Audit Service Association at New Town Hall in Colombo.
The Speaker pointed out the improved space for the public to question the State finance management is a healthy sign of democracy.
He observed the service of Audit officials is a must to make the work of Committees on Public Enterprises and Public Accounts a success.
“Sometime back, it was revealed through a movement called ‘Clean Hand’ spearheaded by a team of senior state officials, that 40 percent of the public money is wasted or misused when utilised for public work. I believe we can arrest this unfortunate situation as the end result of successfully implementing the Audit Act, Right to Information Act and independent commissions,” he said.
Addressing the event, COPA Chairman Lasantha Alagiyawanna said unlike before Parliament now takes Audit reports seriously and goes through every page with utmost attention. He reminded there was a time these reports were blatantly disregarded.
COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti stressed the Audit Bill should be passed through Parliament before the end of this year.
“If not, what we were all doing today to arrest corruption and bribery will be in vain,” he said.
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe also participated.
