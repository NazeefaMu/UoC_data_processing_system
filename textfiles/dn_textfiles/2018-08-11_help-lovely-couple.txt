Help this 'lovely' couple

The Daily News met present-time Shahjahan and Mumtaz Mahal at Yatigalpoththa, Galewela recently.
The similarity between the Shahjahan couple and Priyantha and Niroshani couple is that the latter couple are living with great attachment to each other. They have nine children.
Unfortunately Priyantha and Niroshani are not as rich as Shahjahan and still dreaming of completing their Taj Mahal for their loving children.
Priyantha Weerakkody (37) is plucking coconuts for a living, while his wife Gayani Niroshani Dissanayake is looking after the children.
"My eldest is 13-year-old. The youngest is 4 years old. One of our children left us forever," Weerakkody said.
"I am plucking coconuts in the morning and come home to spend the rest of the time with my family. That is the brightest part of my life. I never hope of building houses or to buy lands but to bring up my children. My wife readily agreed and we did it. The sad part is that she became a little bit weak."
Weerakkody is from Kandy and Niroshani is from Kadawatha. They had brought a small land at Galewela with the money Niroshani had saved and built a house there but they were unable to complete it.Now they live in their half-built house.
"Our marriage is a result of a love affair," Niroshani said. "He had not changed his love and does all the household chores in the evening as I am weak. One daughter is not with us. She was sent to another place as there is a belief that it is unlucky to have nine children together," she said.
Remaining eight children are schooling. They said they find it difficult to afford uniforms and meal. The most difficult part is to afford private tuition today since the education has become more competitive than those days. Priyantha and Niroshani said that they will bring up their children well and make them serve the nation. Their contact number is 0764020275.
