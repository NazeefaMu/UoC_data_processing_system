NZ conditions were the biggest challenge - Shashikala

Sri Lanka captain Shashikala Siriwardene said that conditions in New Zealand was the biggest challenge after her team was whitewashed 0-5 by the home side in their women's five-match one-day international series.
"When we arrived in New Zealand we were seventh in the table and had hoped to grab a few points. But unfortunately as a team we couldn't perform as we expected," said Siriwardana.
"Conditions were the biggest challenge firstly and this was the first time we all played here. We were also short of few experienced players like Eshani and Udeshika.
"But we learned a lot and thanks to ICC Women's Championship, we have the opportunity to play against the best seven countries in the world. We gained good experience and I am sure we will be tougher for the experience next time."
New Zealand climbed to third place in the ICC Women's Championship following its 3-0 win against Sri Lanka in Lincoln.
The White Ferns went into the series in sixth position on eight points, but has now leapfrogged Pakistan, England and South Africa to third on 14 points, two behind co-leaders Australia, which lies marginally ahead of the West Indies when run-rates are factored in.
India has switched places with Sri Lanka who are now rooted to the bottom of the table on five points.
The White Ferns, in fact, swept Sri Lanka 5-0 in the series but only the first three matches counted towards the ICC Women's Championship. The 5-0 series win, nevertheless, has had an impact on New Zealand position on the ICC Women's Championship on which it has gained two points to move up to 111 points.
The ICC Women's Championship is a qualifying tournament for the ICC Women's World Cup 2017 and is being participated in by Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and West Indies. The top four sides from the ICC Women's Championship will gain automatic qualification for the event proper which is to be staged in England, while the bottom four sides will get a final chance of qualification through the ICC Women's World Cup Qualifier in 2017.
