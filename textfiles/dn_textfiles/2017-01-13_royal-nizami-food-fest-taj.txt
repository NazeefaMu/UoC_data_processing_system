The Royal Nizami Food Fest at Taj

A dish that's par excellence, loved by all food lovers across the world and has a rich historical past. One of the representative dishes of India that reminds of the culinary heritage of the regal era is back at Navratna, Taj Samudra.
Colombo's premier Biryani feast returns with seven national treasures perfected by Chef Bhumi Chauhan at Colombo's oldest Indian restaurant, one of the finest places to enjoy an authentic Royal Nizami experience, Navratna at the Taj Samudra from January 13-29.
Using nothing, but the best authentic ingredients from age-old recipes Chef Chauhan will prepare some delectable Biryani dishes, from the famous mutton morels infused with fragrant basmati rice to a classic from the heritage menu of Hyderabad.
The fragrant and scrumptious dish is prepared with a mixture of spices and condiments, rice (usually basmati), meat or vegetables and yoghurt. The dish finds its origins in the Mughal dynasty and derives its name from a Persian word beryan, which means fried or roasted.
Hyderabad, Malabar, Delhi, Agra, Dhaka, Kolkata, Lucknow and Karachi are the main centers of biryani. Biryani was traditionally prepared in earthenware pots and is known for its unique aroma, flavor and spices. Navratna arguably Colombo's finest Indian restaurant of the Taj Samudra presents tantalizing Biryani cuisine that challenges you to resist.
The Biryani promotion also includes the Jalpari Zafrani which is a combination of saffron flavored lagoon prawns and Anda Dum Biryani, a traditional Biryani dedicated to egg lovers. Vegetarians are sure to love the kathal Dum Biryani, a combination of baby jack fruit or the Dhingri which includes mushroom. Subz Zafrani is known for its fresh ground vegetables and Chhara Aloo Masala which has baby potatoes infused in Biryani masala in a Dum pot.
Vegetarian or non-vegetarian, mild or spicy, as a stand-alone dish or combined with a complementary curry, the appeal of an authentically prepared biryani is indisputable. All Biryani dishes include Mirchi ka Salan, Burani Raita and the Kachumbar Salad.
The Navaratna restaurant exudes the ambience of luxury with beautiful paintings. The unique aroma of various spices wafts through as soon as you enter while waiters dressed in traditional kurtha welcome you graciously. Often times, there is a live instrument music playing in the background and adds to the exclusivity of the experience.
The Hyderabadi Biryani and Haleem Fest is happening from January 13-29 at Navratna at the Taj Samudra offering guests a complete experience of Indian cuisine at it's finest.
