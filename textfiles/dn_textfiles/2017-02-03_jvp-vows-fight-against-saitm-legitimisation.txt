JVP vows to fight against SAITM legitimisation

The JVP said it will continue to struggle against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) being recognised as a legitimate private medical school.
“We will discuss this matter with university lecturers, doctors and other academics and would not allow this corrupt organisation to be legalised, he said.
The Court of Appeal’s ruling to grant provisional registration to SAITM Medical graduates from the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) will affect the Sri Lankan education standard, he said.
Most political parties too are opposing this decision despite their differences, JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake told a media briefing yesterday.
He said the JVP strongly opposes the legalisation of SAITM which is a known hive of corruption. Arrangements will be made to stage protests countrywide, he warned.
"Despite the court order, there is no provision for SAITM to be registered with the SLMC. The reason is that they have to wait for the verdict once the appeal is filed in the Supreme Court," said Ratnayake adding that the SLMC has said it will file an appeal in the Supreme Court.
"There is no need for a lawsuit, because Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and the student who filed the case have recognised SAITM in principal. This is unfair as medical bodies or
medical practitioners were not allowed to give evidences in this case and it is wrong," he said.
"A five-member committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena when he was the Health Minister during the former regime had ruled that SAITM was illegal. Hence it is not clear as to how the current Health Minister can defend SAITM," he pointed out.
"Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had admitted that it was wrong to allow SAITM. Therefore, President Maithripala Sirisena's failure to correct this mistake will certainly boomerang on him at the next election," Ratnayake warned.
