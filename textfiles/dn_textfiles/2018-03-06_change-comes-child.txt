Change   comes   with a   child

CUP mission
Education is the foundation, where people can begin to improve themselves and their communities.
Today’s children are tomorrow’s leaders and educating them will have a positive impact on their futures and their community’s future.
All Children have the right to quality education regardless of their economic background.
All Children have dreams and they desire to fulfill them.
In leveraging technology, knowledge, and resources to create educational opportunities for Children.
Making an interest to read and write among children and bring out their inherited talents and creative thoughts.
Somewhere in a corner of that giant oak table, she shuffled the chaos of her little workstation. She had so much to do. Observing her father’s moves and moods was one. At times he would pout. Bent forward with raised eyebrows, he would occasionally take a break to meditate on a character sketch.
The Sinhalese-reading children of the seventies and eighties will still remember who S A Disanayake is. His name is kind of eponymous with the Asterix-type characters who came to life in the Mihira newspaper cartoons.
“Father created a character called Punchitta following my birth. Whenever he draws a few sketches, he used to show them to me. So to say I had a good access to his work. I won’t forget his contemplative moods.”
Her father had instilled the art of neatness in her. He had her table, bookshelf, bed and the book bag well organised. Her father made her a box-like bag so that she can carry much stuff inside.
“Father entered us to various art competitions both international and national. He wanted to pass down his legacy to a certain extent. When I was eight, I started the violin. I was drawn away from arts and studied music up to Bhatkande. Art is beautiful. But I find it a bit difficult.”
Nadee Tharanga Disanayake has produced a few books for children. There is more to children’s books than writing some fairytale. The children’s books have the potential to change one whole society, Nadee believes. That belief led her to initiate the Children’s Upliftment Programme (CUP) in 2005.
“I formulated the organisation with the assistance of a few friends. Together we worked out on how the underprivileged or the less-privileged children can be benefited from the children’s literature.”
Nadee’s fervent belief was that she should – and she could – make some worthy contribution towards the betterment of children in need.
CUP was brainstormed in 2004 with the primary objective of building up the future of the younger generation of the country. Its scope is further narrowed down by targeting the community which suffered from poverty, lack of attention and guidance. At the beginning CUP was registered as a charitable organization under the Companies Act No. 1982 and today it is a registered non-profit making charity organization.
“We have set up libraries in the rural villages. And we are conducting programmes to encourage children to write storybooks. At the same time, we offer numerous scholarship programmes. For the visually impaired children, we have established therapy units. The very first one was set up in Karapitiya.”
The change comes with the child, Nadee maintains. The adults are a tough species to crack down. If anyone ever believes that this society needs to be changed, they should begin with the children. That’s precisely why Nadee got together with a few adults to form CUP to begin change with the children.
As a Commissioner at the Inland Revenue Department, Nadee Disanayaka is constantly in touch with the affluent crowd who are willing to offer a helping hand. But they have their own share of concerns as well. They have no time for charity, for one. Most charity organisations are not trustworthy, on the other hand. They would look forward to sponsoring a child through a genuine charity organisation that can be transparent about how the funds are exhausted. If the funds reach the right place, there are enough people who would like to donate.
“I think I had some writing talent. Whatever the skill you may have, you need to practise it. A writer should constantly write. I have written several children’s books. I take time to edit them. All the time I feel that the raw writing should be improved more. Then I am obliged to pass that inheritance to the younger generation.”
Nadee’s books are a result of extensive research in various fields. Children’s books should be more creative in order inculcate wholesome habits. One of her books focuses on offering a comprehensive idea of the Inland Revenue Department’s role.
A poor child makes friends with a rich child. The rich child is conversant in English, while the poor child is well versed in maths. They share the knowledge with each other. The poor child observes certain things. His friend scribbles down in the textbook itself. Whenever he needs money to visit the doctor, the rich child channels a private physician for his friend. The rich child’s father is a wonderful man, the poor child thinks. The bulk of welfare such as pensions and free services offered by the government is a result of the earnings of the rich child’s father. The poor child wants to thank his friend’s father in person.
“Finally the poor child makes a resolution to become rich and do his part by paying income tax which in turn benefits the whole society. Paying taxes is a social responsibility. We enjoy the benefits of parks, highways and streetlights. These services come as a result of government expenses. That’s why we should decrease the budget gap. You need to teach that a child should brush teeth twice a day. They won’t learn that naturally. Having said that, it should not be forced either. The training should be done naturally.”
Disanayaka also made a point about bilingual books. More children’s books should be published in both English and Sinhala side by side.
“We did not speak English as children. We studied English with difficulty. But the younger generation should be motivated to read the books in both languages.”
Who chooses everything for the adult, Nadee questions. It is the parents’ responsibility introduce children to the books and reading. A child should be given a chance to read.
“A child should be given a chance to write what he remembers. It could be a list, favourite author. Or even the contents. It could even be a diary. Let them write every day, and there should be a reward to them following the lapse of 365 days. You can tell a child to go to Katharagama from Colombo, they don’t know how to go. But you can give them tips on the transport and highway system. A child should be given guidance.”
If a child has been introduced to iPad, then why not literature? A child would not suddenly go for an iPad.
“When I was doing A/Ls, my father bought a colour television set. But he did not unpack the box until my exams are over. I think that’s how parents should behave with children. Today’s social media is a huge distraction for the child. The adults can opt to stay away from the distractions. But the children are not mature enough for that. So the best thing is to replace social media or iPad by a physical book.”
We cannot change the whole world. But Nadee believes in lighting one candle. Develop your child’s language and then let them choose their future career. And for that, the adults should let them write in the first place.
