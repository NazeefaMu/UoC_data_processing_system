Use of SPC funds to pay mobile phone bill: Case against Keheliya re-fixed for trial

A corruption case filed against former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and former State Printing Corporation (SPC) Chairman was yesterday fixed for trial on October 16 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
This is for allegedly causing an unlawful loss of Rs.230,984 to the government after paying former Minister’s one month mobile phone bill using SPC funds, while functioning as the Mass Media Minister in 2012.
When the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the court was informed that the first witness in the case was yet to receive notices.
Accordingly, the notices were re-issued on the witness to appear in courts on next trial date by Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
On a previous occasion, the court had rejected the preliminary objections raised by defence and decided to fix the matter for trial.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former minister had induced the CPC Chairman to pay his mobile phone bill from March 15, 2012 to April 14, 2012 causing an unlawful loss to the government while the former minister was serving as the Mass Media Minister.
The Bribery Commission had named former (SPC) Chairman Jayampathi Bandara Heenkenda as an accused for aiding and abetting to commit the offence.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed the case against former minister and the former SPC chairman under section 70 of the Bribery Act on three counts.
Counsel Anuradha Siriwardena, the Assistant Legal Director of Bribery Commission, appeared for the prosecution. Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the defence.
