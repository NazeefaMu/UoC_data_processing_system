MFSAC opposes absorbing SAITM students into KDU

The Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee (MFSAC) opposes absorbing SAITM students into the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU). The minimum qualifications for absorbing was decided to get in close friends and minsters’ relatives, Committee Convener Didula Amarasinghe said.
He was addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday.
The minimum qualifications recommended by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) have been totally ignored, he said. Amarasinghe said KDU authorities have the power to absorb SAITM students and to decide the degree they must follow. This sidelines the SLMC power in this regard.
Abolishing the SAITM could have been included in the Act presented to Parliament on June 8. No plans should be made to set up private medical faculties in Sri Lanka hereafter, he said.
