Point of view
Sri Lankan equities reversed 7-consecutive weeks of negative returns this week, helping the ASPI end on a positive note for the 1st time since late-May’18.
Despite temporarily falling below the key 6100 level, the benchmark Index gained ~29 points or 0.48% over the week (cf. -86 point loss last week).
Similar to last week when the Index breached the 6100-mark to hit a 15-month low of 6044.03, the ASPI lost ~31 points on Monday to drag the index once again below this key 6100-mark. However, the ASPI rebounded notably over the latter half of the week, and the ASPI’s ~61 point gain between Wednesday and Friday more than offset the losses recorded earlier in the week and helped push the Index safely above the 6100-mark for the 2nd consecutive week.
The stronger performance on the Index was mainly attributable to the return of Institutional and HNI investors and crossings accounted for 46% of weekly turnover (cf. just 36% last week) with Jetwing Symphony and HNB accounting for 53% of the bulk parcels.
Despite the Index’s stronger performance, overall activity levels on the Bourse remained dull, with turnover decreasing 31% W-o-W to Rs.2.0Bn.
Daily turnover levels subsequently hit a 12-week low on both Monday (Rs.155Mn) and Tuesday (Rs143Mn) cf. the previous low of Rs.102Mn recorded in Mid-April amid the traditional New-Year holidays.
The foreign equity sell-off on equities meanwhile, continued once again this week with net outflows from the CSE amounting to Rs.221Mn cf. Rs.900Mn last week.
Net foreign outflows from the CSE widened further to Rs.2.8Bn, reflecting the heightened risk-aversion for EM/FM assets since Feb’18. Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues both from domestic political & economic developments.
Industrial production in May edges higher
The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) in May rose to 105.7 (from 97.7 in Apr’18) indicating greater manufacturing activity over the month.
The IIP which is a leading economic indicator, measures short term changes in the volume of industrial production in the country’s manufacturing sector and the higher index value indicates greater manufacturing sector activity over the month.
However, on a year-on-year basis the index rose just 2%, as slower manufacturing activity in electrical equipment, machinery, paper and paper products and non-metallic minerals offset strong manufacturing activity in fabricated metals, chemicals, Coke and refined petroleum and pharmaceuticals.
Meanwhile, the LMD-Nielsen Business Confidence Index (BCI) declined by four basis points to 102 in June, falling short of its 12-month average of 115 once again, as concerns over inflation heading higher (on the back of higher fuel prices) has impacted sentiment.
The BCI also noted that high taxes, political interference and the value of the rupee are the main corporate concerns, with survey respondents believing that the “constant political interference and inconsistency in policy implementation” has negatively impacted the economy.
LMD-Nielsen added that in terms of future projections of the Index, it believes that positive news to ‘propel a major comeback of the barometer of corporate sentiment’ remains scant and that several sectors remain vulnerable to the depreciating LKR, the prospect of higher inflation/cost structures and world events.
