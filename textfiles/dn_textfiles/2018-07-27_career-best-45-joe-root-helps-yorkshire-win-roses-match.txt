Career best 4/5 from Joe Root helps Yorkshire win Roses match

LONDON, Wednesday - England Test captain Joe Root finished with a career-best 4-5 as Yorkshire polished off Lancashire in the first hour of day three to win by 118 runs.
Lancashire resumed on 194-6, needing 129 runs to win the Roses match, but Root had Graham Onions caught with the first ball of the day at Old Trafford.
His off-spin claimed Matt Parkinson before Tom Bailey (45) fell, with Root bowling James Anderson to seal victory.Day three lasted less than an hour, Lancashire adding just 10 runs to their overnight total as they were all out for 204.
Division One leaders Surrey bowled out Nottinghamshire on day three to win by an innings and 183 runs and seal their fifth consecutive Championship victory.
After resuming on 57-1, 325 runs short of Surrey’s first innings total of 592, Notts lost Steven Mullaney (23) early on before Will Fraine went for 30.
Seamer Morne Morkel ended the resistance of Samit Patel (55) as the hosts were reduced to 172-7 at lunch. Spinner Amar Virdi (2-35) helped Morkel (5-60) wrap up the tail.
Surrey took maximum points from their victory at Trent Bridge as they remain unbeaten in the league this season, and are now 43 points ahead of second-placed Notts in the table with a game in hand.
Somerset eventually broke Worcestershire’s county-record 10th-wicket partnership to win by 141 runs and keep their title hopes alive.
Victory looked imminent after lunch with Division One’s bottom club 165-9, chasing 443 to win at New Road.
Debutant Alex Milton (104 not out) and last man Steve Magoffin (43) resisted for 38 overs in a stand of 136.
But the rearguard action was ended when Craig Overton had Magoffin caught at point by Josh Davey. Victory on day four at New Road moved Somerset up to second in the table, 34 points behind leaders Surrey.
Gloucestershire battled to their second County Championship win of the season despite late resistance from Durham.
Needing 340 for victory, the visitors started the day on 35-0 and openers Tom Latham (45) and Cameron Steel (62) gave them a solid foundation. However, once England all-rounder Ben Stokes was bowled by Matt Taylor (4-31) for nine to leave them at 189-5, hopes of an away win seemed slim.
