Speaker certifies RTI Bill into law

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya certified the Right to Information (RTI) Bill into law on Monday, co-cabinet spokesman and Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatileka said yesterday.
Minister Karunatileka addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department said the delay was due to the Speaker having left to Singapore recently.
While the RTI Bill itself was passed in Parliament on June 24, there was criticism that it had not been passed into law. The Act also stipulates that its contents needs to come into effect six months after having been made into law.
Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) in a statement released to the media earlier this week urged the Speaker to act on RTI or to inform “the public of the reasons for any further delay”.
“TISL is conscious of the time needed to accommodate Committee Stage amendments, but in light of the fact that nearly all amendments had been pre-drafted, TISL believed a lapse of over a month is unwarranted. In delaying the certification of the Bill, the entire process of rolling out the RTI infrastructure is put on hold, including the setting up of the RTI Commission, the appointment and training of Information Officers, Designated Officers and Commissioners, and the sensitisation of the entire public service,” the TISL statement added.
