March 12 Movement urges Govt. to hold LG polls

The March 12 Movement yesterday urged the government to hold the Local Government election without further delay to preserve the voting rights of the people respecting the public consensus vested upon them on January 8, 2015.
“We express our displeasure regarding the continuous postponement of Local Government electionS,” PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said.
“It has been two years since the dissolution of the Local Government institutions in Sri Lanka. This means the people have been denied of representation at the most basic, grassroots level, which impacts their day-to-day life, health and welfare. Depriving voters of their representation in any of these tiers is a violation of the democratic rights of the people, ”he added.
The amendment bill with regard to the Local Government elections will be presented in Parliament on August 24. It will be amended to 60 percent under the first-pass-post system and 40 percent under the preferential system. This is a good move. But, this amendment should not lead to the further postponement of elections,’ he added.
“All political parties will be vested with the responsibility to allocate 25 percent quota for women under the preferential voting system. We urge the government to not to reduce the 25 percent quota for women representatives.
Under the new system, political parties are vested with the powers to select their candidates.Therefore, we urge the all political parties to reveal their candidate selection process to the people before the election,” Hettiarachchi said.
“We request the relevant political parties to submit nominations only for suitable candidates, having taken the relevant points above into consideration. It is also necessary to retain transparency during the entire process of selecting candidates,” the PAFFREL Executive Director said.
“Creating a clean political culture is a collective responsibility that should be shouldered by the entire citizenry. This responsibility is unavoidable for the Members of Parliament as the representatives of the people respecting the public consensus vested upon them,” he added.
The March 12 movement is of the view that it is not too late to bring about a political culture that honours the public consensus having properly comprehended the socio-political needs. The political parties and their leaders should also take prompt action in fostering such a political culture.
Shashi de Mel from Transparency International Sri Lanka, Manjula Gajanayake from the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV),Chaminda Rajakaruna from Sarvodaya and Naveendra Liyanaarchchi from the Sanasa Movement were also spoke.
