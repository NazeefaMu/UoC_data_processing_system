SLFP condemns Vijayakala’s statement

The SLFP vehemently condemns State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran’s statement that the LTTE should be revived in the North, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said, issuing a statement in his capacity as the SLFP Media Spokesman.
He stated that tough action should be taken against her by the Government as well as Parliament.
“The LTTE brutally killed innocent Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim people. We suffered for three decades due to the ruthless war.
“The War Heroes sacrificed their life and limb to save the country from terrorism and the Government is committed to safe guard their dignity,” Samarasinghe said.
