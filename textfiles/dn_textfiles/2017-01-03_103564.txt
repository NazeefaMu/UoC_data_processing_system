The ground breaking on the much publicised and long overdue Volkswagen assembly plant will break ground in Kuliyapitiya today under the patronage of the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Volkswagen AG’s local joint venture partner is Senok Automobiles and the total investment will be US$ 26.5 million. Out of this US$ 21.5 million will be invested in fixed assets within a period of 24 months, the Board of Investment said.

Volkswagen, the second largest car maker in the world had strived since 2008 to start up a business to manufacture cars in Sri Lanka for export,but did not succeed for various reasons.
