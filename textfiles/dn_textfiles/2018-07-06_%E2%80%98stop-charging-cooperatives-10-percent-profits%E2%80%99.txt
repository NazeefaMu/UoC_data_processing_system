‘Stop charging cooperatives 10 percent from profits’

Uva Provincial Councillor M.P. Leelasena called for the cessation of the 10 percent charged by the Cooperative Development Department from the profits of cooperative societies. He stressed many are running at a loss and this charge simply put them into greater debt.
“The consumer units of these cooperatives have completely broken down. The majority of cooperative outlets have been closed. The remaining cooperatives survive because of the fuel stations and the cooperative banks. Can the cooperatives survive in an open economy? We should ask ourselves this question. We have to admit that the open economy principles of the UNP government after 1977 led to the decline of the cooperatives. It is difficult to rebuild them now,” he said.
He said the Badulla multi-purpose cooperative, for example, paid Rs. 3 - Rs. 4 million to the Fund every year, but now it was in debt amounting to Rs. 20.6 million to the Fund. From the Uva Province alone, the Fund collects Rs. 10 million every year. “But the Fund did not spend a cent on the welfare of these cooperatives. The officers of the Department, however, take frequent trips abroad and enjoy many benefits. The cooperatives fall into ruin. Our cooperatives today owe more than Rs 50 million to the Fund.”
He said it was unfair to collect 10 percent of the profits for the Fund and asked for a more reasonable percentage. It was through the profits that 742 employees were paid their salaries. He asked that this 10 percent charge be stopped in order to save the struggling cooperatives.
“If so, we can save that Rs 10 million and use it for the benefit of the cooperatives.”
The Provincial Councillor said that in accordance with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, cooperatives come under the purview of the provincial councils. “We can form our own Fund and use that money for the benefit of the cooperatives and their families,” said Leelasena.
