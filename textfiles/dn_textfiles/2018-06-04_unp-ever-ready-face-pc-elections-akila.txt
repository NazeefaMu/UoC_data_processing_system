UNP ever-ready to face PC elections: Akila

The UNP is prepared to face a Provincial Council Election at any moment, UNP General Secretary and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
He was responding to a question raised by a journalist after attending the opening ceremony of a new three storey building at the Balapitiya Revatha National School recently.
The building was put up under the ‘Nearest school the best school programme.
The Minister said the flaws in the new election system had drawn attention of many political parties, civil organisations and intellectuals.
The recent UNP Working Committee Meeting also discussed the election system. A party gaining a majority of votes was unable to set up a council administration as those amendments had to be brought to the election system to overcome the drawback.
The Provincial Council Elections should be held under the old system until the amendments were brought in and passed in Parliament.
