Abolishing SAITM the only solution: IUSF

The Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF) said yesterday that the only solution to resolve the issue concerning the Malabe private medical college was to abolish it.
IUSF members addressing the media in Colombo said that appointing various commissions to find solutions were futile.
They said that allowing the medical college to function will create numerous problems and also open the doors for other private medical colleges to come into the fray.
The IUSF said that the country’s political leaders should get involved in the matter and take immediate steps to abolish the private medical college and restore the credibility of medical education in Sri Lanka.
