Nearly 500 citizens in Aranayake lack NICs

There are nearly 500 persons without National Identity Cards (NICs), 150 persons without birth certificates, and nearly 50 married couples without valid marriage certificates living in the 61 divisions coming under the purview of the Aranayake Divisional Secretariat Division, Aranayake Divisional Secretary Z. A. M. Faisal said.
He was speaking to the media at a mobile service programme held at the Thalgaspitiya Muslim Maha Vidyalaya yesterday (21). The mobile service targetting three GS divisions, namely Thalgaspitiya Muslim Village, Thalgaspitiya Sinhala village, and Habalakkawa, was held to issue new identity cards, birth, and marriage certificates to residents who needed them.
Faisal said he hoped to conduct several other mobile service programmes to ensure that everyone in his division who needed legal documents such as NICs, marriage and birth certificates possessed them before January 1, next year. He said the majority of such needy people lived in the plantation areas in his division.
