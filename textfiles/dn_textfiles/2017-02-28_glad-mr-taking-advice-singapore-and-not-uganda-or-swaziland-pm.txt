Glad MR taking advice from Singapore and not Uganda or Swaziland: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said he was happy that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had switched to taking advice from Singapore and not from Uganda and Swaziland anymore.
“When I met the Singaporean Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs for dinner on my way back from Australia, the latter informed me that the former President was also there and was leaving Singapore that night”, the premier said as he addressed a gathering at the new premises of the Ministry of Rural Economic Affairs at 492, R.A.De Mel Mawatha.
“I hoped to meet him on the plane back but unfortunately he took the flight after me. I will tell him in Parliament,”the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister said that it was important for all to think differently and it was better for the former President too to change his way of thinking. “China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia,Indonesia and even Bangladesh changed the way they thought and acted over time and they are progressing. But, we are stuck here, even though the war has ended. This is because we have no national unity. But, we are building on that now,” he said.
