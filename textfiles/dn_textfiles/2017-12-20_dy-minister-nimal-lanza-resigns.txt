Dy Minister Nimal Lanza resigns

UPFA MP and Home Affairs Deputy Minister Nimal Lanza resigned from his ministerial portfolio yesterday.
The former Deputy Minister told the Daily News that the letter of resignation was sent to the Presidential Secretariat and also made the UPFA and SLFP secretaries aware.
He said he left the portfolio as there had been no economic management in the country for the last two years since the unity government took over.
He said he is always with the underprivileged people but he has no opportunity to help them. The government does not have a national program that helps the poor.
He added that today, there is a situation where the country cannot face the future.
