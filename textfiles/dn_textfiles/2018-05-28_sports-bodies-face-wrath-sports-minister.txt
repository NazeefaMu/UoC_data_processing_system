If they fail to submit audit reports
Sports bodies to face wrath of Sports Minister

A special media meeting was held on Saturday at the Duncan White Hall of the Sports Ministry by Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha on amendments to the National Sports Act to rectify areas which are controversial. Officials representing 64 sports associations and a large gathering were present.
Addressing the gathering the Minister said:
“We expect unity from sports. But when looking at the issues of sports associations unity is a problem. To my mind we hope to find unity, reconciliation and brotherhood through sports in any country. The rules and regulations of the Sports Act of 1973 confer great authority to the Minister of Sports. I have an issue with regard to this.
“The Minister approves the sports teams. The selectors are appointed by the Minister, and also there is a fund which the Minister can distribute at his discretion. It is necessary to arrive at a broad consensus in using these funds after discussions with sports associations.
“When I took over this Ministry I stated that I will appoint interim committees only if there are financial fraud. I have a problem why some associations have not submitted the financial statements as yet. Also reports too have not been submitted. The advice of the Auditor General has not been implemented in some cases. I have requested the Auditor General to be present today to give you all a clarification on audits.
“Further various sports associations have presented several issues with regard to administration and constitutions. Please give us your ideas. I am committed to doing the best for sport. I am ready to sacrifice my prerogative if you feel that is in the best interest of sports. I hold the position that the Sports Minister’s prerogative should be divested to a committee. I have observed that in some instances when appointing selectors some people come forward and say do not appoint such and such a person. The same is true when appointing teams. In some cases certain decisions have been taken. I have therefore appointed a legal committee.
“Six lawyers have volunteered to assist me free of charge. I will be obtaining the views of the public subsequent to obtaining the views of sports associations. I will give 14 days for this. This is a journey we have to go together. I am not ready to be a partisan. The Minister is accused of being partisan when elections to sports associations are due. This finger pointing is because the Minister has powers when it comes to appeals with regard to actions. The final decision with regard to elections rests with the Minister. “In other Ministries it is the Ministry Secretary who takes administrative decisions. The Minister is in charge of policy. There is a difference in the Sports Act and other Acts. The Chief Accounting Officer of other Ministries is the Secretary. According to the Sports Act the Minister can supersede the Secretary. We need to find a solution to this issue.
“I am taking this opportunity to obtain your views. There are some sports associations that have never submitted audited reports. As Minister I will be taking stern action regarding this. It is necessary to have an audited report to check on financial irregularities. There can be big financial problems in associations that do not audit their accounts. I have to state that if anyone sits as a chairman or official of an association and have not submitted the audited reports of the previous year then you have a legal obligation regarding any frauds or irregularities that had taken place. Do not say that you did not hold office previously.
“My view is that you are responsible for the Audited Reports of the previous year. Prior to taking up duties as chairman you should obtain the Audited Reports. Any Audit Report is linked to previous years. There cannot be a standalone audit report.”
