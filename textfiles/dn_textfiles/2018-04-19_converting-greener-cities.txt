Converting to greener cities

The world, in unison, is speaking of saving the environment. What is the role sustainable or green architecture plays in it? Archworld speaks to famous architect Murad Ismail for his viewpoint on the matter.
"In the past, there was no real issue about understanding the degradation of environment. The dwellings were smaller and their occupants accommodated to secure themselves from the environment. For instance, Sri Lankan architecture encouraged smaller windows and thicker walls to deal with the heat. “But it didn’t really matter because it was not mass scale production,” said Ismail.
“But over the years, with industrialization, the buildings became bigger and increased in number. Population increased and large scale land clearance took place. Then only was the environmental thought process was really researched into. So, the green building concept came up in favour of saving energy and correct use of material,” he elaborated.
So, at present, the carbon footprint is taken into consideration in architecture which is developed upon the minimal effect it has on the environment. “It’s not that we can totally eradicate but we are trying to minimize the adverse effect,” he said.
“With the damaging effects, we believe we have the ice-caps melting, the ozone layer damaged and the temperature increased, “I think there is a transformation in the world,” Ismail remarked. “With the industrialization and development, the amount of CO2 released into the environment has increased and we’re trying not to add to it. We’re trying to reduce what buildings, material manufacture or sustainability is going to negatively impact the environment. We will need the buildings, we will need the cities but we’re trying not to contribute too much to the disaster.”
“In the early days, when we were not worried too much about energy and technologically advanced material, we had very standardized material around the world so we used them to the best of our ability. It had all to do with how you keep the house warm in a cold climate, how to keep it cool in a warm climate and control light and ventilation,” explained Ismail. So, since the old days, architecture evolved on the usage of what we had in hand at that particular moment. Architecture evolved for the usage of mankind and as a necessity for use.
“Today, with the development and increase of population towards cities and the scarcity of land in cities, larger and more complicated buildings have evolved. Therefore, environmentally, one has to think of energy and material used. Today, we’re expanding as a necessity, but at the same time, we’re trying to minimize the use of energy – energy in form of electricity, of production of material, or of sustaining a material,” he said further.
There are 3 clear areas of being environmentally conscious:
Energy
Material such as e-glass, blocks heat and Ultra Violet rays but you can see through it without a problem. “Technology has gone further where we have solar panels – solar energy and automation systems where the usage is controlled. There’s a lot of technology that takes place which allows us to minimize energy wastage,” stated Ismail.
“We have alternate energy – how you design with material that is helped to save energy. And how to manipulate the design itself to save energy,” he said.
Sustainability
“The idea for me in environment friendly material choice is how much energy is used to produce a material and how much energy that material can give you within a period of time,” said Ismail. “Basically, if the energy put into making the material and sustaining it is more than what it can give you in terms of durability, then, I don’t think it’s environmentally friendly. For instance some eco-friendly hotels and resorts, using biodegradable material such as timber is made to last a prolonged period of time, there’s a lot of energy put in to sustain it,” he explained. Re-polishing, replacing while a lot of human energy and chemicals are used.
“Sometimes, replacing could be worth it,” he stated. “But put the timber in the wrong place, you have to keep looking after it. It’s like, you cannot take a soup in a paper bag,” he elaborated. “You’re not going to build a high-riser with sticks and stones and expect it to last a hundred years. Therefore, choice of material is really important.”
Direct green/ Chlorophyll count
There is a clear notion of the demolition of chlorophyll – trees, grass, the greenery – which is a breathing center, said Ismail. How we actually reproduce what we have demolished in order to build something is important.
“The idea is that, if you take a green plot of land to build a high-riser, we need to find a way to replace that amount or more on the building so the quantum of green is not disturbed by a city,” he explained.
This has now been used in East Asia (e.g. in Thailand), where they replace whatever ground they have taken up for the edifice– the amount of chlorophyll which produces oxygen within the day – on the building, itself.
“This can be done by creating vertical gardens, or planting on rooftop. We need greenery for many reasons. It is the breathing ground, the oxygen production. It is where fauna inhabits in flora and it produces food. And secondarily, it collects dust. We need that,” he stated.
In Sri Lanka, we’ve been really environment friendly since long years, remarked Ismail. “Our architecture has been simple – minimal use of material, sustainability minimal – because we were a poor nation. We have not destroyed our beaches. We have been using a lot of natural, reproduced material, for a long time,” he added.
But now we’re changing and going into cityscapes. And most environmental friendly buildings around the world talk about energy saving, automatizing of buildings and the material use.
If the material is brought from another part of the world, the amount of energy required for transportation and all other calculations must be taken into account. We, like other countries need to be careful how and where we get our material. We have to weigh the pros and cons. The best way to look at this is Environmental Economics.
When it’s unhealthy for the environment but necessary for the economy, we, today, can turn to the new subject around the world: Environmental Economics where you weigh the pros and cons and use the best solution to balance both needs.
It is important to learn green architecture and the correct way to practice the art. Reach beneath the outer layers and you will find a deeper foundation upon which it is built. There you can learn, realize and practice and protect the scarred nature, saving it for many generations to come.
