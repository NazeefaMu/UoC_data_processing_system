GMOA strike inconveniences patients

The token strike by the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday morning inconvenienced patients seeking treatment at government hospitals islandwide.
Some patients returned home while others sought treatment at private hospitals.
GMOA secretary Dr. Navin de Soysa said emergency cases were attended to during the strike conducted in protest of police attack on undergraduates on Thursday over the SAITM issue.
