ETCA talks in final stages’

A negotiating team from India was in Colombo this week to discuss the terms of the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA). The Indian delegation left Sri Lanka yesterday.
“The Indian team was here to negotiate the final stages of ETCA. The talks went well, and the two sides are in the process of finalising the agreement,”the Indian High Commission’s Secretary of Press, Information and Culture Niteen Yeola said. “These negotiations bring ETCA closer, but Yeola did not say when the agreement would be finalised, as both sides are still working to resolve some issues,” Yeola added.
