And now comes straight into your palm, Sri Lanka’s first mobile TV, comprising a variety of soothing line ups, that can be watched anytime, anywhere at your own convenience.
With the rapid hi-tech evolution taking place globally, the medium of entertainment is also changing. From films to television in the past, the medium has now switched to mobile devices – and Susila Mobile TV is Sri Lanka’s first entrant to this market.
Susila Productions Group – which is too well known for its evergreen hits like Doo Daruwo, Sathpurawesiyo, Yashorawaya, Nedeyo and others - headed by Ms. Sandya Mendis is ready to fall in line with this evolution. Backed by a wholesome track record exceeding three decades, Susila Mobile TV is honoured to launch Sri Lanka’s first ever mobile television which will allow you the luxury of watching your favourite television programmes assorted with content especially created for mobile phones.
This novel and hassle-free platform also comes as a stress buster because you need not stress out yourself to squeeze in time to watch peak time programmes.

Susila’s contribution to the country’s arts is almost unparalleled to this day, despite the lapse of nearly 35 years and its penchant for perfection is too well known.
Susila Group Chairperson Sandya Mendis says the new mobile TV platform was launched on March 7, opening a new and significant chapter in the country’s entertainment annals.
“Understanding and feeling the pulse-beat of the people and creating optimum market access to corporate clients have been the secret behind Susila’s success story. We are embarking on this new mission also with the aim of making life easy for the people living here and abroad and thus facilitating corporate clients to reach their desired markets. Our segments are exclusively made for mobile devices. So far people have been watching TV on mobile phones, but those content were not produced to suit mobile devices. We have created and produced all our content to suit the mobile screen. Earlier the entertainment that came to your sitting room has now come to your palm. It is people-friendly, user-friendly and also purse-friendly. Whether one is travelling to and from work on public transportation, relaxing at home or elsewhere, enjoying a hotel stay, waiting to board a flight or waiting to pick up your children from school or tuition classes, you now have full control of how, when and where to watch TV. The segments range from tele dramas, studio comedy, fashion, beauty, business and multi religious thoughts to reality shows like viral queen contest, short film contests and youth talent,” Ms. Mendis said adding that viewers could interact with the channel and share content on the social media with ease.
The company had carried out extensive research for more than three years before launching this momentous technology. The monthly subscription is as low as be Rs. 100 a month (around Rs. 3 a day) and there is easy access for payment modes too. Even millions of people living overseas can access this TV channel by paying through EZ cash. We are part of Dialog VIU too yet it is an independent platform, where people using any smart phone connection by any mobile service provider can have easy access to Susila Mobile TV.
“Backed by Susila’s credibility factor, we have introduced latest techno-savvy features which have been simplified so much so that any ordinary person could operate it with no hassle. The unique software technology can generate high quality audio and video output even if you are not within 4G range in rural areas. All content in this channel will be intact for one month and users will have the option to go back and choose any programme they want within 30 days. This is a noteworthy advantage for TV viewers as well as for the sponsors of the programmes,” Ms. Mendis said.
The programme line up will also have live streaming in the near future. This is not an ordinary app but a unique TV channel made exclusively for mobile phones with an average duration of 7 minutes per programme. Recent popular Tamil films (also edited to suit mobile screens) will also be telecast in 15-minute segments with sub titles. This platform will also have sub titling features, which means that one watching Sinhala programmes could opt for English sub titles if he or she wishes, just at the press of a button.
