Metaphor unspoken

The royal banquet is in full swing. A bird of ill omen suddenly smashes the merriments into smithereens. A sense of gloom reigns as the messenger lays bare the bad news before the king. Before long, the king has to take a decision in the face of the siege. Despite the protest from his own kith and kin, the king sets out.
The country is at war!
Over a few days, a triumphant king returns to the palace only to come upon a courtesan en route. She tells a tale that involves the chief minister and the queen consort. Driven by overwhelming antagonism, the monarch orders the execution of both the chief minister and the queen. No inquiry, at all? No, he threw all that caution to the wind. This earned the ire of the deities, and the capital was plagued with three kinds of evil: famine, epidemic and the non-human peril. The whole city was all locked up in an inexpressible darkness until a congregation of saffron-robed saints crosses the threshold to instil serenity.
That tale unfolded elaborately at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre before a distinguished spectacle under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena just a few days ago. Packed with essential oils of modernization, Professor Ariyaratne Kaluarachchi’s newest ballet effort, ‘Tri Horror’, tingled the millennia-old wisdom. Professor Kaluarachchi has crammed every traditional element possible into this refreshingly modern ballet. If you had (or will have) a chance to watch this ballet, it would definitely have left you tingling for a while. The tingle factor is the thing. How could Professor Kaluarachchi, a busybody in the highest echelons of the University of Visual and Performing Arts administration, achieve that end?
“I committed my weekends completely to work on this. If not for the support of the team, I would not have been able to make this a reality.” Kaluarachchi belongs to the privileged clan of artists. He has an electrified career of working under (and with) the veterans such as Chitrasena and Sarachchandra. Their legacy left enough space for the likes of Kaluarachchi to explore their own inner heights. “The Sri Lankan audience is yet to be familiar with the art of ballet. Even in a developed western country, it will be difficult to understand the narrative completely with the body expressions,” Professor Kaluarachchi notes. The tale was spilt out in brief before the ballet opened the curtain. An obedient student of Chitrasena of Karadiya fame, Kaluarachchi, however, opted to move a few steps beyond his mentor.
Queer classic
A ballet, without a single verbal expression, will remain resolutely enigmatic. Yet, it will reach the modern audience as a queer classic crammed with memorable body expressions and other essential ingredients such as background sets, which syringe a scarlet marvel to the production.
Sri Lanka’s ballets – or dance dramas, as it is known in the vernacular – have banked on body expression with heightened concentration on facial emotions. Professor Kaluarachchi chose to combine this stimulation with other dynamics.
“Instead of using words, ballet dancers use their bodies and movements to relate the narrative. A ballet dancer requires a variety of facial expressions for that. The ballet artists are creatively charged to safeguard the expressions without distorting it. During Chitrasena’s time, we did not have a theatre like Nelum Pokuna. At the Lionel Wendt you cannot perform a substantial feat,” Professor Kaluarachchi elaborated.
Professor Ariyaratne Athugala shouldered a similar feat titled as ‘Maha Samayama’. Beyond the semblance of their first names, both academics have used their artistic prowess to create an archway that opens into the traditional a grand courtyard of ancient wisdom. But will the Sri Lankan audience be able to breathe in the fullness of the experience? Kaluarachchi toys with doubts, because a major portion of the spectacle consists of self-chosen couch potatoes. A simple soap tale will suffice for that audience. That audience has to change. And they will transform, Professor Kaluarachchi keeps his fingers crossed, into an intellectual audience capable of grasping the visceral storytelling.
Professor Kaluarachchi roamed every nook and corner of the Nelum Pokuna to heighten the theatric effect of the production.
Breathtaking scenes
To make the demonic forces slide down to the hell, chief minister indulging in some royal luxury on the second floor of the palace and many other breathtaking scenes turned out to be no challenge at all.
Kaluarachchi also employed the stilt-men of the local peraheras to launch a surreal effect in the production. “We need to revive the traditional arts to enter the modern arts. When we visit other countries, we can see how far these arts like ballet have gone. We have a rich tradition influenced by the orient as well as the occident. We have a lineage with Chitrasena and Premakumara Epitawela reigning in the industry.”
Kaluarachchi’s message is clear. We need not worry too much about our local culture and lore. We need to reach for a super-imposed echelon, where the orient and occident converge. Go, watch it the next time ‘Tri Horrors’ comes to town. That will place you in more familiar terms with Ariyaratne Kaluarachchi. Even better, you will discern how Sri Lanka shall evolve with the ballet and the similar art of delicate intellect.
