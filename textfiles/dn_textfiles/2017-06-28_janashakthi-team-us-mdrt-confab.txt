Janashakthi team in US for MDRT confab

Janashakthi Insurance PLC announced that Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) qualifiers from its Life Insurance Sales team had attended the prestigious MDRT Conference that was held in Florida, USA, recently.
Founded in 1927, the Million Dollar Round Table, The Premier Association of Financial Professionals, is a global, independent association of more than 43,000 of the world's leading Life Insurance and Financial Services professionals from more than 500 companies in 67 countries.
Surpassing the record numbers it had set in 2016, Janashakthi Insurance recorded its largest ever contingent of MDRT qualifiers in 2017. The MDRT membership is recognized internationally as the standard of excellence in the Life Insurance and Financial Services business.
MDRT members, therefore, are perceived as individuals who demonstrate exceptional professional knowledge, strict ethical conduct and outstanding client service. The 18 MDRT qualifiers from Janashakthi were selected based on their performance in 2016 as well as their overall adherence to the association’s strict ethical standards.
Significantly, Ruwan Kumara from Janashakthi’s Hatton branch was awarded the MDRT Life Membership for having qualified for MDRT membership 13 years in a row whilst Sadun Jayawardhane from the Havelock branch was accorded the MDRT’s Court of the Table membership.
“At Janashakthi, we strongly believe that our team of world-class insurance professionals are the primary drivers of our steady growth over the years.
We have been conscious of this right from our inception and, hence, have always focused on nurturing their talent through continued investments in their learning and development,” said Stuart Chapman, CEO/Director, Janashakthi Insurance PLC.
“Therefore, we are delighted to see even more members of our team qualify for the coveted Million Dollar Round Table membership this year. This is yet another testament of their commitment towards helping us realize our vision of lighting the lamp of Insurance in every home and work place.”
The team from Janashakthi had the opportunity to be inspired by some of the world’s best minds in the insurance sector at the MDRT Conference.
