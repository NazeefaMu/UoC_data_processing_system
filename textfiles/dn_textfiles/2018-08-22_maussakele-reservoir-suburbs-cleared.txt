Maussakele reservoir, suburbs cleared

A Sramadana was held to collect non-biodegradable garbage in the Maussakele reservoir in Maskeliya on Monday.
Nearly tonnes of garbage were dumped in and around the Maussakele reservoir by people and shopkeepers in Maskeliya, Samimale, Nallathanni and by visitors of the Sri Pada.
Maskeliya Oya, Seethagangula Oya and Gardmore Oya carry the garbage to the reservoir.
Ceylon Electricity Board Maussakele Security Division officials, Maussakele Army Camp officials, Navy personnel and Maskeliya police assisted by the people who fish in the Maussakele Reservoir cleaned the area where the garbage gathered in the reservoir near the Mohini Ella and Seethagangula Oya.
The collected garbage will be handed over to the Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha Health Division, the organisers said.
Laxapana Power Plant Complex Deputy General Manager D. G. S. Gunasekara said the reservoir is very important for the national hydro power plant system. The garbage dumped in the reservoir obstruct its power generatiom. He said the people in the area are under a major health hazard since they drink water in the reservoir. He said it will affect aquatic life in the reservoir as well.
