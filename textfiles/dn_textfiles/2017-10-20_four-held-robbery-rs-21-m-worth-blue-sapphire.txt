Four held for  robbery of  Rs. 21 m  worth blue sapphire

Four suspects were taken into custody by the Police for the robbery of a blue sapphire gemstone valued at Rs. 21 million.
Police Media Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said a businessman from Beruwala has given the blue sapphire gemstone to a private company in Colpetty for cutting and polishing. The businessman has gone abroad afterwards and the company had informed him to say that the gem had gone missing.
He had returned to the country and lodged a complaint with the Police in this regard.
Meanwhile, the businessman had received a tip-off saying that the gem was in the Trincomalee area. He had called the IGP and informed him of the tip-off. The IGP had handed over the investigation to the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID).
A team of Police officers in the guise of gem dealers had gone to meet the suspects in the area. Three suspects had initially shown them a fake stone. However, later they were apprehended when they showed the real stone.
It was revealed that a son-in-law of one of the suspects who was employed as a painter at the Colpetty gem institute had stolen the gem. The suspect was arrested by the Police later.
All suspects were produced before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate and remanded until October 20.
