In search of healthy wealth

The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), is an advocate of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) for all. They have joined hands with the Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka (FPASL) of Sri Lanka to tackle a host of problems ranging from unwanted pregnancies, teen pregnancies unsafe illegal abortions, rape, incest, women’s access to secure livelihoods and economic resources and HIV/AIDS
Director General of IPPF, Dr. Alvaro Bermejo was in Sri Lanka recently and met multiple stakeholders from the government, Civil Society, Healthcare delivery system and community leaders to discuss IPPF’s commitment towards strengthening healthcare delivery in Sri Lanka.
Daily News met up with Dr. Bermejo at a Media Interaction where he discussed some of the key issues that IPPF is tackling such as new technologies related to HIV and how we need to adjust to developments in the 21st century.
In March this year the National STD/AIDS Control Program of the Ministry of Health, which spearheads the national response to HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka, said that the country is at the verge of successfully eliminating mother to child transmission of HIV. Also Sri Lanka continues to have very low HIV prevalence.
“I am coming to the end of my trip to Sri Lanka. I was appointed only six months ago and I came to Sri Lanka because I wanted to visit countries that were successful in family planning. I also want to visit countries that have done well in HIV prevention. So I want to visit countries with family planning associations who have played an important role in achieving them. And there is no doubt that Sri Lanka is a country that has done well in family planning. Sri Lanka came in top of the list for this region and it is the first country that I have visited in Asia,” said Dr. Bermejo.
Dr. Bermejo pointed out that though Sri Lanka still faces many challenges overall, it is doing well in family planning compared to others in the region and others outside of the region.
“It is commendable that Sri Lanka has kept HIV prevention low. And it is happening during a transition period for Sri Lanka, as the island becomes an upper middle income economy. So I have been visiting the delivery sites of FPASL, the HIV prevention work that is being done, and talking to the government officials that FPASL works with, as well as visiting pharmacies. I do all of this because I feel Sri Lanka has been ‘shy’ as a country to show their success internationally. A lot of us can learn from what has been done in Sri Lanka. I want to be a part of supporting Sri Lanka to do that. Now Sri Lanka has joined the international community in the family planning 2020 partnership. Now a large new generation of young girls are becoming sexually active at a reproductive age, and we must think how we can cater to them who are different in their approach to the world. How do we try to understand them? So that has been a really interesting debate. And I have learnt a lot from Sri Lanka,” said Dr. Bermejo.
UNAIDS’ targets are for 90 percent of people with HIV to be diagnosed, 90 percent of diagnosed people to be taking treatment, and 90 percent of people on treatment to have a fully suppressed viral load. Achieving these targets will greatly reduce the spread of HIV.
Dr. Bermejo pointed out, that in his visit to Sri Lanka, he has had a discussion with the Director of the National AIDS control program.
“So we discussed the 90-90-90 target and the challenges that we face in reaching it. So we spoke about identifying 90 percent of those living with HIV by 2020. And so that 90 percent will be accessing treatment, and those that are accessing treatment, 90 percent will be immune suppressed so they will not be able to transmit the disease. That was the target that has been set internationally, and from the discussion we had, we understood that Sri Lanka is not going to meet that target. It is going to fall short. We were discussing as to why Sri Lanka is going to fall short? The reality of Sri Lanka is that it is doing well once the person is diagnosed with HIV and linked to care. That person stays in care and complies very well with treatment and reaches immune suppression and does not transmit the disease to others. But the problem is we are not able to diagnose many of those who are living with HIV. We are not reaching them or they are not reaching the health system. So we were discussing what we could do about that,” explained Dr. Bermejo.
How can FPASL reach out to some key populations that are not being reached? – particularly men who have sex with men and do not identify as gay.
“We were also discussing other technologies that are not being registered here that could be helpful. For example HIV self –testing. There is technology with which you can test yourself from the privacy of your own home. In 20 minutes you get results. That is not yet available here in Sri Lanka. It is still commercially expensive. But it could be brought down to a lower price. That was one discussion,” pointed out Dr. Bermejo.
Bermejo also pointed out that he had had a discussion with the Director of the Family Health Bureau. (FHB)
“I congratulated the Director for bringing Sri Lanka into the Family planning 2020 partnership. We were talking about the challenges of young women who are not accessing services and how we have a big cohort of young women who are about to reach reproductive age, and become sexually active, and we don’t really know a lot yet. We do not know a lot about their health care seeking behavior. These girls come to the clinics the way the older generation came to the clinics or maybe not. How will they express their sexuality?
What other countries have shown is that these girls and boys tend to be adopters of new technologies. They have phones that can access internet that brings good and bad possibilities. It provides lots of new information and new options, and we need to adjust to that because these girls will self- diagnose and self- medicate. That is the reality in many countries. In HIV self- testing, Adolescents are the first ones who don’t want to go to the clinic and talk about having had sex and needing to test. And if they can find tests available on the internet they can manage to get someone to buy that for them. And then they will test. If they can access emergency contraception on the internet, that is what they will do. So how can we adjust our services to this new reality which is there? So we need to make sure that they access information that is correct and information that is safe and products that are correct and safe rather than going the wrong way,” explained Bermejo.
Touching on nutrition for children, Bermejo commented that the problem of mothers who are young and underweight is still a serious problem, as they deliver very low birth weight babies.
“These children never manage to catch up. We financed several studies that show that these babies, not only do they not catch up in weight. They do not catch up in cognitive development and they don’t catch up in economic development. In a study we have financed for twenty years, we find their income is lower than others. It is a multi- country study that was also done in India. What can we do to prevent this vicious circle, because these babies become underweight girls? It is very clear that the first 1000 days are key. Pregnancy and the first two years is what matters. So early intervention is necessary to impact those babies and those toddlers. We need to be able to reach them.
The most exciting program is about cash transfers. For family planning, my personal view is that if you trust the mothers they usually make the right decision. Most of the time. A lot of the studies we have done in India and other countries, is that about 50 percent of the income will be used – if you tell the mother, this is income you are getting because of your new born baby to make sure that it does not become under -weight or stunted, the mother will spend at least 50 percent of that income in nutritious food for the baby. With the mothers having bank accounts you can make sure the money gets to the mothers,” explained Bermejo.
