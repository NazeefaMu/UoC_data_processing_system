Protest march against drug abuse

A protest march against drug abuse organized by the Roman Catholic clergy with the participation of the religious brothers and sisters in Negombo under the guidance and direction of Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm, Cardinal Ranjith, with the Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo, Rt. Rev. Dr. Maxwell Silva, drew great crowds to the city last evening. The peaceful march started from the Maris Stella College grounds and assembled at Green’s Park, from where the Archbishop addressed the people along with Ven. Sumanaratane Thera, Maulavi Abdullah Abdul Rahim and Kurukkal Rajendren. In his speech, the Archbishop pledged that he will take the leadership against all forms of drugs that have been made available to the school children and the youth in Negombo.
