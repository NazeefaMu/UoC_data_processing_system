NBRO provides cash donations to late GN's children

The National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) provided a donation of Rs. 100,000 to the children of former Tallangalla Grama Niladhari (GN) late M. P. Kapilarathne in Thawalama, Galle, for their educational expenses.
Former Grama Niladhari Kapilarathna lost his life while engaging in official relief work for people who were affected by floods and landslides that occurred in the Galle district, last year.
The donation was made at a brief function held at the Galle District Secretariat, with the participation of Canadian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka David McKinnon on the invitation of Galle District Secretary S. T. Kodikara.
