Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe should have been retained: Tissa

Former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake said the period his stars were in transit is slowly coming to an end. He said he would not describe the removal of Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from his ministerial positions as a right decision.
He could have been retained after getting him to correct his wrongs. The UNP and the Government as a whole had been inconvenienced due to this development which may even lead to a political upheaval, he added.
He was addressing the gathering at a ceremony held at the Sri Weluvanarama Saddhatissa Pirivena to commemorate the 10th death anniversary of its former Parivenadhipati Ven. Karamada Ariyatissa Thera, recently. Attanayake said Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had rendered a great service in support of UNP leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and party supporters since 2007. Attanayake added, in his capacity as UNP General Secretary, his sole endeavour was to bring a UNP government into power as it was relegated to the opposition for 23 years.
Today, nearly 60,000 UNP supporters who had suffered political victimisation by past governments were still lingering without any form of compensation as the Government had failed to fulfil their expectations.
The most important thing the UNP ought to do today was to build a strong leadership which could face the Presidential Election in 2019.
UNP supporters were still suffering because the party had failed to form a government of its own so far.
He said the Government had today forgotten the rural masses which supported it. Attanayake said he will enter politics once again at the tune of a future national election. Nutrition food packs and equipment were distributed among a group of 100 expectant mothers at this ceremony.
