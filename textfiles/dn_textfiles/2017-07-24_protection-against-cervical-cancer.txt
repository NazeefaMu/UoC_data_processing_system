Protection against cervical cancer

Dr. Deepa Gamage attached to the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry speaks to Health Watch about the vaccine against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) introduced by the Government recently. The vaccine is now included in the National Immunization Programme and is injected to all school girls starting from grade six in order to reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer in them in the future.
Q: What is Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) ?
A - Human Papilloma Virus has different sub types called geno types (more than 100 types). Each HPV virus geno type is identified by a number. This is a common virus which can stay in surfaces such as skin and mucous membranes (e.g. oral and genital tract surfaces). But the virus, just by staying on surfaces will not cause any signs and symptoms externally to identify whether virus is on the surface or not. It does not actually cause an acute illness and even sometimes it can spontaneously disappear due to various reasons.
Q:How does it spread and affect women ?
A: Some geno types of the virus are dangerous. Even though they do not cause acute illnesses or disease to the person just by staying, it tends to stay long without disappearing (harbouring surfaces) and gradually causes cellular changes in specific areas in the body, which later transform into cancer cells or into non-cancerous cell growths resulting in warts. The interval between the acquisition of HPV infection and progression to advanced stages of cervical cancer is usually about 10 years or longer. It has been identified that 99 percent of cervical cancers are due to any of these types of the Human Papilloma viruses. Out of these different types, type 16 and type 18 are the most cancerous types causes 70 percent of cervical cancers.
Q: How can we diagnose cervical cancer ?
A: Cervical cancer is usually identified very late because cancer develops inside the body and signs and symptoms develop very late. By the time a woman gets signs and symptoms, the cancer is usually spread beyond the cervix to the womb, tissues and organs outside, around the womb and even to other organs in the body.
Cervical early cancer is detected by screening for cervical cancer. Different methods are available to detect cervical cancer early before being spread to other organs. These HPV-induced changes in the cervical epithelium can be detected early by HPV DNA tests, cervical cell cytology testing, and visual inspection with acetic acid or by using Lugols Iodine. Cervical cancer screening is focused on early detection of cases and timely treatment. It is recommended for females in 21 - 65 age group and screening to be performed in every 3 to 5 years period.
Pap smear screening programme is focused on early detection of cases and timely treatment. It is recommended for females in age 21 to 65 groups and screening to be performed in every 3 to 5 years period. Pap smear screening programme in Sri Lanka is in place for the last two decades and all women at the age of 35 years (or above) are offered at least one time screening at the well women clinics conducted by Medical Officers of Health.
Even though cervical cancer early detection is available for women, nearly 850 to 1000 women in each year are still presented to hospitals with advanced stages of cervical cancer. The majority of these patients remain with complications and nearly half of them die due to cervical cancer. Cervical cancer cases in Sri Lanka tend to increase from 29 to 30 years and the majority is in 45 to 55 year age group according to the Cancer Control Programme data.
Q: How can we prevent cervical cancer ?
A: The cervical cancer preventive vaccine gives the protection for these cervical cancer causing high risk geno types of 16 and 18 and prevents development of cervical cancer due to these geno types in the future when they become adult women. However, it has been identified that there is a protection for other cervical cancer causing types also by giving this vaccine through cross protection for other geno types.
This vaccine needs to be given at the optimal age which enables to develop protective immunity and before exposure to cancer causing HPV geno types. In fact, HPV vaccine is recommended to be given to girls ideally between 9 and13 years as two (2) doses. Cervical cancer screening in older women will be continuing and required even though the HPV vaccine is given to girls.
Q: How is the HPV vaccine given?
A: HPV vaccine is given through National Immunization Programme from July 2017. It will be given through the school based vaccination programme. All girls in Grade six are given the HPV vaccination on completion of 10 years of age. Two doses of the vaccine need to be given for complete protection of the vaccine preventable cervical cancer proportion of cervical cancers (caused by cancer causing genotypes 16 and 18). Minimum interval (gap) between two doses of the HPV vaccine should be six months.
HPV vaccine is a very safe vaccine and mild common local reactions (such as pain and redness) can be experienced as for any other vaccination. Severe side effects are very rare and other country experiences shows no severe adverse events.
HPV vaccination was available in Sri Lanka in the private sector since 2010. There are two types of HPV vaccines called Bivalent HPV vaccine (which contained HPV geno types 16 and 18) and Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (which contained HPV geno types 16, 18 and 6, 11) . Both types give the same protection against cervical cancer while Quadrivalent HPV vaccine gives an additional protection for HPV related genital warts. Bivalent HPV vaccine was registered and available to use in in Sri Lanka since2010 and Quadrivalent HPV vaccine was registered and available to use in Sri Lanka since in 2012 in the private sector.
Quadrivalent HPV vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer is available free to the child since July 2017 and vaccination is provided through school based programme to Grade six girls.
