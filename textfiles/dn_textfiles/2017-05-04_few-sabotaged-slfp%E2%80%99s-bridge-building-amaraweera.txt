A few sabotaged SLFP’s bridge-building: Amaraweera

Efforts were taken to unite the SLFP and the Joint Opposition with the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena, but a few persons having links with the UNP sabotaged it, UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the SLFP plans to win the 2020 election. The best option is to work together, he said.
Amaraweera said the SLFP can win 2020 election alone. It was proved after the May Day rally.
"We did not remove SLFP organisers who worked hard for the party. We appointed new organisers to the party," he said.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said the SLFP commenced a clean journey on May 1. President Sirisena will launch a programme to further strengthen the party, he said.
Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said the SLFP got rid of its racist face. A large number of Tamil and Muslim people took part in the SLFP May Day rally this year, he said.
