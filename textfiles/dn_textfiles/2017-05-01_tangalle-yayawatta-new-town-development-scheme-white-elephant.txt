Tangalle Yayawatta  new town development scheme, a white elephant

 The TangalleYayawatta new town development scheme has come to a standstill and proved to be a white elephant by now.
TheYayawatta was to be converted to the next developed town in Tangalle DS area and a shopping complex was setup to be rented out to the business community in the area. At the initial stage, several retail outlets were opened at the shopping complex.They remain closed due to lack of customers.
The location is now haunted by thugs and night stalkers.
The complex was set up in 2008 under the Southern Region Rural Economic Development Programme.
