Sri Lanka cricket team arrives in Kolkata

The Sri Lanka cricket team led by Dinesh Chandimal arrived today for their six-week tour of India, which starts here with the first of the three-Test series, beginning on November 16.
Sri Lanka will play three Tests, three ODIs and three T20 Internationals against Virat Kohli’s Indian cricket team.
The 15-member squad will hit the nets from tomorrow ahead of their two-day practice game against a third-string Board President’s XI at the JU (2nd Campus ground), starting November 11.
“They will take rest today and hit the nets tomorrow afternoon,” the local manager added.
The team however arrived without their newly appointed batting coach Thilan Samaraweera who didn’t get his visa on time to fly with the team.
Sri Lanka cricket sources said that Samaraweera would join the team shortly ahead of the Test match.
The last time Sri Lanka played Test matches in India was seven years back in 2009, a three-match series that they lost 0-2. Earlier this year, India beat Sri Lanka 3-0 in Tests followed by clean sweep in ODIs and lone T20 International.
The islanders had a better showing against Pakistan, winning the away Test series in UAE 2-0.
But in the ODI and T20 series’ that followed they were routed 0-5 by Pakistan. - PTI
