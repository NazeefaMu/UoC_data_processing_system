It was his calling…

Chrisantha de Silva’s talent enabled him to win TNL Onstage 2007 and initially he had these great musical ideas and lyrics. But right throughout, he envisioned a band. Salvage was a kind of calling.
They are a group of people connecting on stage and delivering lyrics full of power and energy. They are a group of people who are vessels of music forming a super vessel. They are a great beast on stage. Melodies spoke to De Silva and found out how successful and forceful this super vessel is.
“As with most good things in my life, Salvage was born out of necessity. Back in 2009, I needed a creative vessel for my musical ideas and lyrics. I had already been a part of a few projects and even tried performing solo, winning TNL Onstage 2007. But after a while I was back in limbo, when a guitarist called James Mather reached out to me after hearing my vocals on another track. And we met up to jam several times and work on some original Rock n Roll. I still remember taking a song I wrote, ‘Follow You Home’, to James, and how it came out completely different from what I had in mind, but still loving the final composition. We performed as Salvage in 2009 at a mini outdoor concert called ‘No Handlebars’ with a few session musicians,” said De Silva.
Not long after this, James had to migrate to Canada, and the current rhythm Guitarist Sajana Bupathi and De Silva went through a long list of line- up changes before they arrived at the current line- up, which is the most cohesive and explosive one yet. The beast or the super vessel was complete. Then it was a matter of unleashing the talent and power of the band.
“We operate within the Rock n Roll spectrum. I hate to specify a sub- genre, because our songs range from Acoustic, Alternative to Hard & Progressive Rock. I am proud about this. Diversity always keeps it interesting for us and our fans,” explained De Silva.
De Silva stated that inspiration finds them. It can come from the most unexpected sources. With the kind of brains and diversity they have in the band, one can could guess that the lyrics are highly creative.
“Every human is a creative being and will express ideas in unique ways. I’ve chosen lyrics, melodies and singing to do so. What I’m trying to say is, inspiration can come from anything, from a personal emotion to a catchy guitar riff to the tale of a forbidden apple. Recently I’ve written quite a bit from a story telling aspect for a very cool project we are cooking up soon,” pointed out De Silva.
Composing the music and then performing in front of a live audience and seeing the crowd appreciate the music has made De Silva’s dream come true. They have a vessel that is irresistible. The vessel is a juggernaut.
“Truthfully, composing, performing and having people connect and respond to our music gives us purpose. For me, it is also therapeutic. Rock n Roll especially is a very passionate and sometimes aggressive form of music. It is a release to sing and play this music. It is also very hard to explain on paper. Come see a show,” explained De Silva.
When it comes to fellow artistes, De Silva instantly connected to those who can make life interesting for him. If they can awaken something within him then he instantly focuses on them.
“I love any artist who can alter how I’m feeling. Music is like medicine, not only in the sense that it heals, but you respond to a song depending on what you are going through or how you are feeling. Timing is important. My friends would attest to the fact that I have some unusual tastes in artists. I recently discovered Regina Spektor and absolutely love her. My everyday playlists however include bands like Alter Bridge, Shine Down, Live and GnR,” added De Silva.
The band has big plans. With the talent they have how could they not have big plans? They are always looking at the next big gig. They are always looking forwards. They are positive thinking and they are looking to grow bigger and bigger.
“We have some exciting things lined up over the next two years: a couple of music videos, live album and even a hybrid-theatre production. Other than that, a dream of mine is to play at a major Rock n Roll festival. Lollapalooza/ Download Festival anyone?” said De Silva.
De Silva correctly points out that they have a lot to be grateful for when it comes to success. They have a loyal following and though they have achieved a lot, they can’t lose sight, for their fans have made them. They are blessed to have a following. No band is really self- made. Fame is fickle friend. The music industry is controlled by the audience.
“The list is extensive. But really, I want to thank everyone who has come to see Salvage play. This is from the bottom of my heart. Our families have been a blessing to us. I am not sure how success is measured for a Sri Lankan, English Rock n Roll band. But persistence is key. Our music and lyrical themes tend to be uplifting,” explained De Silva.
De Silva has message to anyone who wants to take up music. You need to be authentic and original. Don’t let anyone prune your mind. At the end of the day you want your audience to love you and not your idol.
“That’s a serious question. I won’t recommend full time music to anyone who is making original music in Sri Lanka. But this what we need more to make a mark on the international charts. Finding your artistry is an excruciating process. It is however worth it. Idols are good, but remember you are (fortunately) not your idol. Be yourself, in every sense of the word. Work overtime on perfecting your skills. Perform as much as possible. For practicalities sake, don’t give up your day job. It will put food on the table and inspire the artist in you to create,” summed up De Silva.
