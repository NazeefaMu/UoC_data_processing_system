Principal’s FR against Uva CM fixed for support

A Fundamental Rights petition filed by the Principal of Badulla Tamil Girls’ Maha Vidyalaya was yesterday fixed for support by the Supreme Court.
This is with regard to the incident where the Principal was allegedly compelled to kneel and worship Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake.
Through the petition, the petitioner seeks a declaration that her Fundamental Rights were violated by the Chief Minister and provincial educational authorities.
Meanwhile, the Attorney General yesterday informed the Supreme Court that the Attorney would only appear on behalf of the Attorney General but not for other respondent parties including the Uva Provincial Council Chief Minister. The Supreme Court Bench comprised Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice L. T. B. Dehideniya.
The petitioner Bavanie Raguath cited Uva Province Chief Minister Dasanayake, Uva Provincial Secretary of Education Ministry, Uva Provincial Director of Education and five others as respondents.
The petitioner stated that on January 2, she received a letter written by a parent to the Uva Chief Minister seeking the Chief Minister’s recommendation to get his daughter admitted to the Badulla Tamil Girls’ Maha Vidyalaya. The petitioner stated that she was unable to accommodate the aforesaid request since it was contrary to the circulars. The petitioner further said on January 3, she received two telephone calls from the Secretary to the Ministry of Education Uva Province, requesting her to attend the Provincial Council Office.
The petitioner stated that the Chief Minister made several impolite, rude comments and inquired about a party thrown for the governor of Uva Province which is merely an allegation tainted with malice.
The petitioner further stated that to get herself excused from the aforesaid terrorizing and traumatizing situation, she was compelled to kneel down and worship the Chief Minister and pleaded that she is ‘very sorry for any wrong doing from her side’.
The petitioner stated that she is still not in receipt of any favorable response to date.
This petition was filed through Counsel Sunil Watagala.
