Pumpkin Pie with Chocolate Crust
Makes 1 (10 inch) pie
Give the chocolate lovers in your life a treat by making this pumpkin pie. Sugar and cocoa are added to a basic pastry dough, giving an unexpected surprise to your pie.
For the chocolate pie crust: 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder ¼ cup granulated sugar 1 pinch salt 6 ounces unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes, plus more for greasing ½ cup brewed coffee, cold For the filling: ¾ cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for dusting ½ teaspoon salt ½ teaspoon ground ginger ¼ teaspoon ground cloves 2 large eggs
1 can (15 oz.) canned pumpkin 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 can (12 fl. oz.) evaporated milk Sweetened whipped cream (optional) Make the chocolate pie crust:
Combine flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl; whisk to incorporate.
Add the butter, then using your fingertips or a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse meal.
Add the cold coffee in thirds, stirring after each addition. Continue stirring until a soft dough has formed. Gather with your hands and knead, then form into a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes (or up to two days).
Remove dough from refrigerator and let rest for 5 minutes. Grease and flour a 10-inch tart pan. Roll dough on a floured surface and transfer to 10-inch tart pan. Press dough into pan, trimming crust overhang. Return to refrigerator to chill for 20 minutes before baking.
Make the filling: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Combine sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger and cloves in a small bowl. Beat eggs in large bowl. Stir in pumpkin, vanilla extract, and sugar-spice mixture. Gradually stir in evaporated milk.
Pour the filling into the prepared pie crust and bake for 50-60 minutes, until the center is set. Place the pie on a wire rack and cool to room temperature. Top pie with whipped cream if desired and dust with cinnamon before serving.
