Maldives lifts state of emergency

The Maldives government announced on Tuesday an end to a state of emergency, which was imposed last week after an alleged attempt to assassinate President Abdulla Yameen.
 
“Maldives lifts State of Emergency with immediate effect,” the foreign ministry said on Twitter.
 
“Pleased that this matter has been dealt with so swiftly. Country back on a more normal footing,” foreign minister Dunya Maumoon said in a separate post.
 
Yameen imposed the state of emergency last on Wednesday in a move that gave wider powers to police and armed forces to arrest and suspending freedom of assembly and movement.
 
The Maldives, a popular destination for honeymooners, has been rocked by political unrest in recent months, which reached new heights last week when vice president Ahmed Adeeb was impeached.
 
Adeeb, whose predecessor was also impeached in July, has been accused of high treason over an explosion on the presidential speedboat in September that left Yameen unhurt but injured his wife and one of his bodyguards.
