Four themes, different styles

“Beyond the Water Margin” exhibition is held with the participation of four artists, representing four eras in Sri Lankan water colour art: Gunasiri Colambage, Basil Cooray, Sanjeewee Senevirathna and Nilusha Weerakkody. The four professional artists are exhibiting 80 paintings in the exhibition in four different styles and four themes. The exhibition will commence at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery on August 18 at 6 pm. It will be held on August 19, 20 and 21.
Art pieces are being created by the artists’ intellect, imagination, experiments, professional experience and consciousness, who indulge in creative work for their own independent and honest goals solely and collectively. That is not an unconcious copying by pouring some matter into a block. It is a broad, complicated and sensitive process. And it is not an artificial and impatient or a strained product. We believe that the “ART” is a social process of digesting of touching existing social and cultural mechanisms in a most authentic way by a community with a broad app reciation.
“Beyond the Water Margin” is a creative effort of a four water colour artists who united for the necessity of a collective creative approach and united by professionalism and self - satisfaction for the broadness of mutual understanding, the maturity of attitudes, collectiveness and the unity of diversity. It stands as a visual communication of satisfied self - expression as well.
