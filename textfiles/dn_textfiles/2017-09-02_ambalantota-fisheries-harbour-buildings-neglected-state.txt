Ambalantota fisheries harbour buildings in neglected state

Many buildings at the Welipatanwila Ambalantota fisheries harbour remain overgrown with shrub jungles. Among such buildings are resting places of fisherfolk and the storage where fishing gear were stored.
The fisher folk have set up temporary cadjan huts close to the area where fishing crafts are anchored. The fisher folk said as a result of the distance from the sea, they do not use the buildings. The fisher folk said even the electricity wire and electricity appliances of the buildings have been removed by unruly elements.
