‘Country needs to prepare  for impending global changes’

The country needs to prepare for impending global changes, said Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Minister of Special Assignments, addressing a Conference on ‘Human Capital, Food Security and Economic Development’ in Colombo recently.
The Minister was the Chief Guest at the event organized by the Institute of Policy Studies in collaboration with the Centre for Development Economics and the South Asia Research Network of Monash University of Australia.
Dr Amunugama took up a theme from President Obama’s globally televised farewell address delivered a short while earlier and said that the country needs to be prepared for impending global changes. He said that it was a good guideline for the seminar that was being inaugurated. Existing research findings are useful but he said that we must look to the future and direct the research effort to foresee the emerging trends in world affairs and to propose feasible policy initiatives, particularly in the economic sphere, to meet these new challenges.
The possible emergence of protectionism in the West which perceives itself as having been adversely affected to some extent by globalization is a serious threat to the developing world and especially to the emerging economies of Asia.
“It may be that we are in the cusp of a brand new world economic order”, the Minister declared. Will the recently entered into global commitments in respect of climate change for instance survive the impending changes the minister speculated.
He requested the participants at the seminar to take a futuristic perspective in view of the possibility of big changes in the offing.
Turning to one of the topics for discussion at the conference , ‘Gender and Women Empowerment” the Minister referred to the great service rendered by Sri Lankan female migrant workers who remit their entire hard earned wages to the home country unlike richer expatriates working in developed countries.
