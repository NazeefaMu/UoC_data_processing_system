Plans afoot to regulate prisons system
Over 1,500 vacancies to be filled

A total of 350 prison guards were recruited last year to fill the vacancies in the Department of Prisons and action will be taken to recruit 1,200 prison guards this year, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan said.
Interviews regarding the recruitments are being conducted. Following a proper training, the 1,200 officers would be attached to prisons by the end of August, Minister Swaminathan added.
He said it was possible to offer over 1,500 employment opportunities through the Department of Prisons within two years and regulate the prisons system, thanks to the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Minister said steps have been taken to install a CCTV camera and mobile phone jammer system this year to prevent irregularities occurring inside prisons.
