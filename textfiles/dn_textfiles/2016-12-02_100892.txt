Faizer wants rural road reconstruction vested in Local Govt. Ministry

Local Government and Provincial Councils Minster Faizer Mustapha said the authority over rehabilitation and construction of roads in rural areas should be vested in the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, the minister said local government bodies and Provincial Councils understand the needs and requirements of the people better.
Mustapha said the ministry intends to formulate a mechanism to issues pertaining to stray dogs.
“It might not be a problem for people who once in a while visit public areas but it is a major issue for many who do business or engaged in other activities near markets, hospitals and other public places. The ministry will also obtain views of animal rights activists and organisations when formulating a mechanism,” he said.
