Concerted effort to tarnish JHU, former CEB chairman - Warnasinghe

 
 There was an effort by certain parties to tarnish the image of Jathika Hela Urumuya and former CEB chairman Vidya Amarapala, its media spokesman Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said yesterday.
He said that although there was a concerted effort by certain parties to tarnish the image of the JHU and former Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Chairman Vidya Amarapala over the so called black money scandal revealed in Panama Papers’, he had never been involved in such illegal transactions.
Addressing a media briefing at the Party Headquarters, Warnasinghe said the list exposed by some parties and websites in Sri Lanka that includes Amarapala’s name does not have any link to Mossack Fonseca or Panama Papers.
He said his name was only included in the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database along with a list of names of Sri Lankans published in 2013 who had allegedly held accounts or had companies in Singapore but not in the recently released list.
Warnasinghe also noted that even the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), while releasing the names included in the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database had noted that there are legitimate uses for offshore companies and trusts. And that they have not intended to suggest or imply that any persons, companies or other entities included in the ICIJ. Offshore Leaks Database has broken the law or otherwise acted improperly.
“It was the Ravaya newspaper who carried a news item on Panama Papers revelation which included Amarapala’s name along with a set of names of Sri Lankans on 10.04.2016. However, they themselves made an apology on their next issue stating that it wasn’t the set list of names included in leaked files from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseka.”
“However we decided to hold an inquiry on Amarapala soon after Ravaya news story, as he was a JHU activist. Although we got satisfactory explanations in our inquiry, he himself decided to keep away from all his responsibilities and functions of the ministry and Amarapala tendered his resignation to Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka with the hope that it will be easier if the ministry decides to conduct any investigation into the issue,” Warnasinghe said.
Also Minister Ranawaka's Secretary had been directed to lodge a complaint to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) soon after the Ravaya news story, to inquire whether the SCC had been involved in a financial fraud in any way during 2003-2010 when Amarapala was serving there, which proves that the JHU had acted with transparency regarding this issue.
Addressing the media briefing Vidya Amarapala said that he will take legal action against JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka and Muhammad Muzammil of Jathika Nidahas Peramuna for making false allegations during two media conferences held on Tuesday while linking his name to recently revealed Panama Papaers Scandal.
He also noted that the party had allocated 24 hours for them to make a public apology and if they fail to do so he will take a legal action against the two MPs.
“We request the government, the Central Bank and the Prime Minister to conduct an investigation regarding the list of names reveled in Panama Papers. However, we also request them to investigate into the set of names included in the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database and to clear away the doubts held by the public,” he added.
