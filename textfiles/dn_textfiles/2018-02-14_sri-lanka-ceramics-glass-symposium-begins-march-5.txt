Sri Lanka Ceramics  & Glass Symposium  begins March 5

An eminent panel of local and foreign speakers are billed to speak at the technical sessions of the Sri Lanka Ceramics & Glass Symposium on March 6, 2018, while the inauguration ceremony on March 5, will be graced by President Maithripala Sirisena and the keynote address will be delivered by Mahesh Amalean, Chairman, MAS Holdings.
The theme of the symposium is “Sustainability through Value Migration”. The technical sessions will be under four themes: Being Globally Competent, HR - Maintaining A Competitive Advantage, Process Improvement, Innovation.
The technical sessions, although primarily focused on developing strategies and introducing new management techniques to personnel in the Ceramic & Glass sector, will be equally useful to managerial level personnel in any industry.
The Ceramic & Glass Symposium is held once in every two years and this is the seventh symposium since the formation of the Sri Lanka Ceramics & Glass Council.
There will be seventeen speakers including technical presentations by foreign suppliers and two case studies of successful value migration.
More than 150 local and foreign participants drawn from manufacturing organizations, suppliers as well as universities, R&D institutes and Government policy makers are expected to attend.
