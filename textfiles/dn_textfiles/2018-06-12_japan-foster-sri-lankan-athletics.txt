Japan to foster Sri Lankan athletics

Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapa has signed a bilateral agreement with the Mayor of the Japanese city of Hashima, Sathushi Matsui to help boost athletics in the country during his stay in Japan as an invitee of the 18th Asian Junior Athletics Championship.
Under the theme of ‘Ape Jathiya Ape Abhimanayai’ Lankan athletes will be offered a fostering system by Japanese institutions and philanthropists. The program will also focus on enhancing services related to sports counseling and sports career guidance.
Minister Musthapa thanked Japan for supporting the development of Lankan sports. He acknowledged Japan’s long standing relationship with Sri Lanka, despite Sri Lanka not having a strong economy.
“The Japan-Lanka relationship is solely based on brotherhood, not on economic gains, so we, as Lankans value this long friendship with Japan,” Mustapha said.
