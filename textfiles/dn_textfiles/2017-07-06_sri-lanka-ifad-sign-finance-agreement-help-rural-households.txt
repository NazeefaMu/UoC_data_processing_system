Sri Lanka, IFAD sign finance agreement to help rural households

The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a financing agreement for USD 33.7 million that will help 57,500 rural households in Sri Lanka. This agreement aims to increase their incomes and food security by expanding livelihood and business opportunities in agriculture. The ceremony was held on June 26 at the IFAD’s Headquarters.
The agreement was signed by IFAD President Gilbert F. Houngbo, and Treasury and Finance and Mass Media Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga.
The ceremony was attended by Sri Lankan Ambassador to Italy and Governor of Sri Lanka to IFAD Daya S. J. Pelpola, External Resource Department of Sri Lanka Additional Directors General Ajith Abeysekera and Noor Anees and Minister Counsellor (Commercial) of the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Rome Somasena Mahadiulwewa. This new SAP programme will provide a platform for smallholder farmers in Sri Lanka, particularly for women and young people, to access financing and business training and will also help them form partnerships with each other and with the private sector. IFAD has been working with Sri Lanka since 1978, investing a total of USD 317.2 million in 18 programmes and projects, reaching over 614,832 households.
