Steve Smith has big say in team selection: Mark Waugh

Mark Waugh, Australian national selector, has revealed that captain Steven Smith is having an input into the selection of the team to rebuff pointed criticism from prominent former cricketers.
Australian cricket is in disarray after they suffered a fifth consecutive Test defeat during a humiliating innings and 80 runs loss against South Africa in Hobart. Recriminations have ensued with Rod Marsh, chairman of selectors, resigning from his post with Trevor Hohns being elevated into the position. Greg Chappell, Cricket Australia’s national talent manager, has become an interim national selector after an extraordinary meeting of CA’s board on Wednesday night (November 16).
Michael Clarke and Ian Chappell, former Australia captains, have questioned the amount of influence Smith is having and believe he should be entrusted with more responsibility. Rejecting the criticisms, Waugh insisted Smith was allowed input despite not officially being part of the selection panel.
“I have only been a selector for a couple of years but I assure you the captain has a big say in the team,” Waugh told foxsports.com.au on Wednesday. “He’s not a selector but you respect what he says. He’s got to deal with the players on the field so you need to give him the players he wants.”
Waugh said Australia’s setup had remained unchanged since Smith took over from Clarke after the Ashes last year. “When Michael Clarke was captain and when Steve Smith took over, the captain has had a very big say in his team so I am not quite sure what Michael is talking about there,” he said.
With an apparent lack of batting depth in domestic cricket, Waugh said selectors would use their “gut instinct” in selecting the third Test squad, which will be announced on Sunday (November 20). “At the moment the next level of players underneath the Test team, the runs just aren’t there,” he said. “The younger guys in state cricket haven’t got the volume of runs to knock the door down. As selectors I think we will be guessing a little bit and using our gut instinct, (asking) ‘This guy hasn’t quite made the runs, is he going to be better at the next level?’”
After consecutive embarrassing losses, Waugh said changes would be made. “Obviously there will be changes at Adelaide. I can’t say how many or who at this present point in time,” he said. “But I can assure you we are looking at a lot of batsmen.
And if someone sticks their hands up and gets a 150 or a 100 in this round then it is really important.
“But I think now we’re at a stage where we’re going to be sitting down and (acknowledge) it’s not working,” he added. “The team we’re picking at the moment - the batting, we’re having too many batting collapses.”
