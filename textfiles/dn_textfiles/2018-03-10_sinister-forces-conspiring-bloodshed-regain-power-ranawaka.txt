Sinister forces conspiring for bloodshed to regain power - Ranawaka

The decisive factor of the Presidential Election in 2019 wold be the main parties in the government and not those who conspire bloodshed in communal clashes to gain petty political mileage, Megalopolis and Western Development Minister and Jathika Hela Urumaya General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He said the Rajapaksas have initiated an attack on political parties in the government since they have realised that their popularity has reduced than ever before as they have gained only 39% of votes during the last local government election. “Hence their dream of the 2019 Presidential election is only a dream,” Minister Ranawaka said.”So they need bloodshed at this moment to win over the majority of Sinhalese.”
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the JHU political head office Battaramulla.He said the culprits of incidents that took place recently should be arrested.He also said that cyber terrorism should also be treated severely. “The Diyatalawa bus explosion has been proved to be an irresponsible act of a member of the Forces,”. “But Rajapaksa supporters and some media attempted to say it was an LTTE rejuvenation, solely to tarnish the government.So they should be dealt by the law”.
He added that the second incident was the Ampara incident which has been proved by the Government Analyst that it was a lump of flour. “Now it should be investigated as to who was involved in those clashes and who sought bail for the those arrested,” Minister Ranawaka said. “Some attempt to say that the JHU had an involvement in the Maha Sohon Balakaya. But it should be investigated. I have written to the IGP to find it out, he said. He also said that the people need to know as to what extremist groups were fostered with funds of forces secretly by the defence secretary during the previous government.He added that the most serious case was reported from Kandy and the culprits should brought to the book and punished.
Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana and Passaramulle Dayawansa also participated at the press conference.
