Resa to enlighten community

In the day and age, where people become overwhelmed by the digital flood of information, there is an increasing demand for local content and publication that can be trusted.Trust, integrity and connection are some of the premium qualities people are seeking out – this has to manifest itself in the quality and integrity of the stories that are being produced.
Resa, loosely translated to meaning community, is a medium of communication which transcends the ordinary. “Our society simply cannot go forward with the type of thinking and perspectives we derive today from the local press. We need to further intellectual journalism at a time where the industry is dominated by old-school thinking, gossips and click bait stories,” said Chamara Lakshan, Chief Editor of Resa.
Resa, a Lake House publication which hit the newsstands starting yesterday (11), is a newspaper meant for every member of the family. Run daily, the paper will also have an online edition.
Chamara said that the online edition would not simply replicate stories that appear in the print form but offer more long-form, in-depth versions. The editorial team of Resa, comprises of some of the best in the media industry, with many of them being below the age of 40.
“This attests to the thinking which is prevalent throughout the publication,” Chamara says.
Resa, which is out daily, is viewable online at www.resa.lk. The launch of the publication (pictured here) was attended by eminent academics and professionals from the field.
