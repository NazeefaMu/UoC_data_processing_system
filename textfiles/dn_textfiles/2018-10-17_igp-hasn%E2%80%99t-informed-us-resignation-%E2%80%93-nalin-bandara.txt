IGP hasn’t informed us of resignation – Nalin Bandara

Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara has not informed the Minister of any plans to hand in his resignation, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara yesterday said.
“Neither the Law and Order Minister nor I have been informed of such a decision as yet. I am not aware if IGP Jayasundara has informed the President or the Prime Minister of an intention to resign. I do not believe that he has taken such a step. I also believe that IGP Jayasundara has the right to resign if he desires,” Deputy Minister Bandara said.
He also said that there have been no serious allegations against the conduct of the Sri Lanka Police in the last three years for the IGP to hand in his resignation under social pressure.
Deputy Minister Bandara also said he is not aware of a decision to give a diplomatic post to Jayasundara following his resignation, as rumored in some sections of the media. “Such things happened prior to 2015, when then President Mahinda Rajapaksa offered an ambassador’s post to one of the IGPs following serious social backlash against the police in relation to the death of Roshen Chanaka in 2011. That is not how this government operates,” he said.
“Most of the allegations leveled against him are based on the way in which he is presenting himself before the public. If you put aside your coloured glasses, you will understand that Sri Lanka Police is operating independently unlike ever before. I am not saying it is 100 percent independent, but it is way better than what it was used to be. Sri Lanka Police does not have serious allegations levelled against it, unlike many other police services in the regional countries. You must understand that IGP Jayasundara has initiated a number of programmes curbing drugs and the underworld,” Deputy Minister Bandara said.
When questioned if IGP Jayasundara is involved in politics or is trying to pursue a political career, Deputy Minister Bandara said that the IGP is not involved in politics. “I cannot speak for the IGP. But as much as I know, this is the way he behaves from the time he was a DIG. He is a down to earth man who is interested in community service. He deals very closely with his officers.
If you take the last Kandy Perahera, the IGP could have stationed himself by the side of the President and watched the perahera peacefully. But he chose to be on the road, working with his men. That is the way he is, and I do not believe that he is involved in politics,” he said.
Speaking of the Joint Opposition’s enthusiasm in removing the IGP, Deputy Minister Bandara said that the JO is politically motivated for this purpose. “If we were in the Opposition, we would not have requested the removal of a weak IGP. A weak IGP destroys the image of the government.”
“So it is obvious that the JO wants the IGP out of the scene because they would like law and order of this country distorted. They are the ones who are asking for the removal of FCID, the CID and the new Anti-Corruption High Courts,” Bandara said.
