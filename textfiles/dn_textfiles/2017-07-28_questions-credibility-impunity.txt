Questions of credibility impunity

Last week the news of the attempted abduction of Ryan Jayalath, Convener of the Medical Students’ Action Committee in the city in broad daylight was received with shock and disbelief by the civil society. Even sections of the establishment were stunned. Media Minister soon issued a statement condemning the incident and promising an inquiry.
The police hastened to say that the van was not a police vehicle but it belonged to the Finance Ministry. The latter also distanced itself by saying that it was not a Ministry van. Then much later the police came out with a long story saying that the van belonged to the police and those who came in it were police officers in civvies who came to arrest a suspect wanted for several cases and they have a legitimate right to arrest such suspects even without warrant from a magistrate. This last argument does not augur well since anyone and everyone could be arrested by any cop on his sole discretion.
Still several questions remain in the public mind. Why did the police use a “white van, the customary vehicle that was used in forced abductions during the earlier regime instead of a police jeep? Is it to send a signal that vigilante groups such as “Praa” have become active again and instill fear in the minds of agitating students?
Jaffna shooting
It is also customary for the police to jump to conclusions at once and later retrace their steps or speak in double-tongues, as a local idiom says. Even in the case of the Jaffna shooting in which a security officer of a Magistrate was gunned down, the police immediately said that it was not an attempt on the life of the magistrate. Later the assailant was identified as an ex-LTTE cadre. Much more contradictory were the police versions about the murder of the young girl Chaya Sevmini. The police even charged a schoolboy for the murder and remanded him after which the real culprit surfaced and confessed.
We are also reminded of repeated incidents in which hard-core criminal suspects were being shot by the police in violent encounters while escorting them to various spots to unearth hidden weapons etc.
All these create suspicions in the public mind about the credibility of police versions of incidents. This negative image is further reinforced by the increasing number of police officers, even up to the level of DIGs who are being accused of various crimes including murder, robbery, treasure hunting etc.
Of more serious consequences is the existence of a culture of impunity in the country which exempts certain categories of persons from punishments for crimes committed by them. While the Constitution or the law of the land does not approve such impunity it has been the practice either through oversight or willful neglect on the part of the authorities both political and administrative.
For example, for decades no high-profile politician such as an MP or a Minister has been brought before Courts of law and punished for corruption, fraud and misuse of public property though allegations have been made in public against them. Then number of high calibre politicians convicted for bribery and corruption in independent Sri Lanka could be counted with the fingers of one hand, the last being M P de Zoysa MP more than half a century ago. Are we to believe that all our politicians since then were and are paragons of virtue? Even now, though several institutions exist for investigations either they are paralyzed for lack of funds, personnel or political will to prosecute even known offenders. Some enjoy such huge immunity that they are not even touched.
How many politicians have been found to be involved in destruction of the environment? Of them how many have been prosecuted? What action was taken against the encroachments in the world’s end area? What actions have been taken against illicit sand mining in river beds? The people have a right to know.
Hate speech and preaching communalism
Of late politicians whose sole interest is to come to power or retain power by any means have made it a policy to confer immunity to members of the Buddhist Sangha against any wrongdoing. They consider anyone attired in a yellow robe should not be dealt according to the law of the land, if he commits a crime. This is a new phenomenon. Errant monks have been punished even during the times of ancient kings. Even in independent Sri Lanka Somarama was sent to the gallows. Buddarakkhita was jailed. It did not affect the status of Buddhism in the country. There cannot be impunity for anyone, including bhikkhus to engage in hate speech or preach communalism and place the country in danger.
Security forces constitute another category that enjoys immunity through the neglect and camaraderie of officials or protection afforded by politicians in power. Even the Head of State was enraged at the mere issue of summons to some high ranking officers of the security forces to give a statement to the police. If there are errant officers they should be brought before the law and dealt accordingly. It is more damaging to the security forces to let accusations remain uninvestigated. It is to its credit if the relevant officers are given a chance to clear their names through an inquiry.
The only institution that has gained a measure of public confidence after January 8 is the judiciary. Yet a degree of discriminatory treatment is seen in certain judgements or degrees of punishments given in certain instances. A punishment is considered a form of deterrent.
Yet some seem to be stimulants. For example, a certain politico who pleaded guilty to avoiding the submitting of annual income statements as required by law was fined much less than the common fine for “mosquito breeding”. While the former is a willful act the latter is never voluntary.
The ease with which certain politicos accused of normally unbailable offenses roam the globe is also an irritant in the public mind. Law seems to favour the rich and the mighty. No wonder in a class society law itself is class biased.
