Speaker requests members to desist from character assassination

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya urged both the Government and Opposition members to be considerate and not to resort to character assassination during the course of debate yesterday. Parliament took up a full day’s adjournment debate on the COPE report on Central Bank Treasury Bonds investigation yesterday.
The Speaker making a special request at the outset of the debate asked members of both sides to stick to the matter before the House and help him conduct an admirable and respectful session of Parliament.
He reminded them that the full session would go on live yesterday. Defying this request, MPs of both sides resorted to hurl abuse and make direct accusations against each other and officials.
A stormy debate ensued with crossfire between the MPs often in un-Parliamentary language forcing the Speaker to expunge certain sections of speeches from the Hanzard. The Speaker repeatedly warned the Parliamentarians to be mindful about their language and not to disturb the members as they take the floor.
At one point, the Speaker severely warned UPFA MP Lohan Ratwatte asking him not to disturb the proceedings.
“I have been watching you since morning, and this is my third warning to you. If you continue to disturb the other members, I will be forced to take action,” he said. The Speaker also warned UNP backbencher Nalin Bandara to be mindful of his language reminding him that, “All members in this House are ‘honourable MPs’. Give that respect when addressing your fellow members”.
JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake commencing the debate immediately after the Speaker’s announcement said, “I do not hope to resort to any character assassination, but I will not hesitate to call a thief ‘hora’”.
