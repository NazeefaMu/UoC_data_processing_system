Doorway to dream home

Designs make comfortable houses that are a joy to live in. Not all of us can afford multi- million dollar mansions like actor John Travolta who has two plane runways to his house.
Not all of us can afford the luxuries that Hollywood celebrities have, with splendid interior design - leather accessories that cost a fortune. Not all of us can have saunas, swimming pools and furniture that only celebrities and businessmen can afford, which are completely beyond our budget. But that doesn't matter. There are simple designs and tasteful decorations that can make beautiful homes which you can afford. These are homes where you can relax and live happily. Architect Dr. Nishan Wijetunge talks to T n' C Arch World on how to choose the right yet simple house plan.
Modern Architecture
Nowadays, more and more people are increasingly going for Modern Architecture. Perhaps, the significant growth of our media sphere over the past decade or so is responsible for this. In the age of globalization, more and more people are exposed to what is happening elsewhere in the world.
Modern architecture was something that started around the dawn of 20th century in Europe. This was in fact, the avant-garde of modernism that we still see in the Western world today - the white cubes, buildings on stilts, curtain walls, roof gardens etc.
Interior Design
Interior design is what makes our homes a matter of pride and makes it satisfying to live in. It is a special place for a family. It is where we can entertain our friends and relatives who appreciate the design and often compliment us on it. It is a where a girl can invite her boyfriend. Not all of us can have exteriors like John Travolta with two plane runways but we can manage with what we have!
Most People want modern and minimalist interiors. Some like hybrid versions. We always like to experiment. Even when it comes to exteriors the modern minimalist appearance is what most of them are after and what most of the architects are providing. People go for very simple landscaping. People are no longer interested in the 'Classical' or 'English' gardens. They don't have the time to maintain such gardens. Therefore, we try to provide very simple solutions - A single tree in a corner as against many trees. A single plant bed against many plant pots. Gravel against grass etc. A simple element placed under a tree. Simple outdoor furniture or water feature. We always try to achieve that 'Zen' quality.
International Trends
No country can live in isolation. We are invariably influenced by other cultures. We are invariably influenced by their ways and their trends.
Nowadays, international trends are arriving here. They go hand in hand with the new materials and accessories that are imported.
It is not wrong to say that our architectural profession is at the forefront of what is happening in our region. When you discuss the tastes of the Sri Lankan clients and examine what designs are most in vogue you will find that they are trying to become modern -sometimes blatantly modern even to the extent of completely going against regionalist trends that can help device hybrid versions that will work better in this country. Some need to have more open minds about these things.
In a way, going for modern architecture is better than trying to perpetuate the 'British bungalow', 'Neo-wallauwe,' the houses that take after Greek-Roman villa or pattern book architecture. At least this is a genuine gesture.
Different tastes
In any country there are 'the affluent upper class' and the middle class. They too have particular tastes. The upper class want modern and some want architecture that borders between the modern and 'neo-wallauwwe' or Greek-Roman villa. It all depends on the taste really. The middle class go for modern. Seldom do you find someone who is interested in traditional designs.
Be simple
Most clients want more than they actually need. Why would you want a five bed house when you can perfectly do with a three bed? You need to know what your exact necessities and economic capabilities are. I personally hate to design something that would take ages to be completed. So, we try to advise such frivolous clients and convince them to cut down on the brief. Maybe, phase out the construction.
Social responsibility
We charge what is recommended by our institute. Nothing more. Nothing less. We need to upgrade our standards and uphold our professional integrity. There are some who only cater to the elite or the rich. They are in fact, proud to admit that. I personally have no barriers. As an architect, you have the social responsibility to cater to anyone.
Hybrids
Hybrids are designs that strike a balance between the modern and traditional. "In other words, designs that is both modern and regional. Both soft and rustic. That's my stylistic inclination. The location matters too. My ideal house will be on a hill top, overlooking the sea or a tranquil river, at a distance. Like the hotel Kandalama, it should be something to see from, rather than to be seen. I do not want a retinal-centric façade. It should blend with nature.
Keep it simple
Decorating the room all depends on the functional requirements of the room. Based on that the furniture layout is done and depending on that the electrical layout.
Whatever the use, we like to keep things simple and uncluttered. To make the house look attractive and homely it needs to have a lot of qualities. e.g Cleanly designed spaces, elegant furniture, matching accessories, color balance, contrast and texture, good lighting layout and natural lighting.
Corner House
'Corner House' is a unique interpretation of how one could design in a tight corner site of just 8 perches. Rectangular in shape, the site allows for the efficient placement of two main blocks. The house comprises two floors, where the solidity of the built up areas are contrasted wonderfully by the openness of the link and extensive glazing. A generous double-height space and soaring roof profile compliment the light structure.
The most interesting feature of the project is the treatment of the corner, whose subtlety can be attributed to the use of unframed glass for this curtain wall, creating the visual illusion of seamlessness.
The interior of the house is simple, spacious and functional, and earth coloured finishes add a rustic touch to the composition.
When lit up at night, the house glows like a gigantic lantern, illuminating not just the neighborhood corner; but also the much experimented concept of marrying the new and the old.
The Hull
This is 'The Hull', the design exploits the odd and pointed nature of one of the site's corners and delivers an impressive cantilevered glass corner façade.
It has been designed as a unique 3000 Sq. Ft. house consisting of two floors and a roof terrace level. From the access road, one first enters into a breathtaking triple-height space; before witnessing the unique spine-like staircase and rest of the minimalist modern interior. A distinctive balance between solid, semi-solid and void is achieved via the strategic use of walls, louvers and glass respectively.
A seamless glass façade at the sharp corner of the house (which would otherwise have been a jarring joint) blurs the boundaries between inside and out. A cantilevering concrete canopy above - what the Architect calls a 'shadow umbrella', lends critical protection from both sun and rain. In fact, this is what gives rise to the name of the house - the hull-like roof terrace, which when lit from underneath shines like the starlit deck of a majestic ocean liner.
The furniture, fittings and lighting all help create a sense of lightness and serenity, just like the much needed calm after the storm of a busy day at work.

Maple trees for support!
Grandfather builds incredible three-storey treehouse in his garden:
Jay Hewitt - a Massachusetts grandfather many would wish for - has built a gargantuan 40-foot treehouse for his very lucky grandchildren.
Built with only four maple trees for support, and entirely out of scrap materials, this mammoth treehouse in Attleboro, Massachusetts has a spiral slide, electricity and even a ventilation system.
The idea for the treehouse came about before Hewitt's grandchildren were born, springing from conversation with his son. Hewitt told The Sun Chronicle that "At the time, I said I'd build the best treehouse any kid ever had."
Hewitt, a contractor and member of his local Planning Board, as well as being an assistant building inspector, told The Sun Chronicle: "I never dreamed that a treehouse would be anything like this. I had a treehouse when I was a kid, but it was basically a 4-by-8 sheet of plywood."
He's come a long way since then. On the ground floor is a "mud room", with stairs up to a large living room-style area.
It also has a flight of stairs to the loft on the top floor, with every step made entirely by Hewitt from New Hampshire birch trees.
It has an intensely rustic feel, with bare branches and trunks on show, to remind any visitor that they are cradled in the branches of a living tree.
While his 6-year-old grandson and 4-year-old granddaughter adore the treehouse - it is also the perfect entertaining space for Jay Hewitt and his family. -Telegraph
