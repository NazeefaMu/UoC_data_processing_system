Pushpa left us when needed most

Gampaha District Cricket Umpires’ Association Vice President (veteran umpire) and retired English lecturer attached to Colombo University (Extension English Course for Under-graduates) Pushpa Gunatilaka passed away on October 30 (Sunday).
The 64 year old Pushpa was a distinguished old boy of Thurstan College, Colombo, and joined English Teaching Profession in early seventies from Polonnaruwa District, until he was selected to the Mirigama English Teachers’ College in late seventies. I first met him there when I too joined the same teachers’ college, where we played and discussed on cricket as young teacher trainees because our first love was cricket the gentlemen’s game.
After leaving teachers college, he was fortunate to get a school in the city of Gampaha Gothami Vidyalaya, later he joined Galahitiyawa Central and became the MIC of cricket and developed school cricket there. A few years back he joined Bandaranaike College, Gampaha and became MIC of cricket. With the help of the principal he was able to get Raja Athukorale the renowned cricket coach to help the young cricketers there. Not only that he brought the college band to the top as MIC.
Pushpa had many good qualities, one of the noblest being his willingness to help less fortunate but skilful, irrespective of their caste, creed and race. He completed nearly four successful decades as an English teacher. He retired as the Head of English Support Centre, Gampaha where he helped young English teachers on the subject of English Teaching profession but he continued his university lecturing until his death.
After becoming a qualified umpire and cricket coach, he wanted to help cricket playing schools in Gampaha District. The poor schools could not bear the umpire’s fee then, because they had to pay considerable amount to the Colombo Branch umpires including travelling. So he with some of the veteran umpires of the Gampaha District like D S Dissanayake, Pushparaja, Rodrigo joined hands to develop the separate cricket umpires branch to do matches without travelling fee (only the umpire’s fee was paid) (2016) until recently the travelling fee was added. Pushpa did a tireless job holding several posts (he was the General Secretary until 2015) to improve the Gampaha Branch.
Many give up studies after getting a job, but Pushpa followed the Advanced English Diploma at the National Institute of Education, Maharagama and passed out with flying colours and selected to another English professional course in the UK where he met great professors.
He led a very simple life. Nobody knows that he was such a unique person. He was so humble and his motto was “Perseverance and patience will help you to steer your ship in the stormy sea of life.” he spent most of time on organising cricket clubs (Ganemulla Sports Club one of them) and school cricket in Gampaha. I heard one of the principals saying during his funeral oration. You could see him after school at the cricket field practising cricket with young cricketers. He was fortunate to have an understanding wife who helped him devotedly.
Dear Pushpa, though you are no more you will always be in our hearts as a loving and caring brother and wonderful human being. Thank you very much for all your valuable advice.
May you attain Nirvana!
