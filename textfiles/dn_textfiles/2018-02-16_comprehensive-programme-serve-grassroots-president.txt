President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday told candidates who contested the concluded Local Government election under the SLFP and the UPFA banner that regardless of whether they won or lost, they will all play key roles in a programme to be launched shortly to serve the people.
“We will soon organise a comprehensive programme to serve the people as a political party and the government. In this endeavour, we plan to utilise the services of all candidates who contested the LG polls from the SLFP and UPFA regardless of whether they won or lost,” he said. The President was addressing the party candidates who contested the recently concluded LG polls under UPFA and SLFP at the Presidential Secretariat.
The President went on to say that all candidates of the UPFA and SLFP should also be committed to uphold the pledge given by the SLFP to ensure corruption free politics at all times. He also noted that the governments programme to usher a clean political culture and its development drive will be further strengthened in the future while using the experience gained at the concluded elections to good effect.
