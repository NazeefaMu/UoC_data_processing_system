Navy rescues two more jumbos at sea in Trincomalee

Navy personnel attached to the Eastern Naval Command rescued two elephants that were swept out to the sea, between Round Island and Foul Point, Trincomalee yesterday morning.
The jumbos in troubled waters were first noticed by an Inshore Patrol Craft on routine sea patrol. A combined rescue mission was launched by the Navy and Wildlife officials to save the two wild elephants. The Navy augmented the rescue mission deploying three more Fast Attack Craft, on patrol and a team of Navy divers.
The mammoth effort of the rescue teams saw the two jumbos being carefully directed to the shore without any harm to the animals. They were subsequently released to the Foul Point jungle.
A team of navy personnel belonging to the same naval command saved an elephant caught in current in the seas about 8 Nm off Kokkuthuduwai on July 11.
