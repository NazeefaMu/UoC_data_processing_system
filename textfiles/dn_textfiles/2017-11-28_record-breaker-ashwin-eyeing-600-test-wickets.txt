Record-breaker Ashwin eyeing 600 Test wickets

Nagpur: Indian spin king Ravichandran Ashwin said Monday he wanted to double his tally of 300 Test wickets after becoming the fastest bowler to the mark against Sri Lanka. Ashwin surpassed Australia’s pace legend Dennis Lillee, achieving the milestone in his 54th Test. Lillee took 56 matches to reach the same mark.
“I really hope I can go on to double these 300 wickets. I’ve only played 50 Tests,” said the 31-year-old off-spinner after India crushed Sri Lanka by an innings and 238 runs on the fourth day of the second Test in Nagpur.
“It’s not easy bowling spin, it looks like you’re just ambling up. But there’s a lot (that goes) behind it.”
The mercurial spinner, ranked fourth among top the top 10 bowlers, dismissed number eleven batsman Lahiru Gamage for nought to return impressive match figures of 8-130.
Ashwin, who made his debut against the West Indies in 2011, is India’s premier spin bowler and has often achieved top positions in the International Cricket Council rankings.
He had also surpassed Lillee in the race to 250 wickets in his 45th Test against Bangladesh early this year.
Ashwin also has 150 one-day wickets in 111 matches and 52 wickets in 46 Twenty20 games. AFP
