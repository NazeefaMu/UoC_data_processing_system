Point of view
Political drama continued to influence Sri Lankan equity markets, with the President’s unexpected dissolution of the parliament last Friday (after market close), the subsequent decision by the Supreme Court and the disarray during the reconvening of parliament dominating market movement.
The broadshare ASPI remained volatile over the week, recording 3-days of positive returns and 2 days of negative returns to result in a cumulative drop of ~23 points (cf. a loss of ~114 points last week) over the week. While Index heavy-weight JKH’s announcement of a 1 for 20 share repurchase helped prop markets to some extent, markets remained broadly on a downtrend and failed to regain momentum as the country’s political deadlock progressively worsened over the week.
Although activity levels remained largely subdued over the week, Softlogic Group’s strategic transfer of Odel Plc within the Group helped total weekly turnover increase ~6.6% W-o-W as the transaction amounted to Rs.6.2Bn (or ~75%) of the week’s turnover. Crossings for the week consequently accounted for 84% of the weekly turnover cf. just ~19% last week.
Despite this week’s continued political standoff, foreign investors returned to Sri Lankan equities for the first time in 11-weeks, to record a net inflow of Rs.0.13Mn cf. an outflow of Rs.3.9Bn last week. Meanwhile, September quarter earnings of ~ 92% of corporates remained weak (-7.8% Y-o-Y to Rs.56.2Bn cf. Rs.61.0Bn reported by the total market in Sep’17) and the CBSL on Wednesday acknowledged that GDP growth for 2018 is likely to remain below envisaged levels. Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the outcome of Monday’s parliamentary session and any further political developments.
The Central Bank on Wednesday maintained a neutral monetary policy stance by simultaneously reducing the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) by 1.50 p.p to 6% while increasing policy rates (SDFR by 75bps to 8% and SLFR by 50bps to 9%). The monetary authority acknowledged that the reduction in the SRR (which is expected to release a substantial amount of rupee liquidity to the banking system and thus reduce banks’ costs of funds) is aimed at addressing the large and persistent shortage in rupee liquidity in the domestic market.
Meanwhile, to neutralize the impact of this reduction, policy interest rates were raised by 50-75bps. The CBSL added that although inflation levels have decelerated (driven by the decline in volatile food prices), private credit to all major sectors up to Q3’18 showed a notable acceleration while the trade deficit has widened amid higher imports, thus prompting the increase in policy rates.
The CBSL noted though that a slowdown in imports and private credit growth is likely in period ahead given the LKR depreciation and its recent policy measures. Market rates moved higher in the aftermath of the increase in policy rates, with rates on the 3M and 1Y Government securities rising between 36-42Bps since the announcement.
Yields on G-Secs have increased sharply in the recent weeks amidst the country’s ongoing political turmoil. Since the start of the political turmoil on Oct’26, yields on T-bills have risen between 17-50Bps across all tenors, prompted by the sharp sell-off by Foreign investors who have sold ~Rs. 23Bn in the last 3 weeks as the political fallout has progressively worsened.
