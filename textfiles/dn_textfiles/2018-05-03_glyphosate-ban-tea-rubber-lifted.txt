Glyphosate ban on tea, rubber lifted

The ban on Glyphosate weedicide has been lifted for tea and rubber from yesterday.
Plantation Industries Minister Naveen Dissanayake said the decision to lift the ban imposed three years ago had been taken after considering scientific research which proved that this substance is not harmful to human health.
Japan has rejected a stock of tea exported from Sri Lanka claiming that the stock contained chemical substances exceeding the default residue level imposed by them.Sri Lanka Tea Board sources this was due to the weedicides being widely used by planters as a substitute to Glyphosate.
