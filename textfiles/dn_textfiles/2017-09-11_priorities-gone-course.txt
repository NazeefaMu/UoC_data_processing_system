Priorities gone off course

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has announced a joint island-wide strike in the next few days if the Government fails to offer an effective solution to the SAITM issue. This is high time for the Anti-SAITM People’s Barricade to have this strike as this chaos was initiated by the previous regime in 2008. Where were these so-called Anti-SAITM Barricade at the time of its inception?
It bears testimony to the old proverb that someone with eyesight lost is trying to worship the sun. They should have nipped in the bud but now it has grown beyond any repair. Having lost all the opportunities, they are now pressurising the government to give them a sustainable solution. We also learned that the deans of the eight medical faculties have submitted a set of proposals spelling out how to resolve the SAITM issue. The SAITM was set up after the SLMC came to an agreement. A private institute could be established under the provisions of UGC Act, according to the agreement.
The GMOA, the SLMC, the university students as well as the Anti-SAITM People’s Barricade such as the Inter-Company Employees Union, the Ceylon Teachers’ Services Union and the Government Indigenous Medicine Officers’ Association have threatened the government that they would commence an anti-SAITM vehicle parade on September 12. Touring around the country on September 12, 13 and 14, the parade will reach Colombo on September 15. Then the entire city of Colombo will be disturbed with all its activities coming to a halt.
Traffic congestion
This cannot be the ideal solution. The traffic congestion and all that will affect the innocent public. In fact, this is a deal between the GMOA and the government. If that is the case, why avenge the innocent public? The innocent public, of course, undergo untold hardships and face unnecessary inconvenience. In the past, the general public could not protest against the government. That is possible today thanks to the good governance. We enjoy the freedom of expression. As a result, most protesters express their grievances to the government in the form of strike or protest.
An ideal solution rests elsewhere. The committee solution is still pending. They are yet to formulate an optimistic solution. Until then, why not stay put a little? Why not hold on the parade?
The GMOA and the medical faculty students have been leading this protest against the SAITM for a quite long period. The whole period has elapsed with no sustainable solution. What has happened in reality is that the students missed their lessons. The completion of their degree will keep on being postponed.
Their parents would naturally wonder as to how long these protests would go on. They have every reason for that worry as the guardians.
On a different note, some female medical undergraduates have expressed their concern about the protest in an interview with the Daily News. They are quite uncertain about their future with an ongoing protest. Unlike the males, the females have an added burden to worry about: the age factor. The longer the protest goes on, the more added their burden will be with an incomplete degree.
Unsolved issues
That is no joke, of course. The cream of the young blood wastes their precious time on the streets. That is exactly why the government should be more serious about this issue. The government must take necessary steps to solve the unsolved issues. The university lecturers have an important role to play as well. Without misleading, the much-respected academics must try their level best to convince them why they should call it a day and focus seriously on the studies.
On the other hand, thousands of students at the SAITM are earnestly waiting for a favourable solution. This protest is at a total loss for the government, medical faculty students as well as the SAITM students.
The relevant authorities should bring up a permanent solution to this long-pending issue. The students can then rest assured and reach their goals: completing the degree on time.
