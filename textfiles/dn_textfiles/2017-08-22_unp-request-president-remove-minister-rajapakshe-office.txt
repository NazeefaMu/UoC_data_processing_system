UNP request President to remove Minister Rajapakshe from office

 
The United National Party (UNP) Working Committee today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to adopt suitable measures to remove Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeydasa Rajapakshe from all Cabinet Ministerial posts.
UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim told Daily News Online that the Working Committee made the decision following Minister Wijeydasa Rajapakshe’s non compliance to rectify the statement made by him against Cabinet decisions and party decisions, on or before August 21.
Minister Wijeyadasa was said to have agreed on August 17 to make a statement before the UNP Working Committee on or before August 21 rectifying the comments made by him violating collective responsibilities of the Cabinet of Ministers.
But the UNP Working Committee alleged Minister Wijeyadasa had continued to condemn Ministers and government policies even after the confrontation with the Minister.
With these turn of events the UNP Working Committee has informed President Sirisena of Minister Rajapakshe’s non-compliance to the agreement, and requested him to remove the Justice and Buddhasasana Minister from office, Minister Kabir Hashim said.
