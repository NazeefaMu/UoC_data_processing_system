Cloudless Blue Skies hit the shelves

The wait is over! Aditha Dissanayake, best-selling author of 'Somewhere in the Green Hills' and the winner of the H.A.I Gunetilleke Award 2016, is back. Her new novel, 'When a Cloud Left the Sky' published by M.D Gunasena will be released this Saturday, 23rd September 2017 at around 11.30 in the morning at the Colombo International Book Fair.
“I’ve been working on 'Cloud' for three years, and I’m so excited to share it with readers this September,” says Aditha. “This is my attempt to chronicle life after the war in Sri Lanka. The setting is Galle, my hometown. So, while the story is fictional, it is also quite personal.”
The first chapter, however, begins in New York – immortalizing a young Sri Lankan writer, seated on a bench in Washington Square Park, NY, USA. As you read on, you will realize the story unfolds simultaneously – moving between nights in New York to mornings in Sri Lanka – until finally, the characters meet in Unawatuna, Galle.
Among the central characters are Orinth who dreams of writing the perfect novel, Kanishke who wishes to bring ethnic harmony to his country now recovering from the ravages of war while Sanith just wants to live in peace in the place he calls home. Over the time span of four months, their lives are destined to meet in quite unforeseen ways, under the dark clouds of a turbulent past.
Aditha Dissanayake brings to this story all the warmth and power of insight that characterized her first novel, 'Somewhere in the Green Hills' and her collection of short stories, 'My Mind is Made Up, I'm Afraid its You'. 'When a Cloud Left the Sky' is filled with the magic of her writing, capturing with heartwarming clarity the moods of men and women of different races - in peace, in war, in love.
An author, columnist, and translator, Aditha has a BA in English (Hons) First Class, from the University of Kelaniya. She has studied journalism at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute of the New York University, USA, was a lectuere at the Dept of English, University of Kelaniya and the Features Editor of the Sunday Observer, before she decided to become a fulltime writer.
If you have read and fallen in love with her previous books, here's a chance to go through the same process all over again.
