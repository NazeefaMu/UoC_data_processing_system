We will not allow foreign interference - Voice for Justice

Voice for Justice Editor Sudarman Radaliyagoda said yesterday that the names of those who received monthly allowances and vehicles from the Road Development Authority will be reveled next week, just as the names of those who allegedly received funds and vehicles from Litro gas were revealed this week.
“We will reveal all the frauds and corruption that had taken place at state organisations during the last three and half years shortly,” he added.
He said it is only when MP Mahinda Rajapaksa wanted to bring down gas prices, that we came to know about persons who apparently worked to bring about a just society had also allegedly received payments from Litro gas.
“That is the reason why we could not reduce the gas prices for the last three and half years,” he added.
“The UNP which always cries for democracy is now trying to forcibly enter state institutions. We vehemently condemn the attempts by two UNP MPs to forcibly enter the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation and trying to sabotage its work,” Radaliyagoda said. “Certain local and foreign elements are trying to take the country back to a civil war situation but the people will not allow that to happen,” he said.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Radaliyagoda said both Rupavahini and ITN have come down in the ratings after 2015 mainly because of a number of frauds and corruption.
“Several advisors appointed to the ITN have received nearly Rs.200,000 of monthly payments even without coming to work,” he said.
