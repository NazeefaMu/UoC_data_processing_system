Julian Mendis, Gerald Mendis and Duleep Mendis of St. Sebastian's became the first father and two sons to represent their alma mater. Duleep captained his school in 1968 and went on to lead Sri Lanka in Tests and one day Internationals. Then another Sebastanite Hector Silva and two of his sons Vivil Silva and Theresius Silva played in the big matches.
These two records were broken by three Cambrians this year. Nishantha Peiris was the vice captain to Vikum Halwatura in the 1985 Big Match while his eldest son Nuwantha Peiris captained the school in the Big Match in 2010 and this year the youngest son fourth year coloursman and an allrounder Savindu Peiris is captaining Prince of Wales College.
