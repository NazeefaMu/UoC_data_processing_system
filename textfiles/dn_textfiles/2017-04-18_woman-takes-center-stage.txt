Woman takes center stage

When women come together tremendous obstacles can be surmounted. WOMAN is the story of a group of women who have the courage and determination to realize their aspirations. Daily News recently visited the Good Market to experience firsthand their initiative ‘Rising Woman – Interfaith Women Collective’. The stalls at the good market featured bedspreads and handicrafts collection. Co- Founder of WOMAN Dishani Jayaweera commented on this noble movement.
WOMAN is an interconnected sisterhood that ignites inner power of women by healing, celebrating diversity and womanhood through creative friendly efforts. WOMAN is a sister organization of CPBR (Center for Peace Building and Reconciliation)
“I am a person who is exploring the role of women in healing, reconciliation and peace building, which is not only in Sri Lanka but as a universal community. Today I feel we are living in a ‘hot plate’, ecologically, socially, culturally, economically and politically we are burnt out. That is where my energy comes - to really explore the role of women to heal, because before you do anything else I have a strong feeling that the healing is the most important thing. It is not because of the war but because of everything around us,” said Jayaweera.
For the last 20 years she has been working as a peace builder in this country under the roof of Centre for Peace Building and Reconciliation along with co- founder of CPBR, Prof. Jayantha Seneviratne.
“We worked with women, youth and community leaders. Two years ago, me and two other colleagues of mine, Chandi De Silva (coming from mainly Colombo) and Chandra (coming from grass root communities). So we have given birth to a group called ‘WOMAN’. We are the co- founders,” stated Jayaweera.
So under WOMAN they work with female religious leaders, to explore the role female religious leaders can play to heal the body, mind, soul and soil.
“In that exploration we realized that it is really important to touch the lives of women in the ground level. So we have given birth to an initiative called – ‘Rising Woman’, to explore what kind of role they can play, to bring communities together, to heal their own selves and to heal their communities and heal the soil and the people.
We are working in Jaffna, Batticaloa, Anuradhapura and Pollonanaruwa. We are working with mainly 20 – 30 community leaders who are already doing many good things in their communities and we train them at an intellectual level to understand the topic of power and the dynamics of power in their relationships at a personal level and at a political level.
We are coming together and having fun and sharing our lives. The community leaders work with another 150 women at ground level who are living in their communities to share, their knowledge experience and exposure,” explained Jayaweera.
community level relationships
Jayaweera pointed out the power of Economy. This plays a huge role when it comes to community level relationships. For women to feel confident and to really stand by themselves, economy plays a role. That is one of their main concerns. Half of them are sometimes single mothers for many reasons - their husbands have left them or their husbands are not supporting.
“So we thought to ourselves, we will bring livelihoods, peace building and reconciliation into one cycle with the ecological well- being as well. So we are bringing ecological well-being and social well-being together. In that process we create things together to understand who we are. This self- discovery is made possible through many creations. So this makes them feel very confident as they search themselves. Giving that sense of ownership and sense of connection with your own self is the first step which was why we brought in this creativity into the process,” pointed out Jayaweera.
The ladies have been designing bedspreads and bottles, doing many eco- friendly initiatives. So they did this by themselves setting up small stalls in their fairs under the name of Interfaith Women Collective to sell these things. It was very popular in Anuradhapura, Pollonnaruwa and Batticaloa with women from different faiths coming together, creating things together and selling things together.
“I see this as a part of power sharing. As a believer of power sharing, I think as to how we can bring women from the periphery into the market, and letting them directly experience that. It is not like we collect their stuff and bring it here and sell it. For me it is again centralized power. I become the center or another becomes the center, or a few people become the center,” added Jayaweera.
Jayaweera is a strong believer of interdependence. Nothing can be done alone.
“There are so many people around me. It is a story of all of us. Not one single person. It is a collaboration. It is by all of us. And some of these women face great difficulties. Being with other women and having a space of their own and experiencing this new culture of being together, sharing together and living together means a lot to them,” informed Jayaweera.
It is also about seeing how the power dynamics works.
“So today here at the good market we are not launching a product, it is a whole process of love, care, sharing, creativity, self-esteem, self-confidence and healing. All the decisions are made as one team,” shared Jayaweera.
Jayaweera also put things in a spiritual and philosophical point of view.
Bright and cheerful
“Another person’s sorrow somehow affects me. I am a part of you. Even though I don’t know you, if you are next to me, if you are bright and cheerful, you give me energy. Even though I don’t know you, I look at you and feel positive. If you are sad then that energy affects me. That is how I see the world.
As I said before I am a strong believer of interdependence. My existence means everybody’s existence and everything’s existence. Without this whole environment we are in now, I am not here. It is a story about all of us. That is why we have called this program ‘WOMAN’, it is a story of rising women. That is what I believe and that is what has made me do all these things,” elucidated Jayaweera.
WOMAN has 30 community leaders and all are women. They work with 150 women who are affected by war as well different forms of violence who are located in Jaffna, Pollonnaruwa, Batticaloa and Anuradhapura. There are two Women’s Hubs in Colombo and in Anuradhapura. The women meet here.
