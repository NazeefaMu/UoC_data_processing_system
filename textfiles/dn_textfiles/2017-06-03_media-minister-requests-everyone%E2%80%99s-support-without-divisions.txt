Media Minister requests everyone’s support without divisions

The government’s policies are being implemented on three main pillars,democracy, reconciliation, and development, newly appointed Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The minister was addressing senior officials of the Mass Media Ministry, Government Information Department and other representatives from the affiliated institutions yesterday morning.
He requested the support of every media for the successful implementation of government’s development drive despite the differences in race, religion and politics. “Sri Lanka has one of the most active media industries in the region,”he added.
Samaraweera said that they have already started the process of giving the executive powers to Parliament. The government always listens to the voice of every community and no country can go forward if it is divided. Although Sri Lanka was a country which could become developed after winning independence in 1948, not taking the right decisions at right time due to various divisions disturbed it. The Minister said that they are planning to establish an Education Authority and by establishing private universities the children of the country will get education while about 30 -40% will win scholarships too.
The Minister further said that many powerful countries in the world extend invitations to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as they maintain a friendly foreign policy with all countries and Sri Lanka should use this opportunity for the development of the country.
