Würth Group makes donation  to UNICEF

Within the framework of a worldwide ride-along campaign, Würth customers were given the opportunity to purchase a limited-edition magazine screwdriver. For every screwdriver sold, the Würth Group donated one euro to UNICEF.
For more than 30 years, R.W. WORKOUT Week has been a firm part of the cooperation between in-house staff and sales force of the Würth Group companies. During this ride-along campaign, in-house employees accompany sales representatives on their daily customer visits. This does not only help their cooperation but also gives sales force and customers the chance to suggest improvements and ideas to in-house staff in personal conversations.
This year, a donation campaign and a limited-edition product were integrated in R.W. WORKOUT Week. Würth customers could purchase a magazine screwdriver with signature of Professor Reinhold Würth and matching belt pouch. For each screwdriver of this limited edition sold, one euro is donated to UNICEF.
In this way, 120,000 Euros were collected in worldwide sales activities. Würth Lanka too participated in this campaign following tradition, and contributed 1 euro for every magazine screw driver sold in Sri Lanka. Wurth Lanka wishes to thank its customers to have made this possible.
Bettina Würth, Chairwomen of the Advisory Board of the Würth Group, handed over the symbolic check to UNICEF on Tuesday. “It is part of our corporate culture to get involved and make a social contribution. Therefore, I am particularly delighted that this donation can be made thanks to the commitment of different companies of the Würth Group. This proves once more that our corporate culture is lived in all companies,” explains Bettina Würth.
The donation will benefit a social project in the Philippines supported by UNICEF. The Molave Youth Home in Quezon City looks after children and adolescents who come into conflict with the law and helps them reintegrate into society and try a new beginning.
The Würth Group is the world’s market leader in its core business, the trade in assembly and fastening materials. It currently consists of more than 400 companies in over 80 countries with more than 75,000 employees on its payroll. Approximately 32,000 of those employees are salaried sales representatives. In the Group’s core business, the Würth Line, the sales program for the trades and industry comprises more than 125,000 products: from screws, screw accessories and anchors to tools, technical chemicals and personal protective equipment.
The Allied Companies of the Würth Group, which either operate in business areas related to its core business or in diversified business areas, round off the range by offering products for DIY stores, material for electrical installations, electronic components such as circuit boards, and financial services. They account for more than 40 percent of the Würth Group’s sales volume.
