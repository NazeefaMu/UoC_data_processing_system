IELTS Marketing Manager visits Sri Lanka

IELTS, the English test for study, migration or work is recognised in over 140 countries worldwide including the USA.
Amy E. Carter, Senior Marketing Manager from IELTS USA was in Sri Lanka recently speaking at the Fulbright Commission in Colombo, to students hoping to travel to the US for study.
IELTS USA was established in 1999, and has since been widely accepted and used by over 3000 US institutions as an accurate measure of English language skills at all levels. IELTS stands for International English Language Testing System, and measures the language proficiency of people who want to study or work in a country where English is used as the primary language of communication.
There are two tests available; Academic, for those applying for higher education and professional registration, and General Training for those migrating to Australia, Canada and the UK, or applying for secondary education, training programmes and work experience in an English-speaking environment. Both test four language skills of listening, reading, writing and speaking.
In the US, IELTS has increased in popularity with education institutions that need to use English proficiency tests to measure language capability when they recruit students.
IELTS’ partner in Sri Lanka, The British Council, offers an IELTS scholarship that runs annually. A student intending to study in the USA is selected each year.
