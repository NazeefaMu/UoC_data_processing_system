Record partnership fails to stop Australia from winning

DELHI: A record second wicket partnership of 75 for Sri Lanka between skipper Chamari Atapattu and Dilani Manodara who both made identical scores of 38 apiece failed to stop defending champs Australia from winning by nine wickets in a crucial World Twenty20 Women's cricket match played at Feroz Shah Kotla grounds here on Thursday.
Three-time champions Australia cruised to their target of 124 through their second wicket pair Elyse Villani and captain Meg Lanning who put on 98 runs off 13.1 overs without being separated after losing Alyssa Healy for 12 in the fifth over.
On a placid pitch the Lankan bowlers had to come up with something special to stop Australia, but it was not forthcoming and Villani who was named Player of the Match and Lanning batted without any difficulty to remain unbeaten on 53 off 39 balls (9 fours) and 52 off 52 balls (7 fours) respectively when victory was achieved with 14 balls to spare.
Sri Lanka failed to build on the start given by Atapattu and Manodara and from 89-3 from 13 overs, lost their way and eventually ended disappointingly on 123-8. They managed only 34 off the last seven overs and lost four wickets.
What was impressive about the Lankan Women's batting during the record breaking partnership was the running between the wickets of Atapattu (38 off 32 balls, 4 fours) and Manodara (38 off 35 balls, 5 fours) that had the Australians rattled for a while.
They batted with a positive intent constantly stealing singles and putting the Australian fielders under pressure. Even the bowlers struggled to maintain a consistent line and length against the right-left hand combination.
But once the pair was separated, Australia tightened the screws on the rest of the batting and did not concede a single boundary in the last 26 balls. It was the first time the two countries had met in a T20 International and it ended on a disappointing note for Sri Lanka.
Atapattu said she was proud of her batting performance and that they tried to score more runs in the first 10 overs but was disappointed they lost too many wickets towards the end.
Lanning paid tribute to Sri Lanka's top order batting and said that they got off to an excellent start and it looked like they would be chasing something like 140-150, but her bowlers managed to pull it back towards the end which left them with a chase able target.
Sri Lanka who has one win over Ireland under their belt will play South Africa in their final group match at Bangalore on March 28.
