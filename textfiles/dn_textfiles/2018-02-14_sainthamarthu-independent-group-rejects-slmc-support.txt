Sainthamarthu Independent Group rejects SLMC support

"The Independent Group representing the Sainthamarthu Village won all wards and secured nine seats. It will not support any political party in the governance of the Kalmunai Municipal Council," Sainthamaruthu-Malihaikadu Jummah Mosque President Y.M. Haneefa said.
He was addressing a media conference held on Monday at the Sainthamarthu Grand Jummah Mosque urging the government to declare a council to Sainthamarthu. The media conference was held following the statement made by Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader and Minister Rauff Hakeem.
Rauff Hakeem in his statement, called on the Independent Group to form the rule in the Kalmunai Municipal Council with the SLMC.
During the local government election campaign, Rauff Hakeem assured that he would extend the mayorship to Sainthamarthu and change the name of the municipality to Sainthamarthu-Kalmunai.
The Independent Group obtained 13,239 votes and secured nine seats including three from the bonus slot, while the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress secured 12 seats.
"We request the government to declare a council. Political party leaders gave false promises during the election campaigns to get our votes for their parties. They disappointed us many a time," Haneefa said.
