The Question of harassment

Harvey Weinstein was publicly accused, in well-documented news reports, of sexually abusing young women compounded by intimidation. It has led to a stream of allegations resulting in several well known public figures being names, some apologising, resigning from office, staying put or fighting back.

When should politicians accused of sexual misconduct resign?
Calling for someone’s resignation is not something anyone should take lightly. Indeed, such a call should be made with great care and context as the Detroit Free Press Editorial Board showed last week in a thorough, thoughtful editorial calling on Conyers to leave his “long and complicated legacy” behind and immediately step down. Instead, Conyers said Sunday he would step aside as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee to allow due process during an ethics panel investigation while denying he acted inappropriately.
Meanwhile, in Sacramento, Assemblyman Raul Bocanegra, D-Pacoima, resigned amid sexual harassment allegations and Sen. Tony Mendoza, D-Artesia, facing his own sexual harassment scandal, was stripped of his leadership positions, including chairmanship of the banking committee, pending an investigation.
This quartet has little in common except that all four men are Democratic officials entrusted with power by the public. Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore in Alabama stands accused of sexual misconduct, and President Donald Trump faced allegations as a candidate. Like Trump, Moore denied allegations, resisted calls to withdraw and called accusers liars.
Ultimately, voters decide who to elect or re-elect. But if the threshold for resignation isn’t universal because of the variables in every case and political parties’ reluctance to reject their own, there are still policies everyone might support: Harassment claims should be handled as consistently, quickly and publicly as possible, protecting the rights of all, starting with victims.
Eight questions we need to ask ourselves in the wake of America’s sexual assault reckoning
1. What are appropriate consequences for sexual predation? Assuming a harasser isn’t famous, what form of justice can his victim expect? So far, the tacit consensus seems to be that they shouldn’t get to work in their chosen careers. For how long? If the victim is tasked with publicly judging an apology (or otherwise absolving her harasser), doesn’t that just open her up to being pressured behind the scenes? What do we as a society want from this process we’re being forced to collectively improvise? Punishment? Rehabilitation? Restitution?
2. What are the hierarchies of harm? This is tough; sexual assault and sexual harassment exist on a worryingly wide spectrum, and the damage is hard to objectively measure. But it must at least be attempted. As Michelle Goldberg says at The New York Times, “Weinstein’s sadistic serial predation isn’t comparable to Louis C.K.’s exhibitionism. The groping Franken has been accused of isn’t in the same moral universe as Moore’s alleged sexual abuse of minors.” The terms we have — sexual harassment, sexual misconduct — are such blunt instruments that they practically force false equivalences. If we’re going to take this seriously, let’s take it seriously. We need to radically expand our glossary for sexual misbehaviour so that we may precisely address the sheer range of sexualized abuse to which people are routinely subjected.
3. What should men who know they’re guilty of sexual misconduct do? The Establishment’s IjeomaOluo suggests that, rather than wait to be denounced, they should come forward and face the music. It’s the right thing to do. Others have suggested some kind of “truth and reconciliation committee” — complete with amnesties — whereby harassers could confess to all the reprehensible things they’ve done. The merits of this are largely academic: It would be useful to have as complete a picture of exactly what our workplace culture has been, and it might be validating to victims. On the other hand, this robs people whose entire careers have been derailed of more forceful remedies. Are there other solutions?
4. How does a culture standardize its approach across industrial and political divides? Is this even possible, given how different the incentives and power structures are? Mike Allen at Axios points out that certain industries have remained hitherto untouched: “The wave has yet to hit the New York corporate suites. I’m told they’re hardly immune,” he writes. It’s possible there simply aren’t any allegations; it’s also possible that some industries are still managing to pressure victims into keeping quiet. Academia, for instance, has shown itself to be remarkably resistant to addressing sexual misconduct. The restaurant industry is just barely starting to take this stuff seriously. Politically, too, there are splits emerging between those who are ethical and those who are tactically-minded.
5. Why haven’t past solutions worked? Why, in particular, have HR solutions failed?
6. Now that so many people finally see the scope of the problem, how do we deal with how repugnant our beliefs were?
While there were no social or professional repercussions for men who violated their female employees, there isn’t a single man in the world who thought groping his secretary was good, upstanding behaviour. As CBS News president David Rhodes said in the internal memo announcing Charlie Rose’s termination, “what may have once been accepted should not ever have been acceptable.” We all knew sexual harassment was wrong. We tolerated it anyway. Why? More importantly: How do we stop?
7. How do we come to terms with how awful so many people seem to have been? When someone you love is accused of doing a terrible thing, how will you reconcile your ethics with your affection?
8. How do we move toward a truly equitable society?
It’s possible if we keep asking careful questions and try to answer them while fully acknowledging their difficulties and contradictions, there’s a small but real chance we might channel all that fear and anger into change that lasts.
