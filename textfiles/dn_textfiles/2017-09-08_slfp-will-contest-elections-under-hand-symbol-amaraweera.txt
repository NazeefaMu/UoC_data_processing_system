SLFP will contest elections under the 'hand' symbol : Amaraweera

UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said SLFP will not contest an election under any other symbol than the “hand”. He added that he believed that the unity government would have achieved its purpose by 2020.
Amaraweera added that the SLFP was determined to form an SLFP-led UPFA government after 2020.
The two major parties which signed the MoU to govern together came to an end last month but the two parties have agreed to go it together until December 31.
“By that time, we would have saved Sri Lanka from international investigations, we have removed the EU ban on fisheries, won GSP plus back, able to bring democracy and the biggest victory would be to change the electoral system,” explained Amaraweera. UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim, however, has stated that his party looked forward to continuing the partnership beyond 2020.
“We are happy that he looks upon us in such a favourable light but we want our own government now,” said the UPFA General Secretary in response to his UNP counterpart.
