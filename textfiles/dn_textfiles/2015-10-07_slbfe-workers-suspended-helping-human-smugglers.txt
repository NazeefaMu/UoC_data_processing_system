SLBFE workers suspended for helping human smugglers

Four employees of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE), who were alleged to have helped human smugglers, have been suspended with immediate effect on the orders of Minister Thalatha Athukorala. According to a bureau spokesman, the SLBFE officers who were suspended from duty had been working at the Katunayake airport.
The four officers were alleged to have helped racketeers runing a lucrative human smuggling racket where Sri Lankans, especially women had been sent overseas on employment with the aid of visit Visas.
The incident came to light when 11 Sri Lankans who left for Kuwait seeking employment on tourist visas on October 1 were deported to the country by Kuwaiti authorities.
The group were nabbed by Kuwaiti authorities following the perusal of their documents.
The 11 were residents of Matara, Valachenai, Padaviya, Kalutara, Avissawella and Rakwana areas. Preliminary investigations by the SLBFE has revealed that some of the job seekers have children under the age of five and they had not received training before leaving the country for employment.
