Sri Lanka Retailers’ Association’s AGM today

The Sri Lanka Retailers’ Association (SLRA), the apex association for the retail industry, is to hold its second Annual General Meeting this evening (November 27, 2018) at Hotel Ramada.
Sidath Kodikara, CEO of Cargills Food Company and current Vice Chairman is tipped to be the Next Chairman of SLRA, taking over from Hussain Sadique who has been Founder Chairman of the SLRA from its inception in October, 2015. Hussain Sadique, Group Director of Hameedia, and Leonard Perera, Founder Convenor and Head of Business of SLRA, founded the SLRA in October of 2015 together with leading professionals of top retail corporates.
The SLRA was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in June 2016, and began operation under the aegis of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce as the SLRA Secretariat in September 2016. The SLRA unifies the retail industry to work together towards a common industry goal.
SLRA’s vision is to achieve “Retail Excellence” and its mission is to be the “Voice of Retail” in Sri Lanka. The association works to improve the retail industry and its professionals, and thereby improve consumer experience and service in all facets of retailing, in line with achieving retail excellence.
The Association recognises 4 compelling national needs which are impacted by retail. These are contribution to the economy, contribution to society, promoting Sri Lanka as a preferred tourist destination, and driving innovation and technology in the country. In these, retail plays a major role and it has the potential to drive the development of Sri Lanka. The SLRA seeks to harness the collective efforts of its members in meeting these common goals.
SLRA’s membership is represented by over 40 leading corporates in diverse sectors varying across FMCG, clothing, fashion and jewelry, household and consumer durables, footwear and accessories, E-commerce, entertainment and QSR and healthcare.
Being a member of the SLRA entails that the company is in line with the goals of the SLRA, adopting best practices to create an outstanding reputation for retail in Sri Lanka compared to the rest of the region.
The SLRA has several ongoing initiatives in its continuing partnership with the Government to make Sri Lanka a Retail hub and preferred Shopping destination in the region; having organized the Colombo International Shopping Festival (CISF) in October 2017 and the Tourism VAT Refund Scheme (TVRS) implemented at the Bandaranaike International Airport in September, 2018.
SLRA is also working with Government agencies in its ‘Green Retail’ initiative to reduce polythene and plastic usage at retail outlets. The SLRA organizes Forums such as its Annual flagship event; the Sri Lanka Retail Forumand Training programmes under its Retail Academy, in order to facilitate knowledge sharing and networking within the industry.
