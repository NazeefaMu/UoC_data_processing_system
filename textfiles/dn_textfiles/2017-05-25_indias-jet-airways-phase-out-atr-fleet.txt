India's Jet Airways to phase out ATR fleet

Jet Airways (9W, Mumbai Int'l) is planning to transition its fleet to an all-jet composition following reports it is looking to retire its fleet of Avions de Transport Régional turboprops.
The Indian carrier currently operates fifteen ATR72-500s and three -600s on scheduled passenger flights connecting India's Tier I cities with smaller Tier II and III towns.
