Sanasa Insurance wins ACCA Sustainability Reporting Award

Sanasa Insurance Company Ltd (SICL), a leading micro insurance provider with an aim to improve and uplift peoples’ lives all across the country, emerged as the winner in the SME category at the recent ACCA Sustainability Reporting Awards.
Held at Cinnamon Grand on February 28, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) Sri Lanka rewarded the country’s most transparent, accountable and responsible entities at its annual flagship event, which is a competition with a view to recognizing business entities striving to comply with GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) standards and have demonstrated excellence in sustainable development.
Indika Kiriwandeniya, General Manager of SICL, said ‘We are delighted to have been recognized as one of the most responsible business entities in Sri Lanka. This goes on to exhibit our commitment in going beyond the expectation in improving quality of lives and also posses the highest level of sustainability compliance in the industry.’
The company seeks to uplift peoples’ lives by focusing on them at a grass root level as most have no access to financial assistance from banks due to a lack of assets.
Sanasa maintains relationships with 8400 societies throughout the villages in Sri Lanka, with a membership of over 3 million Sri Lankans. The micro insurance schemes offered by the company are available to every member through these societies.
The event recognized companies under the categories Conglomerates and Diversified, Banking, Financial Services and Insurance, SME (turnover less than Rs. 1 bn), Retail and Trading, Leisure and Connected Services and General Services and Utilities.
Sanasa Insurance Company Ltd is a leading micro insurance provider focused on uplifting and empowering the people at the grass root level.
