Meghan Markle will never become the 'People's Princess'

His biography of Princess Diana took the world by storm in 1992 after he published details of her mental health battle and heartache over Camilla.
And Andrew Morton, 64, has now weighed in on the world's newest royal-to-be Meghan Markle, claiming that she will never replace Diana as the 'People's Princess'.
'The mass media has been looking for a golden goose and Diana died,' Andrew told The Morning Show's Kylie Gillies and Larry Emdur this Wednesday.
'They thought at first it would be Kate, and to a degree it was. And now it is Meghan. I'm afraid to say, folks, there is only one Diana and sadly, she has passed,' he went on. Andrew, who recently announced his plans to pen a tell-all biography about Meghan Markle, also claimed that Diana would have approved of Harry's bride.
'I think she would have been very impressed by Meghan. She was someone who always had ambitions to be a speech maker and Meghan spoke at the UN Women's conference. She is very fluent and articulate.'
'She has elements that Diana always wanted to be, and she is also someone like Diana who wants to give back, who wants to get involved with the community and articulating some of the issues that we'd rather not talk about.' In December last year, Andrew sent tongues wagging after he Tweeted about Meghan's biography, writing: 'Excited to be writing Meghan Markle's story. She has bags of charisma. A royal star who will have tremendous impact on royal family and wider world.' According to The Bookseller, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, will be published on April 19, 2018, a month before the former Suits star weds Prince Harry at Windsor Castle. There is no suggestion, however, that Meghan has co-operated in any way with Morton's latest book.
Andrew wrote international bestseller Diana: Her True Story in 1992 as well as a revised edition after her death based on taped responses from Diana to his written questions.
Those recordings, about seven hours of taped responses, were secretly made in Kensington Palace in 1991 during a series of interviews conducted through an intermediary, Dr James Colthurst.
