Tell us a little about yourself.
I am Pasan Budsara Perera, I am 17 years old. I study at Colombo International School. I am currently doing my AS1 in Business Studies and Accounting. I play basketball and rugby. I have been modeling for around six months now.
QL Tell us a bit about your family-parents and siblings.
My Father is Pathmakumara Perera. My mother is Sriyani Abeygunawardana. I have two sisters Asha Balasuriya, Sapna Perera and one brother Mahesh Perera. I am the youngest in the family.
How does it feel to be the youngest child?
Ha, ha. I always end up getting blamed for things and I have to listen to a couple of lectures from my siblings about studying on a daily basis. Sometimes they complain about how I am chilling too much while they work too hard but they are all very supportive. They love me very much.
What made you enter into the field of modeling and what inspired you to become a fashion icon?
I have been in the industry for six months now. I was passionate about modeling since childhood. From small days I was interested in the field and I used to see my sisters’ friends who were models and I thought I should try it too. Then I joined Brian Kerkoven’s agency and he encouraged me to come so far. It is mostly my passion that made me enter the field. It is pretty challenging and exciting!
Tell us about your experience at Mister Teen International 2017.
It was the first pageant that I took part in. It was definitely a great experience for me. Brian wanted me to take part in the pageant and it was definitely worth it. I met so many people and made a bunch of new friends. Everyone was really friendly and easy to work with. It was nice to see people from different countries and different cultures coming together. The exposure was great especially since I am still very young. I was confidant with what I was doing and I am extremely happy with my performance.
What were the best memories from the pageant?
The best moment was the winning moment. The swimsuit shoot was another unforgettable experience though it was the most embarrassing thing for me to do all the posing!
How has the support been from everyone around you?
The support was just great. From family and friends to school, everyone was just so supportive. So many people came to the airport to see me and I didn’t expect so much love. My school had put up banners and all to celebrate my victory and it was so nice to see all that. Even with the voting, my friends helped immensely. I was able to get more than 2000 votes thanks to all my friends and fans. I must thank Brian Kerkoven for bringing me thus far and training me, Kamil Hewavitharana for the wardrobe advice, Hiran Wijesekara for the dance choreography and traditional costume designing done for me. I am so blessed to have a very supportive bunch around me.
What are your hobbies?
I love to restore vintage and classic vehicles cars and run them. I also engage in charity work. I am a car collector so I am very passionate about classic cars! I have around 15 classic cars. I basically restore the cars with the help of an engineer. I do a test run twice a month.
Are you an animal lover?
Yes, of course. I love dogs! I had four Grade Danes in my younger days but sadly they passed away due to old age and a snake bite. It was very saddening.
Who are your role models?
Jeff Seid and our very own Daham Dias.
What’s your favourite attire and what type fashion trends do you follow?
I am more into casual wear but I like Tuxedos as well. Colour coordination is a must for me! I love to match my shoes with my outfits.
What’s your workout and skincare routine like?
I hit the gym every day of the week. I focus more on building my upper body and chest which I allocate three days for and then the rest of the days I do some cardio and legs. I trim my hair often and go for my facials every month. I love using hair mousse to style my hair!
How do you spend your weekends and holidays?
I usually cook my breakfast and sometimes I cook for my family too. I make my own meals and then I hit the gym. I hangout with my friends and maybe go for a dinner out with my family.
What’s your favourite place in Sri Lanka?
Nuwara Eliya. That is like the best place to go with my family! With friends anywhere is fun as long as they are around. I am a party animal so I love happening places.
How does it feel to be famous?
Firstly, you cannot do anything silly in public because everyone is watching you and they know who you are so every move you make counts. It is cool though to be loved by many people. People ask me to pose for pictures with them and they click so many selfies. All in all it’s great!
What are your future plans?
I want to pursue a degree in Accounting and I am looking forward to taking part in more pageants. I am also hoping to take part in Mr Asia.
What’s your message to the youth?
Be confident and put yourself out to achieve what you want to achieve. Give your very best in what you do and don’t let anything stop you.
