D’Almeida to share insights on  ‘What it takes to be a CEO’

Coffee with CEO is a new Talk Series hosted by Young Leaders, a Steering Committee of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, with Frimi on board as the strategic sponsor. Coffee with CEO will be interactive sessions that facilitate a two-way dialogue between youth leaders and a business idol.
The business idol featured in the inaugural Coffee with CEO will be Peter D’Almeida, Managing Director and CEO of N-able.
He founded N-able in 2008 with 12 others, and today it employs over 200 people, and provides technology-enabled business solutions; ‘connecting people and things, with insight, for an efficient and intelligent world’.
D’Almeida will share his insights on “What it takes to be a CEO” on September 17, 2018, from 5pm at Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo, at the first of the Coffee with CEO series.
