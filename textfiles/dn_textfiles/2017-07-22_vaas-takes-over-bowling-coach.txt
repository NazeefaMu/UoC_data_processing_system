Vaas takes over as bowling coach

Bangladesh CB interested in Ramanayake:
Chaminda Vaas will replace Champaka Ramanayake as Sri Lanka's bowling coach. Ramanayake, who resigned after the series against Zimbabwe, cited “personal reasons” for ending a two-year stint following his reappointment in 2015.
SLC made Vaas’ appointment official on Friday, saying the former fast bowler “will guide the pace attack for the India tour of Sri Lanka”. Since August 2016, Vaas has been working with Sri Lanka's feeder squads into the national team.
Ramanayake has said he is considering several options for his next assignment. ESPNcricinfo has learned that the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is firm in its interest to bring him back under its wing. It is not clear what role he is being offered but there's a strong suggestion, especially with Courtney Walsh's appointment as Bangladesh's bowling coach, that Ramanayake will be assigned to the BCB's high performance unit.
Ramanayake was the first bowling coach appointed by the BCB in March 2008 after heading Sri Lanka's fast-bowling academy for seven years.
He is highly regarded among the current lot of Bangladesh fast bowlers, particularly for guiding many of them in their youth during his stint. He has often been credited with the rise of Rubel Hossain and Shafiul Islam.
For Vaas, the role is only temporary for now, but he has done the job in the past, having been the national team's bowling coach between February 2013, and April 2015. He has also had coaching positions with New Zealand and Ireland in brief stints.
