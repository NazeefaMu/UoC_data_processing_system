New safety  measures at Kandy Teaching Hospital to  prevent A1H1

The Kandy Teaching Hospital yesterday adopted a number of safety measures on the instructions of epidemiologists to prevent the spread of the A1H1 virus, after two patients in the Kidney Unit, died of the virus on Thursday.
The patients in the unit suspected to be infected with the virus are being treated in isolation to prevent the spread of the virus to other units.
Hospital Director Dr. Saman Ratnayake said pregnant and breast feeding mothers and children are more vulnerable to the virus and should refrain from visiting the hospital unless an urgency. He said those visiting patients in hospital can wear a mask to protect themselves from the virus. An investigation has been initiated after two patients in the kidney unit died of AHINI on Thursday. The hospital authorities have also displayed a banner warning patient and visitors to be vigilant and take precautionary measures against the virus.
