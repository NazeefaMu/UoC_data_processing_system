Ceylinco Life policyholders in Rome

It was more than a case of doing what the Romans do when a group of Ceylinco Life policyholders and their families spent four days in the Eternal City recently courtesy of the life insurance leader.
The group, comprising of the grand prize winners in the 11th edition of Ceylinco Life’s Family Savari promotion, undertook a city tour, visited the Vatican Museum, the Sistine Chapel, St Peter’s Basilica, the Colosseum, Piazza Navona and the Pantheon and enjoyed a grand farewell dinner and get-together on the last day of the tour.
Rome was the fifth European destination offered as the grand prize in the Family Savari promotion series, following previous visits by Ceylinco Life policyholder families to cities in France, Switzerland, Germany and England. Ceylinco Life has also treated winners to holidays in Japan, China, Dubai and Singapore.
In May this year, Ceylinco Life hosted two other groups of policyholder families, from 200 people that had won a visit to Singapore and 4,000 that were chosen for a day’s outing at the Leisure World theme park under Family Savari 11. Another 40 people representing 10 policyholder families have won a holiday in China which is due to take place from 28th June to 1st July.
All expenses pertaining to these tours including accommodation in 4-star hotels, guided tours, air fares and excursions, are borne by Ceylinco Life.
Conducted annually since 2006, the Ceylinco Life Family Savari promotion is intended to increase the penetration of life insurance and to reward policyholders for keeping their policies active. It is the largest customer promotion in Sri Lanka’s insurance industry. In all, Family Savari 11 produced 4,260 winners from 1,065 policyholder families, an increase of 2,000 people over the 2,260 rewarded annually at previous Family Savari promotions. Since its inception, nearly 24,000 people have won overseas holidays or an excursion to the Leisure World theme park under this programme.
