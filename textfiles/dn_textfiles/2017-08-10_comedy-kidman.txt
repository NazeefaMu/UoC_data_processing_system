As reported by JustJared.com, the 50-year-old actress revealed that she never gets offered funny roles and she would “absolutely” do more TV, at the event.
“I would love to be able to do a comedy,” Nicole said, adding, “I never get offered them. I always get offered dramas. In this stage of my life, I am so up for anything. I’m willing to fall flat on my face. I know how to get back up again. I’m willing to get back up again.” The actress, who was recently nominated for an Emmy for her role in the miniseries Big Little Lies, added that she is now eager to try any role and isn’t worried about failure.
