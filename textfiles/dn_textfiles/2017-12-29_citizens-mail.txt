Citizens' Mail

Right to sleep
There does not seem to be any solution the hazard of sleep dearth. Hence, a healthy nation in the foreseeable future is just ‘a dream’! Even the present laws against sound pollution are not effectively implemented. It is a real shame that all authorities continue to be deaf to this deadly menace, to children and adults alike. Horning is permitted even at 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. disturbing those in deep slumber causing many health problems. Heavy vehicles like containers and trucks carrying empty containers continue to rattle causing disturbances to those asleep. Also use of electronic equipment including loud radios cause havoc to one’s sleep at all hours of the night.
When will those in authority effectively ban all offenders even with a stiff fine as a deterrent? So far, zero has been done.
