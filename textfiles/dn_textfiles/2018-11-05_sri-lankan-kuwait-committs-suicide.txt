Sri Lankan in Kuwait committs suicide

A Sri Lankan died jumping from his ninth-floor apartment in Hawally in Kuwait yesterday (3).
He had committed suicide following a fight with his wife. He had stabbed her several times before committing suicide.
Kuwaiti Security sources said neighbours reported that they heard the fight, and when the couple were silent, they thought that they had stopped fighting. They had then heard a loud thud when the man’s body hit the ground.
Reportedly, the husband died instantly, but the wife was found alive.
She was admitted to the Mubarak Hospital - Kuwait Times
