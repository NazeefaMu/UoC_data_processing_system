Raw material shortage forces matchstick producers to put up shutters

local matchstick factories have put up shutters due to a shortage of potassium chloride and red phosphorus needed as raw material for matchstick production. The closure of factories has thrown nearly 800 workers out of employment.
This was disclosed by a delegation of the Sri Lanka Matchbox Producers’ Association and the All Ceylon Matchbox Industrialists’ Association, which called on the Malwatte Mahanayake Thera Most Venerable Thibottuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera in Kandy to apprise him about their problems, yesterday.
Speaking to the media after meeting the prelate, representative of the Sri Lanka Matchbox Producers’ Association Dhammika Walisundara said the country may encounter a severe shortage of matchsticks next month as a result of the closure of these factories. He said this crisis occurred due to the stoppage of potassium chloride and red phosphorus imports a few months ago. Non-import of this vital raw material forced match factories which were nearly 30 years old, to close down.
He said due to this crisis, with depleting stocks, there is a possibility that the price of a box of matches would rise to Rs. 100 in the near future.
