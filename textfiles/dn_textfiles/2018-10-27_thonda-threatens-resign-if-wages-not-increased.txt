Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) Leader and Parliamentarian Arumugam Thondaman said that he will resign from Parliament next Tuesday (30) unless the basic wages of estate workers are not increased to Rs.1,000 each by estate companies.

He was addressing the media at the Primary Industries Ministry at Battaramulla yesterday.
Estate workers especially in the tea plantation sector have been resorting to trade union action demanding for an increase in their wage to Rs.1,000 per day.

“The death anniversary of late Minister Saummiyamurthi Thondaman falls next Tuesday,October 30 and therefore that day is significant for the CWC.
The CWC urges the estate companies to come to a conclusion to pay this salary hike at least by that day (October 30) or otherwise, I will resign from Parliament and launch a huge campaign from November 6 aiming to meet the estate workers demands,” he said.
