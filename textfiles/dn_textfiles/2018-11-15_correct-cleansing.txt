Correct cleansing!

Cleansing has come a long way. With many types of foaming face washes, cleansing milks and gels in the market you need to select the right cleanser for your skin. Whatever the texture or type of your skin, it requires thorough cleansing. Give your face the right kind of cleansing treatment by following these guidelines.
 Non-comedogenic products
The word ‘comedo’, or plural ‘comedones’, refers to a type of imperfection that forms on the skin. These blemishes are a result of clogged pores and are considered one of the milder forms of acne.
Non-comedogenic indicates that a product has been formulated to avoid causing clogged pores. Generally non-comedogenic products will be oil-free. It is important to note however that while these products do not claim to cure or treat acne-prone skin, they make sure the formulations won’t block your pores which can be one of the main causes of spots, making it an ideal formulation in the quest to prevent spots occurring in the first place
Day creams
Day creams are generally multitasking products that moisturize skin, wear well under makeup, and sometimes contain SPF. Since you’re more exposed to the sun during the day, day creams also tend to exclude active ingredients like retinol, glycolic acid, or alpha hydroxy acids, which can all irritate the skin when exposed to the sun.
Night creams
Night creams typically have a heavier texture to deeply moisturize skin while you sleep. Your skin repairs itself the most at night, so night creams often feature active ingredients like acids and retinol to promote skin cell turnover.
Pat or rub your face dry
The skin on your face is delicate. Similar to using your ring finger to dab product onto the eye instead of rubbing it on, the same goes for the use of a towel on your face. That’s because when you wipe excess water away, you’re tugging at the skin. The likelihood for wrinkles and wear and tear increases, and you’re removing all of the moisture your skin needs prior to product application. A best practice to get used to is to pat your face dry with a clean towel.
Using a peeling product on your skin
Although different skin types require different face-peel regimens, in general, a series of three to six peels two to four weeks apart should result in a noticeable difference in skin quality.
For some patients, peel pads with low concentrations of acid, which allow patients to continue treatment at home daily or weekly.
