Thomians celebrate  100 years at Mount

The Thomian family jubilantly celebrated a special service of thanksgiving at the Chapel of the Transfiguration, on January 26 with the participation of His Eminence the Bishop of the Anglican Diocese Rt. Rev. Diloraj Canagasabey and Warden STC Rev. Marc Billimoria. It was a reflection of a splendid journey of 100 years in Mount Lavinia.
The college was originally established in Mutwal (adjacent to the Colombo Harbour) on February 3, 1851 by the dynamic priest Rt. Rev. James Chapman. Subsequently the school was relocated to her present location in 1918.
The students and old boys of STC coloured the streets with a parade to mark the event. Here are some highlights of the event captured by our photographer Saman Sri Wedage.
