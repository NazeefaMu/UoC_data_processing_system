Army to gun down with Fijian power

The Sri Lanka Army Sports Club founded in 1961 is a Division ‘A’ rugby union team based in Sri Lanka that plays in the Dialog Rugby League in Sri Lanka. In 1961 Army SC together with Division ‘B’ teams from Air Force, Navy, Police SC and University were permitted to play alongside the Division ‘A’ clubs, Ceylonese Rugby & Football Club, Colombo Hockey and Football Club, Havelock SC, Kandy SC, Dimbula Athletic & Cricket Club, Dickoya-Maskeliya Cricket Club, Uva and Kelani Valley Club in the Clifford Cup competition.
The expanded competition, allowed all thirteen clubs to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the season the best eight teams went on to play in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup.
In 1973 Army SC, captained by S.P. de Silva, shared the Clifford Cup with Police SC following a 19-all draw. It wasn’t until 1975, under Saliya Udugama, that Army SC won the Clifford Cup outright for the first time by beating Air Force SC 4–3. In 1978 the Clifford Cup was awarded to the League champions and the knockout competition was played for SLRFU President’s Trophy. In 1979 Army SC won the President’s Trophy at Galle Face, led by Daya Ratnayake, beating a strong Havelock Sports Club 21–3. In 1981 Army won the President’s Trophy again under the captaincy of John Senaweera.
Army SC this season will be captained by their hardy third row forward Manoj Silva. Former Vidyartha College Kandy centre Imanka Ariyapala will be his deputy and will continue to play as centre.
The soldiers have a very good young and experience player combination that will perform very well in the upcoming season. They are actually in the team building stage. Their aim this season will be to at least finish third or fourth in the league and to reach the semi-final stage of the Clifford Cup knockout.
The new players who will boost Army are former Police, Up Country Lions and CR & FC full back Shanaka Kumara, Peterite winger Kamesh Fernando, Dinusha Nilanga Ariyapala, younger brother of vice captain Imanka Ariyapala, fly half Ashan Bandara of Vidyartha College Kandy and full back Bavantha Perera of St. Sylvester’s College Kandy.
For the second successive year Army will be coached by famous Papua New Guinea national coach Fijian Fereti Verebula. Having the services of a foreign coach for the season will boost Army SC as Verebula has vast experience in the coaching field where he was a part of the Papua New Guinea national 7’s team and also had a coaching stint in New-Zealand premiership team. His fellow countryman Imanueli Veikoso called Rathu (Red) among players and official of Army rugby will be the fitness trainer.
