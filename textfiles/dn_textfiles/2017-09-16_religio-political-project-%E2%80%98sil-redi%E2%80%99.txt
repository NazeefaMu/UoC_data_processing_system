The religio-political project of ‘Sil Redi’

The judgement by the High Court, Colombo on the “Sil Redi” issue, apart from the sentence of imprisonment on the former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeeratunga and the former Director General of the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) Anusha Pelpita, is showing signs of moving to a major encounter between the forces of politics and the powers of the judiciary.
The fact that this was the first case involving alleged fraud and corruption under the previous Rajapaksa Regime, has certainly made it an issue with important political impact in the context of the pledge given by the Yahapalana campaigners to make the fight against corruption a key aspect of its policies. It is important to recall that the pledge in that campaign was to fight, expose and bring to book the politicians in that government who were carrying a repulsive image of their involvement in fraud and corruption. What has happened is that two public officers, have been the first to be found guilty. The question now arises as to when the politicians, whatever rank they may have held, and the members of their families and other players in that carnival of corruption would be exposed and brought to book.
Weeratunga and Pelpita have now filed their appeals against the High Court judgement in the Court of Appeal, and have thus gone back to the judiciary in the hope of obtaining acquittals, or a reduction in the convictions, in keeping with the process of law. It is important to bear in mind that the High Court in making its order in this trial was very clear that neither Weeratunga nor Pelpita had personally benefited in any way with the huge sum of Rs. 600 million involved in this exercise of the buying and distribution of Sil Redi, during the campaign of the last presidential election.
While the due process of law would take its course, very clearly demonstrating a major shift towards the independence of the judiciary in the present policies of government, the politics of Sil Redi is showing a new factor for consideration, where the Rajapaksa image, with its known buttress for corruption, is drawing both Weeratunga and Pelpita into the vortex of a crooked political cavalcade, which seeks to hide the strong image of corruption in the Rajapaksa Regime that has come out with this judgement, and carry out a mix of crooked religious with the loud politics of chicanery.
Mahinda Rajapaksa is very loud in his statements about the honesty of Weeratunga in “implementing” the “Sil Redi” policy on which he had given directions as the President, with the interest of supporting Buddhist religious activities in the country. He says publicly that he is responsible for the order, and that he has not been queried on the matter.
Religious veil
What he considers a superb tactic, in distorting the administrative realities, and supposedly trying to take the blame away from, especially Weeratunga and also Pelpita, is in fact a contemptible attitude of twisted political manipulation, that appears to shield the two persons convicted for allegedly following his instructions, but is in fact using the “Sil Redi” as a religious veil to cover his corruption, with little regard, in any, for the situation that he has pushed these two persons into, about whom he is so gladly shedding crocodile tears.
What stands out here is why he and his lawyers had to wait till the trial of the “Sil Redi” case was over, and the verdict delivered, to come out shouting that it was his order they were implementing; and carrying out a huge political-cum-religious circus to expose what he sees to be the fault of the judiciary, and show his own commitment to serve the religious needs of the Buddhist community through the powers and rights of the Executive Presidency.
It will certainly take much more of this promenade of religio-politics to make the people accept this “I am the guilty…if at all” crooked yarn. But, there is certainly the danger of this dishonest and corrupt political strategy, leading to some arousal of politically directed and manipulated Buddhist feeling, which has to be met with proper exposure of the truth with regard to the corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime.
This masquerading of honesty in government certainly calls for a stronger approach to the fight against the fraud and corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime. The veil of the Sil cloth should not be allowed to hide any more of the corruption that prevailed at the time Mahinda Rajapaksa says he issued so many orders that had to be implemented by the administration, with no fear of corruption or misdemeanor. The twisted logic of MR even goes to compare the annual distribution of school uniform material to children, with the Sil cloth project or “Sil Redi Vyapruthiya” as he calls it. He asks if the school uniform distribution would be stopped if an election is held at the end of a year, when that distribution usually takes place.
The simple answer would be that such distribution will have to be stopped if; the uniform package includes a photograph and/or message (even education concerned) by a presidential candidate or any other candidate in an election being held at the time. That is the simple reality.
The political noise that MR and his JO backers may make on this issue, including arousal of religious feelings, moving away from the realities of religion and, the possibility of Sil Redi being used as political bribes, and the various religio-political strategies that will be used with some of the yellow robe, seeks new strategies. The call now is for a more determined fight against corruption. The exposure of the corrupt forces of the past, and those who have moved towards corruption at present is the call of the day; with the advantage that honest public servants will now feel stronger to fight the forces of corruption seeking to use them for their dirty politics and filthy business.
The “Eliya” – Keliya
While the fight against corruption gained new strength, the political strategies of the defeated forces of corruption have taken a new stride in political organisation, with the launch of the “Eliya” movement, which does not bring much light as the name indicates, but throws out the so far uncertain candidate for political leadership, from the Rajapaksa family. This is the emergence of the Military cum Administrative hulk, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who has so far been trying to show that he had little interest in politics.
With the definite reality that Mahinda Rajapaksa will not be the next national leader, being kept out of the presidency by the 19th Amendment, the Rajapaksa forces have organised what is seen as a new intellectual leadership, - with academia, diplomats, clergy of different faiths, and professionals who have clearly moved to racist and majoritarian thinking, to present Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the next leader of the Sinhala majority.
The “Gota Eliya” exercise was mainly structured on criticism of constitutional changes – especially the proposal for a new Constitution, which has been a key policy issue of the Yahapalanaya alliance. The “Eliya” makes it clear that they are not in favour of any new constitution, and also oppose constitutional reforms that could lead to a wider democracy, and the progress of the thinking and policies of reconciliation and nation building.
The “Eliya” drivers must be pleased with the decision of the SLFP to oppose major constitutional reform, and instead only support constitutional amendments that will not remove the Executive Presidency.
The Eliya policies are against constitutional reform, or progress in towards wider democracy that will go against the success of the military victory against the LTTE, attempting to show that any new constitution that is being discussed today, will give to the Tamils, or to the Tamil Diaspora, what the LTTE failed to win in the battlefield. The rays of Eliya are certainly against any widening of the system of devolution introduced with the 13th Amendment.
The strategies of the “Eliya” are directed towards the expected parliamentary and presidential polls in 2020, and will seek to obtain the support of new voters, not involved in the defeat of the Rajapaksa Regime in January and August 2015. It is certainly an uphill task, but it has hope for success due to the divisions that prevail between the UNP and SLFP. However, there is also the reality of the efforts now being made to bring the SLFP and its inner rivals of the JO to come together, and also the efforts by some to bring both Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena to some understanding in the coming months, especially with local government polls.
Amidst all this complex and tortuous politics “Eliya” certainly has no easy opening for a Gotabhaya Rajapaksa candidacy for national leadership. Its success will have much more to do with giving the true light to the people on the political and social realities in the county, and not through the darkness of racist and religious extremism that hangs as the backdrop in this new political stage in the country.
