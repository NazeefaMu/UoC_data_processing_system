Brain drain in ICT sector on the decline - Ratnayake

The brain drain in the ICT sector is now reversing and this is very evident among Sri Lankans who are based overseas for 10 to 15 years, said chief Information Officer, Virtusa, Madhu Ratnayake.
Speaking at a special press conference last Saturday he said that today even the students who embark on higher education return to Sri Lanka to work. “This clearly shows that the ICT sector is becoming very lucrative in Sri Lanka,” he said.
Ratnayake added that they are happy about the attention the government is paying for the ICT sector and said Virtusa too were working with Universities in a bid to share their knowledge with the undergraduates.
Today gaming is on the palm top of almost every youth and when they do come for ICT related jobs they would have used gaming for almost 100 hours. “This is an advantage when they come for ICT related jobs in Sri Lanka which also gets snapped up immediately.”
Ratnayake said that Virtusa was recruiting youth from Sri Lanka annually and this was a sizable figure. He also said that they are also working with several Sri Lankan companies including ICTA.
“Today youth are also engaged in multiple projects for multiple companies this is giving them additional revenue ,said Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at Virtusa Corp, Keith Modder. He also said that ICT has opened new business areas that could have being done by existing companies. “Two classic examples for these include UBER and AirB&B.”
