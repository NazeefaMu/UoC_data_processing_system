The uncrowned queen

She has sown the seeds of change in many lives through her social service activities. Moved by the distress of the needy Concy Perera formed the Jeewa (Life) Foundation in 1985 under the slogan ‘We Became a Life to You.’ Ever since its inception the foundation has been spearheading a number of social service activities ranging from blood donations, health clinics, donating organs, donating school equipment to children and donating dry rations for the poor for a continuous six years.
With the dawn of 2018 the foundation will commence its social service activities again with a blood donation, organ donation registration, health clinic, eyeglass donation, school equipment donation for school children and donating dry rations for the poor at the Sudharshi Hall, Colombo 7, on January 7 from 8.30 am to 3 pm. A biography of Jeewa Foundation founder Concy Perera titled ‘Rajinak Nowu Rajinak’ penned by Dr Asela S Panditha too will be launched at the event.
The book traces her journey from organizing many relief operations on a small scale to powering large scale social service activities.
Jeewa Foundation’s theme song too will be launched at the event and musical instruments will be donated to commemorate the launch. Perera will also be felicitated with a doctorate from Russia on that day.
Perera has inherited this ability to feel others distress through her father F D Steven Perera. She says that though she was born to a family of eight, her home had been open to many poor children besides her brothers and sisters.
Thus she learnt to give and share at an early age. This habit soon snowballed into a larger scale as the years flew by.
Today Perera has helped build many lives from scratch, providing financial aid for small scale businesses to donating building equipment for houses. She had also helped many release their lands from debt, donated sewing machines, helped to construct tube wells, providing various forms of relief to Tsunami and flood victims.
“I began by helping those close to me by donations dry rations and clothes. I soon realized that there are many others who feel the pain of the needy and wish to work to help the underprivileged.
It was necessary to establish the foundation to join hands with them and work towards a worthy cause in a broader scale,” she explained.
She has also aided institutions belonging to all religions.
An annual event in her calendar is giving alms to 50 Buddhist monks at the temple of the tooth relic in Kandy. She has helped St Paul’s Church, Moratuwa, obtain electricity. She had funded to build a Buddhist temple in Japan and a kovil in Dematogoda. She provides funds to build the pandal in Dematagoda every year. She also helps young girls to get ready for their big day by funding their bridal attire and by funding their bridal dressing.
