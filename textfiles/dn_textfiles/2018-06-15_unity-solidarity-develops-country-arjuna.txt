Unity, solidarity develops country: Arjuna

Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said unity and solidarity among nationalities develops the country.
He was participating in an Iftar ceremony held at the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal Limited (CPSTL) in Kolonnawa yesterday evening.
CPC and CPSTL workers and Islam members broke the Ramadan fast at the ceremony organised under the patronage of Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga.
“Our ethnic groups had no unity in the past, but hatred and anger. They started being away from other nationalities at schools and later in the society. This government encourages unity. We as a custom celebrate Sinhala and Tamil New Year and Ramadan festivals together and shared the joy. Certain powers try to divide us. We have to discourage them,” the Minister said.
Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga said everyone should work honestly to develop the institution and the country.
“When Arjuna was the Ports Minister, we celebrated all religious ceremonies. We had undergone unfortunate events a few months ago but now we have united,” the Chairman said.
Petroleum Resources Development Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe, CPC Managing Director Neil Jayasekara and CPSTL Managing Director Sanjeewa Wiyarathna were present.
