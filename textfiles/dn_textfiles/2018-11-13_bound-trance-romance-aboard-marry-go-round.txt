Bound in a trance of romance aboard the marry-go-round!

‘And the seasons they go 'round and 'roundAnd the painted ponies go up and downWe're captive on the carousel of timeWe can't return we can only look behindFrom where we cameAnd go round and round and roundIn the circle game.’
<U+2015> Joni Mitchell, The Circle Game
There is something magical about funfairs and carnivals that defy description while thrilling the senses. The glittering lights, the scent of popcorn and cotton candy, the screams of happy riders on giant-wheels and carousels are timeless pleasures at these events.
Ever since I was this high, fun-fairs for me been charged with excitement. I love the myriad coloured lights that give cheer and enliven the venue. Besides, there's no telling what exciting things might happen.
Authentic old time carnival fun fair attractions were a great way to unwind and try your luck or skills. No matter whether you were seven or 70 everybody loved the fun fair. Fund-raising carnival booths were allowed latitude to indulge in a little betting flutter and who cared about the silly Gambling Ordinance anyway.
Small fortunes were won or lost at the Crown and Anchor or the Lucky Seven dice game where a player could bet on three numbers - below 7, above 7 or the lucky 7. On numbers below and above 7 the players got double their stake and on Lucky 7 the players raked in three times their stake. At many of these charity fund-raisers the minimum bet was 25 cents and the limit set at five rupees.
And then there was the most addictive game of skill known to every man with a penchant for throwing, meaning the Tin Can Alley stall. The objective of the game was to knock down the tower of stacked tin cans in pyramid fashion off the shelf with six tennis balls. The trick was to hit the bottom tins, ballasted with sand that formed the base of the pyramid.
A few of us were able to knock all ten tins down like ninepins! It seemed all too easy and we sometimes did it with a ball to spare. For folks of all ages it was a chance to escape the everyday monotony and enter into a world of party and fantasy. It was all about dressing up and having fun. Even in those somewhat moderate times we schoolboys were constrained to tog ourselves out in the most colourful shirts reminiscent of rodeo cowboys or mafia gangsters.
And what I liked most about the carnivals was the carousel or merry-go-round, the most popular ride which cut across all ages in appeal. Sitting atop of those beautifully decorated horses you were transformed into another world. You could be a princess riding to the ‘Kingdom of Wonderland,’ or you could be a prince on his trusty steed riding to save his princess from the evil witch.
Or maybe you were the Lone Ranger or Annie Oakley having a shootout with the kid on the other horse adjoining yours. The enchantment and beauty of the fairground with the blinking lights, imaginative creatures, swirling colours and dashing horses never failed to capture adventure in fantasy from the oldest and youngest of generations.
For kids and the youth of the 50s, 60s and 70s era the carnival was a really fun place to be. By the end of the carousel rides we were all flushed and dizzy — and ready to do it again. Waiting your turn, you were hypnotized by the smiling faces that spun past and sprayed the scene with laughter unparalleled.
And there was always the brass band that played at funerals, weddings and other mournful and celebratory events right in the thick of the spinning carousel. These middle-aged minstrels were much sought after to perform the ‘tootooing’ on their horns accompanied by the tattooing drum beats with no flagging or sense of fatigue.
Still, playing on the merry-go-rounds at carnivals they appeared at their dizzying, delirious peak filled with a wild exhilaration and an immense sense of triumph. Theirs had always been an unmatched musical style filled with full-flavoured vigour and originality. When you consider carousel rides what comes to mind will be the kids. Why do kids love spinning? It seems there’s hardly an activity more fun for little ones than twirling around in circles as fast as they possibly can, holding hands with a friend, throwing their heads back, and spinning around together. They squeal with delight, eventually falling on their backsides, loving the fact that the world continues to spin long after they’ve stopped.
Even if we dismiss merry-go-rounds as a ‘little-kiddie’ ride, they have a long-lasting universal appeal that cannot be denied. People all over the world have enjoyed these rotating transports of delight for centuries. However, carousels may also be affiliated with notions of courtship and affairs of the heart. They appear to endorse romance in a sort of nostalgic, roundabout way with folks pierced by Cupid’s arrows.
You might have probably also seen teenagers, or perhaps adults, even octogenarian couples who take advantage of the carousel. These represent the main reasons why carousel rides are often associated with ideas of romance. So it's not just a dizzying fun ride for the kids, but is also associated with folks who are in love or who crave for the days of their halcyon youth.
From the standpoint of the teenagers who have fallen for each other, they can be still, with their heart, just like a child’s. When they have always had an affinity for such rotating platforms with horses that go up and down, they could correlate these amorous emotions with the love of their lives.
While they may have outgrown a carousel, they have those feelings inside. After they fall madly in love, there exists a connection between the carousel and how they feel concerning their spouse. This may not be associated with just teenagers. It many instances it certainly does spread its spirit of romantic adventure transporting many older couples into a magical past. While for many vertigo can be experienced as a spinning sensation similar to riding a merry-go-round.
For example, you will likely seen elderly couples that happen to be relaxing in the chairs that usually come with the carousel ride. They may sit beatifically together, holding hands smiling while they go around in a state of déjà vu.
My school buddy ‘Mad’ Maurice imagined that merry-go-rounds were magical and totally underrated. He said: “I proposed to my girlfriend on a merry-go-round because I wanted to spin the rest of my life with her. As my fellow reveler buddy at the time Rufie quipped: “It’s a ticket to fun and feelin' young”. He was spot on because every funfair and carnival has been replete with a carousel of memories that can never be expunged by time.
