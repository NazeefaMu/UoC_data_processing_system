Pensioner arrested after stabbing burglar to death

British police arrested a pensioner on suspicion of murder Wednesday after a suspected burglar at his home in southeast London was fatally stabbed to death.
Officers detained the 78-year-old homeowner after responding to his call reporting a burglary in progress in the early hours of Wednesday and finding a man, aged 38, with a stab wound nearby, police said.
“The 78-year-old resident found two males inside the address,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. One suspect, armed with a screwdriver, forced the elderly man into his kitchen when he discovered them inside his home in the Hither Green area, while the other suspect went upstairs, the force added.
A struggle ensued between the homeowner and one of the men.
“The man, aged 38, sustained a stab wound to the upper body,” the statement said.
