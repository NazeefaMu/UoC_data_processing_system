Ryan Jayalath ordered to be produced before High Court over revision bail petition

 
The Colombo High Court issued an order directing the Superintendent of the Welikada Prison to produce Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath before the High Court on October 23 regarding his revision bail application, today.
 Accordingly, High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa deferred for October 23 to consider the revision bail application filed by Ryan Jayalath.
 Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath was arrested for causing damage to public property by forcibly entering the Health Ministry premises during an anti-SAITM protest and was ordered to be further remanded by the Maligakanda Magistrate.
 Through this revision application, the petitioner Ryan Jayalath sought an order against the Maligakanda Magistrate’s refusal to grant him bail.
The petitioner is seeking an order to release him on bail.
