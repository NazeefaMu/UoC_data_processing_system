Progressive SLFP ministers, MPs should support

If SLFP ministers and MPs with progressive ideas oppose the heaping of unnecessary burden on the people they should come forward to support the no-confidence motion moved against the Finance Minister, Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said.
Addressing a press conference organised by the Economic Research Unit of the Joint opposition at the Sri Vajirashrama Buddhist Centre, Punchi Borella, Gunawardena said the rupee which remained stable during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime had become unstable today and the responsibility for this outcome should be borne by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
He said the government had resorted to the printing of money to the tune of Rs. 281 billion in 2015 and this was the result of poor financial management. They in the Joint Opposition were moving the no-confidence against the Finance Minister for heaping unbearable burden on the people.
Prof. G. L. Peiris said people have been heaped with heavy burden due to the mismanagement of the economy by the Finance Minister.
The 17 percent increase on VAT had adversely affected prices of cement, sand and vehicles and badly affected industrialists and the export sector.
He alleged that certain SLFP Parliamentarians were resorting to duplicity by criticising this government and later raising their hands in Parliament in support of the government and its disruptive policies. The vote in parliament today would clearly show whether SLFP Parliamentarians were supportive or opposed to the disruptive policies of the government, he said.
