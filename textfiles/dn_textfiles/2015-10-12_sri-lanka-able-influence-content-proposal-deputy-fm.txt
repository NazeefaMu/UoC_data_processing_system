The move to co-sponsor the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka enabled the government of Sri Lanka to exhibit ownership of the suggestions in the resolution, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Harsha De Silva said.
“By co-sponsoring the resolution, we have been able to influence the content of the proposal as well,” he claimed speaking at a conference on After Geneva Proposal yesterday. “The move to co-sponsor was a decision taken by the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, not a move forced on the Sri Lankan Government,” De Silva claimed, adding that all political parties with moderate views including the Jathika Hela Urumaya and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) are in support of the move.
Dispelling accusations that the proposal was an attempt to meddle with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, the minister highlighted the resolution itself has provisions to safeguard these elements.
The minister also claimed that the government was able to avoid serious negative repercussions and economic sanctions by cooperating with the international community and winning their confidence in the current political leadership. “We have been able to avoid a collapse of the economy brought on by the economic sanctions the international community was threatening to impose on us. We have successfully negated this possibility now”. Agreeing Senior Lawyer J.C. Weliamuna said the UNHCR proposal was to be presented in March, where serious action was recommended against Sri Lanka with room to establish an international criminal court. The move was averted due to the change in political climate in the country paving the way for the current resolution.
