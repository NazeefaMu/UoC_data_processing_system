Railway earns record income via fines on errant commuters

Sri Lanka Railway has amassed a considerable income of Rs.13 million as fines from errant commuters through sudden raids and mobile inspections carried out on trains during the past eight months.
According to officials attached to the Office of the Commercial Superintendent of the Department of Railway the record revenue was earned from 9,433 fraudulent commuters as fines on trains operated in all three regional railway zones of Colombo, Nawalapitiya and Anuradhapura. Travelling in class 1 and 2 compartments with class 3 tickets, ticket-less travel and travelling beyond destinations specified in tickets were among the offences they committed. Raids and inspections were intensified and the fine charge was increased to Rs. 2500 to control the situation, railway officials said.
