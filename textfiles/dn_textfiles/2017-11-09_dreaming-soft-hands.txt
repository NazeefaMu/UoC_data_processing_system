Dreaming  of soft hands?

How to make your hands soft
1. Warm Water:
Soaking your hands in warm water is a brilliant technique for soft hands. You must get the temperature right as warm water dries the skin. Add a few drops of Lavender oil or Rose essential oil to the water. To create a fragrant and soothing experience, you can soak your hands in a basin full of warm water for ten minutes. You will feel your hands become softer, and your neighbor’s kid won’t scream when you pinch his cheeks!
 
2. Vaseline:
Vaseline is one of the most widely used moisturizers today. You should wash your hands with warm water as directed above and coat your hands with Vaseline every night before you go to bed. Alternatively, you can wear cotton gloves while sleeping. You will wake up with smooth and spongy hands the next morning. If you don’t have Vaseline, any old moisturizer will do.
 
3. Sugar And Olive Oil:
This one-minute remedy is a real winner. You can do this before you head to a party, or even if you are going out on a date. Mix 1 tablespoon of Olive Oil with a tablespoon of sugar and work it into a paste. Work the paste into your hands, paying equal attention to the palm and the cuticles. Olive oil is a great moisturizer, while sugar helps remove dead cells. Holding hands will be a divine experience for your partner.
 
4. Cream:
Malai or Cream is an effective home remedy for soft hands. This remedy is one of the simplest ones on here. Take a bit of Malai or homemade ghee and work it into the palms, nail beds, and cuticles. For best results, leave the malai on for half an hour. Wash off with warm water, avoid using soap. Although, your hands will still be a bit slick with the malai most of it will be washed away by the warm water. Your hands will become softer within a week.
 
5. Gram Flour And Curd:
Besan or Bengal gram flour can be used for things besides coating pakodas. Besan has been known to be great for all types of skin, being used to treat acne, remove discoloration and add glow to the skin. When mixed with curd, it can be used to treat dry and rough hands. Work besan and curd into a paste and apply generously to the hands. Wash it off in 15 minutes and your hands will feel as soft as a feather.
 
6. Butter And Almond Oil:
Another effective remedy to get those supple hands is a mixture of butter and almond oil. Butter lubricates the skin and the Vitamin E rich almond oil decreases fine lines and wrinkles. To make the mixture, take two teaspoons of butter and add 1 teaspoon of almond oil. Apply this evenly on your hands and leave the mixture on for 20 minutes. Wash it off with warm water and voila, and see how soft your hands feel.
 
7. Egg Yolk, Honey And Almonds:
Egg yolk contains high amounts of Vitamin A, while almonds boost the Vitamin E content in your skin. This mixture exfoliates, moisturizes and nourishes your hands, giving you those supple hands you deserve. Add 1 tsp of honey, ½ tsp of crushed almonds and a hint of rose water to an egg yolk. Work them into a paste. Massage your hands with this mixture for 10 minutes and let it stay for 15-20 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water.
 
8. Wear Gloves:
The main reason most women have rough hands is due to household chores, exposure to hard water and detergents, which sap moisture from ones’ hands. Although this is not truly a remedy, wearing rubber gloves while working in the kitchen or handling detergents can help you avoid dry and rough hands. Wearing cotton gloves overnight can also help rejuvenate the skin on your hands.
 
9. Abrasive Hand Wash:
We know all about the germ killing antiseptic hand wash that is supposed to keep your hands free from germs. What they don’t tell you is how the liquid will drain your hands of the much needed moisture. So, one way to get soft hands is to choose a moisturizing hand wash. Try to wash your hands with warm water as often as you can. Remember to pat your hands dry instead of rubbing them with a hand-towel.
 
10. Lemon And Sugar:
This is one of the oldest and most trusted remedies for soft hands. Take a half cut lemon and coat it with sugar. Scrub the lemon into the cuticles and the nail beds and the flat of your palm.
