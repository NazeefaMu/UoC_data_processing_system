Sexual abuse common in IDP camps

Sexual abuse and gender-based violence is common in IDP camps and similar environments, the Sri Lankan Family Planning Association (FPA) Medical Director Dr. Harischandra Yadandawala said. He was addressing a media workshop held at the FPA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday.
Four percent of women are always pregnant in any given group of population such as the internally displaced, refugees, etc. Out of this number, 15 percent face fatal health complications, the doctor said.
According to Dr. Yakandawala, people have more sex when they are under various pressures. They have sex with their own partner or someone else and there are lot of unwanted pregnancies occurring at IDP camps etc. due to this situation.
Transmission of Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STD) such as HIV etc. also increase at IDP camps and similar environments. Relief providers should pay special attention towards not using male workers for relief programmes and should use both male and female persons to distribute relief, he added.
When providing relief, the organizers should pay special attention towards providing sanitary pads, underwears, fully-covered places to change clothes etc. to women and children. Covered places can be created using cupboards etc. Male and female IDPs should be kept and handled separately. Separate temporary toilets, bathrooms etc. should be provided for them and 20 persons should have one toilet. One IDP should be given 20 litres of water per day, he added.
