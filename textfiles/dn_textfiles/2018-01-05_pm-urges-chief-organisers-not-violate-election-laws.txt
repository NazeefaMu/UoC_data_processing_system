PM urges chief organisers not to violate election laws

All UNP chief organizers of electorates countrywide were instructed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that they should launch their election propaganda campaigns in their respective electorates without violating election rules and regulations declared by the Election Commission.
He had advised them to set an example to the candidates of other political parties in the forthcoming local government polls, said Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam in Kuliyapitiya.
Speaking to the Daily News, he said the UNP had rendered a great service for the benefit of the country while being in a unity government for the past two and half years. No money was spent wastefully for publicity of development work by the UNP as carried out by the previous government.
All chief organizers of the UNP were instructed by the Prime Minister to visit all households in their electorates and explain the great service that the UNP has carried out so far. The Prime Minister has added that if the UNP loses a local body at the forthcoming local government polls, the respective chief organizer of the UNP has to be answerable, according to Minister Kariyawasam.
