Short of match fitness
Asela, Kusal overlooked for Test series against India

Batting all-rounder Asela Gunaratne and wicket-keeper/batsman Kusal Perera have been left out of the 15-member Sri Lanka Test squad picked for the three-Tests against India starting at Eden Gardens, Kolkata on November 16 due to match fitness.
The Lankan squad was picked yesterday and has been sent for ratification by the Minister of Sports.
“Angelo Mathews, Asela Gunaratne and Kusal Perera all passed the yoyo and skinfold tests but as Asela and Kusal were short of match fitness we did not select them,” said chairman of selectors Graeme Labrooy.
“They will probably be considered for the one-day series that starts on December 10 as they will be able to play in the Under 23 tournament that is due to commence shortly and prove their match fitness,” he said.
Each team in the Under 23 tournament is able to field at least five senior players in their side.
Kusal Perera suffers from a hamstring injury during Sri Lanka’s record run chase against India at the Oval in June.
Perera has not played any cricket since the ICC Champions trophy in June where he picked up a hamstring injury while guiding Sri Lanka to a stunning seven-wicket over India at the Oval with an innings of 47 before retiring hurt.
Gunaratne fractured the base of his left thumb attempting to take a catch in the slips offered by Indian opener Sikhar Dhawan during the first Test at Galle in July and has not played any cricket since.
The Sri Lanka team is due to leave for India on October 8.
NO APPROVAL WITHOUT FITNESS TEST REPORT
In another new development Labrooy stated that all the teams selected and sent to the Minister of Sports for ratification should have the fitness test report (ie the yoyo and skinfold tests) attached against the names of each and every player selected.
“This was a directive we received from the Sports Minister to prove that the individual selected is declared physically fit. Without the report the Minister would not accept the names. We have been following this procedure since we picked the teams for the series against Pakistan,” said Labrooy.
The Minister it is reliably learnt will be expanding this fitness test report procedure to all other sports from January 1, 2018.
