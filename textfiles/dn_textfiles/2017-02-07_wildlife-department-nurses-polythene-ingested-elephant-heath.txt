The Giritale Wildlife Department nursed to health an elephant that was found to have consumed vast amounts of polythene.
The elephant was found lying in a swamp at Manampitiya, Nelumwila on January 29.
The Giritale Wildlife Department said the elephant was moved out of the swamp with a backhoe and treated with 30 bottles of saline.
