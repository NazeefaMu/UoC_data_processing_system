Jeep Club of Sri Lanka Annual Expedition 2016: Jeep conquers coast less travelled in Sri Lanka

Jeep Sri Lanka frequently organizes outdoor adventure activities for their loyal customers who loves to go anywhere, do anything. Adventure is a part of the DNA of every Jeep Brand vehicle ever built and as long as curiosity drives man to explore the edges of heaven and earth, the Jeep Brand will continue to inspire him to go beyond. Freedom, adventure and passion are some of the core values of Jeep.
Jeep Club of Sri Lanka’s Annual Expedition was themed the ‘Coast Less Travelled’ for 2016 and covered some of the most gruelling,scenic and exciting terrains and tracks along the coastal belts of North Western, Northern and Eastern part of Sri Lanka. Seventeen members of the Jeep Club of Sri Lanka (JCSL) took part and DIMO came on board as the main sponsor as the only authorized distributor for Jeep in Sri Lanka.
JCSL together with DIMO organised the ‘Coast Less Travelled’ from the 10th to the 13th of December 2016. The expedition commenced from DIMO 800 and went on to Jaffna during the first day.
The route took the drivers through the flora and fauna of the Wilpattu National Park whilst experiencing the scenic and breathtaking views of Kudrimalai Point where King Vijaya landed. Lunch for the members were served on the Talaimannar Pier organised by the Sri Lanka Army. The first day drive ended at Jaffna covering approx. 420 km and the drivers stayed the night at Jetwing Jaffna.
The second day consisted of a 180 km drive from Jaffna to Mullaitivu. The most interesting part of this route was the 35 km drive across the beach which was tremendously breathtaking and exciting. The beach drive was another opportunity for the drivers to learn and enjoy the techniques of sand driving, especially in a Jeep. All members enjoyed the capabilities of their Jeeps, which for some were a novel experience.
The experts in the JCSL were always at hand to teach the others on manoeuvring in sand and water and working with tides and tyre pressure. Lunch was served at Maradankeny beach and they were accommodated at bungalows for their second stay.
The third day saw the members drive from Mullaitivu to Trincomalee covering approx. 130km. This trail included a 25 km jungle run and which went through the devastation and damage caused by the war. After having lunch the memberswent on another 10 km beach drive which was equally scenic as the other. Overnight stay was at arranged at TrincoBlu by Cinnamon where everyone enjoyed the networking session where they could share their knowledge and stories.
The expedition turned out to be yet again a memorable experience for the Jeep Club members. The experienced and the drive also reassured the members that they have chosen the best off-road vehicle, which is truly a go anywhere do anything vehicle.
