Compensation for damaged properties in Gintota clash already initiated:Kiriella
Steps have already been initiated to pay compensation to property damages in the clash that occurred in Ginthota in Galle last week, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Replying to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday, the minister said the Government was bound to provide security to all communities may they be Sinhala, Tamil or Muslim.
He said unlike the previous Government, this Government is committed to protect the rights of all ethnic groups.
MP Dissanayake queried on the delay of the Police in taking down the complaints of the people with regard to the property damages of the violent incident on November 16 and 17 in Ginthota. “When people go to the Police station, they had been turned back stating that the Police would visit their homes to taken down the complaints. But the Police are yet to visit the houses and the people have been unable to clean and mend their damaged property due to this delay. People have not cleaned up their homes, as the damages have not been evaluated yet,” he pointed out.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said that he will promptly call the DIG in Galle and bring his attention to that matter. Minister Kiriella also observed that the Police cannot send back anybody who comes to the Police to lodge a complaint without taking it down.
MP Dissanayake noted that five persons were admitted to hospital with injuries while 66 houses, 26 shops, 10 vehicles, four motor cycles and two mosques were damaged from the clash.
He questioned as to why the Police and STF personnel deployed in the area on November 16 were removed on November 17 without proper security assessment.
“The IGP stated in Galle that the Police failed at this instance. Who has to take the responsibility for that? The people in the area have lost confidence in the Police. Just admitting that the Police failed is not enough,” he added.
Parliament Select Committee needed to release military held land:Dinesh
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena proposed for the appointment of a Parliament Select Committee to coordinate the release of military held land in the North.
Speaking at the Committee Stage Debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday when Finance Heads of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry were taken up for debate, the MP said the PSC will help expedite the release of military held lands in the North.
“The land issue in the North has been internationalized now. These are issues we could resolve domestically. De-mining had been completed in most of the areas at present,” he said.
Commenting on Parliament, the MP also criticized the out-dated bureaucracy of Parliamentary officials. “Parliamentary system should minimize waste. See what waste is doing for over an year by taking over a building to house the Oversight Committees,” he commented.
The MP also said the Joint Opposition complained to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) over the delay in elections and Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) over the suppression of rights and privileges of the JO.
“Do not make the environment that we always had to run to the CPA or IPU to resolve our matters. It is up to the Speaker to intervene impartially and create an environment where all members would feel that we are respecting the traditions and established norms laid down,” he said.
The MP also questioned as to why the Cabinet and Constitutional Council did not take a decision on the IGP who himself admitted that the Police failed during the Ginthota incident.
Replying to MP Gunawardena’s comments on the LG elections, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella observed that the Government was not involved in postponing elections. “This happened due to a Court order. Parliament cannot change a court order,” he said.
'Hostel facilities would improve by next year'
Hostel facilities of state universities would be completed next year, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The minister said that after providing hostel facilities, the Government would pay attention to improve other facilities in universities, including common rooms, libraries, canteens and toilets.
The minister said the Higher Education Ministry in coordination with the Health Ministry, would come up with a plan to avoid a shortage of House Officers in hospitals, as a result of disruption to academic activities in medical faculties.
Responding to a question by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana in Parliament yesterday, the minister said a total of 583 students have been suspended from classes during the two years from May 30, 2013 to May 30, 2015 as disciplinary measures.
Court action was taken against 37 students, while two students had been expelled from universities within the said period. The minister, observing that a large sum of money had been invested in improving the facilities of universities during the last two years, said disciplinary action would be taken against the students who damaged public property.
Speaker to ascertain whether President was criticised
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya stated that he would ascertain if the President had been criticized by a statement made by a State Minister. He made this observation yesterday, when Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena raising a point of order said that the conduct of the President could not be criticized even by a statement of State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe. He added that guidance on it is in Standing Orders as well as in the Constitution.
"But State Minister Senasinghe had in a conference violated those provisions by stating that the President should not act n a way thaat would affect young UNP Parliamentarians," MP Gunawardena said. "The Speaker should look into the matter and take a decision."
MP Bandula Gunawardena and MP Ranjith de Soyza also expressed their views.
Parliamentry Police Division allowances not increased
The allowance paid for the Policemen directed to service of the Parliamentary Police Division for a sitting day has not been increased in 25 years, said Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Parliamentarian Sunil Handunetti yesterday.
He said that current allowance paid for such a policeman per day is Rs 62.50 and hence their monthly allowance does not exceed Rs 500. "This has been decided more than 25 years ago and remained unchanged since then," Sunil Handunnetti said. "This not fair and need to be addressed soon. I urge the Parliamentary Reforms Minister to attend to this matter."
He made these observations yesterday joining the Committee Stage Debate on the Budget proposal for 2018 under the financial heads of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry, Plantation Industries Ministry and Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry.
MP Handunnetti further said that the surveyors of the Survey Department are skilled. He questioned as to why a the US company Trimble given the management of the Survey. He pointed out that it could be a threat to the defense of the country. He also said that in future the country would have to get those details at a high cost from them.
At this stage the Minister Gayantha Karunathilake stated the survey has not been handed over to USA but technology and equipment are taken from them.
MP Handunnetti said that the fertilizer subsidy is curtailed. No allocation has been made for this relief.
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said that Rs 1.5 billion has been allocated to provide the fertilizer subsidy.
Abolish the LRC and use the land to generate income:Anura Yapa
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa yesterday in Parliament, requested that the Lands Reforms Commission (LRC) be abolished and the lands be distributed among those who could cultivate and generate income.
The minister made this comment while participating in the Committee Stage Debate of Budget 2018, when the Finance Heads of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry were taken up. He pointed out that the LRC was set up in 1972 for five years, but it has been continued for over 40 years.
“What is the point of keeping these agricultural lands under the LRC without making proper use of them? Lands are there to be cultivated and thereby generate income and not to just wait and watch. I presented a Cabinet paper in 2004 for the abolishen of the LRC and use those lands in a productive manner.
It had not happened to this date. We need to reap the maximum economic benefits from those lands. I propose for taking private sector support, while using the services of several competent planters to achieve this end and take measures to close down the LRC,” he commented.
Tea production has increased this year:Navin
Tea production has increased this year though it had a drop last year, said Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament.
He said that a 10 percent increase of tea production is expected at the end of this year. However, coconut production had drastically dropped this year, he said. He made these observations yesterday, joining the Committee Stage Debate on the Budget proposal for 2018, under the financial heads of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry, Plantation Industries Ministry and Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry.
Minister Dissanayake said that there was an issue with coconut prices. "Coconut production has considerably dropped," he said. He said that it was because of a lower rain fall recorded last year, while the drought lasted for more than six months.
He further said that the coconut harvest would increase with a heavy rain fall. He also said that coconut cultivation had reduced unprecedentedly. The Annual harvest of 3,000 million coconuts, had dropped to 2,300 million. "We have taken measures to provide coconuts from the Coconut Development Board at Rs 60 through the Sathosa," Minister Dissanayake said.
He also said that a sum of Rs 900 million had been granted to the Coconut Cultivation Board to take quick remedial action to address the issue. He added that another Rs 100 million had been allocated for organized coconut cultivation.
The minister also said that Rs 800 million had been granted for affected tea estates. He added that with the 10 percent increase of the tea production this year, an additional 3 million kilograms of tea production is expected this year. "We also hope that we could be able find new tea markets in China," Minister Dissanayake said. "We are intending to get machinery from Japan to develop the tea industry."
Govt. plans to grant blocks of land to 4 m families: Gayantha
The Good Governance Government has planned to grant plots of land to 4 million families in the country, said Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake in Parliament yesterday.
He added that hundreds of thousands of plots of land would be granted before year 2020, to honour the election pledge of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He said the government had decided to acquire technology and equipment from Trimble, the US Company, to make the project a success. "However, fears expressed by the Opposition was baseless as the data was not provided to the Company, as we would keep them with us," Minister Karunathilake said. "The other matter is that the the project is only three years not 20 years as speculated by the Opposition members."
He made these observations yesterday, joining the Committee Stage Debate on Budget proposals for 2018, under the financial heads of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry, Plantation Industries Ministry and Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry.
The minister also said that the Survey Department could survey only 50 plots an year and the grant of 2 million plots to the families project needed 40 years to complete. So the government decided to get the services of the Trimble Company. The survey would commenced in 2018.

"The LRC had issued 6,500 licenses during the last 4 months which is higher than the number that was issued during the previous 4 years. It has been able to earn an additional sum of Rs 240 million during this period."
The minister also said that discussions are in progress with the President to increase Parliamentarians insurance coverage from Rs 300,000 to Rs 500,000.
Rs. 100 million for school cricket: Arjuna
The Education Ministry had allocated Rs 100 million for the development of school cricket, said Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga in Parliament yesterday.
