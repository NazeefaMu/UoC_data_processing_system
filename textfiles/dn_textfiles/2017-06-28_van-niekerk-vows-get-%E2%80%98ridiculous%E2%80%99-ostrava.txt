Van Niekerk vows to get ‘ridiculous’ in Ostrava

OSTRAVA: South African track sensation Wayde van Niekerk vowed to get “ridiculous” when he competes in the little-run 300m at Wednesday’s Golden Spike meet in Ostrava.
The world and Olympic 400m champion, who broke Michael Johnson’s long-standing world record when winning gold in Rio, said he would do everything to break the meeting record set by his role model Usain Bolt, back in 2010.
The world record of 30.85sec, set at altitude in Pretoria in 2000 by Johnson, is seconded by Bolt’s 30.97, with van Niekerk third in the rankings, having run 31.03 in Kingston last year.
“I’ve had a few good runs this season so far,” said the 24-year-old. “I’ve been moving quite quick in the 100 and 200m, but I’ve still got quite a lot of world to do to get fit for the 300 and 400m. This is another stepping stone to see where I’m lying at the moment. AFP
