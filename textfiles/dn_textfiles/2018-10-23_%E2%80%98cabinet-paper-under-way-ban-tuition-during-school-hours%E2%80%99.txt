‘Cabinet paper under way to ban tuition during school hours’

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that he would submit a Cabinet paper today proposing the banning of tuition classes during school hours, as many students had been skipping school to attend such classes.
He was addressing a crowd at an inauguration ceremony held yesterday for a newly-constructed building at the Udawela Rewatha MMV in Bingiriya, Kurunegala.
The minister said that the proposal stated that tuition classes should not be permitted to be held on schooldays, between 7.30 am and 1.30 pm.
