Kandy SC in driving seat after winning Sevens first leg

The 1st Leg of the inter -Club sevens was conducted last Saturday and Sunday at the Race Course Stadium. Kandy Sports Club the defending champions and the rugby kings in the country were in an excellent form clinching the title by beating Police SC 21-5 in dramatic fashion to win the inter club rugby sevens 1st leg championship. Kandy’s new sevens coach Fazil Marija and his assistant Saliya Kumara were the architects of the victory. The Chairman of Kandy rugby Lasantha Wijeysuriya stated that it was a mountain to climb and they believed in themselves to succeed. President elect Mahesh Weerasinghe said it was a fantastic performance by the squad who raised the levels in every game, and it was a decent showing.
Now Kandy SC go into the 2nd leg in the driving seat, but they should not take anything for granted as the other teams are also equally good and can turn tables. They achieved their goal as a team and it must be remembered that Kandy SC possess almost the national team with the best rugby players. The important message now is for the players to keep their feet on the ground and continue to work hard, to win the 2nd leg too.
The inter club sevens tournament was first introduced in 1976, the first win in seven’s championship for Kandy Sports Club was in 1999 under Haris Omar and coached by Priyantha Ekanayake. They went on to win in 2002, from there they won it for many years. Last year 2017 they pulled out of the tournament and Navy won for the first time.

Today Sevens rugby is very popular in the country, likeT-20 cricket. In the early days schools and clubs, kicked off their inter club or school season with a sevens tournament. Sri Lanka has a long history in the sevens field. It was in 1931 that the first sevens rugby game was played, and that was in Ratnapura. The man who did everything possible to see to the kick off was K.F. Jenkins a Welshman, who was the ASP at Ratnapura Police Station. He organized a game between a Police team with the Planters. From here the game spread its wings to Kandy, Colombo and the planting sector.
Then in 1941 the first ever major sevens tournament was held for the Layard Cup. In 1947 to mark the 25th year of CR & FC, Sydney de Zoysa and Winne Serasinghe came out with a tournament. It was CH & FC the first club to win an international sevens tournament that was the All India Sevens tournament in 1968. The side was led by John Burrows and together with Omar Sheriff made things easy for the winners. Sri Lanka’s first Sevens team to go overseas was in 1976 for the Hong Kong sevens. The team comprised players such as Lanil Tennakoon, Jeffrey de Jong, M. Omerdeen, Ronald Rodrigo, G.Gunadasa, Dr. Maiya Gunasekara, Mohan Balasuriya with Indrajith Coomrasawmy as the captain.
Kandy SC under Lasantha Wijeysuriya won the 1997 All Pakistan Sevens. Sri Lanka’s first ever sevens trophy was in 1984 when they won the Bowl under Hisham Abdeen at the Hong Kong Sevens. Rest of the players in that team were Nalin de Slva, Saman Jayasinghe, Chula Dharmadasa, Hubert Rayan, Len de Silva, Rohantha Peries, Chandrishan Perera, and C.P.P. Abeyagunawardene. The inter club Seven-a-Side tournament is without doubt the best organized rugby competition of its kind in Sri Lanka. It has consistently produced a high standard of rugby.
