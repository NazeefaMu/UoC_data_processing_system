Great Naval Tragedies: USS Indianapolis (CA-35) reclaimed

August 19, 2017, is a special day for US navy, researchers and world war history enthusiasts because after 72 years and several unsuccessful expeditions later an expedition team finally managed to identify the wreckage of USS Indianapolis.
USS Indianapolis was one of two Portland-class heavy cruisers (Other ship was USS Portland). Her construction started in March 31, 1930, and launched in November 7, 1931. After USS Indianapolis commissioned on 1932 November 15, this vessel served as a flagship under several commanders. After a lengthy list of important missions during Interwar period and World War II period, one fateful mission standout above the rest because it helped form the geopolitical power balance of the today’s world.
July 16, 1945, was the day that Manhattan project conducted its Trinity test. Trinity test was the codename of the first artificial nuclear explosion in human history. Same day within hours of the Trinity test USS Indianapolis left San Francisco’s Hunters Point Naval Shipyard for a top secret mission. It was ordered to deliver parts and enriched Uranium 235 for the nuclear bomb ‘Little Boy’. (Little Boy was the first nuclear bomb to be used in history of warfare and the second artificial atomic explosion in the history while Trinity test being the one. Little Boy dropped on Hiroshima in Japan on 1945 August 06.) With nearly a half of Uranium 235 supply on Earth at that time, USS Indianapolis traveled from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor with record breaking speed of 74.5 hours with an average speed of 29 knots. From Pearl Harbor she reached her destination of Tinian Island on July 26, 1945.
After completing the secret mission Indianapolis was sent to Guam. In July 28 1945, she left Guam to go for Leyte. July 30, 1945, USS Indianapolis crossed her path with Japanese I-58, a B3 type cruiser submarine. I-58 submarine managed to sink Indianapolis by shooting two torpedoes to the ship. Ship sank in 12 minutes. Approximately 300 of 1196 crew members went down with the ship, others was manage to remain adrift. Remaining crew faced hyperthermia, dehydration, saltwater poisoning and shark attacks. After 4 days when the rescue came only 317 crew members were survived from initial 1196 crew thus making this is the greatest loss of life from a single ship in United States navy. Survived Captain Charles B. McVay III was court-martialed and convicted for hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag. The commander of Japanese I-58, Mochitsura Hashimoto testified that zigzagging would have made no difference. McVay was the only captain to be court-martialed for sinking his ship even though US navy lost many ships during the World War II.
Several expeditions were conducted to find the remaining of Indianapolis ship during past. On August 19, 2017, the “USS Indianapolis Project” group on the research vessel named Petrel finally managed to discover the wreckage on the floor of North Pacific Ocean. This research team was led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Since 1960, the survivors of this tragedy held reunions to honor their lost companions. This discovery will be a long waited closer to those remaining survivors.
