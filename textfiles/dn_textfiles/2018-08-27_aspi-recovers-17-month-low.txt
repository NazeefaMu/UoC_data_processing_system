Point of View
Equity markets closed on a flat note this week as revived foreign buying mid-week helped offset the rest of the week’s lackluster performance.
The Benchmark Index closed just 1.6 index points above last week’s close (6052.69 points vs. 6051.1) as markets held above the Index’s new support level of 6000-points. Revived net foreign buying on the back of lower valuations on Thursday helped the benchmark Index rebound from a 17-month low: The ASPI hit a low of 6040.37 on Tuesday for the 1st time since March 30th 2017, but net foreign buying of Rs.114Mn on Thursday and Friday helped push the Index above this low. Renewed foreign interest in stocks such as Melstacorp, LMF & JKH also helped push market turnover on Thursday to a 2-week high of Rs. 1.06Bn and helped maintain average daily turnover levels for the week in line with that of last week (ie: Rs.0.48Bn cf. Rs. 0.44Bn last week).
The recovery in foreign buying during the latter half of the week also helped convert the overall net foreign position on the Colombo bourse to a net buying position for the 1st time in 3-weeks; net foreign purchases of domestic stocks totaled Rs. 55Mn cf. net sales of Rs. 679Mn last week and compared to the last recorded net buying position of Rs. 23Mn during the last week of July. Despite the mild recovery in foreign appetite for domestic stocks during the week, local HNI and Institutional and retail investors remained staunchly on the sidelines this week as weaker June’18 corporate results clouded sentiment.
Crossings over the week amounted to a paltry 24% of market turnover (cf. 40% last week and YTD average of 40%) with the majority (~94%) of total crossings concentrated on Diversified counters such as JKH (43%), Melstacorp (44%) and Hemas (7%). Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain similar muted sentiment.
Jun’18 corporate earnings declines 10% Y-o-Y
June quarter earnings for listed corporates indicated a slowdown relative to last June, as earnings of the approx. 90% of corporates who have reported earnings totaled LKR 48.7Bn cf. the LKR 54.4Bn reported by the total market in Jun’17. The 10% decline in Y-o-Y earnings over the Jun’18 period stands in contrast to the 6% Y-o-Y gain in market earnings recorded over the comparable period last year (ie: Jun’17).
The decline in earnings was led by the Diversified sector (which remains a broad proxy for the overall economy and typically accounts for ~18-20% of total market earnings) which fell 49% Y-o-Y compared to a growth of 34% recorded in the comparable quarter in 2017.
The majority of listed Diversifieds recorded Y-o-Y losses in their June quarter earnings with notable blue-chips such as JKH recording a 23% Y-o-Y decline in earnings while Aitken Spence fell by 41% and Hemas fell by 20%. The Y-o-Y decline in overall market earnings was also partly attributable to a slow-down in the Manufacturing sector (-42% Y-o-Y) which typically accounts for ~8% of market earnings, Hotels sector (-74% Y-o-Y) which accounts for ~4% of total market earnings and the Construction sector (-372% Y-o-Y) which accounts for ~2% of total market.
Meanwhile, sectors such as Banks, Finance & Insurance (~35-40% of market earnings) recorded a 11% Y-o-Y growth in earnings over the quarter (cf. 15% Y-o-Y growth in Jun’17) while the Food, Beverage & Tobacco sector (which accounts for ~11% of market earnings) recorded a 26% growth in earnings compared to a 1% Y-o-Y loss recorded in the comparable quarter in Jun’17. Despite the decline in quarterly earnings, the market PER for by the end of June’18 quarter fell to ~10x (from ~11x by the end of Q1’18 and ~12x at the end of Jun’17) amid the 4.4% loss on the market Index’s value.
