Child stunting less prevalent in Sri Lanka

According to the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted by the Census and Statistics Department in 2016, short stature and stunting which result from long-standing undernutrition in children under five years is only 17 percent, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said in a statement.
According to Dr. Jasinghe, when compared with the recent data from other South Asian countries, Sri Lanka has reported the lowest prevalence of short stature. According to WHO cut off levels, Sri Lanka is considered as a low prevalence country with regard to short stature since Sri Lanka's figure is less than 20 percent.
Dr. Jasinghe pointed out in his statement that according to the same survey, wasting, which results from acute undernutrition, is 15 percent in Sri Lanka. Undernutrition has already been recognized by the Health Ministry as a public health problem. The Health Ministry is currently focusing on further improving the coverage and the quality of several interventions in progress to address the issue.
Activities are underway in collaboration with other line Ministries in implementing related interventions which could help to improve the nutrition status.
The recent Food and Agriculture Organization Report is not a measure of malnutrition but a measuring of undernourishment, he stated.
