Dinesh Chandimal ruled out of first two Tests

 
Dinesh Chandimal, the newly appointed Sri Lanka Test captain, has been ruled out of the first two Tests against India.
The 27-year-old was admitted to a hospital with suspected pneumonia.
In Chandimal's absence, Upul Tharanga, who has been appointed One-Day International and Twenty20 International captain, will lead the side.
Chandimal led Sri Lanka to a memorable record win over Zimbabwe in the one-off Test after being appointed Test captain.
The responsibility was bestowed on him after Angelo Matthews decided to step down.
India will begin their tour with the first Test in Galle before heading to Colombo for the second Test.
The third Test will be played in Pallekele and the series will be followed by five ODIs and a one-off T20.
