SLTB bus plunges down embankment

Passengers travelling on a bus belonging to the Sri Lanka Transport Board, between the Mahaveli C Zone area of Rathkinda and Mahiyanganaya, had a narrow escape recently when the vehicle veered onto the Rathkinda-Ulhitiya twin reservoir side of the road owing to a technical failure, while it was running along the reservoir embankment.
The driver of the bus was able to stop the vehicle just before it plunged down the embankment.
“The brakes were not working properly,” said A.M. Gunaratna, a passenger. There were about 29 passengers on board at the time of the incident. They urged the management at the SLTB Mahiyanganaya depot to run a bus in a good condition along their route, which has a long stretch along the Rathkinda-Ulhitiya reservoir embankment.
