Return of mindlessness

Having survived and escaped by a whisker the option of being burnt alive by mobs in 1983 I am fully conversant with the manner in which hate is built up, myths generated before finally unlashing violence systematically against groups of citizens.
The lead up to the infamous 1983 riots began on or around 1978.There has been a similar build against Muslims of this country in recent years. The foot soldiers who stone and burn apart, there is a middle layer which has shared reports, exchanged notes about Muslims on social media.
In the recent past we have witnessed violent outbursts in 2014 in Aluthgama, Beruwala and Dharga Town in Kalutara District. In 2017 we had another spate of violence. A response of the present Government was the setting up of District Level Reconciliation Committees
District Level Reconciliation Committees
Based on the Cabinet Memorandum submitted by President Maithiripala Sirisena in his capacity as Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to establish District Level Reconciliation Committees to address the incidence of inter-religious and inter-ethnic tensions and to promote national integration and reconciliation in all 25 districts. The District Level Reconciliation Committee to be convened by the District Secretary of the relevant District with representation of inter-religious leaders, the Superintendent of Police, retired judges, school principals and other relevant officials as observers, Secretary of National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry, V. Sivagnanasothy said.
The function of the District Level Reconciliation Committee is to undertake study on the background and causes of religious and ethnic tensions in the locality; formulate suitable strategy and approach to mediate the problems; provide rapid response to resolve conflicts and tensions; invite the perpetrators and victims and mediate conflict resolution; maintain a database on incidents of tensions and attacks on religious places; mediate, negotiate and resolve conflicts and prevent hate speeches.
The District Level Reconciliation Committees should resolve problems amicably and where necessary submit recommendations on unresolved matters to the National Reconciliation Committee through the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation.
The Cabinet Memorandum also recommends that this mechanism should not in any way disturb the law and order arrangements and rights in the country. The District Level Reconciliation Committee and the proposed institutional mechanism should help address the isolated pockets of incidence of religious and ethnic extremism and help to sustain a durable peace in the country. The Committee should meet on a regular quarterly basis where necessary based on reported incidence, he added.
The past two weeks saw further ugliness. Kumar Sangakkara has in a tweet noted that “no one in Sri Lanka can be marginalized or threatened or harmed due to their ethnicity or religion. We are One Country and One people. Love, trust and acceptance should be our common mantra. No place for racism and violence. STOP. Stand together and stand strong”.
Lawless order
I do not pretend to be an expert on policing, intelligence or crowd control. However I ask, the Police backed by the STF have had sufficient expertise dealing with internal strife since the late 80’s.
In the past two years they have dealt with innumerable crowds staging all manner of protest marches in congested areas. I imagine Police gathers intelligence. For reasons known to them at least on four separate occasions mobs have had free reign to cause damage and blacken the image of the country before semblance of law and order was restored. When the Army is called in, clam descends. How come? No different recently. None have fired a bullet in anger to control mobs.
Intelligence-led Policing (ILP)
Intelligence-led policing has a 3-part model as follows:
(1) Analysts interpret the crime trends and patterns;
(2) Information, or intelligence, allows decision makers to form strategies to impact specific crimes and serious offenders;
(3) The plans and resources flow down to based level officers to disrupt the crimes and offenders.
Intelligence-led policing (ILP) is a policing model built around the assessment and management of risk. Intelligence officers serve as guides to operations, rather than operations guiding intelligence.
Calls for intelligence-led policing originated in the 1990s, both in Britain and in the United States. Although intelligence-led policing builds on earlier paradigms, such as community policing, problem-oriented policing, and the partnership model of policing, it originated as a rejection of the “reactive” focus on crime of community policing, with calls for police to spend more time employing informants and surveillance to combat recidivist offenders.
As intelligence-led policing represents a move towards surveillance, it focuses on information collection and analyzing data. However, the way that this data is collected is a concern for privacy advocates. [The U.S. Supreme Court has given a two part test to determine a search in Katz v. United States (1967). The first is an expectation of privacy, and the second is that the expectation of privacy should be reasonable.
In the world of policing, it means something totally different. Intelligence-led policing can be defined as a policing philosophy that follows a business or managerial model of operating an organisation. Intelligence-led policing allows police departments to utilize data and information in order to better evaluate crime trends and issues, thus allowing top decision makers to efficiently and effectively allocate resources and develop crime fighting strategies.
In other words, police departments can incorporate a decision-making system where information about crimes, crime trends, and specific groups of offenders is analyzed and then paired with executive strategies to properly direct ground level officers’ actions and resources in a specific, targeted effort for the sole purpose of reducing, eliminating and preventing specific crime issues and offenders.
The legal, administrative and institutional framework for the implementation of ILP requires, First, ILP must be based on clear and precise legal and administrative provisions, which set out the conditions in which it is to be implemented and provide for adequate safeguards to ensure that it does not compromise human rights. Second, legality, necessity and proportionality of limitations of human rights and thirdly, effective remedies, oversight and accountability: International human rights standards provide for the right of everyone whose rights or freedoms are violated to an effective remedy and to have a claim for such a remedy determined by a competent judicial, administrative or legislative authority.
Since ILP may lead to potentially far-reaching interferences in a broad range of human rights, effective and accessible remedies for human rights violations that may result from ILP are essential. Furthermore, solid internal and external oversight mechanisms need to be in place in order to ensure accountability of institutions and individual law enforcement officers involved in ILP.
We cannot overstate the mess we are in at present. It follows on the horrendous shenanigans seen in post local government elections. None of which this country can afford. Ministers, implementers of Policies, the Police Department, political and other leaders have all a duty to perform. At present what we see is collective failure.
