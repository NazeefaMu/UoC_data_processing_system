Charity

Reeta was returning from the district court of Colombo. She was earlier told by her lawyer that the magistrate has the powers that of a District Court Judge and that he as an experienced lawyer and an exponent of the courtcraft and knows the mind of the judge than anyone. Therefore the today’s failure in getting the custody of her child is nothing more to be worried about.
Why should not she? She had already parted good portion of her meagre fortune for this shameless fellow. He called himself happily married. She pondered over the ordeal she had to put up with. Never mind, my body is not all that is important. The custody of the child is her ultimate goal. It also means a self-sacrifice. The lawyer’s words reverberated in her ears. ‘You must be prepared to make marginal sacrifices’. ‘Do not think what you pay is enough to muster a good lawyer’. ‘This is a Pro-deo job’. She was at a loss to understand the meaning of the word. The G. C. E. advance level education she had at the Kelaniya is not helpful to her in understanding Latin.
The lawyer filled that vacuum. He wants to explain the meaning of all these terms, which he said that she ought to know and as he is quite busy now she is to wait until he returns from the courts. What choice has Reeta got? Can she leave this fellow’s office? Can she? I have faltered in two previous appearances. How can I find that money? Least I can do is to obey the command and stop thinking about what is in store for today.
Loss of parents of a growing girl by no means a happy coincidence. The job she got was after facing a so-called interview along with six other girls and twenty boys were easy. There were more qualified people having lengthy testimonials and certificates and other extra-curricular activities. She thought she would not get the job.
She got it according to her boss though she has no past experience and that she could be trained. She thought when the boss inquired about her family that he became sympathetic. The so-called sympathy she had to put up with that man for two years until she was thrown out from the job on the charge of misbehaviour with a minor staffer. Her fault was when her boss was coming into the office room that she was answering some matters raised by the other party.
She soon realized that this was a set up as she has to give birth to a fatherless. At the settlement of her termination, she was paid three-month salary and further Rs. 5000 referred to as santhosm. Whose santhosm money, she wandered. It is definitely the santhosam for the boss. While parting he said to her that ‘all these help I have given you because you are an orphan’. ‘You should have been grateful. Your kind does not deserve this. People soon would know who you are. I can still do you a favour once the child comes. You leave the fellow with me. I can take care of that’. And she happened to agree with the proposal due to poverty and the inability to bring up a child by herself in the present condition.
So here is an employer doing a charitable deed to alleviate her difficulties. Good lord such people are found in this world. Otherwise, how can such wretched characters like us to survive in this blessed world? Sarcasm is trying to break her head.
‘Pro-deo, my dear pro-deo! That is the Latin word I have to teach you. Have you learned Latin in school? I don’t think so!. Nowadays they do not teach these important subjects. That is the cause for this social degeneration. Look, last week I was invited to give a lecture at the law college.
I selected the topic ‘what subjects children should learn’. Tomorrow I have to attend a meeting at Kegalle and deliver a lecture on ‘human rights violations in the country’. I am handicapped. I don’t have the type of the help that I need in this field. People come but they cannot grasp the subject. I think you are intelligent enough. If you agree to my proposal I made to you last time to come and sort out my outstanding matters. After all your aunty is very old she cannot look after you forever; what do you say, Reeta? Anyway today I will only release you if you give me a definite answer…’. ‘All this work I do pro deo. Try to pronounce it properly. It is a useful word for your kind’.
What is my kind? Everyone seems to talk about my kind. We are the creation of the Holy Father the God! The how can there be different kinds. If all human beings are created by the Holy Father why should there be a difference? There apparently has no answer to this questions.
Morning bus from Pettah takes her to Kelaniya by 5.30 a.m but today it seems to be late. She longs for an early bath at her aunt’s place, which at least provided her shelter for all these years. She has been the only good soul she has known in her own life amongst genteel fork who call me ‘Your Kind’. At least she murmured to herself. I am now learning Latin. ‘Pro-deo’ means in English for merits or free of charge. I think he is a hell of a good lawyer. He exactly knows what children should know to have a moral society. He is a defender of human rights violations. The right kind to be in the right place! At least I am sure of one thing. That is fighting to get my child apart for me he will not come to worry about his fees. She came to this conclusion when she was dropped near Pettah bus stand, he was sporting a smile; a smile of satisfaction. So my kind is needed as fodder to create such smile of satisfaction.
She came to her senses when a vehicle stopped near her. Head popped out said get in. She meekly got into the Volvo car which later stopped at a lush greenhouse. The driver looked younger than her. Could be less than twenty-five. Perhaps may even be schooling. Signs of affluence written all over him. He appears to be no novice. She is proved right. It is a large luxurious well lit bungalow. There is a sprawling garden which is well-kept. She has no idea how to judge a good garden from a bad garden. Nor that she had the experience elsewhere. The sun is rising. Its early luminous rays are beginning to pierce her eyes. She felt some comfort in her skin. The sun rays are reflecting from the three cars parked in the garage. Some servants are smiling at her. Seated in a comfortable armchair in the large verandah, she was told that the lady of the house is in the hospital.
A servant who brought her a pot of coffee. If her mother was alive she would have been happy to see her in that place at that time. She longed to embrace her mother whom she lost when she was only 10years old, to tell her new situation. Well, it is only a dream. She came to senses with the message ‘Baby Hamu wants you upstairs’ conveyed by another servant. For a moment she felt she is the lady of the house. She suddenly longed for a bath. Reeta added an extra spring and strength to her heel. The sounds of spring; a melody added to the path of the oldest profession in the world.
