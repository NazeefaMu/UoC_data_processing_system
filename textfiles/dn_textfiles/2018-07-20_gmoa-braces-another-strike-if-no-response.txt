GMOA braces for another strike if no response

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will announce the date of launching the strike next week, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters yesterday evening he said that the GMOA will wait another two or three days for the responses of the President, Health Minister, Finance Minister and Finance Ministry Secretary and decide strike action.
Aluthge said no response had been received from any of those four persons on the ten demands presented by the GMOA in several occasions in the past.
The demands were submitted in writing on several occasions but no response yet.
The reasons for launching the strike are not updating DAT allowance as promised, not issuing the gazette notification on the minimum standards of medical education recommended by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), not responding to the proposals presented by doctors in connection with amending tax policy, violating the National Wages Policy are some of them, he said.
Signing Singapore FTA putting the local job market in a grave danger, purposely delaying holding election for the four vacancies in the SLMC and interrupting SLMC's functions, not solving grade promotions issues of doctors, not granting schools for doctors' children and intervening in appointments and transfers in the medical administrative service overlooking Public Service Commission and ignoring relevant rules and regulations etc. are the other reasons, he added.
