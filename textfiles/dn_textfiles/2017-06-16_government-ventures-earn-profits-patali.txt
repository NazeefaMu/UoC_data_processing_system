Government ventures earn profits: Patali

The government implements income earning ventures not like the previous one that indebted the country, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He made this observation after initiating the Waters Edge expansion project yesterday.
The minister said Waters Edge is an institution under the government that proves government institutions could earn profits and run without public funds.
He said the government has had to bear the burden of the loans that the previous government obtained to show off development.
“There is a view in society that the government sector can run businesses like the private sector,” Minister Ranawaka said.
“Waters Edge is a fine example that has proved the view as its runs and expands with its own funds,” the minister said.
He said previous governments failed to pay compensation for the people for the land acquired to set up Waters Edge.
“This government allocated Rs. 408 million to pay compensation to them,” he said.
The minister said an Exhibition Hall will be opened at Waters Edge. It will reduce the congestion at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. He said the number of the rooms in Waters Edge will also be increased.
