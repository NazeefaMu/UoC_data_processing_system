Chandimal, Tharanga to take over roles played by Mathews

Dinesh Chandimal and Upul Tharanga were named as Test and ODI and T20I captains after Angelo Mathews stepped down as captain from all three formats.
Twenty-seven-old Chandimal who has appeared for his country in 36 Tests was named as captain of the Sri Lanka Test side. He will mark his debut as captain when he leads the team in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe starting at the R Premadasa Stadium tomorrow.
Chandimal is the 15th player to captain Sri Lanka since the country achieved Test status in 1982.
Likewise 32-year-old Tharanga has been entrusted with the responsibility of leading the Sri Lanka one-day and T20 teams. A veteran of 207 ODIs, left-hander Tharanga has captained his country in 14 ODIs prior to this appointment. Chandimal a prolific scorer in ODIs last year was left out of the recently concluded five-match series that Sri Lanka lost 3-2 to Zimbabwe, but has unexpectedly found favour with the selection committee.
Chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya explaining Chandimal’s sudden elevation to the Test captaincy said, “He was in our plans for the Tests but he had some issues with regard to ODIs so we did not pick him. It’s a temporary setback every player goes through a setback in any format of the game. There are little things that he needs to fine tune in ODIs and he knows what is required of him.
I am sure he will do that. He is the senior player we have and he has been in the system for some time. We have confidence in him.”
Jayasuriya paid a glowing tribute to Tharanga, who was his one-time opening partner and with whom he still holds the current world record opening partnership in ODIs (286 v England at Leeds, 2006). “Upul is a cricketer who has batted from 1-6 in the order and I have felt sorry for him as a former player. He has taken up all the challenges thrown at him and even sacrificed his place to a youngster which is as good example for every cricketer.
Upul has shown 100 percent commitment to Sri Lanka cricket and we believe he is the best man for the job,” said Jayasuriya.
In the current year Tharanga is Sri Lanka’s leading run getter in ODIs with 591 runs (avg. 53.72) at a healthy strike rate of 95.16.
Jayasuriya also had a word of praise for veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath who had stood in as Test captain at times when Mathews and Chandimal were both injured.
Herath led Sri Lanka to Test series victory in Zimbabwe and to a drawn series against Bangladesh at home.
