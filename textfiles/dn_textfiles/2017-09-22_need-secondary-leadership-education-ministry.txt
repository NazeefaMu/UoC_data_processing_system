Need for secondary leadership for Education Ministry

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has instructed Education Ministry officers to take measures to build a second tier in the ministry which is capable of taking up challenges in the education sector.
The Education Minister has pointed out the need to build the secondary leadership, which can take the education sector forward once the present top level officers are on pension.
He was addressing a meeting of staff officers at the ministry, recently.
The minister said there is a scarcity of capable staff officers for secondary leadership since there is no proper mechanism for recruiting staff officers to the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service (SLEAS).
However, with the mediation of Minister Kariyawasam, 852 staff officers have been recruited to the SLEAS based on the results of limited and open examinations. Moves are taken to give them a proper training including foreign exposure.
“At the moment, almost all senior staff officers in the SLEAS have been recruited under a programme implemented to recruit staff officers to the SLEAS by then Education Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in 1988. Most of these officers are scheduled to be on pension within the next few years. Therefore, there is a scarcity of SLEAS officers to take the baton,” the minister said.
The minister noted that all senior staff officers in the SLEAS are duty bound to create a strong secondary leadership.
