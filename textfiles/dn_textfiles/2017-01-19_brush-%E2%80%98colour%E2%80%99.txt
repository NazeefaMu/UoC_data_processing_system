A brush with  ‘Colour’

S H Sarath is a well known name in the art scene. One of his exceptional features is the skill to use his innate talent in such a manner so as to create a painting which is meaningful as well as entertaining to his viewers. With rich, expressive colours, radiant strokes and a blend of curves, he makes up subtle creations.
S H Sarath
Born in 1947 at Weligama, Matara, Sarath is a remarkable painter with unique talent. His works of art are eye catching and meaningful. Sarath belongs to the post-independent generation of Sri Lankan artists. After completing a five-year course in painting at the Government School of Fine Arts (1968-1973) he followed post graduate studies in art at the Silpakon University in Thailand under a UNESCO fellowship. Thereafter he completed a course in printmaking at the University of South Australia, Adelaide, in 1995.
Sarath's drawings are full of social consciousness, satire, sarcasm, irony and multi-religious philosophy. Each and every drawing portrays a thematic content which is very tropical. He tries to highlight aspects of the prevailing society through his paintings. He has held a large number of both international and local painting exhibitions. . His work of art have been elected for exhibitions held in such countries like Australia, Canada, Norway, Malaysia, Yugoslavia, Bangkok, France, India, Bangladesh, Cuba, Korea, Japan, Brazil, and the UK. Some of his most significant exhibitions were ‘S H Sarath Retrospective 1968-1988’ sponsored by the British Council at the British Council, Colombo, on 1988 and the solo exhibition in Adlaide Nexus Gallery in 1996 which was part of the Adlaide Fringe Festival in Australia.
He had won the first prize for the Annual Exhibition of the Ceylon Society of Arts in the years 1972-73 and 1977 and the first prize for stage decor, organized by the ministry of cultural affairs in 1985.
Sarath's work too are part of several collections. Some of his paintings have been included in the collections of the President of Sri Lanka, National Development Bank, Colombo, Commercial Bank, Colombo, ANZ Bank Norwood, Australia, Westpack Bank, Adelaide, Australia, National Art Gallery, Colombo, and Ecka Art Gallery, Yugoslavia. One of his paintings depicting a drawing of a tree had been included in the collection at the United Nations premises after the exhibition.
"Nelson Mandela's exhibition committee came along to the UN headquarters to get permission for one of their artists to exhibit his work when my paintings were on display. They were enthralled by my creations and expressed their pleasure to me," he said adding that some of his past exhibition can be viewed via videos through YouTube.
Sarath reflects a thousand of thoughts through a single painting. This year too he has brought his art to the fore via an exhibition of paintings which will unfurl at the Lionel Wendt Art Centre’s Harold Priries Gallery from January 21 to 23. The opening ceremony of the event is at 6 pm. It is titled ‘Colour’and comprises some of his latest paintings.
