‘Over Rs. 400 m saved from President’s Office expenditure’

President Maithripala Sirisena has already made significant sacrifices and saved over Rs. 400 million from his office by cutting down expenditure from Rs. 800 million to Rs. 330 million. Therefore, following his practical example, the ministers also can save money without putting pressure on the people. A written request has been sent to the President proposing him to release a circular for Ministers in connection with cutting down their expenses, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, he said that in the letter to the President he has requested the President to intervene to cut down on many unnecessary expenses make by ministers. They should use the business class when traveling by air and not first class. All who travel abroad using state money should use economy class air tickets. They should use the cheapest rooms when stay abroad. They should limit their delegations and they should try to get the service of diplomats at Sri Lankan missions abroad.
According to the State Minister, the letter also requests the President to issue a circular limiting the number of foreign trips of Ministry Secretaries’ and other officials’ for only essential purposes. The Ministry Secretaries should formulate a system to educate all ministry officials on ministry expenses and fund management of the relevant ministry.
“All Ministries should obtain vehicles on leasing. The Ministry Secretaries will not ignore these rules and regulations and they will violate those because nobody wish to go to various commissions and give statements or being questioned. If the President can save funds, the ministers should also do the same,” he added.
