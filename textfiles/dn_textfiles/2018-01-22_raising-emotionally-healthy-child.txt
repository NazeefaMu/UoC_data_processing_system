Raising an emotionally healthy child

It’s important to recognize and treat mental illnesses in children early on. Once mental illness develops, it becomes a regular part of your child’s behaviour. This makes it more difficult to treat.
But it’s not always easy to know when your child has a serious problem. Everyday stresses can cause changes in your child’s behaviour. For example, getting a new brother or sister or going to a new school may cause a child to temporarily act out. Warning signs that it might be a more serious problem include Problems in more than one setting (at school, at home, with peers)Changes in appetite or sleepSocial withdrawal or fear of things he or she did not used to be not afraid ofReturning to behaviours more common in younger children, such as bedwettingSigns of being upset, such as sadness or tearfulnessSigns of self-destructive behavior, such as head-banging or suddenly getting hurt oftenRepeated thoughts of self-harm or death.
u Identifying mental disorders in children can be tricky for health care providers. Children differ from adults and they experience many physical, mental, and emotional changes as they progress through their natural growth and development. They also are in the process of learning how to cope with, adapt, and relate to others and the world around them.
u Furthermore, each child matures at his or her own pace, and what is considered “normal” in children falls within a wide range of behaviour and abilities. For these reasons, any diagnosis of a mental disorder must consider how well a child functions at home, within the family, at school, and with peers, as well as the child’s age and symptoms.
Most common mental health conditions in children
There are several different types of mental disorders that can affect children and adolescents, including:
Autism
Autism, or autism spectrum disorder, refers to a range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviours, speech and nonverbal communication, as well as by unique strengths and differences. We now know that there is not one type of autism but many types, caused by different combinations of genetic and environmental influences. The term “spectrum” reflects the wide variation in challenges and strengths possessed by each person with autism.
Autism’s most-obvious signs tend to appear between two and three years of age. In some cases, it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months.
Anxiety disorders: Children with anxiety disorders respond to certain things or situations with fear and dread, as well as with physical signs of anxiety (nervousness), such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD):
Children with ADHD generally have problems paying attention or concentrating, can’t seem to follow directions, and are easily bored and/or frustrated with tasks. They also tend to move constantly and are impulsive (do not think before they act).
Disruptive behavior disorders:
Children with these disorders tend to defy rules and often are disruptive in structured environments, such as school.
Pervasive development disorders:
Children with these disorders are confused in their thinking and generally have problems understanding the world around them.
Eating disorders:
Eating disorders involve intense emotions and attitudes, as well as unusual behaviors associated with weight and/or food.
Elimination disorders:
Disorders that affect behavior related to using the bathroom. Enuresis, or bed-wetting, is the most common of the elimination disorders.
Learning and communication disorders:
Children with these disorders have problems storing and processing information, as well as relating their thoughts and ideas.
Affective (mood) disorders:
These disorders involve persistent feelings of sadness and/or rapidly changing moods, and include depression and bipolar disorder. A more recent diagnosis is called disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a childhood and adolescent condition involving chronic or persistent irritability and frequent angry outbursts.
Schizophrenia:
This disorder involves distorted perceptions and thoughts.
Tic disorders:
These disorders cause a person to perform repeated, sudden, involuntary (not done on purpose), and often meaningless movements and sounds, called tics.
Some of these disorders, such as anxiety disorders, eating disorders, mood disorders and schizophrenia, can occur in adults as well as children. Others begin in childhood only, although they can continue into adulthood. It is not unusual for a child to have more than one disorder.
Symptoms of mental illness in children
Symptoms in children vary depending on the type of mental illness, but some of the general symptoms include: Inability to cope with daily problems and activitiesChanges in sleeping and/or eating habitsExcessive complaints of physical ailmentsDefying authority, skipping school, stealing, or damaging propertyIntense fear of gaining weightAbuse of drugs and/or alcoholLong-lasting negative moods, often accompanied by poor appetite and thoughts of deathFrequent outbursts of angerChanges in school performance, such as getting poor grades despite good effortsLoss of interest in friends and activities they usually enjoySignificant increase in time spent aloneExcessive worrying or anxietyHyperactivityPersistent nightmares or night terrorsPersistent disobedience or aggressive behaviorHearing voices or seeing things that are not there (hallucinations)
Causes of mental disorders in children
The exact cause of most mental disorders is not known, but research suggests that a combination of factors, including heredity, biology, psychological trauma, and environmental stress, might be involved. Many mental disorders run in families, suggesting that the disorders, or more accurately, a vulnerability to the disorders, might be passed on from parents to children through genes.
How is mental illness in children treated?
Mental illnesses are like many medical disorders, such as diabetes or heart disease that require ongoing treatment.
Medication:
The drugs often used to treat mental disorders in children include antipsychotics, antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, stimulants, and mood stabilizing drugs.
Psychotherapy:
Psychotherapy (a type of counseling often simply called therapy) addresses the emotional response to mental illness. It is a process in which trained mental health professionals help people deal with their illness, often by talking through strategies for understanding and dealing with their symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors. Types of psychotherapy often used with children are supportive, cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, group, and family therapy.
Creative therapies:
Certain therapies, such as art therapy or play therapy, might be helpful, especially with young children who might have trouble communicating their thoughts and feelings.
