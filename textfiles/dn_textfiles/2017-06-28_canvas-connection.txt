Canvas  connection

In its third edition Swim Week Colombo launched the Art Connect on June 27 at Trace Expert City. Art Connect returned for its second season and features six of Sri Lanka’s most acclaimed artistes. Swim Week Colombo, with its title partner Olu Tropical Water, hosted this curated event that is highly anticipated by many a fashion personality and is an initiative that explores a meaningful interaction between art and fashion.
“Art and Fashion has a deep relationship. The expressive nature of these two creative streams is encompassed in Art Connect. This edition of Art Connect is the interpretation of the Green Conscious position of Swim Week through the eyes of 6 important artists.” – Ajai V. Singh
The artists collaborating with Swim Week Colombo for the exhibition are Anoma Wijewardene, Mahen Perera, Bandu Manamperi, Vajira Gunawardena, Chathurika Jayani and Ajith Susantha. These six acclaimed artists will exhibit their expressions of the theme “REVIVE”.
Anoma Wijewardene, an alumna of Central St Martins College, University of the Arts, London, was also a visiting lecturer there. She is known for creating images that depict man’s existential anxieties, contemporary concerns about the human condition and internal tussle with his nature and his fellow man. Anoma’s work has been displayed at the V&A Museum and the House of Commons in London and she has also exhibited at Sotheby’s Gallery Hong Kong.
Mahen Perera is an artist who works mainly with found objects and material detritus that are often ignored and seeks to analyse and challenge the conventional language used to talk about issues of identity and representation. Trained in multidisciplinary design at the National Design Centre in Colombo, he went on to pursue his BA in Fine Arts from the Lasalle College of the Arts, Singapore in affiliation with the Open University, UK.
Bandu Manamperi is a leading figure in recent social art projects carried out under the aegis of Theertha, including “Let’s Take a Walk” and “Ape Gama”. He holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Sculpture and is a core member of Colombo’s Theertha Artists’ Collective, Sri Lanka. Bandu was one of the first performance artists in Sri Lanka, creating highly personal art experiences based on the transformation of his own body, but he doesn’t limit himself to any one genre and his art practice also encompasses sculpture, drawing and painting, and installation art.
Vajira Gunawardena questions the reality and the representations of reality in a bargaining world. Hence he concentrates on subjects such as politics, metaphysic, culture, history, consumerism, myths and ethics. Internal body of his work is interested in using the figurative forms, assemblage and stencil techniques. Each motif is a specific archetype that uses line, colour and space to form a cognitive-based narrative that explores inhuman space in daily lives.
Chathurika Jayani is a young gifted artist who establishes a story that is defined by both dimension and texture. The use of mixed media creating a layered three-dimensional visual on her canvas is effective in illustrating this aesthetic. The artist completed her Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Colombo and has participated in numerous group exhibitions both locally and abroad.
Ajith Susantha is a dynamic experimentalist who is forever coming up with innovative design ideas in acrylics, mixed media & 3D sculpture of various types. Ajith holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Institute of Aesthetic Studies, from the University of Kelaniya and ever since has exhibited his works in England and Norway, as well as the Colombo galleries.
These artistic interpretations shared at Art Connect stimulated thoughts and inspired new ideas among designers and manufacturers, as with last year’s edition. Through these unconventional, yet related means, it is expected that a new wave in Sri Lanka’s fashion realm will be initiated.
