Malays at Padang assist Islamic Boys Home

Sri Lanka Malay Association recently completed a meritorious project with the Islamic Boys Home for the needy and orphan children in Ratmalana. Several private sector companies also came forward to assist this project.
Diana Rahaman, Chairperson of the Women's Affairs Committee, under which the project was initiated, said that, the home was also provided with brand new lawn mover so that the garden and surroundings could be better maintained, for the children to have a safe and a clean environment to play and relax.
The home has around thirty inmates and all of them were entertained with evening high tea as well as with games and music.
Each of them was provided with a bed sheet, pillowcase, bath towel as well a tea mug.
