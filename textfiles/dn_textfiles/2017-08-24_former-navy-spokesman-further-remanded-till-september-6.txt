Former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and five others arrested on the charge of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009 were today ordered to be further remanded till September 6 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
 Meanwhile, the Court had refused to grant bail on the suspects citing that there is no exceptional circumstances to release the suspects on bail.

 The missing persons had been abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009. The OIC of CID’s Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva prosecuted. Counsel Achala Seneviratne appeared for the aggrieved parties.
