Refrain from strikes upto February 15 - Deshapriya

The Election Commission yesterday requested all trade unions not to conduct strikes and other activities disturbing the election process until February 15.
A letter of request will be sent to all Trade Unions by the Election Commission asking for their cooperation to hold the election process without any hindrances, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
Deshapriya made these observations at a press brief held at the Election Commission premises yesterday evening. He observed that a large number of Trade Unions are using the coming election to win their demands unlike ever before. Deshapriya also said the Election Commission has requested political parties to interfere in the matter as well.
Deshapriya pointed out that the Commission respects the TUs right to bargain with their administration at an election to win their demands. However, they should not obstruct people’s right to vote, Deshapriya said. “So I would like to request all trade unions and political parties involved in this, to refrain from using the election to realise their demands. These trade union actions are a great hindrance to the election process.As you all may know, most of the government workers are a part of the election process.The TUs should realise that if they are to fight with the administration for their rights, first they should establish a democratically elected government. If we keep postponing elections, it will lead to dictatorship.TUs have no power under a dictatorship.” he said.
