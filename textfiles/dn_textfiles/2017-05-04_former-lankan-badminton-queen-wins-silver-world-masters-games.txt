Former Lankan badminton queen wins silver at World Masters Games

DUBAI: Former Sri Lanka national badminton champion Sriyani Deepika has added another feather in her cap by winning a silver medal at the World Masters Games held in New Zealand.
Deepika lost a closely contested final in the Women’s Singles 45+ ‘A’ category to Delwin Cooper of New Zealand 21-16 23-21 in her maiden appearance at the Masters held in Auckland from April 21-30.
“I am grateful to all my friend and fans in the UAE and Sri Lanka for supporting and encouraging me to participate in this prestigious Games,” said Deepika who runs her own Deepika’s Badminton Academy in the UAE for the past three years.
“I was the only player from UAE at the Games and was sponsored by Yonex UAE,” said Deepika who represented Sri Lanka at the Games where competitions were held in 28 disciplines.
Incidentally, another Sri Lankan badminton player Upendra Jayawardena also won the silver medal in the Men’s Singles 45+ ‘A’ category.
“I’m very happy with this achievement. Coaching in the UAE has helped me extend my career and also maintain my fitness,” said the 50-year-old who won the last of her five national singles titles nearly two decades ago.
Since making UAE her home five years ago, Deepika has been active not only as a coach but also competing in local tournaments to lead by example.
A regular member of the Sri Lanka team for 15 years during her heyday, Deepika never officially retired as a player competing in the World Seniors badminton tournaments in Canada, Turkey and Sweden.
Her success in New Zealand has rekindled her determination and ambition to continue her mastery in the court.
