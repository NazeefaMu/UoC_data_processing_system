87-year-old creates awe-inspiring MS paint art

Some grandmas spend their time in the garden, some knit, but 87-year-old Concha Garcia Zaera enjoys a hobby that’s rather unusually among her friends. She draws using only MS Paint. She discovered the program after her children gave her a computer, and she hasn’t looked back ever since.
“My husband fell ill and I had to take care of him, so I couldn’t go out very often,” Zaera told El Mundo. “I began painting little things: first, a house, the next day I’d add a mountain… Step by step, I was adding details, and in the end, the result was a very pretty thing.”
“I have no imagination at all, so I get inspiration from the postcards that my husband used to send me or drawings that I find and like.”
According to Vanguardia, Zaera spends about two weeks on one piece and focuses intensely on the details.
Zaera used to post her masterpieces on Facebook, but one of her granddaughters suggested that she should use Instagram instead. On March 9, she had about 300 followers. As of this post, more than 108,000 people are following the humble artist. “I do not understand very well why my drawings draw so much attention, I think they are very simple things,” she said.
