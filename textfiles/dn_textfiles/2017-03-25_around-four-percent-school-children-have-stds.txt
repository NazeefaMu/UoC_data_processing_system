Around four percent school children have STDs

Around four percent of schoolchildren in Sri Lanka have some sort of Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) and over 10 percent of them are drug addicts, Educational Non Academic Employees Union Secretary Ajithge Thilakaratne said.
Big Matches further promote those. Therefore, Big matches should be completely banned. There is no way of regulating them because no Principal respects and follows circulars issued by the Education Ministry, Thilakaratne said.
Addressing a press conference at the Public Library in Colombo yesterday, he said that one in every 10 school children is a drug addict. Thilakaratne challenged any school Principal who can come forward and claim that no student from his/her school uses drugs. Statistics are incorrect and unavailable because most of the school children afflicted by STDs seek medical treatment from private hospitals with or without the assistance of their parents. Only Rehabilitation Centres, Physiologists and Psychiatrists in the country have current statistics and details of the true picture.According to Thilakaratne, most school Principals do not adhere and follow Education Ministry circulars.
“It is the past pupils who control big matches. Any outsider can enter the ground where a big match is played. No only during the big match season, even on normal school days, some children bring drugs into schools hidden inside their shoes, trousers, shirts etc and sell inside schools. This is how they develop sick a mentality and invade girls’ schools and harass them,” he alleged.
Thilakaratne pointed out that his organisation has informed about this situation to the Education Ministry authorities on numerous occasions, but all to no avail. Nothing has been done to prevent this dangerous trend. “Now it is up to the parents, teachers and the media to educate the children and save them from this grave trend,” he added.
