Three Sri Lankans were rescued by a Royal Air Force of Oman (RAFO) helicopter from a ship sailing to the Khasab Port on Friday, the Times of Oman reported today.
Unstable weather condition had forced the ship crew to call for help, the ToO said.
The members of the crew were transported to the Khasab Airbase.
