Fire erupts in Rajagiriya super market

A fire broke out in Laugfs super market in Rajagiriya yesterday morning. The fire brigade of the Kotte Municipal Council responding to Daily News said they were alerted about the fire around 5.25 in the morning.
A team sent by the Kotte Fire Department has reached the location within five minutes following the alert.
They have doused the fire assisted by the Colombo Municipal Council fire brigade. The fire caused extensive damages to the supermarket, the Kotte Fire Department said. No causalities were reported.
Police suspect that the cause of the fire was an electrical short circuit. Investigations are continuing.
While praising the fire brigade’s quick response to the situation, Minister Harsha de Silva said he has requested a full report regarding the incident.
Posting in social media, Minister Harsha de Silva said there are ‘numerous issues regarding the location, equipment to reach high rises, staff, training and more, with respect to emergency responding.
“The Kotte fire trucks must be placed in a central location instead of where it is now at the very corner of the division down a narrow lane after the former location in Nugegoda was converted in to a park.
I have brought this to the attention of the SJPK MC since 2012, but to absolutely no avail. I think the time has come to find an alternative solution to fix the problem before a disaster happens,” Minister de Silva said.
