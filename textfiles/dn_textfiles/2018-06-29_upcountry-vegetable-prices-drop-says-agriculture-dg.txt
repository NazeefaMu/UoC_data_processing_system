Upcountry vegetable prices to drop, says Agriculture DG

The prices of upcountry vegetables will return to normal by the end of July, Agriculture Department authorities assured.
Agriculture Director General W.M.M. Weerakoon said that the heavy rains and strong winds had devastated upcountry vegetable cultivation. This, together with the seasonal demand, had pushed prices to their highest levels.
“Farmers have already restarted their cultivation and prices would go down further in the coming weeks,” said the DG.
He made these observations at a meeting held recently at the Ministry under the patronage of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, to discuss the implementation of prgramme Api Wawalai – Api Kanne.
According to the Agriculture Minister, aim of the programme is to encourage people to grow at least one food crop in their home gardens.
