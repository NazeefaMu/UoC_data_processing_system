Green August launches Green Walk

The Green August, a socio-environmental activist group, is to launch a ‘Green Walk’ voicing the importance of environmental protection on July 8 and 9 from Kandy to Colombo.
They are to leave Kandy at 8 in the morning to reach Colombo by the next day. The walk is to begin at the Kandy Wewa Rawuma and the interested can join the 'Green August' team on July 8, at 7.00 a.m.
The Founder of Green August, Mohomed Farshan, speaking to Daily News said the immediate reason for organising the ‘Green Walk’ is because Sri Lanka is at a eco-crisis.
“While we raise our voice against environmental pollution, we do not just stop there.
We continue committing to raise awareness, and experiment to find solutions for short and long term environmental issues within our own communities,” he said.
Farshan said several programmes such as collecting plastic bottles thrown either side of the Kany-Colombo road, planting trees in appropriate places by the side of the same route, distributing plants among people who are interested in growing trees, cleaning mosquito breeding places and reporting on illegal garbage dumping by the side of the road will take place corresponding to the ‘Green Walk’.
An eco friendly concept promotion will also take place along with the Green Walk together with schoolchildren, he said.
“We recently launched a programme aiming the Yagoda-Gampaha railway track, among several other similar programmes under the theme ‘Don’t dump waste while travelling’.
We collected mounts of plastic bottles from the sides of the railway track within just one km.
We are planning to launch similar programmes aiming to clean island wide railway tracks.” Farshan said.
He requested to hand over plastic bottles to the Green August team. "For each kilo of plastic bottles you give, we will give a plant," he said.
