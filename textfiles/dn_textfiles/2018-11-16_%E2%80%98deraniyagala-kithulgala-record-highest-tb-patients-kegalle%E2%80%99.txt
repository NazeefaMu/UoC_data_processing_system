‘Deraniyagala, Kithulgala record highest TB patients in Kegalle’

Deraniyagala and Kithulgala have recorded the highest number of tuberculosis (TB) patients in Kegalle. A female health officer who had checked patients for tuberculosis had been transferred to a national hospital without a replacement. As such, steps should be taken to fill this vacancy immediately, Deraniyagala Urban Councillor member from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) M. Ruwan Chaminda Perera said.
He was addressing other urban councillors at a meeting held on November 8. Deraniyagala UC Chairman A.B.W. Lakshman Rajakaruna said schoolchildren could not attend school on time as the Deraniyagala Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Depot's school bus, which was scheduled to leave the Deraniyagala bus stand to Erathne via Malibada at 7.00 am, was now departing at 7.30 am.
United National Party Councillor R. Indika Prasad Ranasinghe said fish stall owners at the Deraniyagala public market had incurred losses in sales since a brother of a former chairman was engaged in van sales in the area using a fish market van. This was an injustice for traders who had leased stalls through tenders, he added.
UC Chairman Rajakaruna said the Deraniaygala town had become unclean due to fish strewn around the town, adding that he would take immediate action with the assistance from the police and health authorities.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Councillor P. Sujeewa Nanda Pathirana said the construction of houses in the Asamana Kanda housing scheme earmarked for landslide victims had been postponed halfway. Chairman Rajakaruna said beneficiaries of the scheme had been provided with five to seven-perch lands through the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) and the Estate Management and Valuation Department to build houses with their own labour contribution.
United National Party Councillor W. Govindasamy said the daily wage of estate workers should be increased to Rs.1,000 since they could not make ends-meet with the present wage. Thereafter, the chairman introduced the council Budget for 2019 and it was approved by one vote, with 10 members voting in favour and 9 members opposing it.
