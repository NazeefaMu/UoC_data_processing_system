While the Internet boom is inevitable and so is the need for new gadgets, children of tech-savvy parents are learning to use them even before they can say their first word.

According to a report in BBC, infants spending time on touch screen depend on the number of hours. More the number of hours spent, the child tends to sleep 15 minutes lesser than the last time. About 75 percent of the toddlers use smartphones on a daily basis and that affects their sleeping pattern in the long run slowly reducing the number of minutes by the hour.
Interestingly, the toddlers tend to sleep more in the day than the night because of the shifting patterns. While the use has to be reduced so that it doesn’t affect the development of the child.
