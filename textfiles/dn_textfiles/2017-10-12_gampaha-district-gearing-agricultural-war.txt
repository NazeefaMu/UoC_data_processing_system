Gampaha district gearing for agricultural war

Following the Wap Magul ceremony spearheading the government’s agricultural war launched by President Maithripala Sirisena, there has been a spurt of agricultural activity in the Gampaha district including areas such as Divulapitiya, Minuwangoda, Katana and Mirigama with people preparing their paddy lands and highlands for cultivation this season.
A noteworthy feature is that paddy and highlands hitherto left abandoned too have been brought under the plough by the owners.
Under this program, arrangements have been made to cultivate high quality ancient paddy strains with medicinal value in paddy lands irrigated by the Galkaranda No 1 and No 2 anicuts and in other areas such as Nugagahayaya, Pansilpura, Boragodawatta, Yatiyana, Heenatiyana, Gamangedara, Rathdolugama, Arambayaya, Katuwellegamayaya, Burulapitiya and Minuwangoda Yaya.
The proposed ancient paddy strains include Rathdel, Pokkali, Masuran, Kaharamana, Kahamala, Rathkenda al, Pushparaga, Gonabaru, Hichchinangi, Veda Heenati, Kalu Heenati, Ratu Heenati, Suvandel, Pokuru Samba, Gajamuthu Samba, Pancha Perumal, Vellavilangal, Madakawalu, Kuruluthuda and Suduhandiran, President of the Agricultural Resources Protection Organisation and the Farmers Association in the Region W. D. Wimaladasa said.
He said there are nearly 5719 varieties of ancient paddy strains which can be successfully cultivated using carbonic fertilizer.
