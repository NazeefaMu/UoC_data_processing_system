Pakistan charges Jamshed in spot-fixing case

KARACHI, Tuesday- Pakistan cricket charged former Test batsman Nasir Jamshed on Tuesday with obstructing and failing to cooperate in an investigation into a spot-fixing case which rocked their Twenty20 league. Jamshed, 27, is the fifth player charged in the scandal which saw a one-year ban -- six months suspended -- and a fine meted out to fast bowler Mohammad Irfan last month.
Three other players -- Sharjeel Khan, Khalid Latif and Shahzaib Hasan -- will fight the allegations before a three-member tribunal headed by a retired judge. -AFP
