Sri Lanka aims for 200 MW of solar power by 2020

The next phase of the Soorya Bala Sangramaya (Battle for Solar Power) national programme which aims to add 200 megawatt of solar power to the national grid by 2020 was unveiled at an event under the auspices of President Maithripala Sirisena at Waters’ Edge yesterday.
Accordingly the national program which was initiated under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena with the paronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has achieved a connectivity of 100 megawatt to the National Grid since its launch.
A manual which sets out the standard code of practice to ensure quality assurance of the project was also handed over to the President at the event. The manual lists out 17 standards which are to be met at various stages ranging from documentation to grid connectivity, testing and inspections. The Soorya Bala Sangramaya is a community based power generation project which is jointly undertaken by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority, Ceylon Electricity Board and Lanka Electricity Company to promote the setting up of small solar power plants on rooftops of households, commercial establishments, religious places, hotels and industries.
