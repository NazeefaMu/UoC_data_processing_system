Travel ban on MPs

The Cabinet has taken a decision not to allow government MPs to travel overseas on sitting days of Parliament, a Senior Minister yesterday confirmed. The decision will especially be in force during the month of November when Parliament debates the Budget 2019.
The MPs however will be allowed to travel outside the country for medical and family emergencies.
The decision comes in the wake of several instances of the House being adjourned due to lack of quorum.
Last Thursday, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya also raised concerns over the lack of quorum of MPs and urged all the MPs to prevent recurrence of such instances in the future.
In an announcement, Speaker Jayasuriya stressed the importance of maintaining the quorum of 20 MPs during the sittings and pointed out that it is a Legislative responsibility of both the Government and the Opposition members.
Parliament sittings ended due to lack of quorum of 20 MPs on September 6, August 9 and July 19 in the recent months. According to a previous statement made by the Speaker of the House, Parliament spends over Rs. 4.5 million for each sitting.
