War Heroes’ remembrance at Abhayaramaya

About 29,932 traditional oil lamps will be lit on March 30 at 4.30 pm at Abhayaramaya, Colombo 5, to remember the 29,932 soldiers who sacrificed their lives to protect the motherland.
Addressing the media at Abhayaramaya in Colombo yesterday, Ven. Ananda Thera said, all will be invited for the event without party politics or any other differences.
About 14,000 soldiers became disabled while combatting terrorism, he added.
Ven. Ananda Thera said today, people travel by trains and buses without getting killed by bomb blasts due to the lives sacrificed by soldiers. We should be grateful for them.
