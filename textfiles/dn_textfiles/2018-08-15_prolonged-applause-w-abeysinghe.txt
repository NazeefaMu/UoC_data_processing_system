Prolonged applause for W A Abeysinghe

A writer’s task brings forward his ideas, emotions and attitudes. A creative artiste capitalises on his creative capacity to express emotions in an artistic manner. That said, a creative writer’s final product gives an idea about his or her personality. The ideology, as well as the stream of consciousness, counts most important in this regard. The question is if this creative effort – or exercise, rather – can influence the prevailing social order.
Sri Lanka has a plethora of creative writers engaged in composing poetry, lyrics and other genres. However such work does not seem to have a proper driving force on the prevailing social order. Most of such stories could be enjoyed on par with fairy tales, albeit with not much effect on the societal growth. Or do they lead the society to some kind of downfall?
The discourse on veteran writer Dr W A Abeysinghe’s literary and social service emerges at this crucial point. A comprehensive anthology covering his contribution to the society and the literature was launched recently at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute. The anthology titled Abhaya Mudrawa is edited by Chandrasiri Seneviratne and Udeni Sarathchandra. Another anthology titled Anandayen Pragnanawata – Abeysighe Sara sangrahaya edited by Deepachandri Abeysighe and Sumudu Chathrani Jayawardena were also launched to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Dr Abeysinghe’s literary career.
The second step of the launching ceremony will take place at the Kuliyapitiya town Hall on August 21 at 2 pm as a special literary programme.
Dr Praneeth Abhayasundara of Sri Jayawardenepura University and Senior Journalist Thimbiriyagama Bandara will deliver the keynote speeches while Jagath Kumara Jayasinghaarachchi (who features the lion’s character in the present production of Sinhabahu) will please the audience with his vocal and performing abilities. Wayamba University Vice Chancellor Professor E M P Ekanayake will chair the event.
Whatever the genre – be it poetry, lyrics, short story, newspaper writing or translation – Dr Abeysinghe’s literary contributions lay a direct touch on the social plane. He makes use of international literature to expose the contaminated social body while intermixing law and politics with an amazing dexterity.
He represented Sri Lanka at the Afro-Asian Writers’ Conferences held in Baku, Soviet Union in 1966 and in Beirut, Lebanon in 1967. Dr W A Abeysinghe has been awarded the Sahithya Suri award by the Wayamba University and the Government has presented the Kala Keerthi award.
This special programme, designed to appreciate Dr Abeysinghe’s social and literary contribution, is a joint collaboration of the Kuliyapitiya Provincial Secretariat and Kuliyapitiya Urban Council Public Library Consultant Committee.
Dr Abeysinghe’s latest works will be available as Sarasavi publications for a nominal sum.
