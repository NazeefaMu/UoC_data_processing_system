SAARC Anaesthesiologists, Intensivists meet from Feb 24

 
The College of Anaesthesiologists and Intensivists of Sri Lanka will be hosting the 12th SAARC Associations of Anaesthesiologists meeting in conjunction with its own 33rd Annual Academic Congress from February 24 to 26.
The ceremonial inauguration will be held on February 24 at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre with the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. Health,Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne is the special guest and Dr. William Harrop Griffiths representing the Royal College of Anaesthetists and Dr. Jannicke Mellin Olsen, President Elect of the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists will be the guests of honour. The WHO in 2015 declared Anaesthesia as a part of universal health coverage. The Lancet commission in 2015 found that five billion people in the world do not have access to safe anaesthesia and surgery.
This means five out of seven people in the world are not able undergo surgery safely. It is alarming to note that a large majority of these people are in the SAARC region. 143 million people are denied required surgery annually.
Of this 58 million people are in the SAARC region.
The Helsinki declaration on patient safety during anaesthesia was a landmark document, in identifying this issue. Patient safety during Anaesthesia has become a global concern, and several initiatives are in place currently in the world to address this issue.
“Safe Anaesthesia for Everybody Today” by the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiology, “Zero preventable deaths by 2020” by the Patient safety movement of the USA, “ Safe Surgery Saves Lives” by the WHO and “Pathway to Safe Surgery” by the Royal College of Anaesthetists.
The working agenda of the College of Anaesthesiologists and Intensivists of Sri Lanka has been “Improving Outcome after Anaesthesia through Safety and Knowledge”.
The theme of this meeting is “Improving Outcome in the SAARC region”
In the context of the prevailing global concern on patient safety during anaesthesia, this years meeting would address safety and quality issues in the SAARC region. Over 70 reputed international speakers from many countries including the SAARC countries will take part in a comprehensive academic programme, complete in educational content. Several workshops would be conducted by international academic institutions.
The meeting is conducted and hosted by the College of Anaesthesiologists and Intensivists of Sri Lanka, headed by its President Dr. Kanishka Indraratna.
