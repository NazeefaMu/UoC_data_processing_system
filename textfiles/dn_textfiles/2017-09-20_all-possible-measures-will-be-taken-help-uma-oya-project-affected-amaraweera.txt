All possible measures will be taken to help Uma Oya Project affected: Amaraweera

“The Government will take all possible measures to help people affected by the Uma Oya Project,” Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing a meeting after he commissioned the Makuluella Drinking Water Supply Project on September 18.
“Cancellation of the UMA Oya project as requested by certain parties is not a proper solution to the emerging problem. If the project is abandoned, it will take at least four years for the underground water level to return to normal. Already 80 percent of the project was completed. Only 20 percent remains to be completed. The Government will take all possible measures to help out and revive the livelihoods of the people fallen destitute due to the project,” the Minister said.
“Irrespective of whether the project is abandoned or not, it will take a long time for environmental conditions to return to the previous level,” he said.
“The Makuluella project was built by the Government to cater to the needs of the people in and around Bandarawela affected by the Uma Uya Project. The project cost Rs. 342 million and it will cater to 2,000 families in several villages including Makuluella and Karandegolla,” he said.
A press release by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry said several other water projects were being implemented to resolve the drinking water problem of people affected by the Uma Oya Project. Work on the Greater Bandarawela Water Supply Project is due to commence this year. Deputy Minister Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle was present.
