Love, lust, sacrifice and solace

In most people’s estimation the 21st century is now lopsided and seems to be far removed from the past with the advancement of science and technology, and we see preserved cultural norms are challenged with the coming of transparency and openness in human relationships.
In Lanka, as I see and observe, the Tamil community here, have lost their so-called treasured values and they have no meaning now, necessitated by the protracted war faced by the middle class and the poor people among them. The upper classes have their own set of values for several decades now. That is not a problem for the others. Let them be.
Dreaming
In this context, a young lady from Thirukonamalai (Trincomalee) has written a maiden novella in Tamil. Her name is Rathi Thananjeyan. The title of the book is Kanaa Kaanum Kaalam (The Era of Dreaming).
I presume she anticipates a reality that will come true and enacts a dreamy fiction with downright common practices in adolescents as far as conjugal and sexual relationships are concerned. Though the story looks fanciful, valid reasoning out and a rationalization becomes effective at the end of the story. The dialogues are put in an intellectual climate, backdrop. I welcome that part of the story because it is the only way out for the protagonists to solve the problem they confront.
In this there are two protagonists- one is Aakash (Male) and the other Divya (Female) They both have an entangled situation but understandably the writer most of the time looks through the female character in her narration.
Maturity
Before I continue, I must bring the attention of the readers at the beginning of the story.
The writer says that she began the story in 2002 and completed it in 2009 and kept it in store until recently to polish it with her newly gained maturity to submit her story to the Department of Cultural Affairs of the Eastern Province for publication. And the Department has published it in 2017. The book has 92pages.
Inspired by the South Indian past romantic writers in Tamil, the writer uses the motif practised there and also liberally follows the language and speech pattern of those writers. This was irritating me at first because Lankan Tamil and modes of speech are different from the Tamil spoken in India.
However, as the story develops the plot becomes convincing and the characterization comes in place.
As I began reading, I thought that it is a love story between two people, - no, a one-sided attraction of Aakash towards Divya. But with coming of Swathi in the scene, it becomes a triangle of love. Swathi loves Aakash, and Akaash is fascinated by Vidya. Vidya is non-committal because she having lost her parents had to depend on his brother’s family. She is unhappy. So, she applies for a job and gets it at Aakash’s office. He forces himself on her and Vidya also lends herself to be kissed by him. Meanwhile, Vidya and Swathi become friends and knowing that Swathi loves Aakash, Vidya sacrifices her apparent love for the latter. Vidya was forced to marry someone who wanted only sex with her. Aakash is also married. Vidya wants him to live with his wife and Swathi gets married to someone else.
Readability
There are few more characters in the story, but I desist from giving more information as the readers in Tamil would read and enjoy themselves.
The story goes on ends well.
But the significant thing about the novel is the perception of the writer to understand well the contemporary realities in human relationship. Rathi Thananjeyan’s style of writing is appreciable. She is familiar with the craft of writing. Her multifaceted knowledge on many matters is evident mostly in the latter part of her story. Rathi Thananjeyan at present works as a Management Assistant in the Maddakkalappu (Batticaloa) Kacheri. She hails from Thirukonamalai(Trincomalee)
She has a promising future as a writer of novel themes. Congratulations to her.
