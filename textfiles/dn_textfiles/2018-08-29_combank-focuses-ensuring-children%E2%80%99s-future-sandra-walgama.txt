COMBANK FOCUSES ON ENSURING CHILDREN’S FUTURE - SANDRA WALGAMA

Decades after it pioneered a savings product for minors, the Commercial Bank of Ceylon continues to devote attention to developing products for children, a segment immensely important to the long-term vision of the bank.
Today, children’s accounts represent a substantial percentage of the bank’s account base and play a noteworthy role in keeping its CASA (Current Account- Savings Account) ratio, one of the healthiest in the local banking sector. In this interview, Commercial Bank’s Deputy General Manager, Personal Banking, Sandra Walgama elaborates on the bank’s focus on children.
Excerpts of the interview:
Q: There seems to be growing emphasis in Sri Lanka on banking products for children. How does Commercial Bank view this trend?
A: Commercial Bank has always considered children a very important segment, both in terms of the products it offers as well as in terms of its corporate social responsibility initiatives. We in fact pioneered the savings product for children with the Isuru Minors’ Saving Plan in 1991. It is a unique savings product and is one of the best performing products in its category, having evolved over the past 25 years. Banking products for children continue to receive a lot of attention at Commercial Bank, because we believe in its potential and the fact that they build a very worthy customer base in the future.
Q: What products does the Bank have for this segment?
A: The Isuru Minors’ Savings Plan is one of our principal savings accounts for children. It is a product that has been periodically improved with the addition of new features. Earlier this year, we launched Isuru VI, increasing the guaranteed amount receivable to Rs.8.8 million, when the child turns 18. Another equally popular children’s account is the Arunalu Children’s Savings Account, which is linked to a scheme that rewards high achievers at the Year 5 scholarship examination each year.
Q: What makes these products special?
A: Let’s look at the Isuru Minors’ Savings Plan first. It covers the period from birth to majority – age 18 – and offers parents two savings options – a monthly deposit scheme or a lump sum deposit scheme, whichever suits their financial capacity. Under the lump sum deposit scheme, the guaranteed amount the Bank will pay, when the child turns 18, depends on the age of the child at the time the account is opened. Parents may deposit between Rs.5,000/- and Rs.1 million at any time between the day the child is born and the child’s 10th birthday. A deposit of Rs.1 million at birth will guarantee the child a payment of more than Rs.5.7 million at the age of 18.
Under the monthly deposit option, the guaranteed amount depends on factors such as age of the child, agreed amount of the monthly deposit and the deposit period. Account could be opened for children between the ages of one day and ten years, and parents may choose to save between Rs.500/- and Rs.20,000/- (in multiples of Rs.500/-) a month, for five or ten years. A 10-year savings plan opened at birth of a child with a monthly commitment of Rs.20,000/- will guarantee a payment of Rs.8.8 million, when the child turns 18.
For parents who wish to save for their children, these figures are attractive, but what makes Isuru Minors’ Savings plan extra special is the fact that the Bank undertakes to pay the final guaranteed amount when the child turns 18, even in the event, the monthly deposits being interrupted due to the untimely demise of the depositor.
Q: And what are the unique features of the Arunalu Children’s Savings Account?
A: The distinguishing feature of the Arunalu Children’s Savings Account is its cash rewards scheme for high achievers at the Year 5 scholarship examinations. Every year, Arunalu account holders have the opportunity to win cash prizes from the Bank if they are placed first, second or third at the national, district or school levels at the scholarship examination. This is intended to inspire young students and emphasise the value of good education.
The Bank pays up to Rs.450,000 to the top three scorers island-wide at the Year 5 Scholarship examination usually held in August every year, if they are Arunalu account holders. On this basis, the student or students placed first will receive up to Rs.200,000/-. Similarly, students placed second in the island will receive up to Rs.150, 000/-, while those placed third will receive up to Rs.100, 000/- .
Even if there are multiple winners within the top three ranks in the country, Arunalu rewards all such winners on the above basis. Additionally, Arunalu account holders ranked 1stin their respective districts at the examination receive up to Rs. 50,000/-, and account holders who are placed first, second and third in their schools receive cash prizes of Rs.10,000/-, Rs.7,500/- and Rs.5,000/- each respectively.
Q: How successful have these products been?
A: They have been extremely successful and very popular among parents. Today children’s accounts represent about a tenth of our total accounts and we feel there is potential for further growth.
Q: What are the factors that have contributed to the success of these products?
A: First and foremost, these products appeal to the instincts of parents. The next important factor is trust. Since these are long term products, parents look for a bank that is stable and trustworthy, and in those aspects Commercial Bank stands out.
The rates of interest and the final guaranteed sum are also important factors. Added to all these factors are the features, which are improved periodically as the products and the market evolves.
Q: Given the features of the banking products for children, are they profitable/sustainable for the bank?
A: Yes they are. Our Children’s savings products represent a win-win for the parents and the Bank. Additionally, from the Bank’s point of view, children’s accounts are our future adult customers, so building a relationship with this segment makes sense.
Q: How do you see these products evolving in the years ahead?
A: Children’s banking products will continue to thrive and the Bank will continue to look for exciting and innovative new features to add on to this product range.
