Japan provides Rs. 358 m to continue scholarship programme

Two Exchanges of Notes between Sri Lanka and Japan, and Grant Agreements between Sri Lanka and JICA for the implementation of the Human Resources Development Scholarship Programme were signed at the Finance and Mass Media Ministry on June 30.
The documents were signed between Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Mass Media R. H. S. Samaratunga on behalf of the Sri Lankan government, Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma on behalf of the Japanese government and Chief Representative of JICA Tanaka Fusato.
The Japanese Grant Aid for Human Resources Development Scholarship (JDS) Programme was introduced in Sri Lanka in 2010 by the Government of Japan to provide opportunities to the executive level public sector officials to undergo Master Degree Programmes in prominent universities in Japan. Accordingly, under the first framework (2010-2013) and the second framework (2014-2017) of this programme opportunities have been provided to 120 officials (15 per year) for this purpose.
The second framework of this programme is scheduled to be completed in 2017 and the selection process of the final batch of the second framework has already been completed. The selected officials are scheduled to commence their studies in September 2017. In order to facilitate these officials, Japan has offered a grant assistance of Japanese Yen 208 million (approximately Rs. 282 million) to Sri Lanka for 2017.
In response to the request made by the Government of Sri Lanka, the Government of Japan has agreed to continue this programme for a further period of four years. Accordingly, the third framework has been designed for the period of 2017 – 2020 to provide 15 scholarships per year to undergo Master Degree Programmes in Japan. After considering the necessity of further career development of JDS fellows, the Government of Japan has agreed to offer PhD programmes at most two slots per batch.
The selection process of the first batch of the third framework will commence in September 2017.
In order to facilitate these officials, the Government of Japan has offered a grant assistance of Japanese Yen 262 million (approximately Rs. 358 million) to Sri Lanka for 2018.
