People’s right to vote should be ensured: Musthapha

“The old electoral system should be abolished ensuring the people's right to vote. An election is a deciding factor of a country's future and therefore, a dialogue should be commenced by the PAFFERAL and other election monitoring organisations on the steps to be taken to protect the voting right of the people,” Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
The Minister was speaking at the occasion where a document was handed over to him by the PAFFERAL and other electoral organizations recently at the ministry.
The document aims to establish a legal framework which limit the expenditure that candidates spend on elections.
Minister Musthapha said propaganda expenditure on elections must be limited.
"The previous government spent enormously on the last elections and a developing country like Sri Lanka cannot afford such a wastage. A country cannot expect a morally sound leadership from candidates who spend enormously to influence voters. A broader dialogue should be built up in this regard, the minister said. The Minister promised to conduct a workshop to raise awareness on the issue for MPs and LG members very soon.
PAFFERAL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi, Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) National Coordinator Manjula Gajanayake and representatives of election monitoring organisations participated.
