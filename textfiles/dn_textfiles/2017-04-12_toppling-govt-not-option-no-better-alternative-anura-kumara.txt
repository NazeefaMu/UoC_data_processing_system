Toppling govt. not an option with no better alternative: Anura Kumara

There is no point in toppling the government as there is no better alternative, said JVP leader and Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
He said one has to think as to who they would bring into power after toppling this government. He added that all had always attempted to topple governments in power. The JVP leader made these observations yesterday in response to a question raised by the media at a press conference held at the JVP Political Head Office in Pelawatta, Battaramulla in connection with a statement made by the GMOA that they would topple the government within three months.
“If there is no alternative, it is better to develop a group to take over power rather than toppling the government,” Dissanayke said. “So we are in the process of educating and directing the public to develop an alternative group to take over the government.”
When questioned by the media on the Joint Opposition’s (JO) prediction of bringing two million people to the May Day rally at Galle Face, Dissanayake said it was better to inform the Navy to provide security at Galle Face as the drunkard participants would fall into the sea and drown.
“However, if we assume if one bus transports 50 participants to the JO May Day rally, it will need 40,000 buses to transport the two million people,” Dissanayake added . “But there are only 21,000 buses in the country, both public and private. So these predictions have no basis,” he added.
JVP Parliamentarian Dr Nalinda Jayatissa also participated in the press conference.
