Dialog first to launch eSIM for Apple iPhones in SL

Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s premier connectivity provider, announced the launch of embedded SIM (eSIM) support for Apple iPhones.
Dialog subscribers can now access advanced eSIM features, enabling them to enjoy the simple on boarding and use of two mobile numbers on the latest iPhone devices, iPhone Xs, Xs Max and XR.
Earlier this year in April, Dialog was the first operator in South Asia to commercially launch the eSIM technology, a reiteration of its promise to deliver the ‘The Future, Today’. With the eSIM support for Apple devices, Dialog continues to expand the eSIM availability across more devices. Dialog customers can now connect to the Dialog network without the need to handle any physical SIM card and use one number for business and another number for personal calls as desired. Customers can also have separate voice and data plans on the two mobile numbers.
eSIMs are a key component of cellular powered Internet of Things (IoT) applications, giving devices an out-of-the-box network connectivity without having to purchase a SIM card separately. eSIMs are being employed in an increasing number of machine-to-machine (M2M) applications including remote monitoring, smart watches, smart cars with onboard entertainment, performance monitoring and alarming, and are expected to be adopted by more and more manufacturers in upcoming smartphone releases.
Commenting on launch, Dr. Rainer Deutschmann, Group Chief Operating Officer, Dialog Axiata PLC said, “Following Dialog’s eSIM launch as first operator in South Asia, we are now extending the eSIM benefits to Apple iPhones as another first in Sri Lanka. Customers can thus enjoy the convenience of easy onboarding and the use of two phone numbers. Dialog is committed to delivering “the future, today” to every Sri Lankan consumer and enterprise, and we will extend eSIM support to all compatible smartphones and wearables.”
Customers will be able to pre-order the all new eSIM enabled iPhone Xs, Xs Max and XR from November 9 on www.dialog.lk, wOw.lk and at selected Customer Care Centres island-wide. The new iPhone devices will be available for sale from November 16, 2018 onwards.
