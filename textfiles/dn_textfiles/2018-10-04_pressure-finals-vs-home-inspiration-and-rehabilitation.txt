Pressure  finals vs home  inspiration and rehabilitation

Just in case...it is the concluding 3rd leg of Asian 7s.
Much pride for Sri Rugby hosting the glamourous 2 days of pure skill and adrenaline.
More pride indeed to note òur iconic racecourse as the best running surface in Asia, and still improving on the pro fundamentals.
The month of Octaviius hands hosts Sri paradise...,.a perfect opportunity for a top 2 finish instead of Japan or Hong Kong.....home turf advantage looming large and hugely considered.
This is definitely our litmus test under pressure and time to stun Asia with our island class.
Naturally our whole 7s future lies squarely on the shoulders of our selectors , coaching staff and eventually our players.
But its all fully based and centres on injuries plus expert rehab.
Destiny on hold till key players cleared protocol and shipshape to play.
Lets not dwell on that slice of team stats....rather the quality of Muthu, Gayan Weere, Jason Dass, Sooriya B, Danushka Ranjan ..all good to go.
Vital our finishers have good ball to chalk out the glam step ups in the middle.
If we sort it all in our dressing room..the home crowd will charge the hearts max for some scintillating 7s skills in the middle.
The men and women burdened with ke.y player injuries....need to literally play out of their skins.
Captains Muthu and Sanju, have to demand more from each player.
They need to surprise themselves and their fanatical fans, in every form possible.
Converting pressure into points like oxygen for each one.
Imperative their belief dominates every second of time ..on and off the pitch, till our job is done.
Coaches Woods and Sampath...need to focus heavily on our home advantage...and motivate our warriors accordingly...each second counts....live the dream of winning at home.
Combinations and recycling players are the rocket fuel that makes the difference.
Expectations are bigger than ever...and thru the proverbial roof.
Time for us deckchair experts to speculate on sea level oxygen and the mental capacity to live at this top altitude of Asian rugby.
Absolutely remarkable SRI has made the grades....but essential we shock in the middle.
Translated , means we not out pace but also take our physicality to the highest.
Exactly the same mantra for both our squads...no hesitation...pressure..pressure..presdsure....every minute counts.
The workrate must stun the opposition into mistakes...
Warriors to force the issues.
As hosts of the finals ..its important that chief Bonsa, Nazeem, Illyas and our top brass get Sri on that radar..focus on 7s development from 15yrs up.
We must be absolutely PROLIFIC.
For players its a critical rehab graph that gets our stars glittering again..
Issues about match fitness to be answered in the middle.
The writings on the racecourse wall.
Inspire the island.
Bula bula big SRI HEARTS.!!!
