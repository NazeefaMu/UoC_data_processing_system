‘We have skilled, talented workforce’

Sri Lanka has a skilled and talented workforce, and it will be expanded further in the near future, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
He was visiting the Koggala Free Trade Zone on Thursday.
The Minister inspected factories and addressed employees' issues. The Minister also vested a volleyball court constructed with the Shrama Wasana Fund with the public.
“The Shrama Wasana Fund facilitates 8.6 million workers in the country. During the past 20 years, the fund provided scholarships, and welfare, empowerment and awareness programmes.
“The fund also helps the workforce invest in their own businesses. The ministry constructed a dental clinic in the Biyagama Tree Trade Zone and three volleyball courts in the Katunayake, Avissawella and Koggala Free Trade Zones,” the Minister said.
The Minister said the management and the employees in free trade zones have a good rapport. “We will uplift the standards of the employees and do our best to protect investors as well,” he said.
The Minister said the government has not set dates for the provincial elections, and it is too early to say about a new UNP leadership.
The Minister said he was disappointed as a Buddhist about the decision made by a Magistrate's Court on Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera. “But we should make way to the law,” he said.
