With the entrepreneurial cap put on

Exports are the goods and services produced in one country and purchased by citizens of another country. Sri Lanka, a small island nation with limited arable land area (27,400 sq. km) cannot solely rely on agricultural and plantation crops to meet the increasing demand for foreign exchange. One of the strategies adopted by small nations in the region (e.g., Singapore) is to improve export entrepreneurship and increase net value addition (not merely increasing exports). Such attempts were made by successive Sri Lankan governments since 1978 but thrust was only to increase industrial exports (but not the net value addition) to supplement the declining earnings from agricultural and plantation commodities (21%). As a result Sri Lanka was able to increase industrial exports (68%).
Although share of industrial exports surpassed the share of plantation and agricultural commodities, net contribution to foreign exchange earnings may not as large as its share. Other important factor is the stagnated number of exporters in recent years. According to recent research, number of entrepreneurs in a country is positively related to economic growth. Validity of this argument is evident when considering the declining trend of export’s contribution to GDP (around 16%) while remaining the number of exporters constant.
What is export entrepreneurship?
Definition for export entrepreneurship is rare in entrepreneurship literature. However we can derive a definition for export entrepreneurship using widely used definitions for entrepreneurship in general. Some scholars argue that entrepreneurship is opportunity (nature of business) based behaviour while others argue that entrepreneurship is involved in three activities (discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities for profit in five areas: to introduce i. new goods and services ii. ways of organising iii. new markets iv. new processes iv. new raw materials through organising efforts that previously had not existed. When the opportunities are in the international business it may be termed export entrepreneurship.
According to above definition we have to assess to what extent our exports are entrepreneurial. The other research finding in entrepreneurship is the number of entrepreneurs of a country is positively related to economic growth. Then we have to assess whether we have increased the number of export entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka over last five years or so, number of new raw material discovered, number of new markets we found, number of new processes introduced and new services introduced.
History of export entrepreneurship
Although Sri Lanka had been exporting since history known to us, very often, opportunities were discovered by buyers or traders of other countries. Therefore, our history of export entrepreneurship is not that entrepreneurial until 17th century with the invasion of Dutch traders.
After the invasion of foreign nations, gradually Sri Lanka started to processed export plantation crops (tea, rubber sheets, and coconut oil) may be the origin of both industry and export industry.
Most of these markets were organised by British and Dutch entrepreneurs who were also the producers of those crops. Involvement of Sri Lankans in the export trade in early years found to be minimal. Even today majority of Sri Lankan plantation crops and spices are exported to destinations founded by foreign companies. As a result, local skills of export entrepreneurship or the discovery of opportunities in international markets had not been very significant.
Considering the recent history of export policy regimes, export entrepreneurship may have started formally only in 1979. Export Development Board (EDB) was established in 1979 under the Export Development Act, No. 40 0f 1979 may be the first formal organisation established to promote exports although entrepreneurship was not a mandate of the Act.
According to performance indicators of EDB in 2016, contribution from exports to Gross National Product (GDP) is declining since 2011. These contributions to GDP fell from 16.85 percent in 2011 to 13.78 percent in 2016.
This stagnation and gradual decline may occur due to two reasons: expansion of GDP relative to exports and high dependency percent. Dependency percent is the indicator which determines the potential for further value addition. For example, apparel industry which claims 52 percent of total industrial exports and 40 percent of the total exports has high dependency percent according to World Bank working papers. Some local researchers claim that 50 percent of value of imports is devoted to textiles and its accessories and 70 percent of cost of production of apparel is for textile and its accessories. This indicates that the room for further value addition in leading exports of Sri Lanka is limited.
The other factor is diversity of exports. According to performance indicators of 2014, only seven products claim for 80 percent of total exports. These include textiles and garment (44 %), tea (14%), rubber (8 %), coconut (5 %). From these figures one can think three things: i poor diversity restricts adding value addition products which in turn restrict innovation ii. low contribution from main plantation crops but utilizes higher percentage of arable land iii. failing to find new product market, new products for existing markets. Lack of diversity of export markets is also a factor to be considered. Accordingly, European Union (EU) buys 31 percent of exports while USA claims 27 percent of Sri Lankan exports in 2014.
Even though we are next to two largest markets (India and Pakistan), our exports to these countries account only for 6 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. The silver line in this export cloud is entry into US and EU market which demand high quality. According to World Bank reports, Sri Lanka reputed for supplying intimate garments which fetches comparatively low prices. As a result young talent of Sri Lanka is devoted to CMT processes (cut, make, and trim) and opportunities for young fashion designers were curtailed.
Current status of value addition
In majority of research and reports produced by government agencies failed to highlight dependency of Sri Lankan exports. For example, Sri Lankan apparel industry is among highly dependent industries in the world. According to World Bank working papers Sri Lankan apparel industry is third on dependency among apparel exporting countries with 40 percent dependency. Leading countries in dependency are Cambodia (85 percent), Bangladesh (71 percent). Value addition in takes place at various stages of value chain until it reaches end user.
The greater the room for value addition, the lower the cost of inputs utilized. Most of the leading exports of Sri Lanka use import intermediate goods as raw material (eg., textile for apparel; leather for foot wear). As a result room for value addition becoming limited and dependency is increased.
As stated in introduction, export entrepreneurship is opportunity based concept which involved in opportunity seeking in international trade, innovation and risk taking potential. Innovation always takes place at individual and firm level. Role of government is to facilitate these risks preferred firms and individuals.
According to research there are four major problems to be encountered by export entrepreneurs: i. high cost incurred in the starting exporting business (sunk cost), ii. introducing old products to new markets (what we are doing now), iii. introducing new products that are not consumed by local consumers (EDB has supported for this considerably), iv. Cost incurred in changing product line when the product is no longer profitable.
Another major problem is with the information about value addition. Some people believe that value addition could be made by adopting some management practices. This is because of not providing information simple digit for value addition. Therefore it is important to develop a formulae to represent each export commodity (e.g., similar to formulae for bus fair). Upon this formulae an index could be made to identify product’s potential to earn net income for the country. Low infusion of high-tech into export is another major problem to be addressed by policymakers. Considering the structure of Sri Lankan exports, majority of products are low-tech products.
It is timely to get foreign expertise to infuse high-tech into Sri Lankan exports. Another important aspect of export entrepreneurship is finding new raw materials. Although Sri Lanka is rich in minerals such as titanium, graphite, Ilmenite, Rutile, and quartz, we are exporting them in the most basic form. Then it is better to conduct feasibility studies with foreign collaboration to assess the potential of Sri Lankan minerals into intermediate product market.
According to our analysis, the main reason is low value addition potential of Sri Lankan exports due to high dependency percent of leading exports. To improve earning from exports we made several suggestions including introducing single digit index to identify the potential of Sri Lankan export. This may facilitate policy makers to assess the export industry promptly.
