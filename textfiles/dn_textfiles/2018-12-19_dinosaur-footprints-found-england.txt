Dinosaur footprints found in England

A trove well-preserved dinosaur footprints has been uncovered on a beach in southern England. Dating back to the Cretaceous Period, the prints still show traces of skin, scales, and claws.Paleontologists have uncovered 85 dinosaur footprints from at least seven different species on a beach in England.The prints range in size from around a three-quarters of an inch (2 cm) to nearly 24 inches (60 cm) across. The stratigraphic layers date back to the Lower Cretaceous Period, between 145 million and 100 million years ago. It’s now considered “the most diverse and detailed collection of these trace fossils from the Cretaceous Period found in the UK to date,” according to a statement.
