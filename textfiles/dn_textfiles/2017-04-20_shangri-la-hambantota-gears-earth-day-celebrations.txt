Shangri-La Hambantota gears up for Earth Day celebrations

Earth Day is globally recognised and celebrated on April 22 this year and Shangri-La's Hambantota Resort and Spa will celebrate its inaugural Earth Day with many activities related to sustainability, and an emphasis to think about the environment will be the highlight this weekend at the resort.
#RootedInNature is one initiative which will be launched in the resort's Bojunhala restaurant this weekend.
This initiative will focus on promoting home-grown vegetables, free from chemicals and pesticide. Adding to this will be a free range of livestock meat, poultry, eggs and sustainable seafood.
In 2014 Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts introduced Rooted in Nature, a culinary initiative highlighting locally sourced food offerings under the auspice of the Shangri-La Group's sustainability commitment.
Earth Day at the resort sits amongst the many CSR projects that Shangri-La supports. The resort will also showcase a kid's fashioncatwalk event, where kids will use recyclable material as the attire. A nature walk and much more awaits all at the resort.The recreation team of the resort will also emphasize the importance of fitness and wellbeing.
