GSK wins PPA Bowling Championship

 
Glaxo Smith Kline Pharmaceuticals (GSK) demonstrated its prowess in a wholly unrelated sphere recently when the company’s ‘A’ team won the annual Bowling tournament conducted by the Pharma Promoters Association (PPA).
The GSK team comprising of Stuart Chapman, Tyrone Fernando, Lashan Perera, Kosala Ranasinghe and Sandun Jayasinghe defeated a team from George Steuarts Pharmaceuticals in the finals. This is the second time that GSK won the PPA Bowling Championship in the four years it has been conducted. “GSK actively encourages its employees to participate in sports and other pursuits that develop team spirit and camaraderie while offering opportunities to improve skills, talents and versatility,” a spokesman for the company said.
“We are delighted to see the success of the bowling team, which is a good example of GSK’s commitment to this aspect of human resources development.” GSK has also won the annual PPA Quiz on several occasions. GSK and its predecessors have been doing business in Sri Lanka since the late 1930s.
