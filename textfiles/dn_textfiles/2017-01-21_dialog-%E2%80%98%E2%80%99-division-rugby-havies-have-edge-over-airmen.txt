Dialog ‘A’ division rugby : Havies have the edge over Airmen

The high-riding Havelock Sports Club will go out favourites against Air Force Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division League return game at Havelock Park under lights today commencing 6.30 p.m.
The Airmen played a superb game against Police SC in their last game at Ratmalana winning after a close fight by 15 points to 13, hence they will have to carry out a similar kind of performance if they hope to beat the Havelock's outfit.
The forte of the Air Force side has been their power-packed forwards and along with their speedy three quarter line they should come up with another blockbuster display with skipper Gayantha Iddamalgoda, Ashok Wijeyjumar, Saraka Weralla, lanky Thilina Bandara, the Medagedara brothers, Dimithri Patabandi, Ranindu Padmasanka, Nuwan Perera, Sooriya Krishan along with their ever green national centre Charith Seneviratne likely to give off their very best.
Meanwhile the high riding Havelock's side who turned tables on Army SC in their last outing at Ratmalana last week will go all out to get a bonus point victory against the formidable Airmen in their own den at Havelock Park.
Teams:
Air Force SC (Probable XV): Pushpakumara Samarahewa, Lahiru Udayanga, Prasad Medagedara, Thilina Bandara, Ranil Medagedara, Dimithri Patabandi, Dinesh Weeraratne, Saraka Waralla, Ashok Wijekumar and Gayantha Iddamalgoda (Captain), Ranindu Padmasanka, Sooriya Crishan, Charith Seneviratne, Ishara Madushan, Nuwan Perera, Head Coach: Leonard de Zilwa.

Kandy won’t have it easy against Police
Kandy SC who scored a thumping 50-22 win over Navy SC at Nittawela last week will go all out to give a repeat performance when they take on a gallant Police SC outfit in their Dialog ‘A’ Division League rugby second round match at Police Park today. Kickoff is at 4.00pm.
Police who went down fighting to Air Force SC (13-15) at Ratmalana last week will have to come up with a much better performance if they hope to overcome the lads from Kandy lads who have notched up heavy scoring victories over top sides like CR & FC, Havelocks and Navy; hence the cops should rally around and strive hard to pull off this game in their favour.
Teams:
Police SC (Probable XV): Udara Gayan, Achala Perera, Randeera de Silva, Romesh Archirige, Udara Sooriyapperuma (Captain), Radeesha Seneviratne, Ranjan Harischandra, Diren Warnakulasuriya, Mohamad Abzal and Sandesh Jayawickrama, Hashan Gmes, Musheen Falleel, Chula Susantha, Reeza Rafaideen, Rajitha Sanzoni, Head Coach: Sudath Sampath

Head Coach: Shawn Wijesinghe
Navy favourites against CH
Navy SC will go out as favourites to overcome the hapless CH and FC in their second round Dialog ‘A’ Division League rugby match at Navy grounds, Welisara today. Kick-off is at 4.00pm.
Navy thus far is the superior team and have lost only two matches in the ongoing league tournament to Havelock's SC in the first round and Kandy SC in the return leg last week at Nittawela.
CH and FC have lost all their ten matches played to-date and look a sorry outfit. Hence they might look to give an improved performance through their third row forward and former national captain cum flanker Yoshitha Rajapaksa who is leading them from the front against his former club. The sailors will field the same team which did duty for them last week against Kandy SC.
Teams
Navy SC (Probable XV): Roshan Ranasinghe (Captain) or Stefan Greogary, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Kasun De Silva, Supun Peiris, Sathya Ranathunga, Sajith Saranga ,Danushka “Gertha “ Perera, Nivanka Prasad, Richie Dharmapala and Chanaka Chandimal, Buddhima Piyaratne, Lee Keegal, Lahiru Herath, Saliya Handapangoda, Thilina Weerasinghe, Head Coach : Mothilal Jayathilake, Asst.Coach: Dev Anandh
