Poaching vessels to face heavy fines under new Act

The Government plans to impose fines upto Rs.100 million for vessels poaching in Sri Lankan waters and proposals have also been received to increase it up to Rs 175 million.
The Foreign Fisheries Vessels Act to be presented in Parliament this year will solve the issue of poaching by Indian trawlers in Sri Lankan waters, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
“Around 80 percent of the drafting process of the Foreign Fisheries Vessels Act has been completed and it will be presented to Parliament this year, Amaraweera said.
The minister said the new Act,fines will be imposed on the vessel owner who will have to appear in courts to secure the release of the vessel. Foreign fishermen involved in poaching in Sri Lankan territorial waters are now charged under the Immigration Act for unlawfully entering the country.
According to Indian media, Rameshwaram fishermen had been protesting against the Sri Lankan government amending its Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act to ban bottom trawling in the territorial waters of the country, said the Minister.
Amaraweera said the Fisheries Act was amended to strengthen the International Fisheries Law and also to protect the marine resources of the country by adding that all these decisions have been taken for the benefit of Sri Lankan fishermen and not for the fishermen in other countries.
The Minister said the central government of India has realised the damage caused damage caused by bottom trawling to Sri Lanka’s marine resources and they have already taken various progressive decisions to solve the issue.
“Appreciating the support extended by the Indian Government, we have agreed to consider India’s request to release 42 captured Indian fishing boats in the near future.” he added.
