Thambana villagers trot long way to town without a bridge

Villagers of Thambana in the Medagama Divisional Secretariat in Moneragala suffer immensely without a bridge over Kiulelanda stream to reach the town.
They said Thambana has over 52 families with about 300 members. In rainy seasons, their children do not attend schools until water subsides. They said everyone in the village including the schoolchildren get confined to the village in the rainy seasons.
R, M, Anulawathi, a resident, told Daily News that the students come in clothes they wear for homes near to the stream and dress in their school uniforms after crossing the stream.
She said the villagers face a dilemma when someone fell sick in the rainy seasons for there is no way for them to take the patient to hospital.
Lalitha Padmini, another resident, said Thambana is around 40 km away from Moneragala. One has to take Madugalla road from Moneragala and turn from the Ruwalwela Junction and come to Thamabana along the Medagama Road. She said politicians have been visiting village since 1948 yet they failed to build a bridge which they promised at every election. They urge authorities to construct a bridge over the stream to ease their burden.
