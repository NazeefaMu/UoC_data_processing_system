Lemon and  aloe vera  to lighten the  face skin

Aloe Vera is a sticky gel that is found inside its leaves. You have to take out the gel from the leaves and take it in a container.
Then mix it with lemon. Now apply it over your face and slowly rub it against your skin. Allow it to penetrate inside your skin. After sometime you can see your skin becomes soft and supple. You may or may not wash it with water as this can also be applied after taking bath. The remedy is very suitable for people willing to get white skin.
