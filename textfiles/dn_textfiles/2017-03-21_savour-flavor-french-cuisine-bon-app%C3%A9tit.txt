Savour the flavor of the French cuisine : Bon appétit!

March 21 will be a night to remember, make no mistake! One of the similarities people around the world share is an appetite for delicious food. It is one of the many gifts of life that make life worth living. On March 21, 2000 Chefs over five continents will prepare 2000 menus inspired by French Cuisine. Daily News visited Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Jean Marin Schuh residence and was briefed on the Good France event which will be held simultaneously all over the world.

Ambassador of France Jean Marin Schuh addressing the gathering 
“Good France is a worldwide event coordinated by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to showcase French Cuisine. With this event in Sri Lanka we want to honor French Cuisine - its excellence and its values.
The Gout de France/ Good France event unites chefs from all horizons and from around the world on the same evening, with one shared goal – Celebrating the excellence and creativity of French Gastronomy,” said French Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Jean Marin Schuh.
This is actually the result of a massive operation. Restaurants were invited to propose a menu that respects French Culinary tradition. An international committee of Chefs then approved the list of participating Chefs
“Following the great success of the two first events, we decided to repeat the experience in 2017 in Sri Lanka and the Maldives,” stated Schuh
The momentum has really picked up! Chefs around the world are now in their elements getting ready for the big day. In the first event 100,000 guests enjoyed a French Dinner in over 1,300 restaurants (85 percent abroad) and 150 embassies around the world.
This year in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, six restaurants are participating. Three in Colombo – Galle Face Hotel, Water’s Edge and Taj Samudra. Two in Kandy – Leopard d’ argent and OZO and one in Male – Taj Exotica Resort & Spa Maldives.
“Gastronomy is part of France’s heritage and our identity, as was demonstrated by UNESCO in 2010 when it incorporated the ‘Gastronomic meal of the French’ into the intangible cultural heritage of humanity. Gastronomy contributes significantly to our country’s image abroad and to our attractiveness, with almost a third of foreign tourist visitors saying that our food and wine was what most drew them to us,” explained Schuh.
This will be the mother of all dinners! A global consciousness. In the first event French Embassies abroad hosted some 5000 guests.
“Our Gastronomy is a pillar of our heritage and a remarkable ambassador for France, and should be therefore defended, supported and promoted. In Sri Lanka this year, restaurants and chefs showed a great interest for the event. I am proud to welcome them on board this exciting adventure,” added Schuh.
