Over 900 kgs of seized cocaine to be publicly destroyed today

Over 900 kilograms of cocaine said to be worth over Rs. 1 billion seized by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) will be publicly destroyed today. The drugs will be destroyed under the supervision of the Colombo Chief Magistrate while President Maithripala Sirisena will also be in attendance to observe the process.
The seized drugs are set to be liquefied and destroyed at the premises of the INSEE Ecocycle organization in Katunayake. According to Police, the liquefied cocaine will be incinerated thereafter at a facility in Puttalam. The stock of drugs to be destroyed is the largest haul of cocaine found in South Asia, Police said. The raid, conducted under the supervision of former Director of PNB, DIG Kamal Silva, led to the discovery of 928 kilograms and 229 grams of cocaine on December 9, 2016, in a shipping container located in the Colombo Harbour.
All officers who supported the raid will receive certificates and monetary prizes from the Police rewards fund at the event today.
According to statistics from the Sri Lanka Police, the PNB has seized 220 kilograms and 650 grams of cocaine estimated to be worth over Rs. 4.4 million during 2017, while 29 arrests have been made in connection to these cases.
