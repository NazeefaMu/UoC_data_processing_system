Dancing Dreams

The night was magical with fairies, swans and reindeer taking to the stage for an unforgettable performance. The Bishop’s College auditorium was alight with vibe and colour when students of the Russian School of Ballet and Dancing of the Russian Cultural Centre run by the Russian Embassy in Colombo held their ballet concert titled ‘Reach for your dreams,’ recently.
The audience was treated to soothing sounds all the way from Russia as well as from other parts of the world where classical dances were performed by the students under the able guidance of ballet teachers – both local and Russian - Galina Pleshakova, Samantha Samararathne, Niluka Madurawela, Svetlana Sergeeva, Radeesha Bodiyabadu and Lasni Subasinghe.
Students from three years onwards ‘reached for their dreams’ giving a dreamy yet lively experience to the audience. The programme consisted of Wizard of Oz, Waltz, Kalinka, 12 Dancing Princesses theme song dance, Irish Dance, Fairy Land Ballet, Swan Lake, and various other pieces from other dances. The Russian School of Ballet which took its initial steps with only four students in 2001 has now flourished into a full-fledged institute that promotes classical ballet. The school holds ballet classes for students from 3 to 17 years, and holds annual examinations conducted by ballet artistes from Moscow.
“It’s a joy to see our little girls who took their first steps in ballet with us 16 years ago, grow up to be graceful, poised and confident young ladies. The Russian School of Ballet not only teaches its students the art and technique of ballet as a form of dance, but also endeavours to build confidence, sportsmanship and grace among the students,” said the organizers.
Russian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Alexander Karchava and other guests participated.
