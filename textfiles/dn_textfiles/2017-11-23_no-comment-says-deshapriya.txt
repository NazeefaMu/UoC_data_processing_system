No comment says Deshapriya

Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya commenting on the Interim Order suspending the operation of the Gazette notification on the Delimitation report said the weekly meeting of the Elections Commission will discuss the matter on November 25.
Asked to comment on the new situation, Deshapriya in a lighter vein said “My comment at present will be no comment!”. “A no comment itself is a comment. So at the moment this is what I could say,” he said.
