Railway officers in civvies to look out for vandals

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday said Railway officers in civvies would in future monitor railway carriages for individuals who vandalise carriages and Railway property.
The government spends millions every year to provide the public with railway services, and thus it is the duty of the general public to protect these resources, said Minister de Silva.
Those found guilty of vandalising public property would be prosecuted under the Offences Against Public Property Act and would be liable for a prison sentence, fine or both.
The Minister was speaking at a function where 10 carriages that have been renovated by local manufacturers were put into service. The carriages were used on the train to Matara from Colombo Fort yesterday.
Under a government plan to strengthen local industry, in January 2017, a programme to revamp and refurbish 200 old and dilapidated Railway carriages was started, the minister said. Thus far 25 such carriages have been refurbished and are in use.
“When we started the project, the trade unions opposed it. They said the Railways was being sold to the private sector. The Ratmalana Railway workshop workers today are on a ‘work-to-rule’ campaign. So how can the minister or the government uplift the Railways with such action? We alone cannot achieve this task. We all need to come together. For tasks which we cannot do, we need assistance from the private sector.”
The Minister said the government spent Rs. 14 million to renovate each carriage under the current agreement, whilst they would have had to spend Rs. 60 million to import a new one.
The government has called for tenders for the purchase of 25 new engines and 15 power sets to further improve the Railways. “We should be able to get them by next year,” he said.
They have also started work on renovating several main railway lines and the Kelani valley dual track line. The Asian Development Bank has agreed to fund this through a soft loan.
“The government will not privatise the Railways, but we also can no longer afford to run it at a loss. We need an alternative programme,” said the Minister.
