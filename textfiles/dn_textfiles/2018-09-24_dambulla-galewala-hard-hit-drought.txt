Dambulla, Galewala hard  hit by drought

Several villages in the Dambulla and Galewela Divisional Secretariat divisions in the Matale district face an acute water and food shortage due to the prolonged drought.
People in Pahalawewa in particular, who earned a living by working as labourers on paddy fields, have lost their employment as paddy landowners have deployed harvesters and other machinery for harvesting and preparation of land, instead.
These unemployed labourers have started digging lotus yams in the dry Pahalawewa tanks to earn a living, while others have resorted to fishing in the small pools of the dry tank.
People in many villages in the area also face an acute shortage of water as all water sources have run dry due to the drought.
