I resigned to prevent split in party - Marapana

Ex-Cabinet Minister Thilak Marapana claims that he was representing the Attorney General (AG) when he made the controversial statement during the adjournment debate on the Avant Garde floating armoury case in Parliament last week, which lead to his resignation on Monday.
Marapana was insistent that he was in-fact informing the House and the general public of the AG’s opinion, although during his speech he lashed out at several MPs for disturbing him, claiming that they were “slandering” and calling the Avant Garde proprietor, N. Senadhipathi “a rouge,” but were “not allowing” him (Marapana) “to speak for him (Senadhipathi).”
“The Attorney General cannot come and make speeches as to why he said this. He expresses his opinion; he is not expected to have press conferences. I am a minister and an MP, when I speak in Parliament. It my duty by the public to inform them so that the public could clear any misconception that they have. Why should the AG be blamed? It is very unfair to malign a person like that,” he explained.
He wanted the public to accept the AG’s opinion he insists. “I myself know that it is correct, because I have examined these documents myself.”
Marapana explained that he had seen the same papers that the attorney General had examined to arrive at the conclusion to give his opinion on the case.
“This man (Senadhipathi) was my client; he came to me in January and February. He showed me these documents.”
Marapana is insistent that the weapons are legal. “One day all those who are having any doubts about these weapons would agree with me, I am confident,” he claims.
Senadhipathi consulted Marapana in January to prevent the court from freezing his accounts and to get clearance to travel to Nigeria, following the police raid on the floating Amoury anchored in Galle, he claims.
According to Marapana, the company was negotiating four contracts for the Sri Lanka Navy and he was ‘convinced it was a genuine operation’ after perusing the documents.
“At that time, I was a practicing as a lawyer. So I immediately wrote to the Attorney General, setting out these facts and urged him not to freeze the (Senadhipathi's) account. In view of the fact that it was very urgent for him (Sendhipathi) to travel to Nigeria. I urged the AG's Department to allow him to go and come back.”
He is quick to establish that Avant Garde only consulted him to seek legal opinion before he became a Member of Parliament.
“I was not even a Member of Parliament. I could not have influenced the AG’s opinion which came in June.”
The Police raid was staged
Marapana is fiercely critical of the conduct of the police and insists that the raid was conducted for political gains.
According to him, Avant Garde has obtained permission from the Defence Ministry to anchor the ship in the Galle harbour, as they needed to switch vessels. As the company had permission to enter any port in the country, given by the Ministry of Defence, “he did not even have to do this,” he says. Marapana says he had examined these letters of permission, copies of which have been given to the Navy, Galle Port authorities and the police.
The police was well aware of the floating armoury that was berthed in the Galle Harbour, claims Marapana.
“The ship was there since October 6, (2014), this raid was in mid January 2015. For three full months, this ship was anchored in the harbour and these weapons came in and out of the ship to be taken to other ships in the sea. The police is just hundred metres from the habour. So it is wrong for the police to say that they didn’t know that there was a ship such as this carrying weapons and wait till after the elections for it to be raided,” Marapana says critical of the conduct of the police.
“Even if someone made a complaint, they should have said it was a legitimate business.”
Marapana also refers to an investigation done by the Police in 2012, when two weapons issued to two Sea Marshals went missing, further establishing that the police was well aware of the floating armoury in question.
Conflict of Interest?
However, the police did conduct an investigation and evidence was submitted to the AG based on which the AG concluded the case.
Marapana was appointed Minister of Law and Order, following the August 8 elections, while demands for further investigations into the Avant Garde floating armoury case mounted.
Marapana maintains that he never interfered with the investigations after taking office as Cabinet Minister of Law and Order. He also insists that there was no conflict of interest in him holding the particular ministerial portfolio, while also practicing as a Criminal Lawyer.
“I have never, never poked my finger into investigations.”
He “never thought” there would be a conflict of interest in accepting the Ministerial Portfolio, despite Avant Garde being his client as it was “only one case.” He insists that the ethical conduct as a minister was “left to his “good self.”
“I am not going to meddle with the investigations like a fool.”
According to him, though he was in-charge of the police, he was only supposed to regulate, supervise the police and “look into any delays” in the work, not monitor investigations.
Pressure to Resign?
However, Marapana decided to tender his resignation to ensure that the public believe there is no biasness in the investigations and to prevent a split in the party.
“Even though I made this statement and the AG has given his opinion, some MPs still maintain further investigations should be conducted. There may be a public perception that the investigations may not be conducted properly if I remain in the ministry. I wanted to avoid that conclusion.”
The decision to resign was his own, Marapana insisted. The decision was taken to safeguard the government, he claimed.
“I went and discussed the matter with the Prime Minister. I realized that it would create a division in the party, if I don’t step down. Some people in the Cabinet were adamant that this should be reinvestigated and that so long as I was the minister, it cannot be properly investigated and the JVP was also shouting. So in that situation, I didn’t want to create any problems for the party or the government, ” Marapana explained.
According to him, the decision to resign was taken to protect the government he helped bring to power.
“I took this bold decision to step down to protect the government and the party. I feel that it was a small price to pay to maintain the unity of our party and the stability of our government.”
Another Portfolio
Marapana is also insistent that he would not take any other Ministerial post either.
“Because then the allegation may be that so long as I am a cabinet minister, the police may be frightened to conduct investigations. Let the police investigate this, it is only a small area under investigation,” he explained.
He will continue to support the government and take over any responsibility assigned to him by the Prime Minister. His loyalties are with the UNP and “entirely with the Prime Minister,” and “will
support the President and the Prime Minister on anything they decide.”
However, he expressed his disappointment on how those who helped the government to come into power have been treated.
“We the ‘National Lawyers Association” played a crucial role in the Presidential and General elections. I feel sad that our lawyers have not got the due recognition from the present government. I hope they
would be rewarded in the near future. Their services to the party should be recognized. I have been taking great pains to see that it happens. Unfortunately, I have not been able to do much,” he says.
Marapana is also undecided on whether or not he would continue his legal work while remaining in Parliament, he said.
However, he has decided not represent the Avant Garde, in light of the present political situation surrounding the case.
“Avant Garde has their own lawyers. He has not come to me since January. He came to me in January as it was essentially a criminal matter" Marapana said.
