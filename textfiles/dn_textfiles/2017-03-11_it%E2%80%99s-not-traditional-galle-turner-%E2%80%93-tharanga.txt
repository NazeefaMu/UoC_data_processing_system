It’s not a traditional Galle  turner – Tharanga

 GALLE: As much as Bangladesh faces an uphill task in trying to score the remaining 390 runs for an unlikely win off a minimum of 98 overs today Sri Lanka will also have a challenge ahead of them trying to capture ten Bangladesh wickets on a Galle track described by second innings century-maker Upul Tharanga as one with less turn than it’s traditionally known for.
On top it is the inclement weather which threatens to disrupt the fifth and final day. The weather has already clipped off 49 overs which both sides would have valued and there is no guarantee that today it will be rain-free.
“Our planning was not based on weather predictions. We can’t look too much into the weather. It could rain tomorrow as well,” said Tharanga at the end of the fourth day. “We have 98 overs and the first hour is going to be crucial. In that first hour if we can take two-three wickets, we can turn the game in our favour.
“Our aim was to give them 125 overs. The Galle wicket this one has less turn. Even on day four there’s not much turn which is unusual. Bowlers need some cover as well. When they have lot of runs they can be attacking. For the fast bowlers the bounce was variable. Disappointed we didn’t get a wicket today.”
Scoring his maiden Test century at home Tharanga said that he was pleased to get it after his first innings failure.
“I was asked whether I liked to open before the series. I stated as an opener I didn’t have any issues and said ‘yes’,” said Tharanga. In the last few years I batted in the middle order and in the last two series also in the same position. Wherever I play I want to do a job for the team.
“It’s up to the management and selectors to decide where I bat. They have used me as an opener since South Africa. If the management is happy, I am happy too.”
However Tharanga admitted that being moved up and down the order was a challenge for a batsman’s mental make-up.
“Batting in the top order and middle order is different. I take up that as a challenge. It’s all up to how I prepare. In a Test match when you open, the first hour or two, the ball seams. You have to prepare for all that. As a player you have to be prepared for such changes,” said the 32-year-old left-hander from Balapitiya. ST
