Ogilvy Media’s young talent for Cannes Lions Festival

Ogilvy Media’s Dulanjali Dilrukshi and Sanoj Fernando will be representing Sri Lanka in the Young Lions Media competition at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in France, to be held June 18-22, 2018.
The duo was selected after emerging winners at this year’s Young Lion’s competition in Colombo, and will be the first from Ogilvy Media to represent Sri Lanka in the youth competition of the world’s biggest awards festival for the creative and marketing communications, entertainment, design and tech industries.
Adjudged the winners from 11 teams that participated in the Media category of the local Young Lions competition, the campaign by Dulanjali and Sanoj titled “The Final Trump (Awasan Thurumpuwa)” was especially commended for its novelty and clever strategy.
This is the latest in a series of similar achievements for the young talent in the Phoenix Ogilvy Group, which saw them sweeping the boards at the 2017 local Young Spikes Competition, winning all three categories of Media, Digital and Integrated.
“At Ogilvy Media, we have a distinctive approach to media planning and buying. It is first important to identify the business problem at the root of any campaign, accurately profile the target audience and then isolate the platforms from which they consume information the most,” said Lalith Sumanasiri, Managing Director of Ogilvy Media and NeoOgilvy.
Both Dulanjali and Sanoj, started their careers at Ogilvy Media in 2015 and 2016 respectively, with Dulanjali simultaneously continuing her education at the Open University of Sri Lanka, while Sanoj joined the company after completing his Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing from the University of Ruhuna.
