President Maithripala Sirisena said the final decision of the government on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) will be announced today.
The solutions were based on the report of committee headed by Deputy Minister Dr.Harsha de Silva.The President said that the responsibility of creating intellectuals to meet the needs of the innovation economy will be lying with the State Universities as well as with the private sector. He also said that all those institutions should safeguard the quality and standards of the education. If the president did not take actions to address these SAITM issues, Dr.Nimal Karunadasa said that they will raise their voice.
They said that the standards of these private medical colleges were poor and the government took measures to get the SAITM students agreed to sit for the national examinations.
The Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) has revealed that SAITM had not received the approval of the University Grants Commission (UGC).
The Deans have emphasised that there must be an opportunity for higher education in Sri Lanka, through both government and the private sectors.
However, they have highlighted that the degree programmes offered by any higher educational institute must follow the requirements of the relevant professional body which in the case of medicine,is the SLMC.
