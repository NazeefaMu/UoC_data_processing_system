NDB felicitated with  international awards

However, NDB managed to surpass these boundaries and emerge on the top as the “Best Bank of Sri Lanka” by the prestigious Global Finance Magazine at the 25th Annual Best Bank Awards in the Asia Pacific.     
The award is conferred by the editors of Global Finance magazine, based on the growth in assets, profitability, geographic reach, strategic relationships, new business development and innovation in products.
