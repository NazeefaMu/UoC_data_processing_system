findmyfare.com wins big at SLT Zero One Awards

Sri Lanka’s largest online travel company findmyfare.com recently won awards for “Best Website” and “Best Digital Enabled Product” in the “Travel and Leisure” category, at the prestigious SLT Zero One Awards.
The company has been recognised at the SLT Zero One Awards because its travel-related products and services have evolved significantly to compete effectively in the online arena.
In fact, the findmyfare.com website currently receives a significant number of visits per day, with its wide variety of content captivating visitors due to unbeatable travel deals and other offers, as well as unique sectoral innovations. Further, findmyfare.com offers a unique range of products and services that are truly multi-platform in scope, no doubt the reason behind its “Best Digital Enabled Product” award nod.
Launched on September 27, 2016, the SLT Zero One Awards is the first awards programme in Sri Lanka recognising and rewarding innovative initiatives in the field of digital communication.
Abishek Sithampalam, Director of findmyfare.com said, “We at findmyfare.com are pleased to be recognised for our best-in-class, multi-platform website and content. Despite it being just one of the many innovations we deploy frequently, we are proud of the work our team has put into the website, continually keeping it fresh and attractive.”
Since its launch in 2012, findmyfare.com has become Sri Lanka’s ultimate one-stop travel shop, providing the best travel deals available in the market-place. The findmyfare.com website allows customers to search, compare and book affordable flights and hotels around the world. The company was also the very first in Sri Lanka to provide an online reservations system that enabled customers to confirm bookings without submitting a credit card payment. All the features of the findmyfare.com website are also designed to make the process of researching, choosing and paying for a holiday as simple, easy and convenient as possible. Please note that terms and conditions for the above initiative apply.
