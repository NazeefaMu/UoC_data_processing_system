Are doctors’ strikes ethically justifiable?
Lionel Wijesiri’s article captioned “Are doctors’ strikes ethically justifiable” is a balanced well-written piece of journalism. He emphasises he is writing the piece as a common citizen and, in that aspect, he has very well projected the average citizen’s viewpoint on doctors’ strikes.
I also agree that we need to analyse our doctors’ strikes, firstly, in terms of its reasons, modalities and its impacts. Secondly, we need to elaborate a general ethical reflection on doctors’ strikes using normative ethical framework. General ethical reflection must be based on the Hippocratic Oath and other codes, biomedical principles like beneficence, non-maleficence and autonomy, as well as ethical approaches like deontological and utilitarian reasoning, and traditional Sri Lankan philosophy.
Sri Lankan doctors’ strikes are morally not acceptable and ethically not allowable based on deontological reasoning and Hippocratic tradition. However, considering utilitarian reasoning, as Wijesiri points out, doctors’ strikes for fair wage, better hospital infrastructure and working conditions are justifiable if it causes less harm to present patients and gives more good to the future patients.
I suggest SLMC develop an appropriate framework developed to prevent doctors from taking a collective action. At the same time, in order to make health care system more efficient and problem free, government should develop appropriate strategies to support health care workers, including doctors, and it should be reviewed regularly so that the frequency and the severity of medical strikes will be minimized in the future.
