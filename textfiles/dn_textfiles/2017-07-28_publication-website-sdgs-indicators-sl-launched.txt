Publication, website on SDGs indicators in SL launched

The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) has launched a publication titled ‘Status of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)Indicators in Sri Lanka: 2017’ and a website to disseminate up-to-date information particularly for Sri Lanka on SDGs. In 2015, countries of the United Nations adopted a set of goals to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as a part of the new sustainable development agenda.
The SDG officially known as ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development’, is a set of seventeen goals with 169 targets and 244 indicators between them.
All countries of the United Nations are expected to give high priority in their development agendas to the SDGs.
The commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka in achieving 2030 goals is reflected by establishing the Ministry of Sustainable Development Parliament Select Committee  on SDGs, the mandate of which is to make recommendations to ensure that the UN 2030 Agenda for SDGs is achieved in Sri Lanka and having four cluster committees of parliamentarians set up representing four thematic areas.
The first copy of this publication was presented to the Deputy Speaker, Chairman of the Parliament Select Committee on SDGs, Thilanga Sumathipala, on July 26, at Parliament by Dr. A.J. Satharasinghe, Director General of the Department of Census and Statistics.
A website on SDGs in Sri Lanka, was also launched by the Chairman of the Parliament Select Committee on SDGs.
There is an urgent need for a SDG indicator framework to turn the SDGs and their targets in to a management tool to help development of implementation strategies and to allocate resources accordingly.
It also serves as a report card to measure programmes towards sustainable development and help to ensure the accountability of all stakeholders for achieving the SDGs.
“Preparing this publication on the availability of data for 244 SDG Indicators (Indicator Framework) is an important endeavour to facilitate compilation of baseline data by the respective agencies, monitoring the progress, and reporting the achievements of SDG Targets,” said Dr. A. J. Satharasinghe, Director General of the Department of Census and Statistics, at the launch ceremony.
This publication provides a brief overview on 17 SDGs, 160 SDG targets and 244 indicators.
Baseline data already compiled by the DCS for the indicators are given in this publication.
Also given in this publication are global and local definitions and tiers for these indicators.
The Director General further said that this publication will continue to be updated by incorporating data compiled by the DCS and other institutions of the NSS from time to time.
The Director General of the DCS said that the webpage launched on SDGs in Sri Lanka can be accessed through its website at www.statistics.gov.lk.
