Mohammad Amir mulls Test retirement

Pakistan’s tainted left-arm pacer Mohammad Amir is considering ending his Test career in order to focus on One-dayers and Twenty20 cricket.
According to reports in the Pakistani media, Amir discussed this prospect with his teammates and the management after Pakistan lost the second Test against the West Indies in Barbados. “Amir himself is now upset that how this private discussion came out in the open and who leaked the discussions,” one report said. - NDTV
