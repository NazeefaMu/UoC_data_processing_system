Eyes Fixed on the goal

Spartan Maleesha Navaratne, Head Prefect of Hillwood College Kandy is surrounded by a belt of responsibilities. Perfect Prefects features Head Girl Maleesha Navaratne who values courage and hard work when it comes to fulfilling her obligations.
“When you take the role of Head Prefect, I think the Head Prefect should have a passion for this role. That is one of the main things when it comes to qualities a Head Prefect should possess. Because if you don’t want to be a leader, there is no point in being the Head Prefect. And with this position comes great responsibility. I think a Head Prefect needs to be responsible, punctual and should be dedicated and committed. She has to be able to balance her studies as well as school work and extra-curricular activities,” said Navaratne
Fire melts butter but hardens steel.
“Other than that, a head girl should be able to face challenges. There are different ways of facing challenging situations. Sometimes you have to be sentimental, sometimes you have to be hard on a situation. But whatever it is you have to have the courage to face it. As long as you have courage any challenge can be overcome,” explained Navaratne
Navaratne is responsible for her guild. It consists of 40 prefects. Nine seniors and 31 juniors.
“I am responsible for each one of their behaviours- how they lead the school and lead students. A head prefect should be responsible for her own character – how she behaves at school and as well as outside school and in other situations,” pointed out Navaratne
When every school function comes up, she has to be responsible for almost every aspect.
The Hillwood Week which is due in May is one of the biggest events in our school. For a whole week, we have an event every day from Monday to Sunday. That is the busiest week in our school calendar, and every event I am doing that week is handled by me and my guild of prefects.
Everything is under my responsibility and I have to make sure everything is done well. Hillwood was founded on May 15, 1890. This year is the 127th anniversary. It is a tradition in our school that the week the 15th falls on May is considered as Hillwood week. Every year, each day we have allocated some events which should happen.
On Monday we have Alms Giving and inter-religious day, Tuesday we have the Prefects Induction, Wednesday we have a combined Aesthetic program, Thursday we have Shramadana and on Friday we have the Prize Giving (which is one of the biggest events in the school), Saturday is Founder’s Day and Sunday is Hillwood Sunday,” elucidated Navaratne
Other than that, the school have their ‘days’. Each club has their days. e.g Commerce Day, English Day and she has to oversee them as well with the president of each club.
“When I look at the world I am concerned about those who are ‘cornered’ in society. When I say cornered, I mean people who are cornered because they are drug addicts, homosexuals, transgenders. I feel concerned about people who are cornered because of their disabilities and because they were born in different ways. That is what catches my attention,” added Navaratne
Character and commitment would have been why she was elected Head Prefect.
“I was chosen as Head Prefect for many reasons. When I was going for the interview, I think they chose me basically because of my character and my personality and how I would handle situations. I am a Christian and this is a Christian school. A higher attention is given to Christians. But we also give opportunities for other religions as well. Because in the prefects guild there is always at least one Muslim prefect, with Buddhists and Christians Prefects as well,” explained Navaratne
Her ambition was to be a Marine Engineer because she wanted to travel.
“But they told me that if I was to become a Marine Engineer I would have to do Science & Math for my A/Ls. They said it might be a bit competitive. The school advised me to do Commerce or Arts and I chose Arts. But I still plan on pursuing my ambition. I also have a plan on joining the UN Embassy in some way. So either way I will get to travel a lot,” stated Navaratne
Support from above and from school has taken her a long way.

“The first thing that strengthens me is my God. In any situation which I face which is hard, I just look up to God and in some way, I find a solution how to get through it. My Principal has always been a great support to me. My teachers and my guild of prefects have always been a source of strength to me, in whatever situation. If something goes wrong, they have always been there to help me and show me areas that I would not see, to solve any situation or problem,” informed Navaratne
There is also a uniqueness to the Prefects attire. They wear the Kandyan Osariya with the blazer. The prefects are privileged to wear that.

“I was born in 1999, and I lived in Colombo till 2009. But my mother wanted to bring me up in a society like Kandy. So we had to move to Kandy. My dad’s original hometown was in Kandy. But my Dad stayed on in Colombo because he works there. He comes every weekend. They have been supportive in every way. They have never let me down in anything. In any situation they have always been there for me,” said Navaratne.
 
Reading books and watching movies are her outside interests.
“I read most of Jeffrey Archer and Nora Roberts, which I find very interesting. Recently I read Jeffrey Archer’s ‘Prisoner of Birth’. The way Jeffrey Archer expresses himself makes his books very interesting to read. He has the reader’s attention by the way he writes something. When it comes to movies lately I watched ‘Collateral Damage’ and I have watched movies like ‘Suicide Squad’ and ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ and ‘Lucy’,” said Navaratne
Navaratne consider passion the most important requirement to lead.
“If you have a passion to be a leader, then that is all you need. The sky is the limit. All you need is to have your goal and just aim for it. Pursue your passion and goals whatever the obstacles or challenges might be, keep your eye on the goal and reach for it, victory is yours as long as you aim for a goal,” summed up Navaratne.
