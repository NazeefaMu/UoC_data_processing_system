Hats off for Diana, Hats off for Diana, the diplomat

The designers who kept all her secrets and how she used her headgear for diplomacy: The hats that made Diana feel like a Princess
There was no other girl in the world who wore as many hats as Princess Diana did during the Eighties.
On the day she signed up to The Firm in St Paul’s Cathedral in 1981, millinery-wearing was in the job description.
‘She knew it was part of being royal,’ says milliner Stephen Jones, best known in the early Eighties for his rock star hats, but a firm favourite of the Princess in the latter part of the decade.
‘She understood from the Queen and the Queen Mother that it was part of the responsibility — to be identifiable. It was a symbol of royalty, to set you apart.’
The Queen’s rules for millinery were laid down long before Diana arrived, and still exist. Hats must never disappoint by having brims which obscure the face from onlookers — that would be rude — and can never fly off. Diana took the convention to heart, at least at first. And it worked. ‘Hats give me confidence,’ Diana once remarked, early in her career as Princess of Wales.
The designers who kept all her secrets
A few months before the big wedding, 19-year-old Diana was taken by her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, to the West London showroom of Scottish-born milliner John Boyd.
A veteran of the Chelsea design establishment, Boyd had been making hats for Princess Anne since she was 17, and Margaret Thatcher since she became Prime Minister in 1979. ‘I knew Diana’s grandmother,’ he tells me now, aged 91. ‘And I met her mother every day on the 173 bus.
‘That day, Diana came in wearing knickerbockers, looking like a principal boy on the stage. She was quite shy, but it quickly became clear she wasn’t interested in plush showrooms; she wanted to see the workroom upstairs and meet the girls there.
‘They got chatting and she told them she’d come because there was a marriage in view, though she didn’t say it was hers.
‘Then she spotted a tricorne hat — a new shape for us — which was going to be in the latest collection, and she said: “Oh, I do like that, I think I want that for my going away hat.” And that was when we realised it was her wedding she was talking about.’
The hat was plucked from the collection, and the shape reserved for Diana. Boyd made another in the same peach-coloured silk as the Bellville Sassoon going away outfit, and topped it with ostrich feathers — a reference to the Prince of Wales’ three-feathered insignia — which were dyed to match the fabric.
Even for Boyd, it was a career-defining commission and the hat was a big public hit. Suddenly ostrich feathers were all the rage. Indeed, Boyd’s South African supplier, whose business hitherto was built on providing huge feathers for dancing girls in Hollywood, was ‘flabbergasted’ by the boom in demand.
In those early years the Princess was almost never seen without a hat, and Boyd became one of her most trusted designers. He understood the enormity of the task she was faced with, and developed a kindly, teasing relationship with her.
‘She was very tall, and I had to avoid making her look any taller,’ he says. ‘She liked hats that fitted quite close to her head, and she liked little nets and veils too, which also became very popular.’
In fact Boyd’s pretty Diana designs — tricornes, mini-bowlers, close-fitting cocktail hats with netting and feathers — triggered a trend for small-brimmed hats. ‘From 1981 to 1983, the style was copied at every possible price level,’ wrote critic Colin McDowell. At seven and a half, her hat size was a little bigger than average, and her hair was ‘quite springy’, so Boyd bought special wire combs from Thailand to keep the hats on her head.
‘She had a great sense of humour,’ he says. ‘I used to tease her, and say: “You’ve got a big head — let’s hope there’s a lot inside it because you’ve got a big job.”
‘I remember once, early on, we went to the wee cafe across the road from the showroom and a woman there said to her: “You look just like that new Princess.” And she replied: “That’s funny, everybody says that .” ’
It’s a telling anecdote from a time, hard to imagine now, when Diana’s face was still relatively unknown — glimpsed under a heavy veil on her wedding day, but by no means iconic yet. ‘She did have a wonderful fashion sense,’ says Boyd. ‘She knew just how to wear hats and look chic. And the more people got to know her, the better an ambassador she was for British fashion.
‘In the end, she was just the best we’ve ever had. Wherever you went in the world, as soon as they heard you speak English, people would ask you all about “Lady Di”. They couldn’t get enough of her.’
As she grew into her Royal role, milliners Philip Somerville, Frederick Fox, and Graham Smith of Kangol, were drafted in, too.
The Australian hat-maker Fox was particularly influential in the mid-Eighties, when Diana began to experiment with wider brims and was seen wearing his flying saucer-shaped hats at Ascot.
Somerville, meanwhile, often made hats to co-ordinate with outfits by Catherine Walker, and encouraged Diana to go for bold colours, often with distinct hat bands — fuchsia and pillar box red; crimson and black.
This was in marked contrast to John Boyd’s more discreet affairs. He was also behind Diana’s move into Jackie Kennedy-style pillboxes, which she wore perched on the back of her head.
Diplomacy
Diplomacy via headgear was royal protocol. Coded compliments to foreign hosts and witty references for special appearances were part of the Queen’s tradition, and Diana ran with it.
For a visit to Japan in May 1986, for example, she accessorised a now-famous red-spotted dress with a wide-brimmed scarlet hat, replicating the Japanese Rising Sun flag almost too obviously — though her hosts fell in love with it, and the outfit made headlines around the world the next day.
Meanwhile, a Philip Somerville blue-and-white turban hat was commissioned for a trip to Dubai in 1989; a stylish means of keeping her hair from view, in line with the country’s more conservative attitude to female dress.
Somerville also made her a sleek pagoda-shaped hat in purple silk — with a wide brim and a pointed crown — to match a Catherine Walker outfit worn on a visit to Hong Kong in 1989.
Milliner Graham Smith provided the suitably military-style white hat for Walker’s outfit for Diana when she attended a passing out parade at Sandhurst in 1987.
But most daring, and either horribly mistaken or gloriously witty, depending on your taste, was the hat she wore to Ascot in 1986. Its black silk brim and crown of green and black polka dots matched her spotty dress. With an outfit so clearly referencing lurid jockey silks, onlookers might have been forgiven for expecting Diana to saddle up for the races herself. ‘She loved dressing up, because in a way, the clothes and hats could speak for her when she couldn’t,’ says Stephen Jones. -Daily Mail
