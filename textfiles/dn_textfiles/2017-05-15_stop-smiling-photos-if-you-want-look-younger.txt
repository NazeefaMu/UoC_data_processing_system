Stop smiling in photos if you want to look younger

Most people know it takes 25 fewer muscles to smile than it does to frown. The act of smiling has numerous positives attached to it. Not only does it make you look happy and approachable, but it also releases endorphins, making it a surefire way to boost your mood.
Sadly, it’s emerged that smiling is not all it’s cracked up to be. If it’s your go-to photo expression, experts have some bad news. A recent experiment found that smiling in photos can add up three and half years to your face, writes The Sun . This is because smiling apparently exaggerates the appearance of wrinkles around the eyes. Maybe you don’t care. Maybe life is too short to worry about things like these. Or maybe your anti-ageing regimen is so efficient you need never worry about wrinkles again.
However, if your appearance in photos does matter to you, there are some alternative facial expressions which will help reduce the appearance of wrinkles. And it seems as if the likes of Kylie Jenner and Victoria Beckham - neither exactly renowned for their readily beaming faces - are on to something. After the research was conducted, it was found the best faces to adopt are either a neutral expression, or a “pouting” surprised one. One thing which was rather sweet and reassuring was the participants said they still believed smiling makes people look younger.
However Melvyn Goodale, who worked on the study at the University of Western Ontario, Canada, rained on their parade somewhat, saying. “We show that this belief, which is well-rooted in popular culture, is a complete misconception.”
So there you go, even if you’re having the time of your life, don’t let it show on your face. Mirror
