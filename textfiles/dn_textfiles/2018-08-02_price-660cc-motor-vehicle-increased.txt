Price of 660cc motor vehicle increased

The price of a 660cc motor vehicle imported from Japan will increase by about Rs.250,000 due to the increase in Excise Duty, Sri Lanka Vehicle Importers Association President Sampath Merenchige said.
Accordingly, he said the new price of a WagonR car will be about Rs. 3.65 million while the new price of an Alto Japan Car will be about Rs. 2.55 million.
