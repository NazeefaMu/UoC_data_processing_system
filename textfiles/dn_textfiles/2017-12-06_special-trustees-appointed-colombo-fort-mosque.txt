Special Trustees appointed for Colombo Fort Mosque

Nine persons were appointed as Special Trustees of the Colombo Fort Mosque at Chatham Street, Colombo 1 under the powers vested in the Wakfs Board.
They are M. Azhar Kamaldeen Ex- DIG, M.I. Mohamed Rafeek, former Secretary Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Mohamed Juffry Ex- DIG, Mohamed Mohinudeen, Corporate Director, M. Ali Hassen, Director of Information, Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, M. Z. Nazeer Ahamed, A. Sufffiyan Mohideen, Meera Sahib and G.M Nazar. All are company directors.
There had been several allegations of the misconduct of some of the persons in charge of the Masjid, which has been reported to the Wakfs Board by the members of the Masjid.
The donors and other benefactors who contribute regularly have been disappointed as some shops and business establishments have been put up within the mosque premises against the wishes of the donors and without the concurrence of the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs (MRCA) and the Wakfs Board, stated a press release.
Repeated reminders to rectify the situation by the WB and the MRCA have been ignored.
In the circumstances, the Wakfs Board has been compelled to appoint the new board of Special Trustees, with a mandate to take all possible steps to regularize the unauthorized structures that have been illegally constructed and rented out to outsiders, a press release stated.
