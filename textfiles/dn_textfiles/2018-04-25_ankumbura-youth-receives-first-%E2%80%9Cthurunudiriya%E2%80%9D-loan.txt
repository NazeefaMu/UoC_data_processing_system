Ankumbura youth receives first “ThurunuDiriya” loan

The first loan under the “ThurunuDiriya” loan scheme was awarded by the Bank of Ceylon Ankumbura branch to a young entrepreneur from Ankumbura in the Kandy District recently.
The Bank of Ceylon’s “ThurunuDiriya” loan scheme has been initiated by the Policy Development Office of the Prime Minister’s Office to uplift young entrepreneurs of the country.
The first recipient of this loan is Asela Tharindu, who owns an online clothing trading platform and an entrepreneur.
He created a clothing trading solution - daylook.lk and used Facebook to market his clothing range that has already over 200,000 followers around the country. As a result, he also has become a job creator by providing opportunities for more youth to be employed in his growing business.
He said he plans to use the loan to further develop his business by investing in a robust web-based trading platform soon.
The “ThurunuDiriya” was launched aiming to provide assistance to young qualified entrepreneurs having novel ideas to improve their entrepreneurship skills that will contribute to the country’s economic development.
This loan scheme has become a boost to small scale entrepreneurs who want to take the next step to develop their ongoing business.Currently, the Bank of Ceylon has received a large number of applications from around the country with the Eastern Province branches receiving the largest number of loan applications. The necessary guidance and assistance for the preparation of the project proposal which is the prerequisite for this loan will be provided by the Small Business Development Division Officers at all District Secretariats across the country. So far, around 800 applications that have been received are awaiting evaluation.For example,the Ratnapura District itself received nearly 340 applications.
