MoU signed between Kelaniya University and ICTISC

To develop ICT related NVQ courses in e-learning:
A memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between the University of Kelaniya and the Information and Communication Technology Industry Skills Council (ICTISC) yesterday, to develop ICT related NVQ courses in e-learning platform in Sri Lanka.
ICTISC Chairperson Poorna Bandara said that one of the main objectives of the Council was to act as quality assurance, coordinating and advisory body for e-learning for vocational education for the Industry Sector councils. Among the other objectives are, providing National Competency Standards and related Curriculums, promoting and obtaining the endorsement from the industry for trainings and courses provided through e-earning platform and providing various industry inputs related to technologies, standards, statistics and recommendations.
The MOU would provide the ICTISC an opportunity to collaborate with the University of Kelaniya in the e-learning project. The Council is basically entering the necessary inputs from the industrial sector. We will be able to get the industry inputs into the university and then create the e-learning resources materials. This opportunity will create a supply chain linking universities, the government and industries, thereby creating an environment for job creation. We need to convert lecture based teaching into learner based teaching. One of the main objectives of the e-learning platform is to introduce leaner based teaching to Sri Lanka. It is essential to provide high quality education. We have the infrastructure which is a e-learning platform. This will be used to train Sri Lankan citizens for the digital future under the e-citizens programme. The entire project is the sustainable and long term programme which would take Sri Lanka into the digital economy.
Vice-Chancellor, University of Kelaniya, Professor D. M. Semasinghe, said one of the main objectives are working with the ICTISC for analysing the needs of ICT related NVQ courses in the e-learning platform and to design, develop and deliver e-learning programmes. Several other
objectives are working with ICTISC to identify courses of other sector council into e-learning platform, creating public and private sector partnerships for professional and career development, promoting anywhere, anytime learning in Sri Lanka and especially, provide knowledge at doorstep for rural areas in Sri Lanka, increasing employability of young people and attracting overseas investors and outsourcing jobs by creating a national knowledge work force.
He said an e-Learning Resource Centre has been set up at the University of Kelaniya for ICT courses as a part of the budget proposal of last year and the government has funded Rs. 250 million for that.
The ICT related NVQ courses are expected to commence at this centre. This would help to produce employees in line with the industry requirements.
