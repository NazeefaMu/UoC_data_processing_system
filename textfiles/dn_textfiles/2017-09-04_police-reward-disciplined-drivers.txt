Police to reward disciplined drivers

In an effort to combat the high incidence of traffic accidents, the Police Department acting on the direction of IGP Pujith Jayasundera has introduced a new practice of selecting disciplined and cultured drivers and rewarding them in addition to the normal practice of nabbing errant drivers and taking legal action against them.
As a first step of this programme, a batch of 300 disciplined drivers were routinely selected in the Kandy City and presented gift vouchers of Rs.3,000 each after a workshop held for them in Kandy for their benefit for a duration of one week plus a free inspection of their vehicles.
The programme was sponsored by AMW pit stop.
“The next step of this programme would be held in Colombo and later extended to Kurunegala and Matara,” a Police Headquarters release said.
As the programme progressed, added benefits would be given to disciplined drivers selected including free medical check-ups, and a discount for services in leading hospitals and Hotels and restaurants.
N.M.Nalin Bandara, a resident of Gurudeniya, Kandy who was the first motorist halted by Police during the programme in Kandy said when police waved his car to a stop he was trembling thinking he had breached a traffic rule. But, the Policeman who was very courteous cleared his apprehensions saying he was stopped for the disciplined manner he was driving the vehicle. He said this motorist friendly attitude on the part of police would help clear public mistrust in the service.
