Public Lecture on Alzheimer’s disease

“Tea and Cognition: More than a storm in a tea cup !” will be the topic of this year’s public lecture on September 21 at 6.30 pm at the Lanka Alzheimer’s Foundation 110,Ketawalamulla Lane,Colombo 10.
The lecture will be delivered by Dr.Shehan Williams (MBBS, MPhil, MD, MRCPsych), Professor in Psychiatry and Consultant Psychiatrist, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya.
Tea is an ancient beverage considered to be the most commonly consumed beverage in the world after water. Recent epidemiological studies provide evidence that higher tea consumption could be related with slower cognitive decline, reduced risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, and reduced mortality in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
Although the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood, there is emerging evidence from in-vivo and in-vitro studies on the neuroprotective effects of tea.
The lecture will summarize the evidence regarding the role and the possible mechanisms of phytochemicals in tea for the reduction of risk factors and prevention of cognitive decline.
Professor Shehan Williams is a leading researcher in Alzheimer’s disease in Sri Lanka and has in July published a review article on ‘Diabetes and Alzheimer’s Disease: Can Tea Phytochemicals Play a Role in Prevention?’in the International Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease with a group of eminent researchers in Edith Cowan University , Perth, Australia. This research paper is significant as we celebrate 150 years of Tea in Sri Lanka.
