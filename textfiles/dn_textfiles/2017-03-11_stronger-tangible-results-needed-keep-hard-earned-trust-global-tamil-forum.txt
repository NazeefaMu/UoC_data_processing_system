Stronger, tangible results needed to keep hard-earned trust: Global Tamil Forum

While welcoming High Commissioner Zeid’s report on Sri Lanka released on March 3 in Geneva, the Global Tamil Forum said that ‘stronger, tangible results needed to be forthcoming without further delay to prevent any further dissipation of hard-earned trust.’
Quoting from the High Commissioners report the GTF called upon the Government of Sri Lanka to make every effort to implement all of the recommendations presented in the High Commissioner’s report, which include: ‘present a comprehensive strategy on transitional justice, with a time-bound plan’; ‘invite Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to establish a full-fledged country presence’; ‘adopt legislation establishing a hybrid court, which should include international judges, defence lawyers, prosecutors and investigators’; and ‘operationalise the Office of Missing Persons Act and provide the Office of the Missing Persons with sufficient resources and technical means’.
The GTF requested the member states to consider the following in resolution 34/1;in respect of Sri Lanka
1.Extend the timeline by the requested (by Sri Lanka) twenty four months to implement all of the requirements of resolution 30/1 of October 2015.
2.Must formally ensure that Sri Lanka makes a time bound delivery commitment to implement requirements of resolution 30/1 in full, without any exceptions.
3.Include a formal mechanism of monitoring of progress by OHCHR based from Sri Lanka
4.Delivery on these commitments must be formally reviewed on a more frequent basis (every six months) at the Council during the next two years, to avoid recurrence of non-delivery or partial delivery by Government of Sri Lanka by the end of the extended period.
GTF would like to reiterate its commitment to Sri Lanka’s transition to real peace, justice and prosperity, founded on genuine political power-sharing with all its peoples.
