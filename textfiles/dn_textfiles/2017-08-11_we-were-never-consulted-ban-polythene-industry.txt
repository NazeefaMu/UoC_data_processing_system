We were never consulted on the ban - Polythene Industry

The polythene ban which will become effective on September 1, despite all its good intentions, is likely to affect Sri Lanka’s retail economy, exports and even garbage disposal.
The ban will result in the overnight loss of 345,000 jobs across the country too, according to Sri Lanka’s HDPE polythene and recycling industry that is now up in arms over the ban.
“The new polythene ban is an industry and a humanitarian catastrophe that kills 345,000 livelihoods overnight,” said Chairman of All Ceylon Polythene Manufacturers and Recyclers Association (ACPMRA) Anura Wijethunga on August 8, in Colombo. ACPMRA Chairman Wijethunga, accompanied by more than 300 manufacturers of HDPE polythene, was addressing Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen and his top officials at the Ministry.
Eighty percent of Sri Lanka's annual polythene production is in HDPE (high-density polyethylene) considered to be stronger and low cost and the rest 20% in LDPE (low-density polyethylene).
Due to its high strength HDPE is considered to be more harmful to environment than LDPE. Annually Lankan HDPE manufacturers produce around 40 million kilos of HDPE polythene which is banned from September 1. The value of annual Lankan HDPE polythene output is Rs 12.87 Billion (US$ 84 million) and this sector employs 345,000 workers, 45,000 of them directly.
ACPMRA Chairman Wijethunga, addressing Minister Bathiudeen said that the ban will affect the entire economy. “Polythene is an essential material in everyday lives anyway. We too support environment preservation. Eight hundred HDPE industry operators are forced to shut down. After the announcement of the ban, we have been facing a serious liquidity crisis and are unable to operate no one lends us now. The entire HDPE industry is at a standstill.”
“No advance notice nor information about this ban was given to us in advance. We tried to join policy level decision making committee and asked them to include HDPE makers too but the 16 member committee did not include even one industry representative. As per latest government recommendations, after the ban starts on 1 September, if anyone still want to use polythene bags (“shopping bags”) in future, the one rupee bag at present will cost Rs 12 each and one lunch sheet will cost Rs 10 each."
"We also call for low cost oxo-biodegradable plastic technology to be used in Sri Lanka instead of proposed starch based bio degradable plastic technology, which is four times costlier. We brought down British experts at our own cost to explain to local environmental authorities but they refused to meet the experts. On the bright side, when we met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on this issue recently he showed his understanding of our plight and sympathised with us.”
Minister Bathiudeen who bore the brunt of polythene protest that was not of his making, said that being the Industry and Commerce Minister, he is concerned about job loss and impact on exports. “I was not involved in the ban but still I am willingness to support the sector for a win-win solution. Use of plastics that harm the environment should be discouraged, but step by step. It appears to me that the ban was somewhat sudden, and has been decided without the consultations of the industry” he said.
Thereafter Minister Bathiudeen instructed his top officials to inquire into this and also phoned several Cabinet Ministers promptly, calling for their inputs on the issue. He also immediately arranged a meeting yesterday between the industry representatives who met him on August 8 and national environmental officials.
More importantly, Minister Bathiudeen then scheduled another urgent consultation between industry representatives and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) for today (August 11). The CCEM is headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wcikremesinghe.
