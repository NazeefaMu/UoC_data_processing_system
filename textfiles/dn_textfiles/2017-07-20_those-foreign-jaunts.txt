Of those foreign jaunts

President Maithripala Sirisena has once again spoken of the need for a curb on overseas travel of government ministers, MPs and state officials, noting that, more often than not, these ministers and officials overstay their visits after attending some international conference or other. Implicit in the President’s remarks, made at a meeting with ministry secretaries on Monday, is that these extended overseas stays are at the expense of the taxpayer. The President also wanted a follow up on the plethora of bi-lateral agreements signed by the government during visits of the Head of State and ministers to foreign countries. He said, during his recent visit to Bangladesh, as much as 12 such bi-lateral agreements were signed, which, according to the host country’s Prime Minister, was the highest number of agreements signed by the Bangladeshi government on a single day. He called for the appointment of an additional secretary at ministerial level to follow up on these agreements.
Also, the President’s advise to the Secretaries that no single official should have a monopoly on foreign travel, no doubt, will be welcomed by the second tier officers who had been overlooked for such overseas travel wherein they could gain valuable exposure and insight to do with their profession. Being ignored continually could also lead to frustration and affect output of these officers.
True, overseas travel are being frequently undertaken by ministers, MPs and government functionaries, sometimes, for the flimsiest of reasons, and, often, for no reason at all, with nary a thought that the public has to foot the bill for the official stay as well as the extended stay, as pointed out by the President. Perhaps, the country’s Foreign Minister can be an exception to the rule, given the nature of his duties, but here too the tendency has been to go overboard. We say this because there was once a Foreign Minister who presented Supplementary Estimates to parliament to cover up his extravagant spending during his overseas visits, undertaken at the drop of a hat, with spouse and brood in tow. That worthy overreached himself by undertaking a visit to Iceland, a diplomatic outpost, where Sri Lanka is concerned.
It is such extravagance, no doubt, that the President had in mind when he prevailed upon government politicians and officials to minimize their foreign visits, and, what is more, to keep tabs on the agreements signed with foreign countries during such visits. Like the President noted, there had been no follow-up action on these trade and economic pacts even in the past. There has been much show, highlighting these agreements, where ministers or government representatives are shown exchanging letters denoting this or that trade pact, in the full glare of publicity, with photo opportunities with Heads of State and other dignitaries. However the public is left in the dark as to what have become of these agreements. No one is aware of what became of the agreements signed with much pomp and ceremony during the series of overseas visits by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Similar agreements are also signed during visits to this country by foreign leaders, but what became of their fate is anyone’s guess.
Hence, the suggestion by the President for the appointment of a monitoring authority in this connection is most welcome. The Right to Information could now come in handy for the public to verify if these agreements were real or phony ones, signed merely for the cameras, to bolster the egos of ministers or some government panjundrum. Not just the trade agreements, the President should also insist on a report of the various ‘study tours’ undertaken by ministers, MPs and even local government politicians. We say this because many a ‘study tour’ had been undertaken with regard to garbage management by ministers as well as LG politicians in the past. But the country is still neck deep in garbage, so to speak. Jolly rides could not to be condoned for ministers and MPs, to add to the numerous perks and privileges they now enjoy, unless they give value for money.
A mechanism should also be put in place for the effective monitoring of the affairs of our overseas missions. This is because, as is well known, these postings have been taken for granted as ‘all paid holidays’ for the kith and kin and supporters of the governments in power. The output of these appointees should be kept tabs on and those found wanting should be recalled and placed in other unimportant assignments, if rewarding past favours is what the authorities have in mind. The taxpayer should not be called upon to pick the tab on behalf of the deadwood in overseas postings. The country is now being made aware of the consequences of the diplomatic postings freely doled out to the kith and kin of the Rajapaksas, particularly, the heavy price the public has had to pay for their upkeep and extravagant lifestyles, for practically no returns to the country, not to mention the other scandals such as involvement in arms deals.
