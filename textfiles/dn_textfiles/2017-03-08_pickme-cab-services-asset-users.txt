PickMe cab services  an asset to users

PickMe, one of Sri Lanka’s first mobile taxi hailing Company says that an efficient cab service can prove to be a great asset in terms of cost as well as time management for users.
In a scenario where vehicle prices keep skyrocketing and congestion on roads is getting to be out of control; it would appear far more advantageous to some to replace ownership with a reliable taxi service.
CEO of PickMe, Zulfer Jiffry says that is what their service offers customers a way of rethinking their investment in transportation, without the added cost of large interest payments to leasing/borrowing institutions or the hassle of driving around on congested roads, trying to find almost non existent parking spaces during rush hours. He says that according to their calculations, the minimum investment in any kind of vehicle as opposed to using their taxi service is extremely high. 
Zulfer believes that most of these costs could be avoided and traveling made much simpler both in terms of expenditure and time, by hailing a cab for daily commutes to work or for other daily chores such as school drops and pick-ups.
In both cases the monthly leasing of an equivalent vehicle itself would cost 2-3 times more than what they would spend on taxis; and add to that the fuel and maintenance costs they would have to incur. Therefore, the assumption that taking a taxi for your daily travels is a luxury ordinary middle class people cannot afford is in fact not entirely true.”
During a press conference held at HNB recently, PickMe’s Chairman Ajit Gunewardene said, “I believe that one PickMe vehicle on the road allows to remove four other vehicles from it. The efficiency levels will go up to such a point that it will have a significant impact on traffic, pollution and on fuel consumption.”
Zulfer added that the world is now moving away from vehicle ownership especially as a mode of daily traveling. “Look at Singapore, they have remedied their traffic problem, lack of parking and severe pollution through online taxi hailing apps and ride sharing.”
“These apps allow them to connect with people around the country and share a ride with whomever they choose. Use of these services has not only become cost effective for the consumer but has helped to considerably reduce the number of cars travelling on their roads and as a result, also improved their environment” he said.
The global trend in investment that supports a similar vision is called a ‘sharing economy’ where people consider sharing homes and vehicles as a better option than owning one. Even businessmen and women around the world have taken to re-directing their investment in assets that pay back instead of in assets that only serve one purpose while depreciating in value otherwise.
The CEO says that there are local companies who now provide employees holding higher positions with taxi services like PickMe to drive them around as they have begun to see the advantages of time management and keeping their Executives hassle free.
