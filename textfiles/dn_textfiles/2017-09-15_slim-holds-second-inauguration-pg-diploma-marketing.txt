SLIM holds second inauguration of PG Diploma in Marketing

The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) had its second inauguration of the Post Graduate Diploma in Marketing (PGDIM) program for the current year in July at the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management.
Fresh intakes are now on and students will follow PGDIM classes at the SLIM Business Schools in Colombo, Kandy and Matara.
As the national body for Marketing, SLIM organized the inauguration to educate the new PGDIM batch on the curriculum that permeates beyond the fundamental theories. The value of it can add vastly to an individual’s persona in the grooming process to become a marketing professional.
Participants represented a cross section of young employees, marketing practitioners, corporate and public sector middle managers and SLIM students.
The SLIM PGDIM is highly recognized by the corporate sector and it paves the way for budding marketers to secure employment in the corporate sector. As a unique program of study, it offers students and practitioners an opportunity to learn the finer points in marketing and blend theoretical concepts with day-to-day diverse business scenarios.
The 24-month (part time) program, which consists of four levels, gears students with marketing competencies from the operational to managerial level. Students are provided with a detailed understanding on the marketing tools. The strategic level focuses on concepts such as Sustainability and Strategic Marketing Planning. The final level of PGDIM is an individual research study every student is required to carry out.
SLIM PGDIM is the ideal entry-level qualification for a budding marketer who is looking to secure his or her career path by obtaining an MBA.
The guest speaker at the inauguration, Priyantha Ellepola, the General Manager of United Motors Lanka PLC, said that SLIM has performed a yeomen service to the nation over the decades by producing hundreds of promising marketers.
“SLIM has nurtured the local marketing sphere with its mentoring prowess. Many who have followed the SLIM PGDIM have boosted their chances of success enormously. I am confident that the new batch of students will follow in the footsteps of their predecessors to elevate the Sri Lankan marketing platform to new heights”, he said.
SLIM Vice President Pradeep Edward, the Director/CEO of GAP Holdings, stressed the importance of equipping people with the necessary marketing knowledge to excel in the existing vibrant business environment.
“SLIM has designed the PGDIM program to groom quality marketing personnel who can add value to the marketing fraternity in Sri Lanka. Postgraduate Diploma holders of SLIM are also employed by companies beyond our territories,” he said.
He stated that marketing has evolved to become a way-of-life globally and that the PGDIM program caters to this reality.
SLIM CEO and Executive Director Sanath Senanayake said, “The right blend of assignments, individual and group presentations and exams have elevated the PGDIM qualification to its pinnacle. The program will evolve with the changing marketing scenarios in the world to produce fully fledged marketers, who could rub shoulders with veterans in the arena.”
