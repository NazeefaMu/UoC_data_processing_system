National Audit Bill restricts Auditor General - JVP

The National Audit Bill passed in Parliament last week does not have the features to empower the Auditor General, his staff and the National Audit Commission, the JVP said yesterday.
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said the original Audit bill that was drafted by the Auditor General’s staff and amendments had been done on several occasions at Cabinet and in Parliament as well. He made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) head office in Pelawatte, Battaramulla.
He said a flaw in the National Audit Bill is that the Auditor General cannot audit the Internal Audit reports of Corporations, Boards and other such institutions.
“On the other hand if a surcharge is imposed on an officer found guilty by the Auditor General, it would be implemented by the Secretary of the Ministry to which the officer is attached,” MP Handunnetti said. “The Ministry Secretary is vested with power to hold a disciplinary inquiry and take a decision in that connection. If a Secretary had done an offence it is the President who had to take action.”
MP Handunnetti said that however this measure has been taken to protect the Ministry Secretaries who implement Ministers’ orders. He also said that the maximum fine against those officers found guilty was Rs 5,000 as amended by the government and it was increased to 25,000 on the JVP’s insistence.
Handunnetti said the government was not willing to take most of the amendments made by the JVP. “The Bill that was passed also contradicts some of the rights guaranteed by the Right to Information Act,” MP Handunnetti said. “Auditor General cannot publicize the reports that he expects to take legal action against and it breaches the rights guaranteed by the Right To Information Act.”
He added that however it was not the Bill that the public needed.
