When civilized politics give in to racial bigotry

“To ignore evil is to become an accomplice to it”
- Martin Luther King Jr.
As fanatic communal flames burnt alive the humanity, reason, and sanity in a series of violent incidents in Ampara and Kandy, lawmakers of both the Government and Opposition closed ranks in Parliament to condemn and mourn, but all in all it was too little, too late.
Teldeniya and Digana in the central hills were on fire as Parliament commenced its bi-weekly session on Tuesday and most regrettably the situation had gotten out of hand as acts of violence spread fast even before the dust settled on the incident in Ampara, where racists took the gullible for a ride.
Parliament put off its previously scheduled day’s agenda to take up a full-day adjournment debate on the current situation in the country, where members of both the sides grieved with those who grieved while urging the law enforcement authorities to pull up their socks and tackle the situation head on.
Quelling the madness
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was also the Law and Order Minister briefly before the mantle was passed on to another, announced in Parliament the decision to declare a week-long State of Emergency in the country for the first time since the end of terrorism.
Equipped with first-hand information from trusted sources and intelligence units, the Premier broke his silence on the incidents in Ampara and Teldeniya, laying bare the fact that well-organised gangs were behind the series of violent acts that ensued. “Those could not be underplayed as happened out of sudden anger. While the Buddhist monks and Muslim clergy in the area tried to resolve the issues, groups that came from outside created chaos,” the PM stressed.
Without trying to make light of the situation, he pledged to implement the law against those who triggered violence and to investigate any shortcoming on the part of Police in maintaining law and order.
“We see that certain power hungry groups are all out to disrupt the public life through conspiracies and acts of sabotage. Racism is their only resort. I appeal to the public not to fall prey to those who try to fulfil their petty gains by inciting racism, but to act patiently and rationally,” he urged.
The PM was seen worried about the negative impression the rest of the world would harbour on Sri Lanka upon seeing the false and racist propaganda in the social media. This type of madness that drives the potential investors away was no doubt the last thing he wanted to see being saddled with a debt-ridden economy.
End impunity
Ethnic and religious extremism has been a serious and insidious problem that hampered the country’s chances of any economic and social revival since the end of 30 years’ protracted war, let alone the hopes of national unity and reconciliation. Politicians, may they be in the Government or Opposition, cannot get away from the blame of ignoring the elephant in the room for so long.
From Aluthgama and Beruwala in June 2014, Gintota in November last year to Ampara and Kandy last month, the ruling parties, present and past, failed to take any tangible action against the leaders of the organised mobs which triggered violence.
Not long ago, it was openly accused that those groups mushroomed and functioned with the connivance of the previous regime. The people, not only those belonging to minority communities but also the right-minded majority in the majority community, wanted to see an end to the impunity enjoyed by those marauding gangs, when they came out in large numbers to vote for a change on January 8, 2015.
Expressing similar sentiments as above, JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake and TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran, in their convincing speeches that reverberated in the House, came down hard on the Government for backtracking on this undertaking as it did with many other important tasks it was entrusted with. They directly spoke to the consciences of the Joint Opposition and the Government, the former for vociferously fanning communalism and the latter for going soft on extremist elements.
Debate saw no SLFP involvement
The JVP Leader in a fiery speech, pleaded not to use racism as a political football, adding that rousing suspicion, mistrust, hatred and anger among different communities would only lead to a divided country where the innocent ordinary people would fall victims. He lamented that the recent trend of racial tensions was indicative that the civilized politics which revolved around building national unity suffered defeat at the hands of tribal, fanatic, racist and ignorant politics of the bankrupt political elements.
Lakshman Kiriella, a senior UNP Minister from Kandy electorate, noted with heavy heart that the Sinhala Buddhists should be ashamed of and apologize for their violent behaviour. He found fault with the intelligence units for failing to alert the political authority sufficiently on the impending danger.
The absence of any speaker from the SLFP side of the Government was felt during the debate, and this was despite that several SLFP stalwarts were present in the House earlier on the day. It was not clear as to whether they deliberately sidestepped the debate due to some reason best known to them.
The violence aimed at Muslim community put the UNP and other Muslim parties allied to it in a very inconvenient position. The feeling of the minority communities that they were not safe even when the UNP was in power did not politically bode well to the Grand-Old Party with multi-ethnic vote base. It was in this backdrop, a group of Muslim MPs representing the Government sat on the floor in the well of Parliament, while the debate was on, urging the Government to provide adequate protection for their community.
About 11 Parliamentarians including Minister Rishad Bathiudeen flocked near the Mace registering their disappointment on the Government, as their colleague Minister Faiszer Musthapha took the floor. They went back to their seats after the assurance of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe that the Government was taking all possible measures to protect the people.
PM outsmarts JO’s delaying tactics
The Government, while battling the wave of communal tensions in the country, also had to put in considerable time and effort to ensure the safe passage of the bill for protection against enforced disappearances in the House, in keeping with the international obligations it has undertaken.
The piece of legislation had already been deferred twice in Parliament and the Government did not want to see it getting postponed again due to antics of the JO. Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana, moving the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill for debate, proposed to amend the Clause on extradition in the Bill for clarity that it does not apply to Sri Lankan citizens. The minister proposed the amendment to dispel the doubts expressed by the JO that the legislation allows foreign states to try Sri Lankans in foreign courts of law.
Being a former Attorney General, Marapana could rebut the claims of the JO on the content of the bill in a more convincing manner. “Nothing in the bill is retrospective and its content applies only to the offences committed in the future. Under this legislation, a person guilty of the offence of enforced disappearance can be imprisoned for a term not exceeding 20 years, and be liable to pay a fine not exceeding Rs 1 million and compensation not less than Rs 500,000 to a victim,” he explained.
The JO, which was all-out to prevent the Government from passing the legislation, was full of sound and fury over trivial matters and the Government had to take extra pain to confront their pressure. In a last-ditch attempt to sabotage Government’s work, JO MPs agitated stating that they have not received a copy of the proposed amendment for their perusal and therefore demanded to postpone the passage of the bill to another date.
Outsmarting the JO’s tactics at this point, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told the House that the Government withdraws the said amendment and puts the bill for vote without amendments. Minister Marapana also observed that the amendment was proposed as per the JO’s request and if it does not want it the Government would go ahead without it.
Accordingly, the bill was passed with a majority of 37 votes, obtaining 53 votes in favour and 16 votes against following a division called by JO firebrand Dinesh Gunawardena. The JO members voted against while the JVP members walked out. A total of 156 members were absent.
The main intention of the bill was to ensure that every Sri Lankan citizen gets the freedom to live without fear of being a victim of enforced disappearance or abduction.
