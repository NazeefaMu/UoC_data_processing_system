Road carnage: Act now

The recent accident in Rajagiriya, which claimed the life of at least one school child and seriously injured several more, has once again focused our attention on the need to ensure road safety. It is easy to rattle off the statistic that seven persons are killed on average on our roads every day, but behind this number lies real people, real lives. Everyone who is killed or maimed on the road is someone’s mother, father, brother, sister, husband, wife, nephew, niece or friend. What is even more painful is the fact that most, if not all, accidents are preventable.
Road traffic accidents kill an estimated 1.25 million people worldwide each year and injure 50 million - 90 per cent of them in middle - and low-income countries, though the United States has the highest number of road fatalities. Such accidents are the leading cause of death among young people aged between 15 and 29. Almost half of all road traffic deaths are among pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Without sustained action, road traffic crashes are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030.
Tomorrow (November 19), the world will remember these victims on the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. The Day has become an important tool in global efforts to reduce road casualties. It offers an opportunity for drawing attention to the scale of emotional and economic devastation caused by road crashes and for giving recognition to the suffering of road crash victims and the work of support and rescue services. The UN has also declared a Decade of Action for Road Safety from 2011 to 2020. Sri Lanka too must accordingly step up its efforts to reduce accidents.
The accident in Rajagiriya has brought several issues to the fore. Judging by available accounts, both cars had been driven by novice drivers with no long-term experience. And with experience comes wisdom. Young people love the thrill of speed, without necessarily thinking about its consequences. CCTV footage of the accident makes it very clear that both cars were speeding and careened out of control.
The biggest lesson that parents could learn from this unfortunate incident is that young people who had recently obtained the driving licence should not be allowed to drive unsupervised. In many other countries, young drivers have to display a ‘P’ (for Probation) Plate for at least one year and be accompanied by a qualified adult driver in the passenger seat. If an accident occurs during this period, the licence is either revoked or the probation period extended, depending on its severity. It is also best to let them drive smaller vehicles first – unfortunately in Sri Lanka, one can get the licence today and drive a high-powered Ferrari tomorrow.
The key ingredient for driving success is discipline. This is one quality that most of our drivers lack across the board. Sri Lankans who have driven abroad know that even a horn sound is rare in many countries. Instead, our roads are a chaotic mess where everyone wants to get ahead at the expense of the other motorists and road users. A little courtesy and decency on the road will actually make everyone safer. Achieving discipline on the road should start from schools to “catch them young”. And road rules are applicable not only to motorists – pedestrians too must follow them. Even a minor gesture such as waiting till the “green man” comes on to cross a street will go a long way towards ensuring road safety.
It is too early to say whether the higher fines imposed recently on a series of offences could have an effect on road safety. But they should act as a deterrent, since Rs.25,000 is a lot of money for the average motorist. Enforcing self-discipline in fear of a higher fine is not an ideal scenario, but in the absence of another mechanism it is the best choice. Conversely, Police have also started a drive to reward good drivers, which will encourage drivers to be at their best behaviour on the road. The Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) with the fullest collaboration of the Police has started a successful programme titled “Parissamen Gihin Enna” (Drive Carefully) which is educating drivers islandwide. The SLRC must be commended for this initiative - we need more such awareness programmes on road discipline and safety.
While one cannot underestimate the human factor in accidents, today’s vehicles are much safer and often save lives in a serious crash. This is why the Government deserves praise for banning the import/assembly of cars without SRS Airbags and ABS (Brakes) through Budget 2018. Many advanced cars have a raft of accident prevention measures from Lane Departure Warning to drowsiness monitoring, which will filter down to the lower-priced cars. Future trends such as driverless or autonomous cars could prevent road accidents altogether, as they will be able interact with other cars, road signs and instantly identify inanimate and animate objects. That day will surely come, but until then, saving lives on the road is very much in our hands.
