Wild elephants destroy paddy lands

A herd of wild elephants had destroyed 500 acres of paddy lands in Waduressa, Leekaduwawa, Gatalawala and Ranayakapura in Kobeigane, recently.
They had left the Wilpattu National Park and entered villages near the Deduru oya.
A farmer had recently been killed in a wild elephant attack as well.
