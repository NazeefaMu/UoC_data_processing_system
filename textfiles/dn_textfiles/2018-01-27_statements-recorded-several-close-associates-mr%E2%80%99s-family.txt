Thajudeen Murder case:
Statements recorded from several close associates of MR’s family

The CID conducting investigations into the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen yesterday informed Court that it has recorded statements from several individuals who were close associates with the family members of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Filing a further report in Court, the CID informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Darshika Wimalasiri that it has also commenced a comprehensive investigation into two Navy vehicles which were used during the time that Thajudeen’s murder took place.
The CID further stated that they have sought an analytical report pertaining to Thajudeen’s mobile phone and laptop as a part of investigation into the murder case.
Further magisterial inquiry was fixed for May 3.
Former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake, former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera and former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara had been named as first, second and third suspects of this case respectively. They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit the murder. They are currently out on bail.
While delivering the verdict, former Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts. Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo on May 17, 2012. The CID had informed court that investigations conducted so far had revealed that Thajudeen’s teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death.
The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of a broken class. Earlier, police maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appeared for CID. President’s Counsel Shavindra Fernando appeared for the third suspect.
