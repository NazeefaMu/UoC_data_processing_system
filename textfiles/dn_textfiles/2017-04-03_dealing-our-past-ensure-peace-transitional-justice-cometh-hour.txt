Dealing with our past to ensure peace (transitional justice) : Cometh the hour

The term transitional justice is a series of measures developed after a traumatic conflict to ensure that peace and stability will last, that the rule of law will prevail, and that a cycle of violence will not be repeated.
Societies that have experienced serious trauma, such as armed conflict or authoritarian rule, need to prevent new episodes of violence and oppression. In order to do that, states conduct different policies to examine the past, pursue accountability, provide for the well-being of violence survivors, and improve their institutions.
Societies that avoid looking into the past fail to build sustainable peace. Traumatic memories don’t simply go away. Grievances can go on for generations, and even centuries, becoming entrenched in culture and historical accounts, and risking new cycles of violence.
Over the years, dealing with the past has become an accepted policy approach to build peace and consolidate democracy, directly linked to governments’ human rights duties. There is now extensive shareable experience about principles and best practices, so that each country can find its own way to satisfy its historical, legal and moral obligations.
The best way to deal with the past is implementing a set of actions that complement and support one another:
• Reparations for victims recognize the gravity of the violations suffered and provide means to rebuild lives. Reparations include many types of assistance, not just financial compensation, which limited resources dictate can only be provided to a small percentage of victims. Reparations foster empathy and compassion, recognizing the common dignity of survivors, such as widows and orphans; those survivors who lost their physical integrity, their psychological health, their land and means to make a living.
• Special offices such as an Office of Missing Persons or a Truth Commission, seek to uphold the right of victims and society to know the truth about what happened. They provide an authoritative account of the facts, establish the fate or whereabouts of the missing, and make policy recommendations to avoid the same things happening again.
• Judicial inquiries, particularly on those most responsible for violations and abuses, seek to restore the rule of law, and individualize responsibility, so that the honour and reputation of institutions is preserved. Trials shouldn’t single out one side in a conflict but seek to punish individuals most responsible for very serious crimes that all humanity condemns. Fair trial standards and the presumption of innocence are the foundation of such judicial processes.
• Measures of non-recurrence focus on improving the professionalism of key state institutions, such as the judiciary, the educational system, and the security forces, to ensure that they encourage reconciliation and avoid practices that are prone to abuse. This often involves additional professional training and new resources to modernize institutions.
All these measures work better if they are based on lessons learned from previous practice, human rights principles and meaningful consultation with society. They need to respect national culture, law and experience. For many years, Sri Lanka has had experience investigating facts, providing reparation and seeking sustainable reform. Recent consultations with citizens in all regions of the country, and public survey results, reaffirm that dealing with the past in a fair way is supported by Sri Lankans of all backgrounds and regions.
It is critical that all these actions incorporate the need for participants to share their experiences freely, without fear of reprisals or renewed trauma. Protection of victims and witnesses, and psychosocial care are indispensable elements of any policy to deal with the past. Processes should be objective and mutually respectful without pre-judging any institution or individual.
The different measures must also pay special attention to the rights, voices and needs of sectors of the population usually overlooked or marginalized. Women victims require special attention, as well as children and young people, and persons with disabilities.
Finally, for these actions to be credible and effective, they must always work in an independent, fair and impartial manner and link logically to each other. For example, a Truth Commission might refer someone who has suffered serious harm to a Reparations Office or to the Office of Missing Persons to assist them in practical ways.
The Lessons Learnt Reconciliation Commission
In 2010, the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed the Commission on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation (LLRC), with a mandate to look back at the conflict and also look ahead for an era of healing and peace building in the country, and make recommendations, ensure that there will be no recurrence of any internecine conflict in the future.
The LLRC recommendations:
The many recommendations made by the Commission also include the following recommendations relating to:
• Justice and Rule of Law:-Emphasis that all allegations should be investigated and wrongdoers prosecuted and punished irrespective of their political links, so as to inspire confidence among the people in the administration of justice; -The need to renew the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system and the rule of law;
• Missing Persons:-Adopt a comprehensive approach to address the issue of missing persons as it would otherwise pose a serious obstacle to any inclusive and long-term process of reconciliation (9.48).
- The Commission emphasises (9.49) that the relatives of missing persons shall have the right to know the whereabouts of their loved ones. -They also have the right to know the truth about what happened to such persons, and to bring the matter to closure.
- All efforts should be made by the law enforcement authorities, in cooperation with relevant agencies, especially the ICRC, to trace the whereabouts of the missing persons and ensure reunification with their families. The families should be kept informed of the progress being made in this regard (9.50).
- Reconciliation is a process. Closure is the first difficult emotive step in that long and complex journey irrespective of whether they are victims of conflict or victims of LTTE terrorism. This will also enable them to seek appropriate legal remedies including compensation/ reparation.
