State minister gives evidence in fraud case

 
Foreign Affairs State Minister Wasantha Senanayake yesterday gave evidence before Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne in connection with a fraud in which he allegedly incurred a loss of Rs 1.69 million, in 2012.
The Fraud Investigation Bureau had filed the chargesheet against Mohamed Musahir Misroom for defrauding Senanayake of Rs 1.69 million in a transaction of scrap iron in a factory that belonged to the state minister.
The state minister, giving evidence during the trial before the Colombo Fort Magistrate, said that he purchased an old BOI-approved shoe factory at an auction by a private bank. He added that there was a bulk of scrap iron inside the factory and he instructed his secretary Hussain Mohamed Husadin to sell it. The minister also said that his secretary had assigned the matter to Mohamed Musahir Misroom.
State Minister Senanayake submitted further that the suspect Misroom had sold the scrap iron but did not pay his due – Rs. 1.69. Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne postponed the trial for August 28.
