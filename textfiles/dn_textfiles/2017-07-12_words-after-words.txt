Words after words

The terms, modern, modernism and modernity, though familiar today in all subject areas linked to arts and culture, the pioneer and his work G S Fraser may not be too familiar. As far back as 1953, George Sunderland Fraser who was a freelance writer on literary topics in the United Kingdom and the United States came to collect all the bits and pieces. Then he, in consultation with some of the literary stalwarts, brought out awareness of the total literary and social scene as something from which the great apparently isolated figures cannot be divorced.
The book had come as a surprise in the Japanese literary scene as far back as the 1950s. Later it came to be used by the university dons of the United Kingdom and the United States. As a result, a methodical arrangement came to be utilised by Fraser, where he segmented his findings.
The part one of the book is termed as the background of ideas.
Creative ideologies
Here he discusses the issues such as modernity and the historical sense as the main theme. He traces the literary evolutions both in the Orient as well as the Occident in order to pinpoint the creative ideologies held from the point of view of Greek poets such as Homer to those of the new English poets such as Eliot and Joyce. Then he proceeds to address issues such as realism, psychology and the various interlinked themes as found in narratives.
From there onwards he comes to explain the literary terms such as complexity, allusions, irony with reference to modern poetry. He traces almost all the major works that had sprung up to the post world war creative works of the major English and American novelists. In order to achieve the goal, he traces the historical evolution of the novel from the 1850s. With this preamble, Fraser emphasises the trends in the poetic creations in Part Three. Some of the new historical findings are enveloped.
One such example is the creation of T S Eliot’s poetic drama titled as ‘Murder in the Cathedral’. This first full-length play was written to be performed in contributing cathedral to commemorate the martyrdom of St Thomas Beckett, who had been murdered there. Fraser says that in spite of its primary religious purpose, the play has considerable purely dramatic power, created via a new form of poetic communication.
This poetic drama, Fraser considers, not only as a turning point in the revival of Occidental theatrical tradition but also a turning point in the creative communication of a powerful religious message to the entire world. In the section on the subject of poetry, Fraser undertakes a special emphasis on such poets as Joyce, Yeats, Eliot, Robert Graves and D H Lawrence and W H Auden.
Practical criticism
The most illuminating findings come in section five, where Fraser discusses the trends of criticism. He triggers off from the Victorian tradition to the critics from Cambridge. Taking into account the initiation of the practical criticism of scholars such as I A Richards and F R Leavis. Fraser considers these two major critics as giving the searchlight to a horde of successions who paved the way for several other literary trends.
Fraser categorically states that with an expert training in psychology and a special interest in languages as an explorable system of communication. It was I A Richards, who, early in the 1920s, became interested in what light a scientific approach could throw on the nature of poetry. According to Fraser, two questions interested him: Firstly what is the relationship to the kinds of statement poetry and secondly the kinds of statement that a scientific student of language believes to be true or possibly true?
Secondly, what exactly is the difference not in terms of the poem itself, but in terms of what happens to us when we read it, between a good poem and a bad one? His answer to the second question was more speculative than his answer to the first. It rested on the idea of the human psyche as a fairly loose self-balancing system of impulses which seeks to satisfy as many of impulses as possible.
Fraser having preferred the background trends in the critical tradition as laid down by Richards and leaves states that following vital points as well.
Imaginative writers
“More broadly, the wider Cambridge critical tradition, of which Dr Leavis is only a part though a very central part has perhaps had a crumbling and discouraging influence on the potential imaginative writers exposed to its impact on youth. Fraser also lays down the backgrounds details pertaining to what is called the new criticism in America, though this owes much more to Richards and Empson than to Leavis, whose attitudes are much too English to bear transplanting easily. Like in many a literary scene seen today, the new creative poets have complained that they feel flattened out by emerging new orthodoxy. As a result, anything creative they do, they feel, is either rejected or placed with a limiting judgement n advance. Most of these sensitive creative areas and the impact on the new forms of criticism are discussed by Fraser in broad perspectives.”
The reader may feel that Fraser had been thinking on literary matters beyond his time. Perhaps this is they type of work that deserves new discovery, a starting point with a visit.
