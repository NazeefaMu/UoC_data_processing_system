Bribery Commission to recruit 250 graduates as investigating officers

The Commission to Investigate the allegations of Bribery or Corruption will recruit 250 graduates as investigation officers. This is the first time that graduates are recruited from outside for the investigation unit of the Commission.
The relevant gazette notification for the enrollment of graduates to the commission's investigation unit has already been published.
Over 200 Police officers have so far been attached to the Commission’s Investigation Unit as Investigators and their services were recognized by presenting rewards from the Police rewards scheme.
