Hrithik to turn director soon?

Is Hrithik Roshan planning to turn director soon? Going by the interest level he showed behind the camera during the shooting of ‘Kaabil’, it would seem Duggu is keen on a career shift.
His proud father Rakesh confirms, “Hrithik will surely direct a film, although I can’t say when. He has assisted me on several of my films before he was launched as a hero in ‘Kaho Na… Pyaar Hai’. So you could say he has been training in direction for a very long time.” However, he discounts any suggestion that he or Hrithik contributed in any way to the direction of ‘Kaabil’. He insists that he and his son worked with director Sanjay Gupta purely in a collaborative spirit.
“I went to the sets only on the first day to give the first ‘clap’. After that, it was Sanjay Gupta’s baby. But yes, our involvement was there throughout, as Sanjay, Hrithik and I were on the same page. There were no ego issues among us.”
