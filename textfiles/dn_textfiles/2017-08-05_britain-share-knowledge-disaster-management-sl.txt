Britain to share knowledge of disaster management with SL

The British Government will share know-how to manage and mitigate disasters with three Sri Lankan Provinces.
The Sabaragamuwa, Uva and Central Provinces were selected for the project to be launched from this year. The provinces will receive a financial grant from Britain under the project.
Technical knowledge of disaster management and mitigation will be given by the Salford University of Manchester and the financial assistance will be granted by the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council of the British Government.
Pakistan and Malaysia were also selected for the project.
The project will go on until 2020 and it has been allocated Rs. 280 million. The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) and the Moratuwa and Colombo Universities will assist the programme.
