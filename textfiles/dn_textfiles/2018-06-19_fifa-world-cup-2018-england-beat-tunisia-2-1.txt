FIFA World Cup 2018: England beat Tunisia 2-1

 
Skipper Harry Kane scored a brace as England started their World Cup campaign with a fighting 2-1 victory over Tunisia, on Monday.
After his early 11th-minute lead was negated by Ferjani Sassi's goal from spot-kick in the 35th minute, Kane scored the winner in the stoppage time to give England all three points.
