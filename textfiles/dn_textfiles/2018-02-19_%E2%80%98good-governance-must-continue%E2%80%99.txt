‘Good Governance must continue’

The responsibility of the Good Governance Government is to continue with the January 8 mandate, while providing reliefs to the people, Leftist Circle Convener Chameera Perera yesterday said.
He said the two main parties have to go forward since the benefits of instability goes to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the government should be smart enough not to get trapped in his ploy.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Centre for Society and Religion at the Church of Our Lady of Fathima, Maradana.
He said the enemy of their coalition was Mahinda Rajapaksa and the government should not allow them to take over power. He added that Mahinda Rajapaksa had gained only 47 percent of the votes, while the rest had rejected him.
Perera said the Rajapaksa has taken the benefit of the high tax increase and the curtaining of the relief to the people.
He added that Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family members are corrupt and if they took over the government, the situation would be worse.
He said the people are moulded by the political culture and they expect relief. He added that they should be given relief including the fertiliser subsidy.
“Even Mahinda Rajapaksa did not give them quality fertiliser, they gave bags of soil,” Perera said.
“The people should be given those relief. They appreciate not money but a piece of cloth for their uniform no matter if it was substandard.”
The Prime Minister has to dedicate for the victory and future of the Party, he said.
