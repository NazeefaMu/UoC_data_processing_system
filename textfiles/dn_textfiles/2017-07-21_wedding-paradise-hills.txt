Wedding paradise in the hills

The Kshatriya Villa, Kurunegala, a splendid and beautiful resort, is highly popular among tourists. It has some really great wedding and reception halls that are on par with international standards.
Located in a serene and tranquil atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of the city, the villa embodies a lot of high class features. The proprietor of The Kshatriya Villa, Kshatriya Weerasinghe says that he embarked on this venture not merely to earn profits but also to engage in charity. He says that he can offer concessions for low income earners to hold wedding functions at the venue. The charge for the service they offer is obtained for the maintenance of the premises.
The resort is spacious and has Roman- Italian cultural features. It is certainly pleasing and attractive. In an era where foreign revenue is vital, The Kshatriya Villa can contribute to the county’s economy by attracting tourists.

The villa has a number of halls that can accommodate many people. The main hall can accommodate 1500 people. The villa is ideally suitable for large gatherings. They emphasise on the comfort of their guests. 2500 guests can be packed into the hall.
The resort has three swimming pools. Day by day the hotel is being enhanced, upgraded, developed and redefined. It has a mini cinema theatre for guests to spend their leisure time enjoying their favourite movies of any language.
The Kshathriya Villa is spread across five acres. This magnificent property was built by Kshastriya to hold his daughter’s reception because even though her wedding was held in a five star hotel in Colombo the reception crowd was so massive that he had to build the resort to accommodate all of them. Any wedding of any dimension or religion: Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim or Christian, can be held at The Kshathriya Villa.
This resort is a dream-come-true venue, for young couples who are ready to enter wedding bliss. Foreigners from India, Dubai, and Europe are in talks with the hotel to hold their special moments there.
Another 50 rooms equipped with the latest facilities will be added to the premises. Guests can enjoy delicious and healthy food served at the restaurant made according to Sri Lankan style.
Two weddings can be held at the same time in this resort without any hassle. The staff is well trained and offer high class service, making their guests feel at home and filling their stay with long lasting memories.
