The World Standards Day 2017 : STANDARDS MAKE CITIES SMARTER

World Standards Day is celebrated every year since 1970, on October 14, to recognize the collaborative efforts of the thousands of experts who share their knowledge and expertise in international standardization activities. This day also provides an opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of standardization among the producers, traders, consumers, researchers, public and regulators. The National Standard Bodies take a lead to organise various activities to celebrate the World Standards Day.
The Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) is the National Standards Body of Sri Lanka having a vision providing leadership to uplift the quality of life of the nation, through standardization and quality improvement in all sectors of the economy. The SLSI also joins to celebrate the World Standards Day along with the rest of the world on October 14, 2017. Coinciding with the World Standards Day, SLSI has declared the National Quality Week during October 9 to 15, 2017.
Within the framework of the World Standards Cooperation (WSC), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) have chosen “Standards Make Cities Smarter” as the theme for this year's World Standards Day.
Half of the Earth’s current population lives in towns and cities. Most people can agree that cities are places where large numbers of people live and work; they are hubs of government, commerce and transportation. According to United Nation forecasts, urban areas are projected to house 60 per cent of people globally and one in every three people will live in cities by 2030. Sri Lanka is no exception where this trend is concerned.
Challenges to local authorities
An increasing number of people are migrating from rural to urban area pose many challenges to local authorities, among them alarmingly high rate of traffic fatalities, traffic congestion, large scale environmental pollution, exploitation of resources, social disintegration, crime and violence, urban diseases, data security and privacy. Climate change and natural disasters can also aggravate social inequalities and degradation of quality of urban living. So, it has created a sense of urgency to improve the quality of life in our cities now for the benefit of future generations.
The concept of the ‘Smart city’ is frequently offered up these days as one answer to many of the problems of metropolitan living. For some, ‘Smart cities’ means green cities. For others it means green energy, better services, intelligent buildings or simply more efficient transportation. Now many countries are increasingly embracing the Smart city notion and they are already experiencing the luxuries of improved services through intelligently design, integrate and interconnect strategies and systems equal opportunities cohesion along with sustainable balance.
One out of 17 Millennium Development Goals adopted by world leaders at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in 2015 is to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Therefore, sustainable urban environment is vital to achieve much needed sustainability goal. But it cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our city spaces.
The different ideas and ways of achieving them make it hard to know where to begin and how best to address the engineering challenges which helps everyone involved agree what constitutes superior practices and how they will follow it. One of the most urgent tasks is simply to agree the common language that is being used so that people know what is on offer, innovators can explain the benefits of their solutions and city authorities can spend public funds with confidence in the outcomes. To do this, we need standards; agreed ways of doing things published openly. Cities need a way to assess where they are, aim for where they need to be and measure their progress along the way. Standards fill that need and will support smooth, integrated and sustainable Smart City development.
International and national standard bodies have already identified its necessity and playing leading role in creation of smart cities towards the improvement of quality of life in urban citizens by developing and publishing relevant standards to support equitable, efficient and sustainable and resilient urban development. The successful implementation and compliance of the series of standards serve as a framework and incentive mechanism for propose, plan, monitor and evaluation of the urban development projects over time, assess their performance, an effective tool to foster urban development and tailor toward more sustainable and resilient communities.
Standardized indicators
Having understood this global requirement and the necessity of adopting relevant international standards locally, SLSI has published SLS 1508: 2015 “Sustainable development in communities- Indicators for city services and quality of life” and SLS 1507: 2015 “Smart community infrastructures- Review of existing activities relevant to metrics”.
SLS 1508: 2015 will enable cities to work with set of standardized indicators to measure and monitor progress of delivering city services and quality of life. In the context of a city, citizens are customers, insofar as citizens pay taxes to the cities they call home. So what would a tool look like that helps demonstrate and measure that a city is meeting the expectations of its citizens? That's where city standardized indicators come in.
They help cities assess where they stand through comparison with other cities and analyze gap, consistent tracking and prioritize solutions. Standardized indicators mean that cities everywhere use the same measures, making it easier to collaborate and shares best practices, experience and knowledge from other cities globally in areas such as education, energy, environment, finance, emergency response, governance, health, recreation, safety, security, telecommunications, transportation, urban planning, real time information, water, sanitation, waste management, resilient to climate change and natural disasters and more. And also standards help cities to better manage by enabling systems to work together and stimulate to find out future oriented innovate solutions to procure reliable and cost-effective systems which are recognized by international entities. Such solutions are often referred to as “Smart”.
Infrastructure is improving living standards and addressing resource efficiency but sometimes conflicts with a path to sustainability. As a result, it is imperative that infrastructures contribute to sustainability and resilience of communities more effectively and efficiently. SLS 1507: 2015 addresses community infrastructures such as energy, water, transportation, waste, information and communication technology (ICT).
Integration of the smart community infrastructure standards helps to improve the lifestyles of its citizens by reducing costs, increasing mobility, accessibility and reducing environmental pollutants. The metrics in this standard will support urban managers in planning and measuring performance and also compare and select procurement proposals for products and services to improve community infrastructures. Therefore adhering to internationally agreed standards, is essential when integrate of various infrastructure systems into urban environment to ensure technologies make interoperable, safe and efficient.
A number of plans and projects to build “Smart cities” are currently underway in Sri Lankan urban development policy framework. Smart parking, smart mobility, smart power grids, smart street lighting, smart building, smart care, smart city maintenance, green environment, robust information technology connectivity and digitization, e-governance and many other smart characteristics would be plan to incorporate.
It is much important to understand the standards involvement in Smart city development and have to move one step ahead by implementing and complying with standards. Then we could improve our quality of life in urban environment, bring more benefits and value to the country, encouraging sustainable development and sustain our communities with sensible management of natural resources and ultimately country will be able to drive forward to make a top-tier country in the world.
