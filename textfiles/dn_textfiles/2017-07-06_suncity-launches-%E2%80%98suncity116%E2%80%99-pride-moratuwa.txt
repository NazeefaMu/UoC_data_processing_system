Suncity launches ‘[email protected]’ a pride of Moratuwa

A prominent presence in the construction industry for over two decades, Suncity Property Developers launches ‘[email protected]’, a luxury apartment project in at Rawatawatta Moratuwa.
Suncity Property Developers is poised to repeat the success of its previous projects in Colombo and the suburbs. Scheduled for completion by December 2018, ‘[email protected]’ combines convenience and luxury for discerning buyers.
A wide range of easy payment options are being offered to prospective buyers to allow them to pay as per their convenience.
Commenting on the new luxury apartment project, Pinsiri Fernando said, “I can proudly state that ‘[email protected]’ will be the new star in Moratuwa. Increasingly, couples are looking for affordable, luxurious and serene locations away from the hustle and bustle of the city, which is precisely what this project offers. It offers a city lifestyle in the apartment, but in a suburban setting, where the environment is more serene.”
Suncity Property Developers expanded its reach out of Colombo for the first time with Melbourne Towers in Moratuwa, which sold out within six months of completion, followed by Suncity Tower Battaramulla. With the success of the Towers in Moratuwa, Suncity Developers began the construction of Suncity Classic Towers in Panadura.
The entire project was completed in 2015, and was sold out within eight months of completion. Thereafter, the Company returned to Moratuwa with Suncity Tower, a new 6-storeyed condominium complex comprising 20 fully functional apartments.
Suncity Property Developers has entrenched its impressive credentials by completing many luxury apartment complexes such as the Rosmead Towers, McCathy Towers, Horton Towers and Horton Regency, Suncity Towers Phase 1 and Suncity Towers Phase 2. Suncity Property Developers is a company that never rests on past glory but keeps striving to consolidate its presence in the market. Its latest project is Prestige Tower in Colombo 3, which is due for completion by July 2017.
Suncity Property Developers remains at the cutting edge of the sector in terms of skills, knowhow, experience, innovation and quality. These qualities have underpinned the Company’s identity for over two decades.
