UNP Working Committee meeting  : Several members voice grievances

Several UNP Working Committee members yesterday brought to light their grievances at the monthly meeting of the UNP’s apex body at the party headquarters.
Vociferous among them was Badulla district Parlimentarian Harin Fernando. Highly placed UNP sources said that MPs and members were told by Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that they are in a unity government and should move cautiously.
Sirikota will be re-structured to meet modern day requirements and make it a more people oriented party office.
UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also told the party’s Working Committee that former Army Commander Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka should be given some position in the party since he was the Presidential Candidate at the 2010 election.
