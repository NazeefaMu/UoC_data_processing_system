‘Government should not follow its predecessor’

While accusing the former regime of using the human rights issue as a political tool, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna yesterday said that the government should not follow the footsteps of its predecessor.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said that although the protection of human rights was the government's responsibility, the rulers should not use the prevailing debate on the issue to stifle the economic issues faced by the people.
“While providing an adequate solution to the human rights issue, the government should also bring immediate relief to the burning economic issues faced by the country and the people”.
Silva, meanwhile, blamed the former Rajapaksa regime for opening doors for a possible intervention in the country's domestic affairs.
“The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime engaged in serious human rights violations after the war while destroying democratic institutions. In addition they used the issue as a political tool. At every election Rajapaksa requested people to vote for him to send a strong message to the international community and save him from the electric chair,” Silva said.
Silva charged that the Rajapaksa regime also had meddled with the affairs of the country's judiciary and shattered the trust placed upon this key institution.
He said the former regime had also repeatedly given false promises to the UN and the international community.
Through all these Silva said that the former regime had opened doors for an international intervention in the country's domestic affairs.
On the resolution adopted in Geneva, Silva went on to say that although it has been watered down, the proposals still called for foreign intervention in Sri Lanka’s domestic affairs.
“There are some clauses we can accept but there are some we should not take in,” he added.
Silva said that the JVP feels a revamped local judiciary was fully capable of handling a credible domestic investigation and subsequent prosecutions.
The JVP Secretary insisted, it was important to ensure justice to victims of human rights abuses but added that this should be through a fully owned domestic mechanism sans foreign intervention.
