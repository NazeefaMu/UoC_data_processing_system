Zou beats Kwanpichit for first world pro title

LAS VEGAS Sunday: Two-time Olympic gold medalist Zou Shiming claimed the vacant World Boxing Organization flyweight title with a unanimous decision victory over Kwanpichit Onesongchaigym in a rematch on Saturday.
The 35-year-old from China easily outpointed Kwanpichit, winning on all three judges scorecards to capture his first world title. Two judges had it 120-107 while the other scored it 119-108.
“Now my dream is complete,” said Zou. “I am a pro champ, Olympic champ and world champion.” The Zou-Kwanpichit fight opened an impressive three-title undercard for Manny Pacquiao’s comeback fight against Jessie Vargas at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.
In one of those title bouts, Jessie Magdaleno seized the WBO junior featherweight title with a unanimous decision over former champion Nonito Donaire of the Philippines.
Zou, who won gold in 2008 at Beijing and 2012 in London, started quickly by winning the opening round and then knocking down the Thai in the second.
With a big size and reach advantage, Zou sent Kwanpichit to the canvas with a perfectly timed right hook to the side of the head with about a minute to go in the round.
Zou improved to 9-1 with two knockouts, with his only loss coming in his first title attempt when he lost to Amnat Ruenroeng in Macau last year.
