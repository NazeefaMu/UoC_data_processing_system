Grand Hotel
Longest potato  cake launch

The longest potato cake was launched at Grand Hotel Nuwara Eliya on April 15. The Grand’s Pastry Master Chef Viraj and his team presented a 333-foot long potato cake, made with 500 yams, 600 eggs, 68 kilos of sugar and 30 kilos of margarine on April 15.
This delicious and succulent cake was ceremoniously cut by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe while Kandy Mayor Chandana Lal Karunaratne, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority Chairperson Kavan Ratnayake, Grand Hotel General Manager Refhan Razeen and other dignitaries graced the occasion.
Nuwara Eliya’s love affair with potatoes began in 1850 when Samuel Baker and other British planters introduced their much-loved tuber in their tea and coffee plantations.
Originating from the Andes Highlands of Peru, this global favourite has since become synonymous with Nuwara Eliya simply because at an altitude of 6000 feet this region produces probably the best potatoes in the world.
With such an illustrious history and tradition behind it, the chefs at the Grand led by Chef Priyantha thought it fit to celebrate this versatile queen among vegetables, and host a potato festival from April 15 to 20 where more than 100 different potato preparations will be on offer at a reasonable price to all visitors to Nuwara Eliya.
The famous Grand Hotel road was the venue for the colourful, fun-filled one-of-a-kind event with street music, beverage stalls and many entertainment acts.
