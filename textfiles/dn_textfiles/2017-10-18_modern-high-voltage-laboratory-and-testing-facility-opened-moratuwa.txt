Modern High Voltage Laboratory and Testing  Facility opened at Moratuwa University

A modern High Voltage Laboratory and Testing Facility was ceremonially opened on Tuesday under the patronage of Moratuwa University Chancellor Prof. K.K.Y.W. Perera as the Chief Guest, Chief Executive Officer of LTL Holdings (Pvt) Limited Eng U.D.Jayawardana as the Guest of Honour and Vice Chancellor, Prof. Ananda Jayawardna, Dean of the Engineering Faculty.
A fully fledged modern high voltage laboratory was a long felt need for the university education and the electrical engineering industry of Sri Lanka. This laboratory has been named after Prof.Rohan Lucas as a gratitude for the dedicated long service over 45 years for High Voltage Engineering Education of the university and the country.
The laboratory consist of a High voltage Impulse Generator, High Voltage AC Test System, High Voltage DC Test System, Artificial Rain Making Equipment and associated control equipment and auxiliary devices. The laboratory has the facilities to conduct High Voltage Impulse Tests, High Voltage AC and DC tests up to 500kV and 300kV respectively at different environmental conditions.
LTL Holdings (Pvt) Limited has joined hands with the university as the industrial sponsor in the construction of the laboratory.
This is as another CSR project by LTL to support university education in Sri Lanka. The cost of the laboratory is estimated at Rs.35 million out of which laboratory renovation and civil construction works costing around Rs.5 million was sponsored by LTL Holdings (Pvt) Limited.
This lab facility will be of immense support to Undergraduate and Post Graduate Engineering students for their laboratory experiments, design and research projects and for the High Voltage Research Group of the University lead by Prof. Rojan Lucas and Dr.Rasara Samarasinghe.
Further, this testing facility is capable of carrying out HV Transformer Testing, HV Cable Testing, Meter Testing, HV Insulator and Bushing Testing, HV Switchgear Testing, HV CT/PT/ and CVT Testing which has been a long standing vacuum in the industry.
This is the only test facility in Sri Lanka of this calibre equipment, including an impulse generator test set, HVAC test set and HVDC test set which are capable of carrying out most of the testing required by the the country’s power sector.
