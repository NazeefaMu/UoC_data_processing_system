Army RSMs leave for Bangladesh interactive sessions

A significant breakthrough made in direct working relations between Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs) of the Sri Lanka Army and the Bangladesh Army has enabled a set of Regimental Sergeant Majors (RSMs) to leave for Bangladesh for a five-day long interactive familiarization session with their Bangladesh Army counterparts on Saturday, May 5.
The novel conceptual approach, mooted by none other than the Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake with the blessings of the Defence Ministry, is closely aimed at creating and promoting a platform for exchange of knowledge in all aspects of military logistics, dependable and fast responses to situations and sharing of Sri Lanka's battle experiences with their counterparts.
Lieutenant General Senanayake, taking an exceptional interest in the overseas visit project exclusively assigned to the SNCOs has already sought possibilities for such overseas openings from friendly armies in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Maldives and Bangladesh in the South Asian region in order to facilitate them to learn from each other.
Lieutenant General Senanayake considering the contribution of Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs) in transforming the Sri Lanka Army to that of a capacity-based one, treats those SNCOs as a bridge between Officers and soldiers and believes the facilitation of them for an overseas exposure of this nature would inevitably stimulate development of their leadership, logistic and organizational skills while simultaneously enhancing military diplomacy among regional organizations and countries.
The five-member delegation of SNCOs, WO I J. A. Saminda (Sri Lanka Armoured Corps), WO I E. P. Sisira Kumara (Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment), WO I W. M. Wijerathna (Commando Regiment), WO I S. J. M. K. Senevirathne (Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps) and WO I K. D. S. Karunarathna (Sri Lanka National Guard), led by Captain D. T. R. Danthanarayana who acquired best results in the recent Captain to Major examination, met the brainchild behind the project at the Commander's office and received Lieutenant General Senanayake's blessings, prior to their departure for Bangladesh on Friday, May 4 night. Major Genaral Aruna Wanniarachchi, Director General Training at the Army Headquarters was also present during the meeting with the Commander of the Army.
During their stay in Bangladesh, those SNCOs will attend interactive sessions with Bangladesh Army Regimental Sergeant Majors in the 46 Independent Infantry Brigade Headquarters and other Sergeant Majors.
A visit to the NCOs Academy and to the Bogra Cantonment and several other interactive sessions have also been planned for those visiting Sri Lankan SNCOs in Bangladesh.
The Commander during his meet with Bangladesh-bound SNCOs urged them to make the maximum use of their stay to learn more and more about their modalities of work and how new innovative technology can be applied for their duties in Sri Lanka upon return.
