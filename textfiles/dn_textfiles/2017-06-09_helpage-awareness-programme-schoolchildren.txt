HelpAge awareness programme for schoolchildren

The Youth Educational Division of HelpAge Sri Lanka conducted an educational awareness programme for over 1,000 students of Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda on `Gerontology and Geriatrics’ related to healthcare of elderly people.
Anula Vidyalaya Principal P. N. Rajapaksha highlighted the value of educating schoolchildren and raising awareness on the importance of keeping parents and grandparents within their family circle without sending them to elders’ homes.
The principal also commended the services rendered by HelpAge Sri Lanka to improve the quality of the lives of elders, especially underprivileged citizens in the country.
HelpAge Rights and Advocacy Advisor Lionel Premachandra said `Gerontology’ is a scientific study of old age and the process of growing old while the subject `Geriatrics’ is a kind of medicine or social science concerned with the health and care of elderly people.
“Although these two subjects are new to present day schoolchildren, education officials have decided to include the same to the school and university curriculum,” he said.
Premachandra added that health authorities have decided to start separate geriatric wards in hospitals to treat elders.
“This shows our country needs separate doctors to treat elderly citizens similar to paediatricians looking into the health care of children,” he said.
Premachandra requested students to look after their parents and grandparents during their twilight days without sending them to elders’ homes.
Anula Vidyalaya Assistant Principal Rajitha Senerath Bandara appreciated the seminar conducted for schoolchildren and reminded them to respect and care for senior citizens.
HASL, Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said HelpAge conducts free cataract surgeries for underprivileged senior citizens and provide them with free spectacles, eye care and medical facilities.
