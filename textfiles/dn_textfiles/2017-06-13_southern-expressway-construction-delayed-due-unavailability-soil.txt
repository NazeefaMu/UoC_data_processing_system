Southern Expressway construction delayed due to unavailability of soil

 
Southern Expressway construction is delayed due to the unavailability of soil, Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal Sooriyarachchi said.
The Chairman said that the shortage of soil is due to the regulations imposed on soil mining and transportation.
Not only the Southern Expressway constructions, other construction sites are also hampered due to this situation, he said.
He said that measures were taken to solve this issue under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“We have to pay close attention on possible threats which the environment could face by soil mining. To rectify this situation, a plan was launched to extract soil with least harm to the environment,” the Chairman said.
