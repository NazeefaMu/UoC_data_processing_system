Election Commission postpones Jaffna University forum

The Election Commission intervened to postpone a forum on the Constitutional Assembly Interim Report at the Jaffna University yesterday.
The Election Commission, acting on a complaint it received has written to the University authorities to stop the discussion on the basis that it is likely to benefit certain parties and disadvantageous to others at the upcoming Local Government polls.
The discussion on a new Constitution, organized by the ‘Thamil Makkal Peravai’ (Tamil People’s Forum), a civil organisation backed by Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran, was to be held yesterday with the participation of the Chief Minister and Jaffna University lecturers.
The Election Commission writing to the Vice Chancellor pointed out it was not appropriate to hold that programme during the period of elections. Following the letter, the Arts Faculty Dean has been asked to cancel the programme and arrange it somewhere else outside the University.
