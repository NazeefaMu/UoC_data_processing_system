On-the-go Coffee cup

Smash Cup is an ultra-portable, sealed travel cup you keep with you - great for hot drinks (like coffee and tea) and cold ones. When you’re not drinking, it collapses into a compact, liquid-tight disk, saving you space in your backpack, handbag, briefcase or jacket pocket. Since it’s reusable, it eliminates the waste of disposable coffee cups - At work, coffee drinkers throw away about 500 cups EVERY YEAR. And you’ll be able to take part in bring-your-own-mug discounts at coffee shops. It’s a no-brainer to choose a green product when it makes your life easier and saves you money. Kick starter
