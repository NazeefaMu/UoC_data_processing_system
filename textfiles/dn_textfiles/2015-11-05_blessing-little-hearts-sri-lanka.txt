Blessing to little hearts in Sri Lanka

Dr. Conal Austin FRCS Paediatric Cardiothoracic Surgeon and John Simpson MD, FRCP, Paediatric Cardiologist, both originally from Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals in London, decided in 2002 that they would like to assist in the development of cardiology and cardiac surgery for needy children in Sri Lanka by making annual visits with a team of 14 medics. Jai Lameer who had undergone cardiac surgery performed on him by Dr. Conal Ausin was the coordinator of the team. Jai passed away in 2011.
But fortunately for the team, Paul Scally, owner of the Gillingham Foot Ball Club, U.K. Whom they had known for several years, came to their rescue and the charity was started with new drive and a new name: "Take heart mercy mission". The Chairman of the Mission is Paul Scally and the Trustees are Dr. Conal Austin and Dr. John Simpson. They have been on such missions for the past 12 years. They have performed 200 heart operations in Sri Lanka. The day after they arrive, they start work early morning and continue working at a stretch for one week. Surgery goes on from 7 am to 12.00 midnight. They are a dedicated and united team.
I became involved in this mission as I came to know Dr. Conal Austin and Dr. John Simpson through the Association of British Residents of which I am a member, having lived and worked in London as a Higher Executive officer in the British Department of Trade and Industry.
During the past five years, I have been visiting Karapitiya Hospital, Galle, to support patients and give them an annual donation and take gift parcels for children undergoing operations.
I stay one night at Light House Hotel, Galle and have Fellowship together with the team and discuss plans for the future regarding how we as Sri Lankans can help them in their mission. After all, their help to Sri Lanka is magnanimous. We, Sri Lankans, should be humbled by what they do and appreciate their work and help them in whatever way we can. They not only perform heart scanning and surgery but also manage a post operative intensive care unit until the operated children are fit and stable enough to be discharged to general wards.
They have also donated to Karapitiya Hospital, Cardiac Scanning and theatre equipment worth millions of rupees during their annual visits. They also fund maintenance and operational cost of theatre and cardiological equipment and educational and training programmes in cardiac surgery and after care. Operations they perform are complicated cases.
Tony Blair when he was Prime Minister of the U.K. presented an award to D Conal Austin for the best charity in Asia. The award was made at a dinner, to which a Sri Lankan child whom Dr. Conal Austin operated, and her parents were invited.
Chairman Paul Scally has in the past two years brought three male football coaches and one female football coach. They coached hundreds of schoolchildren who live in Galle and the suburbs.
Funds for their work is collected in the U.K where they hold fund-raisers.
