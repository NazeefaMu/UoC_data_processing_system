Saving the soil

The ancient Greeks spoke of the natural world as a combination of several elements. Empedocles spoke of classical elements – Earth, Water, Air and Fire. The growth of plant life in a garden, is a result of the functioning of these elements. Earth provides nutrients for the roots. Water is irrigation. Air is necessary for it to breathe. And Fire (heat) is necessary for it to kill pests. Green Thumbs speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Ratmalana, Agriculture Instructor R. S. Kumarasiri on soil conservation or in other words protecting the earth necessary for life.
Soil Conservation plays a major role in Agriculture activities. However sometimes due to unavoidable features of the terrain soil erosion takes place. Sometimes the terrain is like a slope. Sometimes the terrain is level ground. When the terrain is like a slope then to prevent soil erosion we must apply certain techniques. This can be applied to the Home Garden as well as major agricultural activities.
“We know that the soil has different layers. The top soil is the most important layer. This is because the top soil is very fertile. More fertile than the other layers of soil. So our first concern is – how do we protect the top soil from soil erosion on a slope? One way is using stone boundaries. Stone boundaries are a little expensive but long lasting,” said Kumarasiri.
Another way is when the land is a slope we can create drains. When creating drains, one must keep in mind that the purpose of the drain is reducing the water speed that accompanies soil erosion. If the water speed is not reduced, it will create havoc destroying everything in its path. So when the terrain is a slope you need to create a drain that is horizontal. Then the water will gush into the drain and be channeled off in a different direction. The other benefit is that the soil that also moves down during erosion will collect in the drain and can then be removed. This technique is a bit expensive and trained people are needed to implement this technique.
“Another method is using Coconut Husks. It is less expensive but can be maintained for a very short time. Here like a drain, on a slope, coconut husks are arranged horizontally across the slope. The water hits the line of Coconut husks and the water speed is reduced,” stated Kumarasiri.
Another technique is planting big trees. Actually by planting trees you are doing a service to your fellow man and to nature itself. While providing us with fruits to eat, trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen back into the air. Trees clean the air absorbing odors and pollutant gases. Trees cool the streets and the cities.
“Trees prevent soil erosion as the roots system holds the soil in place. Here the water speed is reduced with the number of trees. Growing trees is less expensive and is a long time solution. The leaves of the tree also block the rain. Another method is growing small plants horizontally like the drains and coconut husks. This too is done with the intention of reducing the water speed. It is less expensive, can be maintained for a long time,” added Kumarasiri.
In a home garden we have plant beds. Here the rain is the biggest threat. For this we apply a mulch or covering on top of the beds. We apply the mulch so the rainwater won’t fall heavily on the plant and the soil and break the soil apart. The mulch could consist of straw, polythene, dry grass and leaves.
“The top soil has more nutrients than the other layers. The organic matter is in the top soil. With erosion the nutrients in the top soil get washed away. This will reduce the food production capacity of the land. This must be taken extremely seriously. We maintain a home garden to give us our daily intake of fresh fruits and vegetables. One period of soil erosion can undo everything we have worked for. It will even seriously affect your income if you are in the habit of selling your produce. This could be a bad setback since you will have to go through the process of creating compost again. Sometimes you may have no choice but to grow your plants in the vicinity of a slope. Then you have no choice but to implement these soil conservation techniques,” added Kumarasiri.
TECHNIQUES OF PREVENTING SOIL EROSION
* Stone Boundaries
* Drains crated horizontally to the slope
* Coconut Husks arranged horizontally
* Planting big trees
* Growing small plants horizontally
* Applying mulch/covering
BENEFITS OF TREES
* While providing us with fruits to eat, trees absorb Carbon Dioxide and release oxygen back into the air - an acre of mature trees can provide enough oxygen for 18 people.
* Trees clean the air absorbing odors and pollutant gases.
* Trees cool the streets and the cities and
* Trees absorb dust and wind and reduce glare
* Trees save water - Shade from trees slows water evaporation. As trees transpire, they increase atmospheric moisture
* Trees prevent soil erosion
* Trees provide us with wood
* Trees create income as you can sell the fruits
* Trees create that sense of tranquility, calmness, freshness and comfort actually helping one heal faster from some medical conditions
* Trees shield children from Ultra Violet Rays
* Trees give a home for wildlife
* They add beauty to a concrete jungle
