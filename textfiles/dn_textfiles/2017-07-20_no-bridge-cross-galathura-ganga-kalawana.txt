No bridge to cross Galathura Ganga from Kalawana

Residents of Pahala Galathura and Sinhalagoda in Kalawana are inconvenienced due to the lack of a bridge across Galathura Ganga to enable them attend to their work and market places.
They said, they had to cross the river with the help of a raft which is both, cumbersome and daunting during high-tide.
They had made representations over the matter since 1993, but all their appeals had fallen on deaf ears. At least a suspension bridge would do to tide over their present problem.
When Disaster Management Deputy Minister Dunesh Gankande was contacted over the matter, he said, steps would be taken to build two suspension bridges over the river.
