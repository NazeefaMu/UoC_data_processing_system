Open invitation to bodu bala sena (BBS) : Economic prosperity through national reconciliation

 [Part 3 ]
(International Law)
Part 1 and 2 were published in Daily News on February 15th and 20th.
Attack is not a negative phenomenon, but, really positive. The negativity is coupled to it, when the attack is contaminated with ignorance rooted violence. The attack is a gift bestowed by the creator-God Himself. It contains a divine purpose. That is transformation into transcendence from the imperfection of impairment to improvement, from improvement to sophistication and from sophistication to perfection. Hence, any attack must be divine and for it to be divine, it should be intelligent and constructive. When the attack staggers in the reverse order, that is, from perfection to imperfection, from imperfection to de-sophistication, from de-sophistication to the defilement of destruction, it reaches the evil, beyond negativity.
Hence, the heavenly gift of attack is bestowed to man, to be used as a celestial tool of perfection. Yet, when it is blemished in to the disgrace of violence, assault and outrage, it gets locked in the orbit of impurity.
Empirical examples
The Islamic fundamentalist psychology imagined jihad doctrine and attacked Christians, killing thousands of them. Christians exerted the patience, believing in Christ’s Teaching on the Mount. Yet, when the jihad attack saw no end, the intelligent and rebellious French Pope, Urban the Second triggered the voice: “Let’s postpone the Commandment of Jesus, (When your one cheek is shot with a thundering slap, offer the other also), unite and destroy the Islamic jihadists”. The whole Europe gathered, mustered the power of Christians and launched the Christian Crusade slaughtering millions of Jihadist Muslims and establishing the peace and freedom of Christians. No help descended down from the Jihadist God to fundamentalists. The Islamic Jihaad and Christian Crusade, both were destructive attacks.
Now the Buddha did not idle around. He also attacked. It, qualitatively, was a different attack. Buddha did not attack the believers of other religions, but his own self, its ego, its conceit, its false pride, its greed, hatred and delusion. He educated others too to do the same. The Buddha’s attack was really positive, constructive, self-perfection-oriented. Nor did the Buddha blame others, nor exploited any phraseology to blame others. This is where the BBS can be powerful.
It has to learn the true attacking strategy, the Buddha used. That is to attack one’s own mistakes, ignorance and flawed strategies. Such one attack was well elaborated in the Part 2 of the present text series: “attack the barriers of the increase of the number of Sinhala Buddhist heads”. The current article reveals the second attack: “Fight to prosper the economy”. No need to attack Muslims. When Sinhala Buddhists have right head numbers and right degree of the state of their economic prosperity that alone would castrate the strength and courage of any fundamentalism.
Unification into human-being
The true God created only human beings. Human-beings are God-made beings. Apart from God-made human-being, there are also man-made beings. Those are two types: (1) Social (2) Religious. Man-made social beings are Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. Man-made religious-beings are Buddhists, Hindus and Islamists. These two types of man-made beings (religious and social) have proved only one thing. That is, they can’t live in peace and harmony, though they, really can. Their record is five thousand wars within two thousand years of civilization.
The peace and harmony of Sri Lanka are in flames and now, the only solution lies in the immediate transformation of all man-made artificial social and religious beings, in to the transcendence of original God-beings, to be more precise, in to human-beings, sans, their fabricated and unnatural, social and religious distortions. In the void of such community unification, no peace, no harmony, no economic prosperity of Sri Lanka will be possible.
Sri Lanka already has had a painful experience with the terrorism of a tiny group of LTTE terrorists. Both parties lost and Tamils, with the presence of TamilNadu, lost even all what they previously had. This is what the small group of Muslim brothers, who have been and are at present being victimized in to the extremism of fundamentalism, should understand and grasp. Unity and nothing else. Hence, the Bodu Bala Sena must trigger the depth of this understanding and exhibit the maturity of their strategy structuring, to unify the Muslim youth community, being blemished and blindfolded in to the deception of fundamentalism, in order to blend them with the main stream of peace, friendship and cooperation, and enable the vibrant Muslim youth, to be converted in to a team of self-conscious rebels, who are ever ready to fight against the extremity of fundamentalism.
This proposed dutifulness to be in the unity of human-being, must be operative, not only on the part of Sinhala Buddhists, but also of Hindu Tamils and Islamic Muslims. The reciprocality is a sine qua non and the foundation of any economic prosperity.
Enemies of economic prosperity
Any developmental strategy of any country, particularly of the economic prosperity, has its own amplicity of enemies. Some of them are social. Others are religious. Social enemies are politicians and their self-centred and personal prosperity designs of selfishness, though, all politicians cannot be categorized in to this corrupt group. It is true there are few exceptions.
The political enmity of the developmental strategy comprises the heinous plunder of innocent people’s wealth, by way of the politicization of law and order, criminalization of politics, over-pricing of colossal project cost, unjust distribution of wealth, resulting in the enormous accumulation of it in the hands of a handful of people, unbearable cost of political administration, unfair taxing of people in order to compensate the surplus expenditure of political management, over-orientation to be in the dependence of the world market in order to play the commission game, reluctance to be perfect in the fertility of self-sufficiency, the stress of the focus on the projects of false-pride like, “We built the tallest tower in South-east Asia”, without resolving and satisfying the fundamental needs of the people, i.e. food, water, clothes, shelter and electricity and many more.
The religious antagonism which impedes the development is the proclaimed spiritual values, discouraging and murdering the developmental urge and ascribing to such values a self-imagined false societal respectability, declaring in which, that those who live according to such spiritual values are morally perfect in their character and they are holier than the others, who do not dwell by them.
Thus, if the BBS is interested in the social and religious stability of Buddhists, in the continued maintenance of the Doctrine of the Buddha, the economic steadiness of the Sinhala Buddhist is one component, the BBS must pay its central attention to.
Why? Any community, pauperized in to lack of wealth, to impaired purchasing capacity, to starvation and to shelterlessness, would fall prey in to the power of the fist of the wealthy community and as a consequence, would lead a miserable life of dependency and political and social subordination, including compelled religious conversion. Without rightly understanding and addressing these issues, what is the point of blaming Muslims?
Approach appropriateness of Muslims
Muslims are a community, the entire life of whom is governed by their religion Islam. In Islam, there is no ambiguity in the proclaimed spiritual principles in regard to the production of wealth. The inborn mental propensity of a sane-thinking man, for the attainment of material sophistication has not been cursed in to greed or sin.
On the contrary, it has been divinely encouraged. The death of man has not been reduced in to suffering, but, promoted as the real ground to live a life of celebration. The donation is recommended according to the proportions of one’s own income. No renunciation and going from home to homelessness has been prescribed, as the path to be one with God all Mighty.
Naturally, they work hard, they produce voluminous wealth, they produce many children, via their Islamic discipline, and they are well united in the hour of need. There is an appreciable appropriateness in their approach. No need to blame them.
Sinhala Buddhist
This has to be understood in the context of inceptional understanding components, explained in the Part-1 of the current script series. The majority of Buddhist priests preach the lay community, what must be taught to the monks. They proclaim death, as suffering, life as impermanent, and the individual as non-self, causing pessimism and discourage in minds.
Further they teach, give what you have as Alms or “Daana”, renounce, love thy enemy, greed is an impurity and finally the people are advised to cause to cease the life. Now, how can the Sinhala Buddhist prosper economically? Then, in the void of required head numbers, with no economic prosperity, without the military might, how can the Sinhala Buddhist survive? Will the Buddhism last? Read further and know the truth.
Celebration cause
Death is the real cause of authentic life celebration. The deathlessness would condition only boredom. The vanishing in to birthlessness will have only one result. That is, the disappearance of life. The life is eternal. Its end is not death. Death too is eternal. It does not die. Then, what does die? It is the link that connects life and death, that dies. The Physicality is the link. Life is a beautiful deathless phenomenon, trekking along the path of evolution in to perfection. It is only after empirically perceiving the fertility of life, one must realize its futility. Until then, it is sheer ignorance and blind belief, foolishly believing in what others say. Buddha flatly refused blind belief.
BBS duty
Hence, the BBS has a duty. That is to precisely draw the line, between the Buddhist monk and the layman. It has to strengthen the lay man with the urge to produce his economic prosperity. It must make the Sinhala Buddhist envisioned, that only by living the rich fertility of life as a celebration, he can realize its futility and it is, not by destitution and wealthlessness, but by the amplicity of material opulence, the Doctrine of the Buddha can be retained in Sri Lanka and that is the only way to protect the Sinhala Buddhist and guard the Buddha’s Dharma.
No point in blaming Muslims. If the lay Sinhala Buddhist is diminished in to a voluntary beggar, with the stretched-out hands with the begging bowl, perched on the palm, the nation can do only one thing. That is, to pray for the Lord Almighty God.
Blurb for continuation
The Islamic fundamentalist psychology imagined jihad doctrine and attacked Christians, killing thousands of them. Christians exerted the patience, believing in Christ’s Teaching on the Mount. Yet, when the jihad attack saw no end, the intelligent and rebellious French Pope, Urban the Second triggered the voice: “Let’s postpone the Commandment of Jesus, (When your one cheek is shot with a thundering slap, offer the other also), unite and destroy the Islamic jihadists”. The whole Europe gathered, mustered the power of Christians and launched the Christian Crusade slaughtering millions of Jihadist Muslims and establishing the peace and freedom of Christians. No help descended down from the Jihadist God to fundamentalists. The Islamic Jihaad and Christian Crusade, both were destructive attacks.
