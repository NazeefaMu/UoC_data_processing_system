Beckham to receive UEFA President’s award

PARIS, Tuesday: Former England captain David Beckham is to receive the 2018 UEFA President’s Award in honour of his achievements in the game and his work since retiring as a player, European football’s governing body said on Tuesday.
The ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder, who is now 43, will receive the award in Monaco later this year. “I have chosen David Beckham as the recipient of this year’s award because he has been a global ambassador for football, promoting the game and all its values in every corner of the planet,” said UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin. “His tireless humanitarian efforts, which have helped the lives of many children around the world, should also be celebrated. Beckham is a true football icon of his generation.” -AFP
