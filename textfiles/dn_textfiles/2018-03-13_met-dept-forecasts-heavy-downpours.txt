Met Dept forecasts heavy downpours

Fishermen are advised to refrain from venturing into sea areas off the coast extending from Mannar to Pottuvil via Colombo and Galle during next 36 hours, the Meteorology Department yesterday said.
Issuing the weather report for today, the Meteorology Department stated that, under the influence of the developing low pressure area and active cloudiness associated with the system, the possibility for heavy showers or thundershowers, sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70-80 kmph) and sudden roughness in the sea areas off the coast extending from Mannar to Pottuvil via Colombo and Galle is high. Navel communities are also requested to be vigilant in this regards.
Showers or thundershowers with cloudy conditions are expected to continue over most parts of the island and surrounding sea areas due to the low pressure area in the vicinity of Sri Lanka which is now located to the south of Sri Lanka.
Fairly strong gusty winds (up to 45-50 kmph) can be expected particularly over North-Central province and in Galle and Matara districts. Fairly heavy falls (75-100 mm) can be expected at some places particularly in Southern, Uva and Eastern provinces and in Matale and Polonnaruwa districts.
Meanwhile, eight spill gates were opened in Parakkrama Samudraya in Polonnaruwa district yesterday. People who are living in the downstream areas in Thamankaduwa and Lankapura areas are advised to be vigilant in this regard.
