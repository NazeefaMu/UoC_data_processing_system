Malwatte Chief Prelate praises Govt. for reducing essential drug prices

The steps taken by the government to reduce the prices of several essential drugs by breaking the back of the drug mafia is highly commendable, Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter said.
“The measures taken on the initiative of the Health Minister has helped innocent patients save a lot of money when purchasing essential drugs,” the Malwatte Mahanayake Thera said.
The Chief Prelate made this observation delivering an Anusasana when the newly appointed Director General of Health Services Dr.Anil Jasinghe called on him at the Malwatte Maha Viharaya and received his blessings last morning.
The Malwatte Chief Prelate added that he also appreciated the measures taken by the government to set up a new kidney treatment hospital in the North Ccentral Province (NCP) for the benefit of the large number of kidney patients in the NCP and the North and East.
The Malwatte Maha Nayake who said that wild cat strikes launched by doctors greatly inconvenienced the innocent patients, added that medical practitioners should think about the plight of the poor patients before deciding to go on strike at every turn.
The prelate also highlighted the need for a concerted program to uplift rural hospitals by attending to staff vacancies and drug shortages emphasised that such a program would help to prevent congestion in city hospitals.
Director General of Health Services Dr. Anil Jasinghe said a program was now underway to develop and upgrade the rural hospital network by assigning more staff and providing all other facilities including building equipment, drugs and other facilities.
