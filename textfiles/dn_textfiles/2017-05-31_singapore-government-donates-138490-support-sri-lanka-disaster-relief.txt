Singapore government donates $138,490 to support Sri Lanka disaster relief

The Singapore government will make a US$ 100,000 contribution to support disaster relief efforts in Sri Lanka following the loss of lives and destruction caused by heavy flooding and landslides across the country. The contribution was revealed in letters written by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan to their Sri Lankan counterparts, Ranil Wickremesinghe and Ravi Karunanayake, respectively. The contribution is intended to kick-start a public fundraising appeal by the Singapore Red Cross.
