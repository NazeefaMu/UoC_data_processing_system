Navy rescues flood victims

Under the directions of the Central Depository Systems office and on information released by the Disaster Management Centre, navy officers had provided assistance to victims of the prevailing inclement weather in the Southern and Western provinces.
Ten naval relief teams with seven dinghies and two emergency rescue boats were deployed to the affected areas. Naval personnel attached to the Marine Battalion and the Rapid Response, Rescue and Release Squadron (4RS), as well as Special Boat Squadron teams and navy divers were among the officers deployed.
Four relief teams were engaged in relief efforts in Neluwa, Thawalama, Imaduwa and Hininduma in Galle, while six disaster response teams had been deployed to Mathugama, Walallavita, Bulathsinhala in Kalutara, as well as Wattala in Colombo.
The navy had also distributed 625 lunch packets for displaced persons in Imaduwa.
A naval relief team was deployed to remove the debris near the Baddegama-Agaliya bridge which had increased the flood risk in the locality. The navy had so far rescued 236 persons in flooded regions.
