"Government will continue until 2020" -  President

 
President Maithripala Sirsena today assured that he would run the government until 2020, irrespective of who walks in or walks out.
Addressing a breakfast meeting with newspaper editors and media heads at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo today, the President said he was confident that the unity government would continue until 2020, in accordance with the mandate he received at the Presidential Election in January, 2015.
“Look at the composition of the current Parliament! The UNP has 106 seats and the UPFA has 95 seats. No one has a simple majority to form a government on their own. Any government, under the current circumstances, has to be a coalition government,” the President said, while adding that the Central Committee of the SLFP will make a final decision in December on renewing the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UNP.
“However, I am confident that the current government will continue until 2020. If not, there has to be some coup or conspiracy!” the President stressed.
Commenting on attempts to create divisions in the SLFP, the President said only the SLFP would sustain as a political entity.
“Only the SLFP has a vision and a policy framework. The party is guided by them. Political parties with individual agendas cannot function in the long run,” the President said, adding that the SLFP will become an even stronger political party in the future.
