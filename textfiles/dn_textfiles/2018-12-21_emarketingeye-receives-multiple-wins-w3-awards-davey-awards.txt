The W3 Awards celebrates digital excellence by honouring outstanding websites, web marketing, video, mobile sites/apps and social content created by some of the world’s best interactive agencies, designers, and creators. It is known to be the first major web competition to be accessible to the biggest agencies as well as the smallest firms where small firms are as likely to win as Fortune 500 companies and international agencies.
The Davey Awards is a large awards competition exclusively for the “Davids” of creativity. It focuses on honouring the achievements of the “Creative Davids” who derive their strength from big ideas, rather than large budgets. The awards recognizes the best in websites, design/print, film/video, commercials, online film/video, online advertising and marketing, integrated campaigns, multimedia, marketing effectiveness and radio. Both the W3 Awards and Davey Awards are sanctioned and judged by the Academy of Interactive and Visual Arts (AIVA), an invitation-only body consisting of top-tier professionals from acclaimed media, advertising and marketing firms.
