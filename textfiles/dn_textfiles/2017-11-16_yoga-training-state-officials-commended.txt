Yoga training for State officials commended

The Poonakary Divisional Secretary, in a letter of commendation to 66 Division General Officer Commanding Major General Duminda Keppetiwalana, has thanked the Army for conducting a yoga training programme for the staff of the Divisional Secretariat, with a view to promoting physical, mental and spiritual well-being.
The 66 Division troops serving under the Security Force Headquarters - Kilinochchi (SFHQ-KLN), at the invitation of the Divisional Secretariat, found human resources to conduct a two-day yoga training programme under the theme ‘Yoga and Relaxation Techniques’ at the Poonakary Divisional Secretariat during November 6 and 7.
Accordingly, yoga instructor Leelananda Wickramarachchi headed the training programme, which was attended by 55 employees of the Divisional Secretariat (DS), including heads of different sections in the DS.
Towards the end of the second day, the trainees had an interactive session with the yoga teacher and received answers to their questions with necessary explanations.
Poonakary Divisional Secretary C. C. Kirushnendiran, impressed with the arrangement, in a letter of acknowledgement to the 66 Division General Officer Commanding (GOC), has requested the GOC to conduct one more session for the employees who could not attend the first training programme.
The project, implemented as one more civil-military project, intending to promote goodwill and understanding among civilians in the area, was graced by the Divisional Secretary, GOC and several government officials during the brief inaugural ceremony.
