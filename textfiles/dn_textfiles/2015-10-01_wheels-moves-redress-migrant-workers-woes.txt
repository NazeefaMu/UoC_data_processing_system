Wheels moves to redress migrant workers' woes

Foreign Employment Minister Talatha Athukorale has drawn attention towards implementing a programme to find solutions to problems encountered by Sri Lankan workers leaving for foreign employment.
The minister has taken this decision after observing the failure on the part of certain foreign employment agencies to perform their responsibilities, said a ministry press release.
The release said the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau received complaints about employment agencies shirking their responsibilities when the next of kin of Sri Lankans employed abroad come to them with problems encountered by their family members seeking solutions. There have been instances where even accusations are levelled against those seeking solutions for such problems.
The bureau has been asked to pay attention towards errant employment agencies.
