Chena cultivators entitled to fertilizer subsidy, cultivation loss compensation

Chena cultivators shall be entitled for fertilizer subsidy and cultivation loss compensation. Although the government is prepared to officer chena cultivators growing maize this facility, the lack of land ownership where they cultivate prevent them from receiving it, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The minister told the Daily News that the government has taken a decision to accept the certificate issued by the Grama Niladhari confirming the particular crown land has been cultivated by the chena farmer, to grant the fertilizer subsidy and crop damage compensation. “This is a long-felt requirement as far as the chena cultivators are concerned.
But I warn the chena cultivators not to misuse this to expand the extent of crown land they cultivate in or by claiming ownership of such land at any cost.
This is a temporary benefit which chena cultivators could entertain permanently provided that they adhere to the conditions,” Minister Dissanayake said.
He added that Divisional Secretaries are expected to identify the limited extend of crown land being cultivated by the chena cultivators to ensure that conditions are not breached.
