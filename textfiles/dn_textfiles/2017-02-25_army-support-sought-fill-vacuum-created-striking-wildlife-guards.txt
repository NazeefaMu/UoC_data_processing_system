Army support sought to fill vacuum created by striking Wildlife Guards

The support of the Army will be sought to carry out the work of Wildlife Guards who have commenced a trade union action, Wildlife Conservation Department Director General W.S.K. Pathirathne said.
He said the wildlife guards have withdrawn from work over a salary issue. He said Civil Security personnel are assisting the Department to carry out the work uninterruptedly, adding that the service of Army personnel would also be sought if the need arises.
He said the request of the field officers to place them in the salary category of ‘MN III’ was declined by the National Salaries and Cadres Commission this week. He said the Department would have to re-negotiate it with the authorities.
Meanwhile, a Wildlife Department Trade Unionist told the Daily News that their salary grievances have not been addressed for the six years. “This is a token strike and we will end it by Monday morning. Thereafter, we will conduct fresh talks with the authorities. Our request to change our grade from ‘MN I’ to ‘MN III’ was fair given that we work round the clock.
Ours is largely voluntary work as we love wildlife and are committed to protectin it,” he explained.
“The Department authorities claim the work is going on smoothly.
Yes, the ticketing at the counters of National Parks is going on, but the authorities must realize that tourism and wildlife conservation are two different things. Wildlife raids have stopped and animals are at stake. We are very sad about the situayion,” he commented.
He said about 650 wildlife officers are involved in the trade union action.
