Media plays significant role - Anoma Gamage

Media plays a significant role in communicating to the masses as to how and why steps are taken by the government to curb corruption, bribery, misuse of state resources and other instances that violate the principles of good governance, Deputy Minister Dr. Anoma Gamage said.
She said so addressing the first meeting of the Media Forum of the International Conference on Asian Political Parties (ICAPP) in Seoul, South Korea recently.
The recent General Election held in Sri Lanka was conducted peacefully and democratically. A large part of this was due to the cooperation of media and political parties, she said. Media representatives recognized the need for a stronger relationship between the international media and the ICAPP. Cooperation between political parties and the media has been fraught with tension. On one hand, the international media can be accused of over-sensationalism as well as biased reporting, which can portray an incorrect impression of the policies of political parties. Political parties can also be criticized for suppressing media freedom for their own agenda and thereby not acting in the best interests of the people, the deputy minister said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has given freedom to journalists and media institutions in the country to express their views independently.
The international media can fully utilize its role to raise awareness about the ICAPP in demonstrating the power of unified political discourse and the benefit derived from an Asian community.
Political parties of the ICAPP should utilize the international media in two ways - as a tool for good governance as well as a vehicle to learn and provide assistance in times of crises, such as humanitarian disasters, Dr. Anoma Gamage said.
"When in the opposition party, we had no opportunity to express our views independently and liberally. We were compelled to conduct our political campaigns vocally. We were not able to organise events either political or welfare peacefully," she said.
A strong community can help to hold a government accountable for its action. One way in which the international media and the ICAPP can cultivate their working relationship is in cases of humanitarian crises. Asia is home to 4.4 billion people, a large number of whom are refugees.
The international media is best placed to report on growing developments in situations such areas in which political intervention and cooperation are most needed, the deputy minister said.
