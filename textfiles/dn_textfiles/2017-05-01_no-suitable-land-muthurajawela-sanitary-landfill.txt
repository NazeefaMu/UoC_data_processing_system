No suitable land in Muthurajawela for a sanitary landfill

 There is no suitable land in Muthurajawela to build a sanitary landfill, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Director General K. H. Muthukudarachchi told the Daily News yesterday.
He said even though garbage dumping in Muthurajawela has been temporarily permitted considering the seriousness of garbage disposal issue in the aftermath of Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse, nowhere in Muthurajawela is suitable to build a permanent sanitary landfill.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha told Parliament on Friday that a landfill would be constructed in Muthurajawela within 40 days. While assuring to take all precautions to make it environment-friendly, the minister said the landfill would be used as an immediate solution to the Colombo garbage disposal problem.
Western Development and Megapolis Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka also spoke of his ministry’s plans to build a sanitary landfill in Muthurajawela to dispose of the garbage generated in Colombo Port City and other proposed cities such as the ‘tech city’ in Homagama.
Meanwhile, Wildlife Conservation Department Director General W. S. K. Pathirathne said he has asked for a situation report from the Wildlife Western Regional Office Assistant Director on garbage dumping at Muthurajawela.
“I expect the report on Tuesday and will decide on the future actions after studying it. If necessary, I will inform the court. However, dumping of garbage at Bopitiya, a part of Muthurajawela Wildlife Sanctuary, has been stopped and now they are dumping garbage outside the sanctuary. Sanctuaries do not have buffer zones, unlike the National Parks. As per the National Environment Act, the CEA has the power to intervene up to a radius of 100 metres,” he said.
When asked about the plans to build a sanitary landfill at Muthurajawela, he said, “Various individuals may come up with various plans, but the project cannot be implemented without a comprehensive Environment Impact Assessment (EIA). Objections can be raised during the EIA process if necessary,” he said.
