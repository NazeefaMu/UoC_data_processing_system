Protest against SAITM students using Homagama, Avissawella hospitals

 
Medical Officers attached to the Homagama Hospital and the Medical students of Colombo and Sri Jayewardenepura universities today launched a protest opposite the Homagama Base Hospital.
They are protesting the government’s decisions to provide clinical training to SAITM students at Homagama and Avissawella Base hospitals.
On April 7, the government announced it would take over the Neville Fernando teaching hospital and that SAITM medical students would be sent to the Avissawella and Homagama hospitals for further clinical training.
