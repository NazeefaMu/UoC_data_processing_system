‘Let us build a world where children can be free’

Let us all resolve to build a world where all children including those in Sri Lanka can lead a free and happy life.
The theme for International Children’s Day - ‘Diriyen peramunata yanna lama kelota saviya denna’ has been selected to mark this year’s Children’s Day celebrations because today’s children would be the future leaders inheriting the country. Nearly 350,000 children join the country’s population each year.
As a government, it is our duty to provide encouragement and strength for children to march forward in their chosen fields.
While greeting all children on this occasion and wishing them a bright future, I would like to thank all staff including the Ministry officials making necessary arrangements to make the Children’s Day celebrations a success.
Chandrani Bandara
Women and Child Affairs Minister
