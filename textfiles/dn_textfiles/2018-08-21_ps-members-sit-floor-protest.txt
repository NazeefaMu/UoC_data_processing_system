PS members sit on floor in protest

Two members of the Yatiyantota Pradeshiya Sabha, including the Deputy Chairman, protested against the protest of Pradeshiya Sabha’s Secretary’s behavior by sitting on the floor, during a recent session of the PS.
Deputy Chairman A.V. Rohantha Gunasekara (SLPP) and Pradeshiya Sabha member M.D. Prasadika Kumari (SLPP) sat on the floor in protest of Secretary R.A.D. Ratnayake’s behaviour.
condemning her behaviour, they complained that the Secretary speaks abusively to the employees there and acts arbitrarily.
When the August sittings of the Yatiyanthota Pradeshiya Sabha commenced, presided by Chairman K.D. Wasantha (SLPP), the two members handed over a letter to the Chairman with the signatures of several other members, requesting that he take action against the Secretary.
When the Chairman gave them the assurance that he would look into the matter and report to the Pradeshiya Sabha at the next session, the two resumed their seats.
