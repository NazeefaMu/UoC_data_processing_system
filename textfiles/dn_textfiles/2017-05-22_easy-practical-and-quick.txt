Easy, practical and quick!

Garden Talk speaks to Development officer, Provincial Deputy Director’s office of Agriculture Ratmalana P.A.G.C. Siriwardhana on Pot Nursery Management at the Home Garden Level, focusing on vegetable Pot Nursery Plants. Not many of us are knowledgeable about what happens at the nursery stage. Siriwardhana informs us about the nursery stage.
“When it comes to nursery management there are many techniques such as bed and pot type. Today we are discussing the pot type. The pot type is the easiest techniques when it comes to home gardening. It is more practical. The early stages of a plant begin in the nursery. In many instances we plant seeds of small size in the nursery. That is normally done. There are many types such as Chili, Tomato, Capsicum and Brinjals,” said Siriwardhana
When it comes to Management there is a concept called ‘Root to Shoot Ratio’- the ratio between the volume of the roots and shoots. At some stage the plants in the nursery will need to be planted in the field. If the volume of the roots is less than the volume of the shoots then it cannot withstand the shock of being uprooted and planted in the fields – this is called the ‘transplant shock’.
Root to Shoot Ratio
“When you take the small seeds the vegetable plants that arise have a similar ‘Root to Shoot Ratio.’ When you take Brinjals, Capsicum, Tomato and Chili the root and shoot ratio is similar. They can be uprooted from the nursery and planted in the fields. This is because the Roots will absorb the water and successfully distribute it amongst the shoots. If the roots ratio is low compared to the shoot ratio, then the roots cannot successfully distribute the water amongst the shoots and the plant will die.
When planted in the fields, plants with an equal volume of roots and shoots can withstand the ‘transplant shock’ of being planted in the field,” explained Siriwardhana.
We know by experience and experiment which plants have less amount of roots and which ones have more roots.
“For example we know that Chili, Tomato, Capsicum and Brinjals have a similar ‘Root to Shoot Ratio’. Also if there are plants with less amount of roots than shoots, then they are not directly uprooted and planted in the fields. They are planted in the fields along with the mound of soil in the pot that they grew in,” stated Siriwardhana.
Container types
In pot nursery the containers can be polythene bags, yoghurt cups, curd or ice cream containers.
“However the containers should have good water drainage holes. A good drainage system is necessary. This affects the development of the seedlings. The polythene bag could be 5 inches wide and 5 inches high,” pointed out Siriwardhana.
In the nursery the soil is also an important matter.
“In the soil media, the Organic manure and the top soil ratio must be 1:1. If you take one container with organic manure, the top soil should be in the same amount. Then it is mixed. The media must be soft without huge particles. It needs to be free of debris. Then the roots can grow freely. However before planting and put into a container, the nursery media also must be sterilized. You need to expose the organic manure and top soil to the direct sunlight and close it with a transparent polythene for two weeks. The heat gets trapped and the soil gets sterilized. You can even use fungicide as another alternative – chemical sterilization,” informed Siriwardhana.
The pot filled with the soil medium must subsequently be placed in an area that will protect it from direct rain or wetness and even against strong sunlight.
“Then we plant 10 – 15 small seeds. Again we apply a light layer of the soil (previously prepared soil) over these seeds with a thickness of 1cm. However before planting the seeds we need to do the seed treatment. Here you administer a fungicide to the seeds. This is before planting. You apply a fungicide layer to the seeds. After that the seed is planted in the pots. However at the home garden level applying fungicide is not a really big issue,” said Siriwardhana.
Then the pot needs to be covered by a net – a shade net. After that it needs watering. But only the required amount. After about one week the shoots emerge. After the shoots emerge the net is taken off.
Watering
“When watering it needs to be done with sensitivity, if the water spray is too strong the seedlings’ will be damaged. After two weeks we do the hardening process. However before this there is the danger of ants. So in the home garden we hang the pot or apply insecticide (When done commercially),” pointed out Siriwardhana.
After a few leaves appear the hardening process begins.
“We train the plant to get used to direct sunlight. We increase the amount of exposure to direct sunlight and reduce the shading. A plant that has been exposed to hardening is planted in the field,” stated Siriwardhana.
In a pot where we have planted around 10 seeds, the seedlings have to be uprooted and transplanted. In a pot with two or three seeds, without uprooting it can be transplanted. When five leaves appear it is suitable for transplant.
“In a pot where we have around 10 seedlings we need to uproot them and plant separately in the field because of the competition amongst the plants - the productivity is low and no spacing. However in a pot where there are two or three seedlings, we can remove the polythene bag and plant the seedlings in their soil mound. When planting without uprooting the productivity is high. The harvest comes quickly,” elucidated Siriwardhana. 
NURSERY TIMES FOR PLANTS
* If you take Tomato the nursery time is 21 - 28 days
* If you take Chili and Capsicum is 28 - 35 days
DISEASES IN A NURSERY
* One is damping off – for that you need a fungicide. The base of the seedling develops a brown spot/ it rots and the seedling falls down. This happens when there is too much water and when it is watered too much at night.
* Mite attacks – they suck the plant sap and the leaves become deformed. The growth is stunted. You need to administer Miticides.
* Snails and Slugs.
