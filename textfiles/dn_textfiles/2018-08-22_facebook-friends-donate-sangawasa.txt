Facebook friends donate Sangawasa

A group of Facebook friends in Pallebedda built a Sangavasa at the Karawilayaya Temple at a cost of over Rs. 800,000.
Neesha Madhurangi, who led this noble deed, said that when she visited the Karawilayaya village once, she saw the dilapidated temple there. After taking its pictures with her mobile phone, she posted them on Facebook along with a caption.
Many Facebook friends thereafter contacted her and asked for details. Several of them got together and visited the temple to see what they could do to improve its condition. They decided to build a two-room Sangavasa and donate it to the temple.
Thereafter, they launched a fund with Rs. 10,000 and it gradually grew with contributions of her Facebook friends here and abroad. Within months, they built the Sangawasa spending the money in the fund and donated to the Maha Sangha, she said.
