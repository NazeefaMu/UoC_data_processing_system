Lotus Tower to blossom soon

The foundation stone was laid on January 20, 2012 with an investment of $104.3 million to build an iconic tower in Sri Lanka. It was named the Lotus Tower project.
The Lotus Tower comes with unique features among them three museums which add more glamour to the tower and this project would be the icon of Colombo, said Prof. Nimal De Silva, Senior Engineer, Lotus Tower project.
“The main purpose is transmission and the transmission will be run through this tower. The first and second floors of the tower, located at 215 meters and 219.8 meters, are to be used for TV and radio broadcasting. The ground first and second floors are for commercial purposes and it will be rented out soon. We are going to rent it out for a bigger amount, we intend to cover the cost of the construction within a certain period,” he said.
“On the Lotus Tower, three floors will be technical floors and that will be for technical people. At 234.2 metres (768 feet) on the fourth floor, there will be a restaurant with a revolving floor for fine dining to house 300 packs. At a height of 224.6 metres and 229.4 metres (737 and 752 feet) there will be two banquet halls on two floors. There will also be four chalets for foreign dignitaries, state guests and exclusive guests on the sixth floor, at 239 metres (784 feet). Above that there will be an observation deck where eight telescopes fixed to see around the city,” Prof De Silva said.
“Three museums will be introduced on the ground floor and the ground floor museum is going to be a natural history museum covering Geology, Zoology and Botany.”
“We have found fossils of Dinosaurs, Hippopotamus, Lion and Tiger from gem pits. Few weeks ago I found a jaw of an elephant that lived more than 10,000 years ago. All fossilized things are deposited; we thought that we should expose it to our people. All kinds of gems will be displayed at the museum. Secondly the cultural history, covering the traditional kitchen, pottery, dresses, festivals and many more things will be covered electronically, high technologically. The third museum would be the arts and crafts. The identity of the civilization comes with arts and crafts. We are going to setup a souvenir shop as well,” he said.
The Prof said that they plan to give something that schoolchildren have never seen before and for them to get the knowledge of the history of Sri Lanka. “The country has fascinating rock varieties and people are not aware of it, similarly there are many timber varieties here and people have never seen most of them. The intention was to show the Lankan people the real heritage and they can learn from it,” he said.
“We have installed very high speed lifts in this tower and the speed is seven meters per second. This will help people to go to functions within few minutes. It will enable to evacuate about 900 people in the middle and the top of the tower within half an hours’ time. Three elevators in the tower will be high speed elevators; two will travel at a medium speed of five meters per second, it will be mostly for service usage. It will be used for sending food and other items from the kitchen located in the basement to the top floors.
With the high speed elevators, it will be possible to reach the observation deck from the tower base in less than a minute. These lifts are fire proof,” he said.
Chanaka Abeykoon, Administration Manager, Lotus Tower project said that there would be several VIP rooms in the sixth floor as well and a special area to view Colombo city and the pending Colombo Port City project.
“However the major draw would be the revolving restaurant on the top floor which would do one round in 90 minutes. Once the project completed, and with the lightning tower in place, the tower will stand at a total of 356.3 metres,” he said.
The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) serves as the local regulator of the project while the University of Moratuwa provides consultancy services for this project.
