Terrors beyond imagination

The Mummy is a 2017 American 3D action-adventure horror film directed by Alex Kurtzman and written by David Koepp, Christopher McQuarrie and Dylan Kussman, with a story by Kurtzman, Jon Spaihts and Jenny Lumet.
It is a reboot of The Mummy franchise and the first installment in the Dark Universe film series. The film stars Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella, Annabelle Wallis, Jake Johnson, Courtney B. Vance, Marwan Kenzari and Russell Crowe.
There were two sequels, 2001’s The Mummy Returns, and 2008’s The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.
Though safely entombed in a crypt deep beneath the unforgiving desert, an ancient queen (Sofia Boutella of Kingsman: The Secret Service and Star Trek Beyond) whose destiny was unjustly taken from her, is awakened in our current day, bringing with her malevolence grown over millennia and terrors that defy human comprehension. From the sweeping sands of the Middle East through hidden labyrinths under modern-day London, The Mummy brings a surprising intensity and balance of wonder and thrills in an imaginative new take that ushers in a new world of gods and monsters.
Nick Morton is a soldier of fortune who plunders ancient sites for timeless artifacts and sells them to the highest bidder. Morton must now stop the resurrected monster as she embarks on a furious rampage through the streets of London. Russel Crowe plays a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde – like character.
The Mummy is screening at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm and 7.15 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Empire Cineplex at 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.30 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.30 am.
