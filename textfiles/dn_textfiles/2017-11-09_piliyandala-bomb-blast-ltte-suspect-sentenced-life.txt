Piliyandala bomb blast: LTTE suspect sentenced to life

An LTTE suspect who found guilty to the charge of having conspired to explode a claymore bomb targeting a commuter bus at the Piliyandala bus stand in 2008 was yesterday sentenced to life in prison by the Colombo High Court.
Handing down a sentence against accused S. Ananda Sudahar alias Lorence David Raja, High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe observed that the prosecution has proven the guilty of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the accused alleging that the attack was carried out on or around April 25, 2008 under 94 counts.
The bombing killed 26 and injured at least 64. The accused had been charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
