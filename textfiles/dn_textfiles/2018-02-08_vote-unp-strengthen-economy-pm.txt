Vote for UNP to strengthen economy-PM

A vote for the United National Party on February 10th will empower the government to strengthen the country’s economy and speedup development,” Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing the final rallies yesterday evening.
“For the nation to move forward, the people should have freedom, while the nation should have a strong and stable economy. Today, the people have the freedom even to criticise the government,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
“It is only when there is a stable economy that the government can commence new development projects. We are still repaying the debts passed on to us by the previous government,” the Prime Minister said.
“Matara is a district that thrived on an agricultural economy, mainly tea, rubber and cinnamon.But we intend to change this in the future and make Matara an industrial district. We plan to establish six Industrial Zones in the Hambantota and Moneragala Districts and two in the Matara District, namely Weligama and Kamburupitiya,” the Premier said.
“In future, Matara would be an industrial and not an agricultural district. We also plan to develop the tourism sector. We will be inviting investors to establish industries in the Matara district this year,”the Prime Minister said.
“It is this government that introduced the new electoral system under which elections have become extremely peaceful. It is our government that even approved the 25% female representation in Local Government bodies. Today, you have the opportunity to elect the candidate of your choice to represent your village at the Local Council. By establishing the Election Commission we have ensured that elections will always be free and fair,” the Prime Minister said.
Minsters Mangala Samaraweera, Malik Samarawickrema,Member of Parliament Buddika Pathirana, Members of the Southern Provincial Council and United National Party Local Government candidates were present.
