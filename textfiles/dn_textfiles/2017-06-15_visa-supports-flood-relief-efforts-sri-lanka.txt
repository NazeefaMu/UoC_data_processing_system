Visa supports flood relief efforts in Sri Lanka

In response to the devastating floods in Sri Lanka, Visa has stepped forward to help flood relief efforts by donating US$ 50,000 to the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society.
Sri Lanka's worst floods in the last 14 years, triggered by Tropical Cyclone Mora, have significantly impacted communities across the country.
The heavy rain has resulted in more than 112,000 people and thousands of homes being displaced, according to Government estimates.
“Our hearts go out to all the families across Sri Lanka who have lost their homes and possessions due this flooding disaster.We commend the efforts of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society in helping affected communities through this difficult time,” said Anthony Watson, Visa Country Manager for Sri Lanka.
“We are glad a global organization like Visa is donating to the Red Cross. This donation comes at a vital stage. It's indeed good to know that there are lots of organizations that donate at the peak time of a disaster, but the real challenge begins when we resettle communities and help people to get back to normalcy to live a dignified life” said Jagath Abeysinge- President, Sri Lanka Red Cross.
The donation from Visa will support the work the Red Cross is doing in providing immediate humanitarian aid and relief efforts across the country.
