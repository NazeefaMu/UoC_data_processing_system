SLC has a lot to answer for cricket’s downfall – Sangakkara

Former Sri Lanka captain and legendary batsman Kumar Sangakkara blamed Sri Lanka Cricket and its administrators for failing to arrest the slump the national team is currently going through.
Sri Lanka’s performance has dipped in all three formats of the game after the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Sangakkara from international cricket. It was quite evident from their pretty woeful defence of their World T20 title in India, where Sri Lanka won only one of their four group games.
Interviewed on BBC’s program ‘Stumped’ Sangakkara asked the question what needs to be done to arrest the slump said, “Planning over the last two years has not been the best. I left T20 cricket two years ago so did Mahela and we still have a large amount of the same squad who played in this particular edition (World T20).
“We have Test cricket good performances against the West Indies and not so good against New Zealand, both at home and away we have been tested. Transition yes but the point is have we transition well Are we putting the right structures in place and the procedures in place to ensure this transition period does not last much longer but actually becomes a period where the team has grown and got over the fact that players have retired because players do retire and many more will over the next years Are we actually giving our best cricketers the opportunity to continuously play their best cricket And the answer is probably No.”
Speaking further Sangakkara said, “Luckily for us we have Graham Ford who has taken over. He is a man who knows how to build sides in the long term. He is a great asset to have at a time like this when the going is tough.
“We do have some wonderfully talented players but our structure needs to be fine tuned at first-class level without a doubt. We need to ensure that there is more quality, there is better competition and there is a lot more of a challenge to players to get better where they are continuously tested in skill, in temperament, in character, in mental ability and mental skills so that they can transition not just from under 19 level to first-class level and first-class to international level with a lot more comfort.”
Sangakkara questioned SLC whether they have everything in place to fine tune the talent and potential that is abounding in the country to actual ability and quantifiable performances on the field.
“It’s going to be a very important period for Sri Lanka Cricket to answer those questions and answer them very well,” said Sangakkara.
“Any past players in Sri Lanka they are very open to being of help. You don’t have to be an integral part of the administration to be of service to cricket,” he said.
“You can do that in your own way, in a large way, a small way, doesn’t matter what the role is but I believe all players past and present should take up that mantle and that responsibility of ensuring that you give back something to the game.”
Sangakkara is presently playing for Surrey in the English county championships and admitted that he missed international cricket but does not regret the decision he took to quit it.
“The ultimate is going out there in the middle and batting long, there is no substitute for that. That’s something I am going to miss at international level no doubt, but life moves on and you have to move with it,” Sangakkara said.
