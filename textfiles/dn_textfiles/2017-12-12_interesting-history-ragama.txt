An interesting history of Ragama

Ragama, a backward region thinly populated way back in the past fifth decade with a shanty town resembled a dark isolated countryside village. The appearance of the populace looked very distressed and undergoing a gloomy period of time. I observed this situation as a brat of eleven years on a day in 1950 when I accompanied my parents to the sanatorium at Welisara where one of my grandmothers who suffered from tuberculosis was undergoing treatment. Only a few passengers with us alighted from the train on to the platform of the empty railway station and walked out to a desolate, unkempt, uninviting and noiseless shanty town which broke its silence only in an instance when a vehicle happened to ply. Though human population was less there were pigs more than the humans. There were pigs and piglets left to stray roaming in the roadside shrubby lands. Many families reared pigs for meat and earned a high income.
During this era, the countrymen lived healthy lives because they consumed only natural unalloyed food and as they were very careful about personal hygiene and behaviour. Unlike today, the hospitals were not crowded with sick people. As such, they were dreaded over the disclosure about a never heard of wasting disease affecting the lungs spreading in the country for which a definite quick curing treatment was not discovered but, was on trial like for dengue this day. In its absence, hospitalized patients who were destined to recuperate and live, lived, others departed like my grandmother after a couple of years.
It was during this period that the ‘Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis’ was formed by our eminent elders of the medical profession, philanthropists and those who had a flair for human welfare considering the dreadfulness of the disease in that era. Sanatorium at Welisara situated in a quiet, shady land few metres away from the Colombo – Negombo road was the establishment where the people who suffered from this chronic pandemic disease were admitted and treated severally. Despite this healthy arrangement to put into quarantine and treat the exposed people, misinterpreted by the people of that era owing to their ignorance, Ragama Base Hospital was known countywide as the shayaroga ispirithale (cancer hospital) as a result, people were hesitant to move about at Ragama scared of contraction and those who visited hospitalized patients and obtained treatment from the outpatient department were also few in number.
Feeling of fear and suspense
Several portions of the trunk road leading to Tewatte like other roads to Kadawata and Welisara was covered and shaded by the ramification of branches of profusely grown trees and creepers spreading over the road from uncultivated lands neglected for many years turned forests hooded the road preventing sunbeam from falling hence, the somewhat dark environment during the daytime thickened with the sundown as the twilight was prevented from falling and the dim street lights of that era too did not provide sufficient illumination. This atmosphere with no houses close by and people and vehicles like this day going back and forth often created a feeling of fear and suspense in the minds of the pedestrians and felt precarious to travel alone along this road even during daytime.
The junction in this highway bordering Tewatte popularly known as Kurusa Handiya, where a cross stands to indicate the situation of a Christian shrine ahead of it is the entry point to the Basilica, the “Shrine of Our Lady of Lanka”. The precincts of this shrine during the earliest times were covered by a luxuriantly grown exquisite tea plantation until it was replaced by a rubber plantation for economic reasons. The well preserved antiquated tea factory used for other purposes this day stands as a monument reminding the passersby of a glorious history of a tea industry that existed once upon a time in the outskirts of the city of Colombo. Though tea was replaced by rubber, the name “Tewatta” (tea estate in the Sinhalese language) has put down roots.
When the rubber plantation grew up exuberantly the once well sunlit distance from Kurusa Handiya to the precincts of the shrine too became shady and dark. Under this condition, with the presence of miscreants and misfits in this junction at abnormal hours it was not safe for pedestrians to go this destination in the wee hours of a day or after fall of darkness. Yet, their professions compelled them to walk this destination from the Ragama railway station to Tewatte during abnormal hours whenever they arrived late. At this, then, notoriously known junction during the period from 1967 to 1990 the rogués waylaid and robbed many pedestrians of their possessions, molested women and escaped without leaving clues to identify them.
As the rubber plantation grew tall as the vantage point in the shrine premises got covered, the reverend administrators lost the sight of the frontage of the land from the church premises or the compound of the vicarage, they were compelled to visit the covered areas of the land for superintending purposes. As they couldn’t frequent this area, their absence paved the way for the scallywags, miscreants, rogues and sex perverts who haunted the Kurusa Handiya to intrude the area of the original church. Resultantly, the reverend administrators were compelled to deploy watchers on fulltime duty to arrest this situation. It was extremely difficult to detect them unless after close scrutiny and observation as they mingled with sanctimonious pilgrims to eyewash.
As a person who lived in front of the Basilica from 1982 to 1990, I have seen the trouble undergone by the watchers to eject them. There were occasions when they were compelled to make use of their bludgeons to eject the philistines forcefully. They performed their duty with much dedication and eliminated the menace effectually and efficaciously.
Sixty-seven years after, today, Ragama is not a shanty town anymore. Densely populated Ragama owing to population explosion is not spacious enough to accommodate all and, all those who intend to settle down. It has become a dormitory town as jobseekers are streaming to the west constantly in large numbers. As vehicles from the smallest size to the largest have come on the roads and trains on tracks travelling in large numbers Ragama is affected by noise pollution. It now has a crowded and busy township but, it is the ugliest, unhygienic and stinking town in the (Colombo North) outskirts of Colombo.
Inhale polluted air
It’s a town overflown with effluvium owing to stagnant and contaminated water in drains and decaying garbage strewn everywhere become breeding places for worms, flies and mosquitoes. This is the only township which is having a shrubby land in the middle of the town surrounded by pharmacies, eateries, groceries, bakers, caterers, hotels, hospitals, the marketplace and the Colombo North Teaching hospital in the background on the hilltop on to which all the muck from all these sources are dumped. The only commendable work done in this town is the establishment of the children’s park. Unfortunately, it is situated right by the side of this dump and the drain. The children who play in this park from dawn to dusk inhale polluted air. Not only them, their parents and guardians, the townsfolk too, and, all who come to this town.
It is in this environment all edible things especially raw vegetable, fish, fruit and meat are stored, stacked and sold in the open air. The hidden garbage dump hitherto unknown to the minister and the environmentalists is in the backyard of the row of mercantile buildings in front of the hospital where a high infestation of carrion crows, abnormally, the cranes which should prey on in paddy fields, lakesides and brooksides, cats and dogs, rats and rodents, flies, worms and mosquitoes live on, never leave for this landmass covered with huge trees and undergrowth has become a habitation for the wild since more than fifteen years ago.
When the dengue crisis cropped up a few months ago the visible portion of the dunghill was pushed inwards by a dozer to hide. Has this action solved the problem? No. It has worsened the situation. It’s a hell on this part of the earth. On dry days, there is an eruption of sudden fires probably owing to the plastics and polythene producing methane gas when mixed with earth. Then begins smoke rising to the skies emanating nauseous smell polluting the air right in front of the hospital. And, if a glimpse is taken towards the right from there, the refuse dumped by the people living on both sides of the old railway line to the quarry which provided the rubble to build the railway tracks during British colonial rule. This is the status quo.
We are not blind, dumb and deaf except for an unfortunate percentage of our brethren on whose welfare we as a nation collectively contribute through various public and private sector sponsored organisations, and, individually as well. It is sad to note that those who can see have not seen these, those who can speak have not spoken about these and those who can hear have not heard of these grave shortcomings. What have the Local Authorities, the Medical Officers of Health and Public Health Inspectors done all these years? Misleading the governments, is it not?
Tubercle Bacillus is not a disease to be feared of anymore as the curative has been found to be cured within six months. But, this town which is the catchment area of the hospital, railway station and the bus stands in this hazardous condition is definitely a threat to the arrangements made and is being made for the improvement of public health.
In this undisciplined era, where lawlessness prevails, misdeeds and misfeasance are rampant, misbehaviour of the misbegotten have become a hindrance to the progression of the society when promiscuity is enjoying prominence over decency, the righteous way is scornfully rejected and indecency is repeated, stubbornly and arrogantly.
Employment seekers
The ultimate objective of the church is to establish a holy family in every house. Those who intend to lead to Alter, the pilgrims, devotees and visitors are welcome to the church to receive blessings where they must behave reverently, be it on the premises or in the precincts.
With the rapid influx of citizens from other parts of the country to the city of Colombo for employment and the suburban areas seeking accommodation, we observe from since of late the appearance of strangers and wanderers and their presence in places where they should not frequent without reliable reasons. This infestation has extended up to the Basilica grounds. They may be gaining some solace by being in solitude under the shade of these trees in the holy place of worship and enjoying lustful thoughts in this quiescent environment but, if they misbehave misusing the privilege offered to pilgrims it’s tantamount to the misdemeanour in a sanctum detrimental to the sanctity of the holy land. They have to be warned against repetition and the deviants have to be deterred and repeaters have to be ejected.
This situation dispelled in the 1990s has come up again after three decades may be owing to the relaxation of the administrative procedures after the elimination of this menace. The concerned devotees are of the view including the opinion of Dulishan Fernando, the engineer who is a voluntary factotum closely associated with the Reverend Fr. Administrator that a Police Post at Tewatte or regular police patrolling the area could prevent these from happening. This has to be done as shabby behaviour in a holy land will be a dishonour to a sacrosanct place of worship. As the modern day youth misprision the righteous way they have to be taught about the etiquette.
