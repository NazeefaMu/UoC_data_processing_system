Uva hospital staff protest unresolved issues

Staff attached to all hospitals in the Badulla and Moneragala districts except Badulla General Hospital participated in a sick note campaign and left their posts yesterday (May 16).
This is in protest over six unresolved job problems including the non payment of overtime and holiday payments since February 2017.
Those participating in the campaign included nurses, supplementary employees, para-medical staff and family health workers.
Even the Mahiyangana base hospital was affected by the work stoppage and a large number of patients who attended clinics were inconvenienced since they could not get the specified drugs for the prescriptions issued by doctors who examined them.
Pregnant mothers who attended maternity clinics had to return home empty handed as all maternity clinics had been cancelled. Laboratory services too were disrupted as radiologists had joined the token strike.On May 10 too staff attached to several medical services staged a token strike from 8 am to 12 noon demanding solutions to outstanding job problems.
