Re-introduce the lucky draws for banks
Until about four years ago most banks and other registered financial institutions conducted monthly, half yearly and yearly lucky draws for their customers based on the balance available. The winners got prizes ranging from domestic electric appliances such as refrigerators, TVs, cars and houses as prizes.
However one of the governors of the Central Bank during the MR regime issued instructions to the bank to stop these draws and instead have a scheme whereby one gets a gift when reaching a certain age, at marriage, graduation, on reaching 60 years etc.
This has resulted in the Senior Citizens being completely ignored as they are not eligible to get any gift going by the categories mentioned.
I suggest that the incumbent governor of the Central Bank re introduces the former scheme that the banks had so that the customers will stand a chance to win prizes irrespective of their age and social standing.
