Q: What is your full name and date of birth?
A - Madapathage Gamini Srilal Perera. 25th July 1939.
Q: Which is your first school?
A - In 1944 I was admitted to Palliyagodela Sinhala Mixed School, Rawathawatte and from there to Moratu Vidyalaya in 1949 to Grade 5.
Q:How did you commence your cricket career?
A - As a schoolboy I was interested in cricket and I played soft ball cricket with my neighboring friends and my class mates. During this period our Principal was A. M. de Silva and the Master in Charge of Cricket and Prefect of Games were Mr. Manukularathna and Mr. Ranasuriya respectively. Mr. Manukulasuriya wanted to commence cricket at college and he organized inter house cricket matches and I did well and I was selected for the first eleven cricket team as an under 13 boy. Mr. De Silva arranged a big match with Methodist High School Moratumulla and their Principal was Annesley de Mel, later the President of the Ceylon National Schools. We played the big match at our grounds. Our captain was Divilton Fernando and the others were Tudor Hapugoda, Madurapala Gunaratne, Shelton Perera, Mohanlal Fernando and Vincent de Alwis to mention a few. We continued this encounter upto 1955 vice versa at De Soysa Park, Methodians home grounds. Due to unavoidable circumstances this encounter was stopped and Mr. De Silva arranged the Big Match versus Sri Sumangala College, Panadura a leading Buddhist Educational Institute in the coastal belt in 1956 and I played in this match in 56, 57 and in 1958 when I captained the team we lost to Sumangalians on our grounds. My opposite number was P. Gaminiratne. That year we played against Maliyadeva, Dharmapala, Piliyandala Central, Kalutara Vidyalaya, Gnanodaya, Tissa Central, St. Thomas’ Matara, St. Servatius and Rahula. I represented my school for seven years and played in seven big matches which may be a record for both schools.
Q:Did you play club cricket during your school career?
A - Yes. My coach Bertram de Silva took me to Moratuwa Sports Club and I played Daily News Trophy cricket. Also I represented outstation schools against Combined Schools. Our team was led by Charlie Joseph and the team included Nimal Maralanda, Dennis Ferdinands, and Suranjith Mendis to mention a few.
Q:Did you take part in any other sports at school?
A – Yes, Athletics, Volleyball, Table Tennis and Badminton. I won the Discus and Javelin Throws at the Western Group Meet in the under 19 age group and went on to represent school at the Public Schools Meet in the same events. I was a member of the 4x110 and 4x440 yards relay teams and my other team mates were Laxman de Alwis, Nimal Fernando and Hector Perera. In Volleyball under my captaincy we were District Champions in the Lankadeepa Trophy and we lost to Zahira College and finally Zahira lost to Lawrence College, Gampaha in the finals captained by Sri Lanka famous spiker Sirisena.
Q:Your school is a mixed one, and how did the girls excel in sports?
did not take part in sports. They played Netball and participated in sports meets. Now there are several sports for girls.
Q: What is your employment?
A - I joined the Ceylon Government Railways in 1959 and served for 30 years. After my retirement they absorbed me and I worked for another 16 years for a total of 46 years. I was taken as a Trainee Engine Driver and there too I played cricket in all divisions of the Government Services and I captained for several years. Finally I played for the Veterans team too. There I played for the Volleyball team and I captained them also.
Q: Did you continue to play club cricket?
A- Yes. I continued to play for Moratuwa SC upto 1970 in Sara Trophy. I played with stalwarts like D. D. Jayasinghe, Nisal Senaratne, H. I. Fernando, Stanley Fonseka, Sylvester Dias, D. C. V. Perera, Tudor Meegoda, Kingsley Fernando, R. M. Fernando, Laxman Perera, Suranjith Mendis to mention a few.
Q: Any unforgettable incident?
A - Yes. Once we beat formidable University of Ceylon which consisted of players of the caliber of Carlyle de Silva, David Ponniah, Nihal Gurusinghe, Cyril Ernest, Buddy Reid, L. P. Gunathilake, Lariff Idroos, Kingsley Fernando to mention a few. We batted first and scored 187 runs and I was the top scorer with 41 runs and though this score was insufficient we got them out for 112. In another Sara match H. I. got a century and I was unbeaten at the other end with 81 and all these runs were in singles and perhaps it may be a record in Sara Trophy.
Q: You have played with fine cricketers prior to getting Test status to Sri Lanka and in your opinion who is the best batsman you have come across?
A - No doubt. It is H. I. Fernando whether it is matting or turf.
Q: What is the advice you could give to the young Vidyalian cricketers?
A - My advice is don’t take the Big Match and the Limited Overs Match easily because the present day cricket is very tough. All the cricket playing schools are very well coached and geared. Don’t under estimate your opponents and always play the game hard according to the rules and maintain discipline at all times. On the other hand don’t neglect your studies at any cost. If you have good results with the sports background you will be able to find out good employment. Sports alone will not help to fit you into a better place. May the triple gem bless both schools.
