Neptune Edification to position as leading finance education provider in Central Province

Neptune Edification has been the leading education provider for the ACCA qualification throughout the Central Province for the last six years, with enrollment numbers increasing each year due to their student’s consistent achievements of exceeding ACCA’s worldwide pass rates, as well as producing Sri Lankan Prize winners.
In the wake of these achievements, NEP is now taking a bold step in positioning themselves to also provide education in all the top local finance qualifications currently available in the country.
The leading player in Kandy for ACCA education Neptune Edification, is celebrating six years of successful operation this year, by taking an innovative leap towards being a fully-fledged finance education institute offering all the leading local finance qualifications in addition to that of ACCA.
These will include AAT - The Association of Accounting Technicians, CA - The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and CMA – The Institute of Management Accountants of Sri Lanka.
Speaking of this venture, Krishni Balasubramaniam, Director Administration of Neptune Edification said, whilst it has been a rewarding journey so far in being the leader for ACCA education in the Central province for the last six years, their success made them look at the wider picture, which is that of giving the opportunity to students in the central province, access to a range of careers in one of the most sought-after industries which is finance.
“Whatever the economic climate, there is always a huge demand for experts in fields such as banking, fund management, multinational companies, securities firms and financial consultancy and we wanted to bring to our table all the top finance qualifications both local and international, that will help our students effectively incorporate all the different leanings of finance,that will in turn give them a plethora of skills and insights.
In other words, we wanted to be the “finance qualification hub” in the central province. We believe wholeheartedly in this blended solutions model and strongly feel that this will ultimately lead to the sustainable development of producing top ranked accounting professionals in the region”.
Krishni said, “We at Neptune Edification diversified the portfolio of our qualifications to strategically position ourselves to cater the varying demands of the accountancy profession.
We have now become the only institution in the Central Province to provide learning for the leading Sri Lankan accountancy qualifications AAT, CASL and CMA in English medium along with one of the best global accountancy qualifications, ACCA”.
