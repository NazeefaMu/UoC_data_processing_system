Oily Woes!

Come summer and our skin gets prone to developing blackheads, pimples, enlarged pores and other such problems. If you have oily skin, you can definitely relate to this. Oily skin deserves proper care, if you want to look good. If you are fed up with your skin complications, read on for these skincare tips that work.
 
Combination skin 
Of all the different skin types, combination skin is one of the more confusing and prevalent ones. Characterized as having a mix of oily and dry skin, combination skin is more common and persistent.
Combination skin type is neither dry nor oily, it’s generally a mixture of both. If you have a combination skin type, most of the time you will notice more oil on your forehead, nose and chin area. The other parts would be normal or dry and varies from person to person.
 
Treatment for pigmented skin 
This skin discoloration, commonly known as skin pigmentation is often a result of sun exposure (UV rays), hormonal changes, genetics, medications (such as birth control pills), pregnancy, skin aging or the wrong use of skin care products, just to name a few.
Many think that pigmentation simply refers to the dark spots on the face. However, there is, in fact, more than one type of skin pigmentation and depending on its type, its appearance differs. For example:
* Sun spots
* Melasma
* Freckles
* Computer Radiation Spots
* Post-Acne Pigmentation
* Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation
For deep pigmentation such as melasma, ActiveFX Laser Resurfacing is the skin pigmentation treatment of choice which can remove up to 80 percent of melanin in one treatment.
If you have minimal darkness, try microdermabrasion. During microdermabrasion, the uppermost layer of skin is gently removed to get rid of sunspots, darkness and other types of superficial and minimal discoloration. There are some versions of microdermabrasion, like DermaSweep, that offer a secondary step where specialized anti-pigment ingredients are infused into the skin to further brighten it.
If you have more stubborn spots, try a chemical peel. Salicylic acid, glycolic acid and TCA chemical peels are often recommended to banish discolouration. Beverly Hills, CA, dermatologist Zein Obagi, MD, says that chemical peels are powerful at speeding up results and removing deeper pigment. Their potency can be manipulated to suit the type and depth of pigment. However, not every skin colour is suitable for a peel, and if you have a history of scarring, you may want to find another option.
If you have discolouration from the sun, try intense pulsed light (IPL). A popular choice for targeting sun-induced discolouration, IPL involves light-based energy pulsed onto the skin while simultaneously targeting blood vessels. The light seeks out the discolouration in the skin to lift it up and out. Expect for the treated areas to turn dark and flake off in a few days. We sometimes do an IPL treatment following two laser treatments to really clean up the skin.

Home remedies for oily skin
 
Egg whites 
High in vitamin A, egg whites can effectively dry out skin blemishes as well as tone and tighten up oily skin. Whip one egg white until stiff and spread it on your skin. Allow it to dry and then wash it off with warm water. Do this twice a week.
Whip one egg white, add the juice from half a lemon and mix it well. Apply the mixture on your face, leave it on for 15 minutes and then rinse it off with warm water. This will tighten the skin and soak up excess oil.
Lemon juice 
Lemon juice is a good source of citric acid that works like an astringent. It also has antiseptic properties that can lighten skin discolorations and restore the skin’s pH balance.
Mix one teaspoon of fresh lemon juice with one-half teaspoon of distilled water. Apply it on your skin using a cotton ball. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then wash your face with warm water. Lemon juice can dry out your skin, so apply some oil-free moisturizer afterward. Do this once daily.
Mix one tablespoon of lemon juice, one-half tablespoon of honey and one tablespoon of milk. Apply this paste on your face and leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes before washing it off with cold water. If done once daily, this remedy will give you positive results within a week.
Yogurt 
Yogurt contains lactic acid that helps gently exfoliate the skin and absorbs excess oil from the face.
Apply one tablespoon of plain yogurt thoroughly over your face and leave it on for 15 minutes. Then rinse it off with cool water. Do this once daily.
Alternatively, mix one tablespoon each of organic yogurt and finely ground oatmeal. Then stir in one teaspoon of warm honey. Apply the mixture on your face. Leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes and then rinse with warm water.
Tomatoes 
Tomatoes are great for oily skin due to their cooling, clarifying and astringent properties. The high vitamin C content in tomatoes is very helpful for acne-prone skin. Plus, the natural oil-absorbing acids in tomatoes help get rid of excess oil.
 
Face masks for oily skin 
Baking soda and lemon
Baking soda is an excellent ingredient for oily and clogged skin. It helps maintain the pH balance of your skin and thus prevent breakouts. Lemon works as an antibacterial agent, preventing skin troubles and also controls oil secretion. Lemon also works as a bleaching agent to lighten skin tone.
Do not use baking soda more than once a week as it can turn your skin dry. Also, if you have a sensitive skin, do a patch test before applying it on your face.
Lemon and turmeric
This mask can be used as a natural exfoliating scrub for oily skin. The mask uses gram flour that helps slough off dead skin cells, accumulated oil, and grime from the pores. The turmeric adds antibacterial and anti-acne properties to the mask and also helps take away tanning. The milk, containing lactic acid, acts as a cleanser, and the lemon helps control oil secretion.
Banana
Bananas are not just essential for the morning energy kick but also give you healthy skin. The fruit contains vitamins A, B, E, and potassium that fight blemishes, even out skin tone, moisturize skin, and combat free radicals causing early aging. Mixed with some lemon and honey, bananas can also prevent acne by controlling natural oil secretion of your skin.
Cucumber
Cucumbers are the most inexpensive way of treating oily skin and its related troubles. Its astringent properties help tighten skin pores and remove sebum, dirt, and dead skin cells from the skin surface.
Cucumbers also contain Vitamin C that helps maintain the oil balance of your skin. Adding some lemon juice increases the oil-controlling properties of the mask.
This face pack contains Fuller’s earth clay, which works as an oil-absorbing agent. Additionally, it helps tighten the skin pores and improve the overall appearance of your face.
