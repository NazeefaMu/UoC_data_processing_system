High Tea serenades

Derrick Junkeer (Derrick J) gave the High Tea at Galadari Hotel a little something special last week when he performed for the likes of the ladies who love to spend a little afternoon chit chatting with their friends.
He was also joined on stage by Danielle Faour who was the finalist for the Victorian Championship 2014 and qualified to represent Australia in the World Talent Championships in Sweden
Derrick has been entertaining music lovers, both young and old for over 25 years and has captivated audiences with his graciousness, warmth, passion and most of all his rich and powerful vocal ability.
His musical debut in 1974 on “New Faces” with Bert Newton, earned him the Bert’s Encouragement Award, which was the opening to his very successful career as an entertainer in Australia. For over 15 years he appeared as a regular artiste on many TV shows. His music is of international standard with the backing of great musicians from the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, the ABC show band and Channel 9 band, with backup singers Patchwork from the Don Lane Show, Linda George, Penny Dyer to name a few. Presently he works as a Recording Producer and produces albums for young, up and coming artistes giving them advice on musical direction and promotion.
