Kiriella warns SLMC: Abide by court ruling

Will seek court’s intervention:
Students cannot be held hostage to the whims of GMOA, SLMC :
Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said the government would comply with the court ruling on SAITM and warned that if the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) did not adhere with a court ruling to register students from SAITM, they would have to be taken to courts.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Parliamentary Complex, the minister stressed that the students cannot be held hostage to the whims of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) and the SLMC.
The GMOA and the SLMC which had been strongly opposed to the private medical college have reasoned that the institution was not up to standard and that the medical students did not receive adequate clinical training to qualify as competent doctors.
A court ruling in 2015 allowed the students to receive their clinical training from the Awissawela Base Hospital and Kaduwela MOH but Kriella said that the students are yet to benefit from this due to intimidation from the GMOA.
“We will intervene in future with the help of the courts to ensure that the students receive proper clinical training. Dr Neville Fernando has also offered his hospital to the government on a private-public partnership”, said the Minister.
He explained that he had met SLMC, Chairman, Dr Carlo Fonseka last year and asked that the SLMC grant registration to the students who were completing their studies at SAITM if they were to pass the ACT 16 exam but Dr Fonseka had refused to consider such a request, “Now the courts have asked that they be registered without a common exam”, said Kiriella.
He added that if the SLMC agreed, the government was prepared to appeal to the courts to include the ACT 16 exam for SAITM students.
Former Minister of Higher Education, S.B. Dissanayake who also addressed the media pointed out that only 40 percent of students qualifying for medicine from the state universities were taken on merit basis, “55 percent enter through the district quota system. This means that students in remote areas could also enter the medical faculty with three passes”, said Dissanayake.
“Every year 300 students who receive three As from major towns don’t get the opportunity to do medicine. They need a place to go and they can be given scholarships”, he added.
In a scathing attack on the GMOA and SLMC, the minister said ; “The GMOA are opposed to everything. When we wanted apothecaries to have the opportunity to become doctors, they were opposed to it, when nurses wanted degrees, they opposed. They are very hypocritical”.
According to the former and present ministers of Higher Education, the government has been trying its best to attract international universities to set up medical and other campuses in the country but the persisting issue at Malabe has put them all off.
“We need competition between universities, it is then that they would improve,”Kiriella said as Dissanyake added, “Just because you open a private university, our state institutions will not fall apart. We have 4,31,000 children studying in international schools at present and they all cannot afford to go abroad. The government has to find them universities too”.
The government this year will start construction on two new medical faculties in the universities of Wayamba and Ruwanpura. They have also signed a MoU with Manipal university in India to set up a local campus.
