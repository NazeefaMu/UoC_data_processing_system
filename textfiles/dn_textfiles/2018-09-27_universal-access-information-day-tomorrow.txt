The International Day of Universal Access to Information declared by UNESCO will be celebrated at an event jointly organised by the Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment and Education Ministries at the Mount Lavinia Hotel tomorrow (28).

Addressing a press conference at the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry auditorium in Colombo yesterday, Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said nearly 50 delegates from seven countries would attend the two-day event on September 28 and 29.
The event would focus on the importance of achieving universal access to information to facilitate peace and sustainable development in the member countries.
