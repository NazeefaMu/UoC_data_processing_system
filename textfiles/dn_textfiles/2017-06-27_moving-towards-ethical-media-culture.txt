Moving towards an ethical media culture

President Maithripala Sirisena recently reiterated the importance of an ethical media culture in Sri Lanka and added that the State media should take the lead.
It is this Government’s credit that all media in Sri Lanka operate today in a peaceful environment, free of state control. They are able to sustain a pluralist media culture without obstacles. In our unique media market, it is often contended that the proliferation of publications, radio stations, television channels, and internet websites is a sure-fire guarantor for plurality, diversity, and media freedom.
Despite these impressive numbers for a small country, for a long period, the mass media in Sri Lanka were dominated by a small group, which exercised considerable influence on what was read, heard, and watched.
Sri Lanka’s established private media conglomerates have staunchly refused to accept the need for some restrictions over ownership and control, arguing that this would eventually result in devious and dubious forms of censorship. The government too had played along. After all, powerful politicians needed media barons as much as they need them – a mutually beneficial arrangement.
However, the reality is that a group of political and economic elites still exercise a pervasive influence on media and journalism.Many people, not only those in authority but even ordinary people, have started saying that the media have become irresponsible and wayward, and need to be reined in.
Defects
There are a number of obvious defects in our media. One is that the media often twist facts. We have seen in innumerable occasions how news was manipulated. It could have been the Government or the owners. We saw how “truth” conflicted with other social values. We also saw how the sensitive government or military information were revealed by some media during times of disturbances.
Our media often forget about privacy. Salacious details of the lives of public figures is a central content element in many media. Publication is not necessarily justified simply because the information is true. Privacy is also a right, and one which conflicts with free speech.
Fantasy is an element of entertainment, which is a legitimate goal of media content. Our journalism sometimes mixed fantasy and truth, with resulting ethical dilemmas. Photo journalists who cover war and disasters confront situations which may shock the sensitivities of their audiences. For example, human remains are rarely screened. The ethical issue is how far should one risk shocking an audience’s sensitivities in order to correctly and fully report the truth.
Another identifiable defect is that our media often portray non-issues as real issues, while the real issues are side-lined.
Freedom
The freedom of the media is guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka which gives every citizen the freedom of speech and expression including publication. However, no freedom can be absolute, and reasonable restrictions can be placed on it.
The audiences of media, whether readers, listeners or viewers, expect the media is to provide them truthful and objective information that will enable them to form rational opinions, which is a sine qua non in a democracy. But are the Sri Lankan media performing this role properly?
Dark days
Most of us remember the days when our media were technically under complete state control. Those were the days when the conditions for independent journalism were compromised by a toxic political environment, combined with suppressed civil society institutions which rendered media vulnerable to corrupt relations with different centres of power.
Media were used as foot-soldiers for the war mongering of ethno-national political elites during the LTTE war period. They contributed to the polarisation of communities, the demonization of other ethnic groups and finally to the justification of violence against the “other”. To this day, there is no common moral condemnation of inadmissible media practices prior and during the conflict.Even today, the problems of hate-speech and lack of commitment to ethical standards of accuracy, impartiality and transparency in journalism remain in place.
Self-regulation
Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka believes self-regulation works and, therefore, the best solution to overcome these issues. Not surprisingly, independent self-regulation of media is a challenge across all platforms of journalism. Much of the responsibility is borne by Sri Lanka Press Institute, Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka, The Dispute Resolution Council, The Editors’ Guild, all of which have been created by and are maintained thanks to support from the public funds.
Although all groups say there is a better general awareness and knowledge about the role and work of these bodies, when it comes to respect for codes of conduct, issues of defamation, privacy and journalistic reporting, serious problems still remain.
This writer also feels that some of the stories published and broadcasted by our media are overplayed – more are made of them than seemed really justified. Credibility is a very essential necessity to media enterprises. It is for their own survival that they need to safeguard it.
Ethical practice
Given this scenario, it is obvious that there is a need to strengthen ethical practice among the media personnel, and particularly within the print and TV media where the scourge of sensationalism and unethical practice dominates.
With this in mind, this writer would like to suggest that we initiate an Ethical Journalism Council, an independent body which can prepare guidelines and proposals for helping media to improve the way they work. Such guidelines would help media develop a self-reporting system to ensure they have good governance in their management as well as respect for ethics, self-regulation and transparency in their editorial work.
An Ethical Journalism Council can strengthen the craft of journalism and promote for the public benefit high ethical standards, based on principles of truth and accuracy, impartiality and accountability by the provision of education and training.
Social media
It is estimated there are over 100 online news web portals in Sri Lanka of which, perhaps only 10 per cent are open about their ownership.
A lack of transparency both in ownership and political links with most portals tied in with some branch of the political community. A widespread tendency exists towards fake stories. Editorial material is not fact-checked and is often just cut and pasted from, non-attributed sources.
There is an urgent need for the drafting of social media guidelines to encourage online media enterprises to adopt a self-reporting system to improve their internal standards of governance and editorial performance.
Such initiative could help people in Sri Lanka understand that there are two kinds of journalism. One track is that of unregulated and unethical online reporting and the other is the work of trusted brands based on ethics and standards.
New initiatives
The free media landscape in Sri Lanka is still not up to mark. It suffers from weak economic conditions, undue pressure from the political ownership and a lack of commitment within media circles to core values of journalism and ethical standards.
There is a need for new initiatives to develop more transparency and commitment to professionalism on all platforms of journalism and particularly to highlight the distinctive nature of trusted channels which show attachment to ethics, good governance and self-regulation.
The absence of internal systems for monitoring and auditing editorial performance and governance at the level of the media enterprise is noted across the whole of the Sri Lankan media landscape. The Press Council should be invited to support programmes aimed at strengthening internal standards of good governance and ethics at enterprise level.
The ethical audits and the adoption of new guidelines by media enterprises should be further developed and implemented. The use of the mechanisms for self-regulation and good governance at enterprise level and at industry level can help to identify media on all platforms that follow core standards of journalism and accountability to the public at large.
Where such media are identified there should be consideration of how to provide additional funding and resources to strengthen newsroom capacity without compromising editorial independence.
