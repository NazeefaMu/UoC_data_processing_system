Soaring notes

Unassuming and talented Ridma Dhananjaya Weerawardena has forged warm relationships in his life. This coupled with his talent for singing has given him a solid foundation. Melodies features Weerawardena who is courageous enough to be himself.
“I think one reason that I have got to where I am now is because of the company I keep. I have surrounded myself with amazing people who have stood by me. They are positive and we are all on the same page. I am also a patient person who is tolerant and appreciative when it comes to those who are closet to me. This is the reason I think I have done well in the industry. This is where I have got my optimism,” said Weerawardena.
Weerawardena is never afraid to be unique. He is an individual who delves into areas of music that has allowed him to come up with diverse and original creations. He calls his music – ‘Experimental’. One reason people listen to his music is the fact that he is an artiste who has a flair for originality.
One other reason that he is in the industry is because of the healing power of music. All music can heal and that is the amazing thing about it. Steven Tyler is best known as the lead singer of the Boston-based rock band Aerosmith, in which he also plays the harmonica, piano, and percussion. He is known as the "Demon of Screaming '"due to his high screams and his wide vocal range. Even this can heal! The Demon of Screaming can also heal. So can Bon Jovi and so can Madonna. Music is a totally personal thing and works differently for everyone.
“I love the fact that music heals. It lifts you up and through the music I am healed and I am able to heal those who listen to me music. Music has always been a part of society because of this healing aspect,” said Weerawardena
Weerawardena does covers mainly in in Hindi or Tamil. He already has seven originals. Stepping out of the comfort zone is never an issue for this young man. He was born to step out of his comfort zone. His is all about being himself. His first music video for the song ‘Soya Awa’ is a good example of this.
Weerawardena as mentioned before is never in a rush. He maintains his composure. He is calm in the face of any occurrence. He understands that every finger in the hand in different. He believes that to create something beautiful you need to be yourself and not a copy of someone else.
“I have big plans ahead. I just finished a Tamil original track. I am hoping to release it soon. Indian music inspires me. My message to anyone who wants to do music or even for that matter anyone who wants to succeed in life is that patience is the key. Everyone's pace is different, so take your time. And also focus on making an honest production that you'd enjoy yourself rather than try hard to make a hit song,” explains Weerawardena
He has met his share of challenges in life. Music is not a field that many consider ‘safe’ in Sri Lanka. Yet nothing could stop him from pursuing his calling in life. He knows who he is now. He knows what he wants. And he is doing well.
“Music isn't considered a viable career in certain sections of society but as something that could be done as a passion/hobby rather than professionally. This was something that restricted me in many forms, mostly mentally,” added Weerawardena
Warm relationships have sustained him through his life. He is inspired by those who genuinely care for him. He is honest to others and more importantly honest to himself. And he has no intention of stopping his remarkable journey in life
“My beloved friend Imran, who is no more, was the one who convinced me of my true potential. I owe a lot to him. He was, is and will always be an inspiration. Internationally I am inspired by A R Rahman, for simply being an arthouse of talent with his diversity. Locally I am inspired by Amarasiri Peiris, for that mesmerizing voice of his,” said Weerawardena.
Weerawardena calls himself a relaxed and chilled person. He is a man who is at ease with the world. He has many accomplishments and the future is bright for him.
“Well the few shows I did with Wayo were probably the best. Special Thanks to Sangeeth Wijesuriya of Wayo for giving a newcomer like me a platform to perform my own songs on stage for the first time. Performing at a wedding in India, singing in Hindi made me very happy and. Recording the first few songs was a nice memory. I think my journey has been a result of team work. I'd wish to thank Charitha Attalage and Ranil Goonawardena for giving their best, and all the lyricists, mainly Chandrasena Thalangama for beautiful words and my family and all my well- wishers. Thank you for welcoming me,” said Weerawardena.
