SPC vice Chairman says, there is a move to arrest some council members

At a meeting held at the Southern Provincial Council yesterday, vice Chairman Sampath Athukorala said there were moves to arrest some council members during the next few days and added that if such a thing is in the offing it should be done only after informing the Chief Minister about it.
He said these arrests are to be made in connection with the tense situation experienced in Hambantota recently.
Chairman Somawansa Kodagoda who presided said the request would be duly forwarded to the Southern Province DIG.
