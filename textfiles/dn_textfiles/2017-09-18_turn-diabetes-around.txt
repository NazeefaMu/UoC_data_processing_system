Turn diabetes around

New research shows Type 2 diabetes can be reversed by going on a low calorie diet.
Type 2 diabetes is caused by having too much glucose in the blood because the body’s way of turning it into energy is not working properly. As the condition progresses, sufferers often need to maintain a healthy diet, exercise and a combination of medications to manage it.
Controlling blood sugar levels are also considered to be the key to reducing the risk of life-changing complications for those already diagnosed. Someone’s life expectancy with type 2 diabetes is likely to be reduced as a result of the condition, by up to 10 years.
Consuming just 600 calories a day for eight weeks can save the lives of millions of sufferers of the preventable condition.
Newcastle University scientists said that excess calories lead to a fatty liver, which causes the liver to produce too much glucose. The excess fat is then passed to the pancreas, which causes the insulin-producing cells to fail and thus causing diabetes. The researchers found that losing less than one gram of fat from the pancreas can re-start insulin production, reversing type 2 diabetes.
This reversal of diabetes remains possible for at least ten years after the onset of the condition, lead author Professor Roy Taylor said.
Such a diet helps bring about 15kg of weight loss on average. Weight loss has long been known to help reverse the condition. The study showed results within just a week of starting the diet. It caused a profound fall in insulin sensitivity.
Fasting blood sugar levels of diabetes patients, which were significantly higher, became normal within the same time frame.
Often thought of as harmless, type 2 diabetes is a hidden killer and can lead to heart failure, blindness, kidney disease and leg amputations.
