A future sans fossil fuel

All over Sri Lanka, while drivers of petrol and diesel vehicles were languishing for hours in long queues near filling stations, electric car owners were seen driving by with a smile. This may seem to be a simple observation, but the reality should hit us hard – the world is going to run out of fossil fuel possibly within the next 100 years and we should move on to alternatives.
While we spend a staggering US$ 6 billion a year to import oil and debate about a fuel workers’ strike, other countries are already thinking 20-30 years ahead, to a future sans diesel and petrol vehicles. Both UK and France plan to ban sales of all diesel and petrol vehicles by 2040. The objective is two-fold – save on fossil fuels and ensure better air quality as electric and fuel cell cars are non-polluting.
In addition to the diesel and petrol ban, the proposal will include a fund to help local councils reduce emissions through measures such as retrofitting buses, reprogramming traffic lights, and changing road layouts. Similar programmes are under consideration in the Netherlands and Germany.
The air quality in Sri Lanka is not so bad yet, but we are getting there as more vehicles enter the roads every day. But in the long term, we should be even more concerned about the fuel issue. The time to think is now. Do we spend more and more every year on fossil fuel or do we move into alternative sources of energy, both for vehicles and electricity generation? The choice is crystal clear.
But our problem is living by the day, without pondering on the future. The year 2040 is less than 25 years away – but do we have an energy policy which looks just 25 years into the future? The simple answer is ‘no’. Tax and duty policies on hybrid and electric vehicles have fluctuated so wildly over the last 10 years that most people are actually reluctant to put down money on importing such a car. We should have clear cut policies on the import of hybrid and electric cars that will not change at least for the next five years. This will boost the confidence of buyers. The manufacture, import and use of hybrids and electrics should be encouraged as a means of saving on fossil fuels.
There is a concern that having more all-electric cars on our roads would actually work negatively, because these are charged off the national grid, which in turn depends mostly on fossil fuel. This happens to be true. Hence the decision to increase the taxes and duties on all-electric cars. This is why we have to think of moving away from fossil fuels for electricity generation by focusing on renewable energy options such as wind and solar. Sri Lanka is located in an ideal position for both these types of renewable energy. The Government’s recent announcements on new solar and wind power plants are therefore encouraging.
In the meantime, the Government should consider tax and duty waivers for solar powered charging units for electric cars at least until the renewable energy component of the national grid reaches 30-40 percent. Most electric car batteries will soon be able to light up a whole house once the car is parked overnight in the garage, thereby lessening the burden on the national grid. There should be a gradual decrease in duties on electric cars and hydrogen fuel cell cars (the latter will be commonplace 15 years from now). Just imagine the fuel savings if at least 30 percent of the vehicles on the roads were hybrids and electrics. It is also vital to plan for a public transport fleet that runs on alternative fuels and entices the motorists to come on board.
If you scanned the fuel queues carefully, it was very obvious that three wheelers dominated them. This newspaper has time and again called for the gradual phasing out of this fundamentally unsafe vehicle by at least 2030. After all, three wheelers are responsible for, or involved in, the majority of accidents reported countrywide.
From a purely political viewpoint any move to limit three wheelers may be unpopular, but the three wheeler market is already saturated with over 1.2 million in circulation. The best alternative is to slash duties on sub-1,000 CC cars and increase duties on three wheelers to the point where buying one is simply not worth it. We need a safe, reliable taxi service in Colombo and elsewhere, but the tuk-tuk is simply not an option as the Government moves ahead with the Megapolis plan.
We also need to move on with the times. Driverless and intelligent cars are coming and we should be ready for them. Some cars already have limited autonomous driving functions. In the near future, cars will be able to interact with road signs, traffic lights and with each other which will help reduce accidents and smoothen the traffic flow. The future is already happening in this sphere and the time has come to plan ahead.
