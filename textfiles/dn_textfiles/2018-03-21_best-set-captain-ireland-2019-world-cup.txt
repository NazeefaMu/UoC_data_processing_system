Best set to captain Ireland at 2019 World Cup

DUBLIN March20: Rory Best, fresh from becoming only the third man to lead Ireland to a Five/Six Nations Grand Slam, looks set to captain them at the 2019 World Cup after signing a new contract on Tuesday.
The Northern Irishman -- who won his 111th Test cap in skippering the Irish to a convincing win over England on Saturday at Twickenham to seal the Grand Slam -- agreed an extension that will see him through to the end of Ireland’s campaign in Japan next year when he will be 37.
Inspirational fullback Rob Kearney also signed a new contract up to the end of the sport’s quadrennial showpiece event.
That duo were swiftly followed by Best’s Ulster team-mate the 26-year-old 38-times capped second row forward Iain Henderson, who has committed himself to both his province and Ireland till June 2021.
Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt had joked after the England game that Best was “certainly getting faster on his Zimmer frame on the pitch”.
“I am in a very privileged position as captain of Ireland and Ulster to be involved with two groups of incredibly talented players,” said Best, who also captained the midweek British and Irish Lions team on the tour of New Zealand last year.
“I feel I can continue to make a contribution to both Ireland and Ulster Rugby and am delighted to have extended my IRFU contract to the next World Cup.” IRFU Performance Director David Nucifora said Best, who has been captain since the 2016 Six Nations after Paul O’Connell retired from Test rugby, fully deserved his new contract.
“Rory has been an outstanding leader for Ireland and continues to produce standout performances at the highest level of the game,” Nucifora said in a statement issued by the IRFU. AFP
