'Education sector will see radical changes in the near future'

Steps have been taken to create a radical change in the Education Sector within the next three years, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
Concurrent to the nine main subjects, 26 new subjects have been introduced for students who fail the GCE Ordinary Level examination. These vocational subjects will carry them forward not only to advanced level, but for university education as well. The pilot project of this programme will be started in 42 schools from October 2. All students who cannot proceed to Advanced Level would be provided with technical education within their schools themselves. Steps have already been taken to provide computes to all schools above grade 6 level. Similarly, Information Technology will be made a compulsory subject, he said.
Minister Kariyawasam was addressing a meeting after opening a new administration building costing Rs. 50 million at Matale St. Thomas’ College, recently.
Minister Kariyawasam said opponents were accusing them of destroying free education. "Would the government provide insurance cover upto over Rs. 500,000 to schoolchildren numbering 4.5 million if it was intent on destroying free education?" he said.
A student would be paid Rs. 1,000 per day if he or she obtained treatment in a government hospital and upto Rs. 100,000 in case of a private hospital.
Minister Kariyawasam said English text books would be provided in respect of grades 1 and 2 from next year. Another new 15,000 teacher appointments would be made before the end of this year. Already 4,000 principals had been appointed.
A group of 852 administration-grade principals had also been appointed. Applications would be called soon to fill all existing vacancies in the education sector by December this year. Agriculture State Minister Vasantha Aluvihare, Parliamentarians Ranjith Aluvihare and Matale Zonal Director of Education Mahinda S. Yapa were also present on the occasion.
