HSBC commences seasonal campaign ‘creators of Cheer’

With the festive season fast approaching, HSBC has already begun to spread some holiday cheer by rolling out a meaningful seasonal campaign #creator of cheer. The campaign offers a plethora of seasonal offers that enables cardholders to be the creators of cheer for their family and friends, during Christmas.
Throughout the campaign period that is valid until December 31, cardholders can delight their family, friends and loved ones with amazing savings of up to 50% across the most essential shopping categories such as supermarket, dining, clothing, electronics, telecommunications, lodging, travel, jewellery and many more.
Nadeesha Senaratne, Country Head of Retail Banking & Wealth Management said, “As the leading international bank in Sri Lanka, HSBC has always been passionate about spreading good cheer during the most celebrated time of the year; Christmas. We understand that it’s a time where expenses can get high with gift giving which is a main part of the season and entertaining family and friends.”
Gift giving is one of the main traditions during Christmas and shopping for various gifts can sometimes become a strain financially and mentally. HSBC aims to make this old tradition more enjoyable, affordable and convenient for cardholders, by offering fabulous savings across a number of local and international branded clothing stores in the country.
There will also be super weekends for discerning shoppers with some added retail therapy with exclusive offers at Odel, Hameedias, Cool Planet, House of Fashions, Fashion Bug, Galleria, Cotton Collection and a choice of many other brands during the season. As families come together to celebrate the festive cheer, HSBC will help facilitate these celebrations with holiday shopping deals at Arpico Supercentre, Super Stores and Daily Outlets from 16 November until 31 December 2018.
Be it dining out, HSBC has partnered with a number of restaurants to give cardholders the choice to dine at their favourite restaurants and hotels starting with dining deals as low as 1 rupee.
December will also mark the arrival of Benny Andersson& Bjorn Ulvaeus’ smash hit music Mamma Mia! to Sri Lanka and HSBC credit cardholders will have the privilege to sing a- long with their family and friends to this world famous broadway musical that is set to take stage at the NelumPokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre from December 22-30.
