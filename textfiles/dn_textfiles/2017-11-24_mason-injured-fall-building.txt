Mason injured in fall from building

A mason working on the upper floor of a high rise building in Hatton town, fell off the building and got in contact with a high voltage electricity line before falling to the ground.
He was rushed to the Kandy Teaching Hospital in a serious condition and is now warded at the ICU. He was identified as S. Priyantha, a father of two of Ketapulawa, Nawalapitiya. Secretary of the Hatton Dickoya UC Ms. S. Priyadarshanee said the building is an unauthorised one and the owner had been noticed to stop construction work. But work had been continuing ignoring the halt order.
The injured mason received initial treatment at the Dickoya hospital before being rushed to Kandy Hospital.
