Dwarf family

A rare genetic condition has made nine of the 11 members of a family dwarfs. Ram Raj Chauhan’s clan once consisted of 21 people - 18 of whom suffered from a genetic condition called Achondroplasia which causes short limbed dwarfism.
Achondroplasia is the most common form of disproportionate dwarfism, and is characterised by a normal sized torso and short limbs.
Ram Raj, 52, originally had seven sisters and four brothers, with eight of the 11 siblings suffering from the condition. But some of them have passed away, including his elder brother, Prithvi Raj.
Ram Raj now lives with ten of his family members in the Old City in Hyderabad, India. Nine of them have the condition, making them the largest dwarf family in the city.
Their condition attracts a lot of attention, much of it unwanted. Curious looks, verbal jibes and taunts are a common occurrence when the family steps out.
Ram Raj explained: “If we go out, people crowd around us and ask us strange questions like, ‘Why are you so short?’, ‘Where are you from?’. Everyone teases us.”
There are health issues as well. Due to the shortness of their legs, walking can become a problem.
Ram Raj explained: “After a certain age, the legs become weak. I have seen my grand father and my father face this, but they still managed to walk properly. But I have difficulty in walking and my younger brother can’t walk without help. Same with two of my sisters.”
Ram Raj works as a ‘Marriage Welcomer’, where he dresses up and welcomes guests to weddings, but finding employment has proved challenging for the family.
He said: “No-one was willing to give me a job. I have faced a lot of problems because people look at me and say, ‘How will you manage?’ I work at my relative’s grocery store when I don’t have the wedding work to do.”
His 27-year-old daughter Ambika wants to be an accountant but as she also suffers from this condition, she has also found it difficult to find work.
She said: “In the future I want to become an accountant but this will only be possible if I’m able to get a job. People tell me that because I’m short, that’s why I’m unable to get a job.”
The other members of the family who are of short stature, including Ram Raj’s brothers and sisters, also find it very difficult to get steady work.
He said: “My younger brother works in a telephone booth and my elder brother’s wife is a tailor. We manage this way.”
Ram Raj believes life is particularly tough for the females in his family.
He said: “It is still ok for the male members of the family. But what about the women in my family who have this condition? Life is much more difficult for them.”
Ram Raj’s wife was of normal height but sadly passed away in 1993 while she was seven months pregnant with their third child.
Ram Raj says that even though people laugh at them, and the condition makes it difficult to travel, get married and lead a regular life, the family believes God has given them this condition because they are special.
He said: “My father once said that this is the dwarf incarnation of the Lord. People may laugh, but we shouldn’t feel bad about it.”
“So many people have teased me and other members of the family. But if someone is sad and, by looking at us they get to laugh, it’s God’s will that we are the ones making them laugh.”
“I have two daughters,” says Ram Raj. “I try and make them understand by saying that this is their duty. And you can make it work. God is with you.” Mirror
