Direct2Door eyes Colombo takeover

Since its start as a convenience service delivering vegetables to homes in selected neighborhoods of Colombo, Direct2Door has grown significantly over a very short time frame, with the service now available across the entirety of the Colombo district.
This is mainly in service of Direct2Door's true calling to become an all-encompassing household concierge service from which Sri Lankan households can source each and every product via a single access point.
Direct2Door's growth plan has proven so successful that the seed funding it initially secured over the last few months has directly translated into a 7x increase in monthly revenue.
Direct2Door is a delivery solution, with the platform itself being able to connect and add value to both customers and vendors in many different and unique ways.
“We try to be one step ahead when it comes to understanding our customers specific requirement, we study and analyze their buying patterns and preference and give special offers accordingly”, reveals Direct2Door CEO Prashanth Premakumar.
From its beginnings in 2016, the two young and entrepreneurial co-founders, Prashanth Premakumar and Thibadharshan Kandiah, first established an excellent convenience service providing weekly vegetables deliveries to households in Colombo, Direct2Door has expanded its capabilities and offerings quite significantly, now delivering in and around Colombo.
Direct2Door is also creating significant social impact since it works mainly with small time vendors based out of National Markets.
Following Direct2Door having won 2nd runner-up at the coveted Venture Engine 2016, the platform has also attracted significant seed funding from well-respected Angel investors from the Lankan Angel Network, including Ruwindhu Peiris, Arj Wignaraja and Dr. Kumudu Gunasekara.
