Undergrads should make best use of free education: Sagala

Some trying to ruin higher education:
University students are duty bound to well utilise public funds allocated annually for higher education, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayaka said.
The minister was addressing the media at Srikotha yesterday.
“Undergraduates should make the best use of free education without merely shouting slogans of protecting free education. Free education has been made available with public funds,” he said.
The funds allocated for the medical education sector are not utilised since medical students are refraining from attending lectures for nearly one year over the SAITM issue. He said some parties are trying to ruin the higher education sector for political gains.
“There is a conspiracy to destroy higher education. Undergraduates have become cat-paws of the conspiracy,” Minister Rathnayaka said.
Speaking on the unruly behaviour of the undergraduates who were storming into the Health Ministry recently, the minister said there is a political motive behind the incident.
“The activities of undergraduates against SAITM are backed by the Peratugami Party, while a few other parties are fuelling the fire,” he said.
The minister said Police had to involve in the case to protect physical and human resources of the ministry.
