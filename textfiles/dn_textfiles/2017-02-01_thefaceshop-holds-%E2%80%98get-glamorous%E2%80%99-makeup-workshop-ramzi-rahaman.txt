THEFACESHOP holds  ‘Get Glamorous’ makeup workshop with Ramzi Rahaman

THEFACESHOP recently held the “Get Glamorous” makeup and beauty workshop on December 17, at the Colombo Racecourse.
This workshop featured a makeup and beauty tutorial conducted by Ramzi Rahaman, one of the leading names in Sri Lanka’s beauty industry as well as the founding member of Sri Lanka Association of Hairdressers and Beauticians (SLAHAB).
The primary aim of the Get Glamorous workshop by THEFACESHOP was to demonstrate how consumers can create everyday makeup looks that will truly enhance their natural beauty.
Ramzi started off the workshop by instructing the audience on how to correctly prepare their skin for the application of makeup with THEFACESHOP Chia Seed Cleansing Foam, Chia Seed Soothing Mist Toner, and Mango Seed Silk Moisture Lotion.
He then proceeded to demonstrate an elegant makeup look using THEFACESHOP cosmetic range that can be easily recreated by the audience for any festive season.
Ramzi also showcased how to give oneself the perfect manicure at home using THEFACESHOP Gel Touch Nail Polish range that possesses a unique formula which requires just one coat to keep nails glistening and strong. With Gel Touch Nail polish, customers can enjoy smoother application with longer lasting and chip free nail colour.
This event attracted many customers who were interested in acquiring tips on how to improve their everyday makeup and beauty looks with THEFACESHOP product range.
Each participant received a complimentary make up bag as well as a 20% off voucher for any THEFACESHOP purchases made on that day.
