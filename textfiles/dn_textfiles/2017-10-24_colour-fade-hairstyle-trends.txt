Colour fade  hairstyle  trends

While rainbow hair colour was big last year, this year, the colour fade or dip-dye hairstyle is touted to be the next big trend. And what’s more? It isn’t just popular amongst teenagers, but women of all age groups.
What is it all about?
Instead of colouring your entire mane, you can either dye the ends of your hair with a light shade to create an ombre look or if you are bold enough, go a step further and colour the hair ends with a bright or a muted hue. To make your search easier, we suggest some looks you can easily try out, without feeling uncomfortable.
How to take care of your colour faded hair
Once you’ve colour faded your hair, you need to take special care. Here are a few points to remember:
t Choose a specially formulated shampoo and conditioner for damaged, bleached or coloured hair.
t Make sure to do a deep conditioning treatment every week, to keep your hair healthy and strong.
t Moisturising and strengthening your hair is essential to prevent damage to the hair ends. Deccan Chronicle
