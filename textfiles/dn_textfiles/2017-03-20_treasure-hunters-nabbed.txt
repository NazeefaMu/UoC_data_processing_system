Treasure hunters nabbed

A retired Air Force officer and three others who went treasure hunting to unearth riches which one of them had seen in his dreams were arrested by the Police.
The retired officer, a Kattadiya (Exorcist), and two others which included the land owner where the treasure is said to be buried in the Kalattewa area, Anuradhapura, were caught in the act. The landowner in Kalattewa is said to have seen the buried treasure in his dreams and had sought the help of the retired Air Force office to unearth it.
According to the Police, they had dug several holes in the land but had failed to unearth any treasure. The suspects had been nabbed with the equipment they had used in the treasure hunting.
Investigating are continuing.
