Policy document for mixed electoral system approved

The policy document presented by Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils Faiszer Musthapha, to have a mixed electoral system for all elections, was approved yesterday.
Minister Musthapha, speaking to the Daily News, said that Cabinet had asked that a committee be appointed to look into the preparation of draft legislation. The committee will look to views from all party leaders and the Elections commissioner.
The proposal was approved without objection. It is only Local Government bodies at present, which follow a mixed system which consists of 60 percent from the First-Past-the-Post (FPP) system and 40 percent from the Proportional Representation (PR) system.
The special Cabinet meeting which was convened yesterday was reportedly a short one and had only discussed the above proposal. The usual Cabinet meeting scheduled on Tuesdays has been postponed to next week.
