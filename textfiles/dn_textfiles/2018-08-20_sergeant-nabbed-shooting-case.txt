Sergeant nabbed in shooting case

A Police Sergeant who had allegedly shot a woman in Kelesgamuwa, Millaniya, was arrested recently.
The victim, 50-year-old Sunanda Perera, was admitted to the Colombo National Hospital by her children after she had sustained a gunshot wound on August 13.
Investigations revealed that the woman and her husband were separated, while the sergeant, a father of two, had been continuing an illicit affair with her.
The suspect had allegedly shot the woman following an argument at her house. He was to be produced at the Horana Magistrate’s Court.
