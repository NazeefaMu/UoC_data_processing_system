Januka to lead Lankan team at inaugural HSBC Inte’l Junior Golf C’ship

The Sri Lanka Golf Union, the national body for Golf in Sri Lanka together with HSBC will host the first ever international junior golf championship to be played among the countries in the region, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and
Bangladesh. Unfortunately the Indian contingent had to withdraw at the last minute due to unavoidable circumstances. The Indian Golf Union has however conveyed their best wishes for the tournament as it is the only one of its kind to be played in the region. The event which creates a platform for our juniors to compete among the best in the Indian sub-continent was the brainchild of the Sri Lanka Golf Union (SLGU) – Junior Sub Committee and
was conceived with the singular aim of raising the standard of the sport in the country.
Each of the countries will field a team comprising 4 boys and 2 girls. The event will be conducted by the Sri Lanka Golf Union (SLGU) and the format structured on a hybrid version of similar international team events played
worldwide such as Asia Pacific Golf Team Championship and the Ryder Cup in the USA.
After much deliberation the Sri Lanka team was selected by the national golf selectors headed by Captain Navin De Silva. Experienced Januka Dilshan of Susumayawardana College and Sri Lanka Junior Open 2015 winner has been named the captain of the six member team. The team also comprises 16-year-old Vinod Weerasinghe of the British School who is the currently ranked no.1 nationally and has many accolades to his credit such as winning the Sri Lanka Junior Match Play Championship 2016 and Sri Lanka Junior Open 2016 winner.
