Five more suspects have been arrested by the Police in connection with the protest held in Hambantota on October 06.
Among those arrested were two persons from Suriyawewa and three from Sevanagala. Four arrested persons were produced before the Hambantota Magistrate's Court and were remanded till the 16th of this month.
The Police used tear gas to disperse the protestors as they attempted to enter the Indian Consulate premises in Hambantota during the protest on October 06.
Twenty-eight persons were arrested earlier and remanded following the incident.
The Police said that suspects were arrested for unruly behaviour and damaging public property.
The protest was against a proposed joint development venture by the government with overseas stakeholders from China and India to develop the Mattala Airport and the Hambantota port.
Meanwhile, the Police also summoned Namal Rajapaksa MP and several other politicians affiliated to the Joint Opposition in connection with the incident.
The protest was held despite a restraining order by the Hambantota Magistrate Court against it.
