Sri Lanka offers cash for stripped ground staff

Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket Wednesday offered cash and new clothes to temporary groundsmen who were forced to hand in the uniforms they were wearing before being paid their wages.
Dozens of casual labourers left the Hambantota international cricket stadium on Monday night in their underwear after they were forced to hand back the uniforms they had been provided.
"The way they were treated is unacceptable and I have ordered that they be given a new set of clothes plus an extra day's wages," board chief Thilanga Sumathipala said. "It is inhuman and slavery."
Soon after the news broke on Tuesday, the board had issued a formal apology.
Sumathipala said an investigation was under way and those responsible would be dealt with. AFP
