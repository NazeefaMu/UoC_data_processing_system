Gem, jewellery exporters discuss issues

Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne promised to resolve the problems confronted by gem and jewellery exporters after making representations to President Maithripala Sirisena about them shortly.
The Minister gave this assurance at a meeting held with a delegation of the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association at his Ministry recently. The delegates pointed out that the withdrawal of the tax concession of profits earned by gem and jewellery exports and the 0.5 service charge imposed by the National Gem and Jewellery Authority were serious impediments for their industry. They pointed out that the withdrawal of the tax concession resulted in the loss of nearly US$ 500 million annually.
The delegates also pointed out that increase of customs duty on gold imports had adversely affected the jewellery industry. The Minister told the delegates that he would brief the President about the problems raised and try to obtain some remedial action.
