Plea to  conserve  Adam’s  Peak

Although the Adam’s Peak is the third highest mountain in the central mountain range, when we consider its’ economic, social, environmental and cultural impact on Sri Lanka, we can consider indubitable, it is the most important mountain in our country. It is a famous religious place among the general public, because of the keen interest in worshiping the holy foot print, and thousands of people belonging to various religions visit this place. Therefore, it gives an invincible contribution to the religious co-existence. However, this interest among visitors leads to serious garbage issue which adversely affects the natural beauty of Adam’s Peak. If this issue continues, destruction of Adam’s Peak is in near future.
“Adam’s Peak is one of the Sri Lankan identities. It makes a great contribution in developing the country’s economic, social and cultural dynamics.
Mahaweli Kalani 
Walawe Kalu yana ganga
Samanala kanda mudune 
sita penanenga
Bawum thenithala 
hel atharin ringa
Mewa galai mini 
keta diyayata hanga
The above-mentioned poem which has been very familiar since our childhood, gives us a sense of hydrological importance of Adam’s Peak. Think a little further; what are the consequences that will arise if we lose those catchment areas? How will it impact on our agro economy, generating hydro power and all the other industries which are based their daily tasks with water? Furthermore, we can expect a social, cultural and aesthetic development properly when we have advancement in our economy only. As an artist, that’s the main reason I joined here. ‘Sri Pada’ or Adam’s peak has its own conjunctive art and culture. If the Adam’s Peak begins to destruct; all the other factors evade along with it. The Adam’s Peak is also known as one of the largest and least disturbed remaining areas of the submontane and montane rain forests of Sri Lanka, which are a global conservation priority on many accounts. That is the reason which United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization has recognized three mountains in the central mountain range including Adam’s Peak as a world heritage. That forest includes flora and fauna from which are unique. Therefore, protecting this heritage is a responsibility of our nation” said the musician, composer Edward Jayakodi.

“While being on the pilgrimage, our fraternal communities dispose their garbage on this religious place viciously. As an artist who represents the younger generation, I have the urge to shoulder this national responsibility. Youngsters are capable of handling challenges, and my intention is to get together with the young generation to protect Adam’s Peak. Therefore, joining with the great musician Edward Jayakodi, created a song ‘Asiri Surakimu Samanala’,” musician Sanka Dineth said. “We invite you all to join individually or as volunteer groups with our social media network and our web site www.savesripada.lk to pledge to save Adam’s Peak. You can also join our campaigns which will be held on December 29, January 12 and 20 with the co-ordination of state organizations,” Sanka Dineth added.
Link Natural Products Corporate Social Responsibility Manager Priyantha Kolonnage says the company has taken the leadership in this endeavor for several years.
“We have been providing Link Samahan and S P balm for those who are on pilgrimage to Adam’s Peak over six years. However, this time we have decided to go beyond our normal CSR and have decided to initiate garbage collection and to create awareness to avoid garbage dumping in the religious land. By using waste materials, they can create new products and at the same time we can minimize the environmental pollution. We encourage volunteers to join us,” Kolonnage added.
