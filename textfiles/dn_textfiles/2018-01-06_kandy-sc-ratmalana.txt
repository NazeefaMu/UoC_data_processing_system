KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP
Kandy SC at Ratmalana

A side that was tipped to comfortably win their eighth encounter Kandy S.C will be pursuing a far better performance than what they dished out in their earlier games. They will be with some real momentum and have some stars in their team. If they get enough ball, they could go really well. Everyone who goes for Kandy SC matches like their play, their rugby makes spectators to enjoy the game. Their pack is strong and rugby nowadays is all about the three Ps - pace, power, physical fitness. So, in today’s game Kandy SC are the strong favourites against Air Force. It will be difficult for the Airmen to surprise Kandy, who within themselves, will feel they are good enough to win this game. The Airmen last season beat Kandy SC in the first game at the same venue and will keep hoping to repeat that success. Kandy who enjoys a better track record, will be eager to take the upper hand. Their fitness is a big thing, they always pride of being fit and that’s why in tight games they come out on top.
Appeal to Sports Minister
The sporting fraternity of Kandy wants to appeal to the Sports Minister to look into the shortcomings of sports in Kandy. Sports in Kandy play a significant part in the lives of the folks living in the hill country. Kandy is represented by all races in the island, Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils, Burghers and Malays. Rugby is the most popular sport in the central hills at school and club level and also cricket and hockey at school level. Kandy has produced many national captains at cricket, rugby, athletes, football and hockey. Today most of the state schools lack funds to equip themselves and also no proper playing fields. Rugby is the most popular sport and crowd-pulling game. This is because Kandy SC is the one and only club from out of Colombo playing the game at it’s highest level. They are the reigning club rugby league and knockout champions. Although, Kandy has several sports bodies they need to get actively involved at the highest level. Kandy is urgently in need of proper ground facilities.
Ruggerite Lashan gets 4 A’s
Trinity College’s talented ruggerite Lashan Wijesuriya passed out well at the G.C.E. A/L with four "A" passes and was ranked 78th in the Kandy District. He was also a school officer and president of the Trinity College Commerce Society. He was a top ruggerite since 2007 and played in all age group teams from Under 12 to the senior side. He was vice captain of the under 14 and 16 teams. He was a member of the senior rugby team from 2015-17 and won his rugby colours. Lashan was the highest points scorer last season with 81 points, five tries, 22 conversions and four penalties. He had the privilege of playing in six Bradby Sheild matches.
Pupils are readying for rugby
Kandy schools are warming up for the coming rugby season and are busy with training programmes. All schools are blessed with some keen and knowledgeable players. Trinity College is once again coached by Lote Raikabula with Buddhika Abeyasinghe as his assistant. St. Anthony’s College is handled by Sanjaya Amunugama. Dharmaraja College is lucky to have Isipathanian Kapila Silva, a former CR & FC, Kandy SC and Sri Lanka forward as their coach for the second successive year. Kingswood College is coached by that talented Dinesh Gamage. St. Sylvester’s College side is coached by one of their products Aruna Rankothge who will be in his third year. Vidyartha College is coached by Sumedha Maleawana. Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St. Paul’s) College by veteran soldier B.B.N. Dharmapala. Sri Rahula College is coached by Nalin Wijesinghe and Nugawela Central is coached by Deepal Puniyawardene.
Governor's trophy for KCC
Kandy Cricket Club pocketed the Governor's trophy in their cricket tournament organized by the Central Province Cricket Association. Kandy CC beat Old Rajans CC by 6 wickets at Pallekelle. Old Rajans CC taking first lease of the wicket scored 84 in 20.3 overs while in reply Kandy CC made 89 for 4 in 23.2 overs. A pat on the back to the President of Kandy CC and Chief Minister of Central Province Sarath Ekanayake and Secretary Janaka Pathirana for organizing the tournament after many years.
Kandy has potential to promote football
Kandy has a lot of potential to be a top football promoting city. Kandy has been playing football since the 1930s. Sad to say, last year there was no AGM and the FFSL failed to do the needful. What Kandy needs today is another discreet and autonomous organization for promoting football at club level. Kandy is so bad at football because of poor organizing.
Kandy Youth SC to get a fillip
Kandy Youth SC at one time did well with their own resources in cricket and rugby, this club was founded by Malcolm Perera, Shaw Wilson, late Bodi Liyanage and H Marikar to promote cricket and they also took up rugby and played in the “A” division. Once again some of the founders have come forward to give the club the much needed support. Their main aim is to support cricket. Despite 10 schools playing top class cricket in Kandy, the town hasn’t been able to play in the Division I of the Premier cricket tournament of the country. The main reason for the drop in club cricketing standards is that the players don’t have a regular playground for practices and even for matches.
Minister Kiriella to upgrade Bogambara Stadium
Former Royalist Lakshman Kiriella, a senior minister and the man who initiated the Pallekelle Cricket Stadium and gave a big hand for the Hambantota Stadium, is planning to redevelop the historic Bogamabara Stadium and expand its capacity. He wants to make the playing area and the track perfect, and also the netball and the basketball courts and swimming facilities upgraded making it the biggest ground in the Central hills. The Minister has already held talks with sports promoters. This is going to be a great help as today a school needs over Rs. 75,000 to play a rugby game.
Antonians back in the game
Thanks to their new coach Sampath Perera, St Anthony’s College has won four games this season beating Kingswood, Wesley, St. Anne’s and Thakshila Horana and drew with Vidyartha, Bandaranayake Gampaha, St.Sebastian’s Moratuwa and Katuneriya. At present, they are playing Royal. This is turning out to be a highly successful year after a long spell for the school. St. Anthony’s College is one of the oldest cricketing schools with a history of over one hundred years producing top cricketers like the first school double centurion Jack Anderson and the world’s top spinner Muthiah Muralitharan.
Sampath to give a hand for iron sport
Weightlifting is one of the oldest sports. At one time this sport was dominant in Kandy and produced several weight lifters who brought honour to their clubs, themselves and the country. Kandy was the hub for the iron sport. All this was made possible due to the immense support and helping hand extended by Kandy YMCA, which was backed by the National Olympic Committee and the Sports Ministry. Once again this iron sport is to get the fullest support. An ardent fan and one time lifter Sampath Perera, a product of St. Sylvester’s College who is also good at Billiards and Snooker is keen in giving a hand to promote weightlifting. Athula Wijawickrema from the famous weightlifting family is happy to do the coaching.
