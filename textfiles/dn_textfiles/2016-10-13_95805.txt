14th TRR Rajan Cricket Sixes successfully concluded

 
The 14th edition of the TRR Rajan Cricket Sixes saw a fourteenth different winner. However the best two teams Rotary Club of Anuradhapura and Rotaract Club of Trincomalee won the tournament, with the second place going to Rotary Club of Nallur and Rotaract Club of Chulikuram.
This is an annual cricket tournament since 2012 and played in Kandy. This tournament was for teams from Rotary and Rotaract clubs in the country, which was fully sponsored by “Sun Match Company”.
This tournament has gained popularity and every year presents good entertaining cricket, with rules and a venue that encourages aggressive batting and high scoring. As every player (except the wicket-keeper) is required to bowl one over, the format suits all-rounders. Games are played between two teams of six players, and each game consists of a maximum of five six-ball overs bowled by each side.
In this year’s tournament played last Sunday at the Asgiriya Stadium, 69 teams were seen in action, games were played between two teams of six players, and each game consisted a maximum of five six-ball overs bowled by each side. It was played under the distinguished patronage of Governor of Rotary Senaka Amarasinghe and Jeeva Rajan, wife of later TRR Rajan. Former Governor of Rotary BDR Suri Rajan too graced the occasion.
A fantastic awards presentation was held for all teams under the patronage of Jeeva Rajan and BDR Suri Rajan. It was a day of cricket style ‘fun in the sun’ and played and enjoyed by all.
In the Rotary final Rotary club of Anuradhapura scored 82 for the loss one wicket in their six overs and in reply Rotary Club of Nallur scored 59 runs for two wickets in their allocated overs.
