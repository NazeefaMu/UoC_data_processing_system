JLanka inaugurates international  business entity in Bahrain

Sri Lanka’s foremost renewable energy and technology solutions providerJLanka Technologies has officially inaugurated its first international business entity, JLanka international, based out in Bahrain.
Commencing operations in this region, JLanka has commissioned to conduct an exclusive training program in Bahrain in cooperation with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Bahrain, along with the country’s Sustainable Energy Unit (SEU) and the Electricity and Water Authority (EWA), to train and certify solar PV installers.
JLanka has also been commissioned for a comprehensive survey of government buildings in Bahrain for solar energy potential for an upcoming tender based feed-in-tariff (FiT) program. 
“We are pleased about the opportunity of knowledge sharing and enormous potential for our solar and pioneering renewable energy and technology solutions in Bahrain, the Gulf region and Middle East,” said Jayantha Jayamanna, Chief Operating Officer of JLanka.
“Our proven expertise and established operation has led to JLanka’s global acceptance as industry leaders, where we were awarded two projects through an international competitive bidding process.
Equally important is the fact that both these projects are long-term agreements (LTAs) signed with the UNDP Bahrain, which further cements JLanka’s continued presence and collaboration in the region.”
The JLanka leadership team including Jayamanna, on a visit to Bahrain met with Dr. Abdul Hussain bin Ali Mirza, Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs of Bahrain as well as Bahrain’s UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, Amin El Sharkawi.
JLanka’s significant research and development capacity in renewable energy and technology solutions, installation and management was commended by Bahrain authorities, along with the company’s approach for industry advancement via knowledge dissemination, leading to their collaboration with the UNDP Country Office and Ministry of Electricity and Water Affairs of Bahrain. El Sharkawi also highlighted the important role JLanka will play in Bahrain’s alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially in promoting Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy for All.
The training workshop, scheduled to be held in June is organized by the Ministry of Electricity and Water Affairs of Bahrain in cooperation with the country’s Sustainable Energy Unit, a Government-UNDP established unit for forming strategies, policies and legislations and for stimulating initiatives and investment projects that promote energy efficiency and widening the share of the production of energy from renewable sources.
