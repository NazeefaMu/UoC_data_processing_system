President, PM to discuss Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe issue

The UNP Parliamentary Members’ Meeting held at Temple Trees headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe decided that Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe should resign from his ministerial portfolio, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said.
He also said that Prime Minister observed that he would discuss the matter with President Maithripala Sirisena last night itself or today on the next step.
Ramanayake added that the Premier also observed that the period granted to Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to appear before the special committee appointed by the UNP Working Committee ended yesterday and that Minister Rajapakshe failed to appear before the same.
He made these observations to the media yesterday following the UNP Members Meeting held at Temple Trees.
He added that the UNP members had no personal grudge with Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and they too do not object him continuing as the Buddhasasana Minister.
“But, we maintain that Minister Rajapakshe had attempted to protect his clients during the past two and a half years,” Deputy Minister Ramanayake said.
“Therefore, the UNP members’ stand is that he should resign from his portfolio as Justice Minister.”
