NCcsl seminar on converting waste plastic into petroleum fuel on May 30

The National Chamber of Commerce in association with Polipto Lanka, a subsidiary of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development, will conduct an awareness seminar for converting waste plastic and polythene into petroleum fuel that can be developed as an alternative to crude oil.
The seminar will be held on Tuesday, May 30, from 3.00 pm to 4.30 pm at the Chamber Auditorium , No. 450 D.R. Wijewardene Mawatha, Colombo 10.
The objective of the seminar is for the prevention of environmental pollution arising from haphazard dumping of plastic waste and to build up a polythene-free environment in the country.
The local government authorities collect nearly 3,500 MT of garbage daily. Nearly 245 MT of plastic disposed daily as garbage causes massive environmental damage unfavorably affecting land, waterways, oceans, and especially marine animals.
The seminar will highlight the dangers of dumping plastic waste and causing environmental damage and point the way forward for a polythene-free environment.
The seminar will be conducted by senior officials from Polipto Lanka headed by the Chairman, Dr Lionel Pinto, and followed by a panel discussion.
The seminar will be beneficial for waste plastic dealers and waste plastic collectors (especially of water bottles and shopping bags), establishments using boilers, furnace oil, and thermal energy.
The resource persons are Dr. Lionel Pinto, Chairman, Polipto Private Lanka, Udeni Wickramasinghe, CEO, Saman S. Senaweera, DGM (R.D.), Ananda Withanage, Director/Inventor and Prof. Rahal Attanage, Deputy Vice Chancellor, University of Moratuwa.
