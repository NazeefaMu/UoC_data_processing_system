Helicopter tour for Mobitel 4G  Nation winners in Batticaloa

Mobitel recently hosted loyal customers to an unforgettable aviation experience with a once–in–a–lifetime ride in a Helicopter for the sixth time.
This initiative combined fun with awareness by outlining to loyal customers on board, the widespread nature of Mobitel’s 4G network, whilst highlighting its investment in providing holistic coverage to those across the country.
Mobitel constantly lives up to its “We Care. Always” brand promise, and the roll-out of 4G LTE is testament to its promise to create equal access to the internet throughout the country at affordable rates. Here, the winners of Mobitel 4G Nation Campaign pose for photographs with the helicopter before taking to the skies.
