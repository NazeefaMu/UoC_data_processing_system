Dismal performances by Lankans in Rio

RIO DE JANEIRO, Monday: Sri Lanka painted a dismal picture as all three of its competitors seen in action on Monday were eliminated from their respective events on day four of the Olympic Games here.
Shooter Mangala Samarakoon came out with the worst ever performance in his international career, finishing last out of 50 competitors who took part in men’s 10m air rifle qualification round.
His second successive Olympics turned out to be a nightmare for Samarakoon who had a poor aggregate of 589.6 while all other shooters went beyond 600.
Italian Niccolo Camprini finished on top with a total of 630.2 - a new Olympic record. In the second place was Viadmir Maslennikov of Russia with 629.0, followed by Peter Gorsa of Croatia who scored 628.0.
Weightlifter Sudesh Peiris fared no better in his men’s 62kg group ‘B’ qualifier. Although he opted to start his snatch lifts from 120kg, he failed in all three attempts to crash out of the competition.
Vaipava Nevo Ioane (SAM) who started his lifts at 115kg finished on top of this group with a snatch of 120kg and clean and jerk of 161kg to total 281kg.
The only Sri Lankan competitor to show some form was judoka Chamara Nuean Dharmawardena who secured ninth place in his weight class. He was eliminated at the pre-quarter finals of the men’s 73kg category.
However, he beat Benjamin Waterhouse of American Samoa in the qualifying round before losing to Lisha Shavdatuashvili of Geirgia in the pre-quarter finals.
