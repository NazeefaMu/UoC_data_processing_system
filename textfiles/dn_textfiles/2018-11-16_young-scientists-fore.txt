Young scientists to the fore

Sri Lankan scientists are exposed to the world more often than not when they take employment in NASA or at universities in western countries.
Little that we know there is a breed of potential scientists here within the country, at this moment, being groomed by their mentors to become forces to be reckoned with.
It is high time we identified the value of these future scientists and support them with finances and other facilities needed for their research work. The public and private sectors in the country have great responsibility towards offering them with a helping hand to continue with research work.
With a proactive approach the country could retain these scientists without letting them become victims of brain draining process.
Postgraduate research communication day 2018
The research and higher degrees committee of the Colombo University’s faculty of medicine held ‘Postgraduate research communication day 2018’ with a view to encouraging their young scientists towards bringing their innovative research work to the public eye.
The event took place at the faculty of medicine at Kynsey Road, Colombo with the theme, ‘Simplicity in research – the ultimate sophistication’.
The program was comprised with two major segments, postgraduate and academic presentations.
Postgraduate presentations branded as ‘Bus Stop Talks’ focused on communicating research work currently being done by postgraduate students.
Bus Stop Talks
The Postgraduate students of the medical faculty who currently work on innovative research work were given a chance via ‘Bus Stop Talks’ to present their works to an audience comprised with professors, faculty and the media.
Each student was allocated maximum of three minutes to present his/her work in the simplest manner.
The objective was to bequeath postgraduate students with skills of simple communication to bridge the gap between the research community and people that includes the general public, the government, private sector and the press.

Heavy jargon in medicine was not used in these presentations.
A panel of judges individually assessed and analyzed each single-slide power point presentation to evaluate best student researchers who were eventually presented with certificates.
“Communicating in simple manner would create awareness within the society of our work. Finding ways to explain our work to laymen is of great importance in many aspects.
A person in a bus-stop should understand what we say in a minimum possible time,” said postgraduate student of the department of bio-chemistry and molecular biology, Suvini Karunaratne.
“Research has to be imparted into the public community,” she said.
Valuable inputs
Out of the 16 postgraduate Bus Stop Talk sessions, significant ones included, The cancer cell killer - wonder fruit from Sri Lanka (Udeshika Yapa Bandara), Significance of non tuberculosis mycobacterium in lung infections (Dharshika Jayasuriya), Leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka - Superior host or inferior parasite?(F H Riyal).
U Mannapperuma on her research on mood stabilization of patients with Bipolar disorder (manic depression) in Sri Lanka shed light on side effects of drugs given and offered recommendations for better monitoring of patients.
“Are our patients taking medicines as prescribed? According to our findings, only 35 percent take medicine as expected. Younger age, poor knowledge of medicines and occurrence of side-effects affect them from not taking medicines properly. In our research we checked the level of quality of the drugs in the blood of healthy people by comparison with scientifically validated ones,” she said.
Expert comments
Prof Thashi Chang said Sri Lankan scientists can do global research with necessary funds.
He stressed the need to have good grant evaluators and said there should be a mechanism for start-up grants.
“Students should have the right attitude and enthusiasm. Stay focused and do correct justification to your research work. You need to communicate with peers constantly for collaborations”, he said.
Dr Jithangi Wanigasinghe said interest and passion is the driving force for researchers. Dr Yamuna Siriwardene emphasized on the need to create a culture of collaborative interaction with peers.
“All great discoveries are not made in laboratories but you cannot research by yourself. Always discuss about your research with peers. Good discoveries have happened in collaborative manner. Setting up postgraduate students’ society’ would be a good initiative,” she said.
Research and higher degrees committee chairperson Prof Vajira Dissanayake’s speech was titled, ‘From PhD research to an academic career in research’.
“Convert your research to an academic career. You got have some entering and a professional mentor would guide you. Innovation would take you to global platform”, he said. Prof Vajira Dissanayake is a medical geneticist who has received many local and international awards for his innovative global research work. He has made a gamut of orations locally and internationally.
He received SLMA oration award for medical research in Sri Lanka on competitive basis in 2008 for his oration on ‘Genetics of Pre-eclampsia and the weight of babies at birth’.
