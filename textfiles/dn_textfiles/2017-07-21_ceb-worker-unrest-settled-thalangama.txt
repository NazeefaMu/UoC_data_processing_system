CEB worker unrest settled in Thalangama

The power outage in Thalangama came to an end yesterday after police arrested two suspects who allegedly attacked two Ceylon Electricity Board workers on Tuesday.
The two workers had been assaulted by the suspect while they were about to disconnect power owing to a red notice at a tyre shop in the Mulleriyawa area. The incident sparked unrest among the CEB maintenance leading to a breakdown in electricity maintenance which caused the outage, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry sources said.
The area went dark for nearly 20 hours, sources explained.
