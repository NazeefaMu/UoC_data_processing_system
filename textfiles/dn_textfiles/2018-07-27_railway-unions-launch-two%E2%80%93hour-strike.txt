Railway unions launch two–hour strike

Commuters were left in the lurch yesterday when the railway unions staged an unannounced two–hour strike targeting the office rush, over demands that construction work on land allocated to the Railway Department was obstructed by the Urban Development Authority.
“The Cabinet of Ministers approved a proposal to allocate land in Maradana for the construction of the Colombo Train Controlling Centre and railway operations headquarters. However when officials had gone to the site today to survey the land, a politician had obstructed their work,” said Operating Superintendent of Railways, Colombo Division, V.S Polwattage. “This strike action we are told is in response to the incident which had taken place today.”
It was announced on Wednesday that the Cabinet of Ministers had approved a proposal by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation to allocate a one acre land and two roads in Tripoli, Maradana for the construction of the Colombo Train Control Centre and Railway Operations Headquarters under the Colombo Suburban Railway Efficieny Improvement Project funded by the Asian Development Bank.
