Dayasiri keen to improve standard of sport

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that he will be working to find strengths and weaknesses of the sports field and to bring amendments to the sports act and make a revival of sports in Sri Lanka.
There is a decline in sports as the sports personnel and the coaches face difficulties due to the internal crisis in the local sports governing bodies.
The Minister also stated that he is proud about the National Paralympic Committee being an exemplary to other sports governing bodies where the officials are in a tug of war to get posts.
He expressed his views at the media briefing for the sponsoring of National Paralympic Committee and Sri Lanka Army Para Games festival by Dialog Axiata PLC.
Also he pointed out the need of a programme to recognize the differently abled youth with sports talent.
Dialog Axiata PLC will provide the financial assistance for the National Paralympics contingent and Army Para Games for a period of two years from 2015 to 2017. Dialog's first international commitment will be the upcoming International Paralympics Championship World Meet in Doha, Qatar where Sri Lanka will field seven athletes.
The Sri Lankan Paralympic contingent for the Doha Games will be led by Anil Prasanna Jayaratne, while team will comprise of Upul Indika Chuladasa, Chaminda Sampath Hettiarachchi, Dinesh Priyantha Herath, Amara Indumathi, Thumira Maduranga Alwis, and Gamini Ekanayake who will stand-in as a reserve athlete.
