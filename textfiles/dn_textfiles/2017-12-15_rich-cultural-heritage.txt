A rich cultural heritage

The Martial Arts have been a source of great fascination to people since ancient times. The main reason is probably because it is a form of self- empowerment. The ability to defend oneself against an external enemy is no doubt valuable. Throughout the ages youth around the world have watched actors such as Bruce Lee and David Carradine exhibit their fighting skills on television adding to its appeal.
 The Chinese Shaolin Kung Fu Show is currently being held from December 12- 17. What is special about the event is that the performance is actually by Shaolin Monks.
This show is organized by the Embassy of the Peoples’ Republic of China, Association for Sri Lanka China Social and Cultural Cooperation, Sri Lanka China Friendship Association, Sri Lanka China Society and Sri Lanka China Journalist forum.
“This event becomes special to all of the associations and the institutions working towards the growing and stable bilateral relationship between Sri Lanka and China as the two countries are Celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the Diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka, as well as the 65th Anniversary of the Signing of the Rice and Rubber pact,” said President, Association for Sri Lanka and China Social and Cultural Corporation, Indrananda Abeysekera.
Abeysekera pointed out that the visit by the performers will further establish the friendship between the peoples of both countries, especially in a time where ‘One Belt One Road Initiative’ is promoted by China. Today China and Sri Lanka is at a new starting point of strategic cooperative partnership, where Sri Lanka is becoming a significant trade and cultural partner in the new maritime silk route.
Director, Cultural Division, Embassy of the Peoples’ Republic of China, Liu Dong, said the event was one of great pride for both nations because both countries have their own forms of martial arts. He spoke of the rich cultural exchange that this event creates.
“These events are an ideal opportunity to further strengthen our relations. So we have organized this cultural show in Sri Lanka for many reasons. One being that Sri Lanka is a Buddhist Country and Shaolin Kung-Fu has a connection with Buddhism. Sri Lanka also has a martial arts tradition and culture so we hope this will be learning opportunity for all involved. This is an important event as it marks 60 years of bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and China and it marks the 65th anniversary of the Signing of the Sri Lankan China Rice Rubber pact,” said Dong.
Dong added that these events had a big impact on Sri Lanka and China cultural relations.
“We have one purpose and that is to continue and consolidate our relationship. Both China and Sri Lanka have splendid traditions and we have much to share with each other,” added Dong.
President, Sri Lanka China Society, Amaradasa Gunawardana reiterated what Liu Dong said when he spoke of the importance that both countries attach to each other.
“The Diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and China have prospered for 60 years. However actual relations between the two cultures dates back hundreds of years. On September 21, 1949, Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the People’s Republic of China. It is common knowledge amongst the people of Sri Lanka, what our relations have been and what they are now,” said Gunawardana.
