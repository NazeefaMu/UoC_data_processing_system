School celebrates its first Media Day

The Nugethanna Maha Vidyalaya in Udadumbara, celebrated its first school media day recently. The programme was held under a project aimed at empowering media units of schools in the Central Province.
Ten schools in ten education zones in the Central Province will benefit from this project. The prime objective of the project is to improve the communication and literary skills of schoolchildren with the help of religious, social and cultural groups in those areas.
A provincial-level media competition will be held later in order to provide an opportunity for children to display their talents.
Central Province Media Unit Officer Nimal Chandrasiri Mahawatte, Media Unit Developmental Officer A.M.B.G.S. Jayaweera; veteran journalists Upali Waidyarathna, Mahanama Galahitiyawa and Lal Amarasiri; as well as Principal W.M.U.G.U.K.B. Weerasekara participated in the event.
