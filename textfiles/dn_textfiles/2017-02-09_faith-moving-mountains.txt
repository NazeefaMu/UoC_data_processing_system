Faith moving mountains

With God all things are possible.
Romans 8:31 – “………If God is for us, who can ever be against us?”
Romans 8: 38 – “And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from his love. Death can’t and life can’t. The angels can’t and the demons can’t. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, and even the powers of hell can’t keep God’s love away………..”
The Apostolic Diocese of Ceylon (ADC) gathered the leaders of all its member churches for the inaugural meeting recently. The ADC hosted over 500 clergy, making it one of the largest pastors’ gatherings of Charismatic/ Pentecostal leaders nationally. The ADC’s collective congregation is approximately 50,000 strong.
The Daily News attended this groundbreaking event.
“It has been one and a half years since I took office as Chief Overseer of the Apostolic Diocese of Ceylon. It has been an inspiring, progressive and empowering journey for all the churches that came under our wing and joined as one under our revived mandate. My commissioning towards the thousands of independent churches in the country was envisioned on the dawn of 2013, and since then I opened my heart to heal, teach and cover those who wanted a spiritual father and leader,” said Rev. Dr. Kirby de Lanerolle, Chief Overseer.
The ADC has now amassed 515 churches becoming the largest charismatic denomination in the country. De Lanerolle emphasized that 2015 marked the dawn of a new era for the free churches in Sri Lanka.
“It was at this very prophetic season that we experienced, “all things working together for the good of those that love him, who have been called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28), when the Indian National Apostolic Diocese concurrently mandated us to fulfil the very vision that had been birthed in our hearts.
“We are the largest non – Catholic denomination in the North and East. The ADC episcopates a congregation of nearly 40,000 island-wide. The Charismatic churches in the country face challenges on different levels. This Diocese has identified four socio religious political areas that we are committed to work for 2017 -
· The challenges of the burial of the dead of a charismatic believer which has been challenged on many occasions unless a main line letter is submitted. We want to especially thank Law and Order Minister Sagala Rathnayaka for taking an interest and following through with an inquiry into this matter in the North and East.
· The challenge to upgrade and build the premises of our churches and worship centres.
· The challenge to be identified as clergy on our travel documents, official documents and our ID cards
· The challenge to place charismatic children in schools in the absence of a letter from a main line church.
The ADC is committed towards religious harmony and dialogue between religions, so that we can work in harmony towards serving a united nation through the multi religious and cultural communities that we are placed in.
“It is important as members of the body of Christ that we emulate the heart of reconciliation within our own church body thereby reconciling the hearts of leaders within our own faith. The Church is divided into nearly 41,000 denominations worldwide with different doctrines and beliefs within the foundations of the Bible. Reconciliation between brethren and bridging the gaps through friendship and love should be of utmost importance in accordance with our faith,” explained De Lanerolle.
Dr. Lakshman Madurasinghe, International President Medicina Alternativa and Ceylon Holistic Centre rendered a powerful speech saying that the Pastors have a great challenge but there are also great opportunities to serve in Sri Lanka.
“We are multiracial, multi-religious and a multi-ethnic society, and naturally there will be many challenges that you will have to face as you go along. But the most important thing is that as you go along, the Lord is there to support you. More than all the plans that we can bring together it is the Lord’s guidance. And as you rely on him, you will be empowered to carry on your ministerial work. In 1John 2:27, we are told that the anointing will teach you everything. Nevertheless when Paul was writing to 2Timothy, in Chapter 2 it is said – to bring people who are faithful and able to teach and train them. He tries to identify that there are certain ministries – the fivefold ministries we have and to empower, teach and develop, and guide them systematically to be able to be of service in society,” said Madurasinghe
Madurasinghe also touched on the areas of competency, commitment, character and consciousness, and their importance.
“We have to develop our competence and we have to have a systematic way of building those competencies to face challenges, cross cultural issues, international connectivity and so on,” stated Madurasinghe.
Madurasinghe urged followers to be committed to the church, committed to your pastors and leadership in order to be able to derive and gain the maximum.
“For too long we have been scattered doing our own thing. Coming under an umbrella supports you, motivates you, encourages you and enlightens you. Character too is important. Many pastors in many parts of the world, have tried to do their own thing and deviating from that character that should be flawless in the presence of God and in the eyes of everybody. Christ consciousness is also vital. But this is not the consciousness spoken by these new age movements and doctrines! We have to be careful about that.
They believe you can advance to a level of consciousness ultimately as Christ Consciousness. We are not into developing that type of consciousness. We are talking about beholding as a mirror the glory of the Lord so that our image will be like his and that comes when you yield to the Lord! There is a lot of work to be done.
Much Bible reading to be done, a lot of areas to learn and equip so we carry on as completely competent soldiers in the vineyard of God,” elucidated Madurasinghe.
