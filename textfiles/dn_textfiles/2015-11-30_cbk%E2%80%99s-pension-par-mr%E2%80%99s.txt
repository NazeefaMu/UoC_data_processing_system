CBK’s pension on par with MR’s

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister, tabled a resolution in Parliament on Saturday seeking approval to increase the pension entitlement of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 97,500 to bring it on par with that of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The resolution was tabled in terms of Paragraph (1) Article 36 of the Constitution which gives Parliament the power to introduce a resolution to determine the salary, allowances and pension entitlements of Presidents. Parliament determined by a resolution on March 4, 1986 states that the pension entitlement of a President shall be a sum equivalent to the salary the President was entitled to immediately before he ceased to hold such office.
Accordingly, from 1988, the pensions paid to former Presidents J. R. Jayewardene, D. B. Wijetunga, Hema Premadasa, the widow of former President R. Premadasa and to former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga were Rs. 25,000 per month which was equivalent to the salary of the President.
With the implementation of the Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006 issued on November 23, 2006, Parliament by resolution revised the salary of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 97,500 per month effective July 1, 2006.
“Remunerations or allowances paid to ministers and Members of Parliament too were revised at the same time. Coinciding with the revision of remunerations or allowances paid to the ministers and Members of Parliament, pensions of former ministers and Members of Parliament too were revised. However, only the pension paid to former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was not revised.
The resolution states: “That this Parliament resolves under Paragraph (1) of Article 36 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, in view of the above, it is just and reasonable to rectify this anomaly— (a) revising the monthly pension entitlement of the former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 97,500; (b) paying a monthly pension equivalent to the two-third out of Rs. 97,500 to Hema Premadasa, widow of former President R. Premadasa; and (c) implementing the aforementioned revisions of pension entitlements with effect from 01.01.2016.”
