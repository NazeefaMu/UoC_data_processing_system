Organized Crimes Prevention Division begins investigations on Azath Salley’s hate speech

 
The Organized Crimes Prevention Division commenced an investigation against National Unity Alliance leader Azath Salley for allegedly making a hate speech during a press conference last year.
 Filing a facts report before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the Organized Crimes Prevention Division informed that it has received a complaint from a resident of Mudungoda alleging that National Unity Alliance leader Azath Salley made a hate speech tantamount to hurt the sentiments of the Sinhala-Buddhist community in the country.
Police told court that the incident took place on or around July 2, 2016 during a press conference held at his office in Colombo.
 The complainant Saliya Ranawaka maintained that the alleged hate speech made by Azath Sally was causing damages to country’s religious harmony.
 Meanwhile, the Chief Magistrate issued an order directing three television channels to provide relevant video footage to the police in order to carry out further investigations.
