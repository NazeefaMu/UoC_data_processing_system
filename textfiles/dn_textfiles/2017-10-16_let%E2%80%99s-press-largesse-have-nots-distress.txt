Let’s press for largesse for have-nots in distress

Today, October 17, is International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. Sponsored by the United Nations, it promotes awareness of the need to help wipe out hardship and destitution worldwide, particularly in developing countries.
The theme this year – selected in consultation with activists, civil society and non-governmental organisations highlights how important it is to recognise and address the humiliation and exclusion endured by many people living in impoverishment. The theme of the 2017 event is: “Answering the Call of October 17 to end poverty: A path toward peaceful and inclusive societies.”
Building a sustainable future
This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the Call to Action by Father Joseph Wresinski—which inspired the observance of October 17 as the World Day for Overcoming Extreme Poverty—and the recognition by the United Nations of the day as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.
The day also presents an opportunity to acknowledge the effort and struggle of people living in such dire circumstances, a chance to make their concerns heard and a moment to recognise that the poor are the first ones to fight against poverty.
Participation of the needy themselves has been at the centre of the day's celebration since its very beginning. It also reflects the willingness of people living in misery to use their expertise to contribute to the eradication of poverty.
Building a sustainable future requires us to intensify our efforts towards stamping out extreme poverty and discrimination and ensuring that everyone can fully exercise their human rights. The full participation of people living in poverty, particularly in the decisions that affect their lives and communities, must be at the centre of policies and strategies to build a sustainable future. Research shows that when a country grows economically, overall poverty is reduced. If the national income is not equally distributed among all communities in the country, there is a risk that poorer communities will end up poorer and individuals will feel it most.
Many programs aim at feeding kids at school and providing health services as well. This encourages parents to send their children to school and keep them there to complete at least their basic education. If children have food to eat and are healthy, they can learn and respond to the needs of the program. It is important that governments extend their development programs such as roads, bridges and other economic facilities to rural areas, to make it easy for goods and services and farm produce to move to and from the farming communities.
Interrelated factors
Poverty alleviation involves the strategic use of tools such as education, economic development, health and income redistribution to improve the livelihoods of the world’s poorest by governments and internationally approved organisations. They also aim at removing social and legal barriers to income growth among the marginalised poor. Why are these tools important? Quality education empowers people to take advantage of opportunities around them. It helps children gain knowledge, information and life skills they need to realise their potential. Training teachers, building schools, providing education materials and breaking down barriers that prevent children from accessing education are important features of poverty alleviation programmes.
The youth and those able to work in the communities are provided skills to help with farm work or other economic activity, which helps them, earn money to make a living and take care of their families. With a bit of effort in these areas it will not take long to see real improvements in the living conditions of these communities. According to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day as a result of poverty. And they die quietly in some of the poorest villages on earth, far removed from the scrutiny and the conscience of the world. Being meek and weak in life makes these dying multitudes even more invisible in death. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to end poverty in all its forms everywhere explicitly recognises that poverty results not from the lack of just one reason but from many different interrelated factors that affect the lives of people living in destitution.
This means we must go beyond seeing poverty merely as the lack of income or what is necessary for material well-being — such as food, housing, land and other assets – in order to fully understand poverty in its multiple dimensions.
For millions of women and girls in the Indian sub-continent and nations such as Africa poverty and sickness go hand in hand. Without access to basic water and healthcare, their livelihoods, families and education are all affected. Many of us do not realise that 70 percent of their illnesses are preventable. But you can help change this by empowering a community health leader. Poverty reduction is a set of measures, both economic and humanitarian, that are intended to permanently lift people out of poverty.
The international poverty line
According to a World Bank report 21 percent of the world’s population was in extreme poverty and more than half of the world’s population was in poverty. More than 30 percent of children in developing countries – about 600 million – live on less than US$1 a day. Every 3.6 seconds one person dies of starvation. Usually it is a child under the age of five.
Poverty hits children hardest. While a severe lack of goods and services pains every human, it is most threatening to children’s rights. Survival, health and nutrition, education, participation and protection from harm and exploitation are all issues that have to be addressed. It creates an environment that is damaging to children’s development in every way – mental, physical, emotional and spiritual.
The work to end extreme poverty is far from over and a number of challenges remain. It is becoming even more difficult to reach those remaining in extreme poverty who often live in fragile contexts and remote areas. Access to schools, healthcare, electricity, safe water and other critical services remains elusive for many people, often determined by socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity and geography. For those who have been able to move out of such circumstances progress is often temporary. That is because they are beset by economic shocks, food insecurity and climate change which all threaten to rob them of their hard-won gains and force them back into impoverishment. It will be critical to find ways to tackle these issues as we make progress toward 2030.
In October 2015, the World Bank updated the international poverty line to US$1.90 a day. At present the percentage of the global population living under extreme poverty is likely to fall below 10 percent according to the World Bank projections released last year.
Poverty cannot be completely eradicated, as it is largely caused by human factors. Over the past years there has been a lot of Poverty Alleviation Programs designed to break the cycle of destitution in many households and communities in the world. The results have been remarkable, but there is still a lot to be done. But it can be achieved with your help.
