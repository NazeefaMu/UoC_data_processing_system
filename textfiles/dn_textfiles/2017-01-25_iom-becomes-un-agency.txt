IOM becomes UN agency

The International Organization for Migration, after relentless efforts on international cooperation on migration issues among its 165 member states and on protecting the rights of all migrants, has now become a UN related agency, IOM Director General William Lacy Swing said.
The IOM Director General was speaking at the 4th Ministerial Consultation of the Abu Dhabi Dialogue (ADD) held yesterday at Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel, Colombo.
The Director General said their organization is to fully facilitate the ADD, which has the greatest geographical map to identify common priorities when it comes to migrant employment.
He said ADD's focus on ethical recruitment, skills recognition, and per-departure orientation that are vital for a good labour migrant programme.
We are to put a stop to abuse of the migrant workers, especially female employees, by introducing a common code of conduct, the Director General said.
