Government failed to abolish PTA: HRW

The Sri Lankan government has failed to fulfill its pledge to abolish the abusive Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report released on Monday.
For decades, the PTA has been used to arbitrarily detain suspects for months and often years without charge or trial, facilitating torture, and other abuse, it claimed.
“The Sri Lankan government has been all talk and no action on repealing the reviled PTA,” said Brad Adams, Asia Director. “Replacing this draconian counterterrorism law with one that meets international standards should be an urgent priority if the government is serious about protecting human rights.”
The 46-page report, ‘Locked Up Without Evidence: Abuses under Sri Lanka’s Prevention of Terrorism Act’, documents previous and ongoing abuses committed under the PTA, including torture and sexual abuse, forced confessions, and systematic denials of due process.
Drawing on interviews with former detainees, family members, and lawyers working on PTA cases, Human Rights Watch says it found that the PTA is a significant contributing factor toward the persistence of torture in Sri Lanka. The 17 accounts documented in the report represent only a tiny fraction of PTA cases overall. But they underscore the law’s draconian nature and abusive implementation.
The PTA was enacted in 1979 to counter separatist insurgencies, notably the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and the law was widely used to detain hundreds of people during the country’s 26-year-long war. Yet while other emergency regulations have lapsed since the conflict ended in May 2009, the PTA remains in effect, the report said.
The Sri Lankan government arrested at least 11 people under the PTA in 2016 for alleged terrorist activities. The PTA permits arrests without warrant for unspecified “unlawful activities,” and permits detention for up to 18 months without producing the suspect before a court.
Human Rights Watch said it has received several reports of people detained for a decade or more without access to legal recourse, who were subsequently acquitted or released without charge, yet received no compensation, reparations, or apologies from the government.
