Sampath Bank, Ustocktrade LK join hands  to simplify investment in foreign securities

Sampath Bank PLC has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Ustocktrade LK (Private) Ltd (ULPL) to enable investors pay conveniently when trading in securities listed on stock exchanges acrossthe United States of America (USA) through the Ustocktradeapp.
Under this agreement, Sampath Bank Personal Foreign Currency (PFC) accountholders will soon be able to link their account to the Ustocktrade app and use it to pay for all the trades they make using the app. Team Sampath had worked on the integration of the Bank’s services into the trading platform.
Thus, Sampath Bank will be creating history once again, becoming the first bank in Sri Lanka to allow accountholders to directly use the funds in their accounts to trade in foreign securities. This adds to the appeal of the Ustocktrade app which eliminates the need for stock brokers to trade in US securities, making such investments more affordable.
ULPL is the locally registered company of Ustocktrade Securities, Inc., a company duly incorporated in USA. The Ustocktradeapp is the first ever mobile based foreign securities investment solution to have been introduced to Sri Lanka.
