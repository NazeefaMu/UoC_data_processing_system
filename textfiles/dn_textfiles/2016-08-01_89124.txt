Mathews thanks fans for sticking with team

PALLEKELE: Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews thanked the fans for sticking by his team through thick and thin and dedicated the win over Australia at Pallekele on Saturday to them.
“In the last 6-8 months, there was a situation where fans were turning away from us. As cricketers we feel that, because when we play well everyone loves you,” said Mathews.
“Even when you lose, they may love you, but they are also disappointed. The best thing was to win this match for the fans. We try to win every game, but it doesn’t always work out.
This is a good experience for us and the fans. It’s a great win for those who stayed with us, and we thank them because that support means a lot.” Mathews said the last six to eight months was disappointing from a team’s point of view.
“We as a team got a lot of stick. But that’s part and parcel of the game. When we do well we get praised. When we do badly we get a bit of stick. I think we as players need to understand that. Also we’ve prepared extremely well. We should also be thankful to the ground staff for preparing a good wicket,” said Mathews.
“The atmosphere in the dressing room has changed a lot. Even though we lost in the recent past, we’ve not given up. We always had hopes. We always helped each other. Every team goes through this transition period, and once you click, you can go a long way. That’s what we believed. We kept helping the youngsters and even the youngsters threw in their ideas and it was a collective effort from the whole team,” he said.
“We brought a lot of talented young players into the team recently. We lost a lot, but going forward, we’ll have more confidence. Kusal Mendis would have got a lot of confidence from playing that kind of innings against Australia. Sandakan took seven and he’ll have that confidence as well. Even if we lose a couple of matches, we need to stick by them and move forward.” – ST
