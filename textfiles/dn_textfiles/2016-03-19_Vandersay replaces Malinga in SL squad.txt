Vandersay replaces Malinga in SL squad

Sri Lanka have named legspinner Jeffrey Vandersay as Lasith Malinga's replacement, after a knee injury ruled the fast bowler out of the tournament on Friday. Vandersay had been named in Sri Lanka's original squad but was withdrawn later on after Sri Lanka's new selection committee took over. Among the two changes that were made, Vandersay had been replaced by Suranga Lakmal in the squad.
 
Vandersay made his T20I debut last July against Pakistan and has picked only one wicket in four T20Is so far. He was included for the Asia Cup recently but was unused because of the seamer-friendly pitches in Bangladesh. (espncricinfo)
