Our proposals for controlling dengue ignored: GMOA

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said authorities were groping in the dark without a scientific solution to the dengue epidemic plaguing the country.
A press release signed by GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge noted that the Association submitted proposals to the President last week to ensure a scientific approach to control and defeat the dengue.
“What was happening is quite opposite to our proposals. Every dengue patient must be recorded at the MOH of the respective areas but that process has been completely ignored,” the press release noted.
“This is essential to control dengue and carry out fumigation and other preventive methods.
“Neglecting this procedure would curtail the information on actual figures of the dengue patients and the affected areas,” GMOA said.
“What guarantee could the Health Ministry give that the true number of dengue patients had not exceeded 100,000?” the GMOA asked in its press release.
