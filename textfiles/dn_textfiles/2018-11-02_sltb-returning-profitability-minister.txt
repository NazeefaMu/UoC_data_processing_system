SLTB returning to profitability - Minister

The Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) is making profits after 43 years and it will continue with the development of its human resources, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
The minister made these remarks at a ceremony held to award certificates to 170 employees who completed their training courses funded by the SLTB human resources development programme at the Narahenpita Shalika Hall, yesterday.
The SLTB has allocated Rs.75 million for these training courses to improve computer literacy and business management skills of 5,000 SLTB employees through the Vocational Training Authority. The first phase of the programme has already been concluded with 1,550 employees and under the second phase, 1,558 employees will gain training. In addition, 20 mechanics have also been trained at the German Technical Training Institute.
The minister said mechanics, motor mechanics, and electricians who did not have recognised career certificates now have such a certificate, and they were trained by the German Technical Training Institute under concessionary fees.
The SLTB has been given 400 computers so far and another 600 will be given in the future to ease office functions.
