Case against Alles, three others:
Preliminary objections overruled

The Colombo High Court yesterday decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by former MP Tiran Alles and three others in connection with a Rs.200 million fraud that had allegedly taken place at the RADA in 2006.
While overruling preliminary objections raised by the defence, High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi fixed the matter for trial to be heard in due course. The case is to be taken up again on March 23.
On a previous occasion, President's Counsel Romesh de Silva with Nalin Ladduwahetty PC appearing for Tiran Alles alleged that prosecutors have failed to follow the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance when dealing with computer evidence.
However, Additional Solicitor Yasantha Kodagoda PC appearing for the Attorney General had raised a primary counter objection citing it was premature to raise this objection since the prosecution has not taken a decision to call computerized evidence at this juncture.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against four accused - former Chairman of RADA Tiran Alles, former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of RADA Saliya Wickramasuriya and Dr. Jayantha Dias Samarasinghe in connection with the controversial RADA fraud.
The High Court had allowed the Attorney General to proceed with the controversial RADA case in absentia of former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, the second accused in the case.
The second accused, Emil Kanthan, is currently evading courts and the Colombo Special High Court had also issued an open warrant for his arrest in connection with the attempted murder of former Minister Douglas Devananda.
