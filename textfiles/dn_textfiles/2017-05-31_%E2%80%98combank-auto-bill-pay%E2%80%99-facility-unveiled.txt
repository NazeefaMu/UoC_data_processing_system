‘COMBANK Auto Bill Pay’ facility unveiled

Credit card holders of Commercial Bank of Ceylon need no longer worry about paying their bills on time thanks to an automated bill payment facility launched by the Bank.
This service will initially offer facilities to settle payments for several services provided by Dialog. Monthly bills in respect of post-paid connections for Dialog Mobile, Dialog Fixed Line, Dialog Television or Dialog Broadband will automatically be settled on their due dates for all credit card holders who register for ‘Combank Auto Bill Pay,’ the Bank said.
No routine checking of the bill value or tracking of payment due dates is necessary in this highly secure and fully-integrated automated facility, which takes all the hassle out of keeping Dialog connections fully paid up. To register for this facility, Commercial Bank credit card holders are required to fill an application and hand it over to their Commercial Bank branches along with copies of their latest bills.
Users of the facility will receive SMS and e-mail notifications of payments to their mobile phones whenever an outstanding bill is paid.
Commercial Bank has also installed its Near Field Communications (NFC) enabled point-of-sale machines at key Dialog outlets island wide, allowing the Bank’s customers visiting these outlets to simply tap their Visa or Mastercard credit cards on the machines to carry out payments.
The ‘Tap n Go’ feature enhances security and transactions below Rs. 5,000 do not require a signature, expediting checkout.
Additionally, Commercial Banks recently provided Dialog with an Internet Payment Gateway (IPG) facility to facilitate faster online payments at all Dialog touch points.
Commercial Bank cards are the fastest growing cards in Sri Lanka and enjoy market leadership in Credit and Debit Card cumulative point-of-sale usage.
The Bank offers a variety of credit cards in the Silver, Gold and Platinum tiers of both Visa and Mastercard as well as Visa Signature, World Mastercard and Visa Infinite cards in the premium segment.
The cards are equipped with ‘Tap & Go’ NFC technology and are backed by a strong NFC Point-of-Sale (POS) network.
