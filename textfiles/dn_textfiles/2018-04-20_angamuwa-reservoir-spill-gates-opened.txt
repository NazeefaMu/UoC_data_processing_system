Angamuwa reservoir spill gates opened

Two spill gates of the Angamuwa reservoir were opened yesterday due to the current rising water levels.
“No harm would come to the public. However, the road from Puttlam to Mannar will be blocked due to this situation,” Disaster Management Centre (DMC) Deputy Director Pradeep Kodipillai said.
Hence, the DMC had requested motorists to use alternate routes.
The Angamuwa reservoir is a medium-sized tank built across the Lunu Oya, which is a tributary of the Kala Oya. The reservoir, which is located at the Rajanganaya DS division in the Anuradhapura district, holds a 1,700-m long dam with a maximum height of 8 metres.
The tank also has a water capacity of 12,000 acre-feet which currently enables the cultivation of 6,181 acres of farmlands.
