CARGILLS Sarasaviya Awards: Starry Night of Sri Lankan Cinema

Sarasaviya is a name synonymous with the arts in Sri Lanka. Appropriately named after the Goddess of the Arts, Sarasaviya is now the country’s only dedicated Sinhala film weekly, with additional focus on television, stage, music and other forms of art. Sarasaviya is close to the hearts of all art lovers in the country and all artistes have a close bond with the newspaper.
Sarasaviya is equally known for the film awards named after it and for many actors and artistes, winning a Sarasaviya award is the highlight of their career. Some have won Sarasaviya awards multiple times, others only once, but a Sarasaviya award is an accolade you cherish for a lifetime and beyond, when your children and grandchildren will hold it with awe. It is the award by which all other local cinema awards are judged. There is nothing quite like it in local cinema.
Sarasaviya was launched during the ‘Golden era’ of Sinhala cinema in the 1960s. To add lustre to the Silver Screen, Sarasaviya founder-editor Wimalasiri Perera held the first ‘Sarasaviya Film Festival’ on May 10, 1964 under the patronage of Ranjith Wijewardene, Ranapala Bodinagoda and the then greats of the local film industry. Throughout the years, the Sarasaviya Film Festival retained its unique identity without a change since it represents a combination of both classical (art house) and popular cinema.
Sarasaviya’s first choice for best film was Gamperaliya (The Revolution in the Village), which went on to win the Golden Peacock Award in India the same year. This shows that Sarasaviya has felt the true heartbeat of cinema fans and critics here and abroad. The Sarasaviya Film Festival and the Awards Ceremony which carry the imprint of Sri Lankan identity and cultural traits is always admired by the movie fans islandwide.
The next Sarasaviya film awards ceremony will be held today, this time with the sponsorship of Cargills Limited. The Cargills-Ceylon Theatres Group has a close affinity with the local movie industry through film production and film exhibition facilities. In fact, the Regal Cinema and the Lake House Building, which face each other, are two of the oldest buildings in Colombo. Expect a mesmerizing, star-studded evening when the Sarasaviya awards are presented amidst a distinguished gathering.
This year, the Sarasaviya Awards ceremony will be a tribute to the Colossus of the Sinhala Cinema Dr. Lester James Peries who passed away recently at the age of 99. Sarasaviya Awards and Lester were almost synonymous as almost every one of his creations from Gamperaliya onwards had won awards over the years. No other individual has perhaps achieved this monumental feat.
Sarasaviya came along at a time when one young man named Lester was bold enough to challenge the song and dance formula of Sinhala films derived from Hindi and Tamil movies. He wanted to create a truly Sri Lankan cinema that reflected a distinct identity, local ethos and real life stories. Not many believed in his capability and mission then, but more than 60 years later, the entire world has recognized him as one of the greatest movie directors ever.
Journalist turned film maker Lester was a giant of world cinema thanks to his sheer desire to steer the Sinhala cinema in a totally new direction. Journalism’s loss was cinema’s gain as he introduced fresh insights to a moribund industry that had no real depth or purpose back in the 1950s. Thus his first film Rekhava (Line of Destiny) literally broke new ground in the Sinhala cinema, with a totally indigenous storyline, local outdoor settings (location shooting was a novelty even in Hollywood at this time), believable dialogues and all-new Sinhala songs – not copies of Hindi or Tamil songs.
Lester never looked back from then onwards, taking Sinhala movies to the global stage. His love for Cinema never wavered right till the end – the recent movie “Waishnavee” directed by his wife Sumithra was based on a story he penned. More than ever, there is a crying need to restore all his movies digitally and release them on blu-ray with English subtitles through a label such as Criterion for the world to get to know him even more closely.
This year’s Sarasaviya Awards is a convergence of fortunate coincidences – a tribute to a journalist who crossed over to an entirely new medium and changed it forever - from a newspaper that stood by that medium through its ups and downs and an organisation that has nurtured local cinema almost from the moment of independence. The winners tonight will no doubt be inspired by the vision of Lester who aspired to take local cinema to global theatres. Yes, a Sarasaviya Award is a treasure to behold, but even more so, a measure of success that calls for more creativity, better artistry and finer storytelling. May the best win tonight.
