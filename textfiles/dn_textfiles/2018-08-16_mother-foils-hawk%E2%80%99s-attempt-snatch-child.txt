Mother foils hawk’s attempt to snatch child

A woman in Veluwanagama, Anuradhapura, prevented a hawk from snatching her seven-year-old daughter, by attacking it with an ekel broom on Tuesday.
The child, Devmini Amaya, had sustained injuries to her back and was later treated at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital.
A youth had then captured the hawk and handed it over to officers attached to the Anuradhapura Wildlife Assistant Director's Office. Officers said the bird was of the oriental honey buzzard species.
Villagers said the bird had attempted to snatch four other children the previous day.
The girl's mother, 30-year-old Ashoka Malani, said that she was sweeping their home garden while her daughter was playing when the incident occurred.
She added that the hawk had grabbed her daughter's back and attempted to peck her head.
Wildlife Range Officer Upali Jayawardena said that the bird probably came to the village in search of food due to the prevailing dry weather, adding that the bird would be soon released into a sanctuary.
A similar incident had occurred in 2015, when a mother of a seven-year-old boy had foiled the attempt of a hawk to snatch her son bathing in the Thuruwila tank in Hidogama.
