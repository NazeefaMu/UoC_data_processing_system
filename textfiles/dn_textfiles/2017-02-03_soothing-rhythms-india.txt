Soothing rhythms from India

The evening was a beautiful and pleasant one. The effort put into the dances was certainly commendable and well appreciated. The boys had great vigor and passion. They were quite dazzling. It was obvious that they had trained well and that they put in 100 percent.
The Daily News witnessed ‘Taal Taranga,’ an Odissi dance recital presented by the Rudrakshya Foundation, performed last week at Bishop’s Auditorium. The dance by the boys was followed by some remarkable dance acts. The young ladies who were elegant and graceful in their fluid movements. All performers showed an energy and maturity that was obvious. Their commitment certainly was laudable. Dressed in bright colors they guaranteed that there was not a boring moment in the evening.
They were trained by Guru Bichitrananda Swain, a legend in India. He has carved a niche for himself as one of today’s leading Odissi choreographers and has earned wide critical acclaim for his work in Odissi.
Rudrakshya has performed in many countries such as South Africa, the Ivory Coast, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, Canada and the US.
On the occasion of the 68th Republic Day of India, the Indian Cultural Centre held the Odissi Dance Recital - Taal Taranga. The event was graced by the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu and Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages, Mano Ganesan. The event was organized by the Indian High Commission in Colombo.
“It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you all to this special cultural performance on the eve of the 68th Republic Day of India. I recently came to Sri Lanka and presented my credentials to President Maithripala Sirisena. This is my first formal event as the High Commissioner. However, I have had the privilege of serving as a diplomat in Sri Lanka earlier,” said High Commissioner Sandhu.
The High Commissioner praised Sri Lanka as a beautiful and friendly country and said that Sri Lanka remains close to his heart.
“I look forward to renewing my old friendships and making new ones. I am delighted that on this special occasion, we are able to present before you an Odissi Dance Recital by the well- known group Rudrakshya from Odisha. India and Sri Lanka share cultural, religious, linguistic and civilizational ties that go back more than two millennium. An event as today’s performance are a manifestation of the continuing close cultural ties between our two countries,” pointed out High Commissioner Sandhu.
The High Commissioner also mentioned that Odissi comes from Odisha, the ancient land of Kalinga associated with Emperor Ashoka embracing Buddhism makes today’s event particularly special.
“It demonstrates that the strong links forged between our two countries since the time of Ven. Arahat Mahinda the son of Ashoka in fourth century B.C. continues today.
These bonds of friendship are underpinned by continuing people to people contacts. India remains the largest source of tourists for Sri Lanka, last year more than 350,000 Indian tourists visited Sri Lanka while more than 200,000 Sri Lankan tourists visited India. We have more than 150 flights a week between our two countries,” explained High Commissioner Sandhu.
The two governments are working closely to deepen bilateral connectivity even further.
“I am confident that our close cultural ties will continue to strengthen. The High Commission through the Indian Cultural Center has been showcasing to Sri Lanka audiences examples of Indian Culture and traditions. I look forward to many such events during my tenure as High Commissioner here in Sri Lanka. I also want to commend the hard work done by the Indian Cultural Center,” added High Commissioner Sandhu.
Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages, Mano Ganesan delivered a short but thought-provoking speech.
“Now it is the era of peace in Sri Lanka. It is a time of national co-existence and reconciliation. I believe our two countries can join hands. It is a win -win situation for India and Sri Lanka. India is booming economically and this can be reflected in Sri Lanka. We anticipate that there can be a free trade agreement, very soon. This too will be something positive for both our countries. I am a Sri Lankan and I am happiest at the prospects of relations between our two countries. Therefore, I believe an occasion like today is very important,” said Ganesan.
