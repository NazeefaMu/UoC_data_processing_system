Automakers divided over safety, tax benefit for small cars

The automotive industry is vertically divided over a government policy that encourages production of small vehicles: lower tax on cars and SUVs measuring 4 metres or less.
One side opposes the differential treatment, arguing that it would be tough to meet the upcoming crash and emission regulations while also staying within the vehicle length rules to claim the tax benefit.
Manufactures on the other side who want it to continue say small cars, too, can meet any safety or emission standards. Everyone agrees that the policy has helped make India one of the largest manufactures of small cars in the world.
But small cars made in India for local sales had often failed crash tests, such as those conducted by UK’s Global NCAP, even as the manufacturers claimed that they were made according to rules in India where the tests weren’t compulsory. From October 1this year, however, all new models sold in India will have to be put through crash tests.
“What happens in the future … with new crash regulations and new emission regulations,” asked Vikram Kirloskar, vice-chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motors. In sub-fourmetre vehicles, especially in diesel cars, the passenger compartment will get squeezed if they are to effectively meet the crash and emission regulations, he said. “So you lose a lot of stuff … will not be able meet these safety norms.”
Passenger vehicles with length up to 4 metres and 1.5 litre or smaller engines attract a 12.5% excise duty, the lowest in the industry. Beyond that, the the tax rate can range from 24% to 30%. Carmakers launched a slew of sedans and SUVs smaller than 4 metres to get the tax benefit. Some added a boot to their hatchbacks, while some others chopped a little tail from longer sedans to stay within the limit.
Between April and November last year, 41.3% of the total passenger vehicles sold India measured between 3.5 metres and 4 metres and had engines of up to 1.4 litre. To be sure, Toyota Kirloskar, the local unit of Toyota Motor, has not been very successful in India’s small car space.
