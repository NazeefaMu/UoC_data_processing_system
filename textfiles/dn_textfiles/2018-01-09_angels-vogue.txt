Entrepreneur, philanthropist and fashion icon Otara Gunawardeene graced the occasion as the Chief Guest and the entire event was organized by Colours Of Art Events and Décor.
The evening began with the unveiling of the Angels, where the male models in linen pants from Dilly and Carlo and female models in vibrant hand painted sarees from Benares, walked the ramp adorned with beautiful angels wings.
This was followed by a stunning collection from Shopping Girl and casual and smart office wear from Dilly and Carlo. Aussie Swim Store had an exciting range of beach and swim wear and Kadpatha featured a range of elegant evening wear.
The models were dressed in shoes by Lakshmis and Skechers, with accessories from Stone – n – String, Vision Care and Turret. Hair styling and make up was done by salon Head Turners.
The fantastic dance performances kept the audience enthralled and the end of the glamorous evening saw them mingling about whilst enjoying canapes and drinks. This enchanting evening ended with refreshments and entertainment.
