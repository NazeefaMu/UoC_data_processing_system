Canine Lessons

Dogs are such phenomenal teachers for us. They teach us about gratitude, love and compassion, being present, and joy. But they teach us more than that.
1. Looks can be deceiving
Don’t judge a book by its cover; a very big man or woman can be hiding inside any body.
2. Allow fresh air and wind in your face whenever possible
Dogs truly do know how to live in the moment. I don’t stick my head out the car window, but I try to appreciate the spring smells and fresh air. Dogs aren’t thinking about tomorrow, they are excited for this very moment all the time. You can be too.
3. Be loyal
If only we could all be the person our dogs think we are. When you think you’ve lost everything, take a good look around, I guarantee your dog will still be there, full of love and admiration.
4. Never to pretend to be something you’re not
Dogs don’t care what other dogs think. They have adorable personalities and we love them for it. Embrace your own adorable personality.
5. You are never too old to play
Life is short, so have fun and stop taking everything so seriously.
6. When loved ones come home, always greet them
Take an opportunity every day to tell those who mean the most to you that you are happy to see them.
7. Stretch before rising
This is a good one to follow especially as we get older. I often see my dog stretching into “downward facing dog.” It makes me smile every time.
8. Avoid biting when growling will do
Stand up for yourself, but no need to be unnecessarily aggressive or harmful.
9. Forgive
Don’t hold grudges, even if someone hurt you; you have the choice to forgive.
10. Show compassion
Dogs are kind souls, full of compassion and love. In times where I have been upset, my dog is the first one to cuddle and comfort me.
11. Trust your instincts
Trust your initial instincts of a situation or person, before you let the mental chatter in your mind tell you you’re wrong. Your gut instinct is usually correct.
12. Things don’t matter
A dog can have the best time with an old worn out ball. You can find joy in small things. Lose your obsessions over materiality.
13. Go for walks every day
Dogs are oddly excited by going for walks whereas some days I feel I have to convince myself to go. Appreciate the opportunity to get outside and be within nature; take in the smells, sights and feelings.
14. Love unconditionally
Love yourself, your friends, your kids, your family, your job, your community and most of all, love mother earth.
15. Get lots of rest
You know the old saying, let sleeping dogs lie. Dogs love to sleep, and we should not downplay our need for rest either.
