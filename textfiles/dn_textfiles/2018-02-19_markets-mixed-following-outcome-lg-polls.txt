Point of view
Equity markets remained relatively calm following the outcome of the LG polls which showed a landslide victory for the Former President’s proxy party over the existing coalition Government’s political parties.
Markets reversed the uptrend it experienced over the last three weeks (+129 points) but the overall negative position ( -8.60 points) was marginal as a 40 point loss in the immediate aftermath of the election results, was immediately offset by an ~31 point recovery over the latter half of the trading week.
Despite the benchmark Index’s overall stability over the week ,daily average turnover levels fell ~27% to Rs.0.72Bn this week, down 15% from the average of Rs.0.85Bn over the last three weeks.
Sluggish market turnover levels were driven by the low HNI and Institutional investor participation levels which fell to ~13% over the week, 12% lower than the average participation levels of 25% in Feb’18 and significantly lower than the average participation levels of 62% in Jan’18.
Meanwhile, net foreign inflows to the market which showed a declining trend throughout most of the week, closed the week as a net positive (Rs.0.49bn) as the domestic equity sell-off was reversed with the net inflow of 0.11Bn on Friday.
In bond markets too, foreign investors sold government securities following the ruling coalition parties’ LG election defeat1, pushing the LKR down to 154.78 (against the USD) by week end (cf. 154.31 the previous week).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum while continuing gather cues from the ongoing corporate earnings releases for the Dec’17 quarter.

Policy rates unchanged as inflation and credit fall
The CBSL held policy rates steady at its 1st Monetary policy review for the year, with the Monetary Authority sounding relatively positive on the back of better inflation and private credit numbers.
The move which was widely anticipated by markets left the key standing deposit facility rate (SDFR) unchanged at 7.25% while the standing lending facility rate (SLFR) was kept at 8.75%. The CBSL noted that due to timely monetary and fiscal policies, the economy has stabilized with private sector credit moderating to desired levels and export earnings reaching an all-time high of ~$11.4Bn in 2017 due in large part to the increase in export earnings from the restoration of the GSP+ to the EU, favorable prices for key commodities in global markets and a flexible FX policy maintained by the CBSL.
The Bank also noted that stronger tourism earnings and better FDI flows in 2017 have led to gross official reserves of $7.7Bn by Jan’18 and a depreciation of 0.9% against the USD so far this year.
The significant slowdown in urban food inflation levels in Jan’18 meanwhile, is expected to be reflected in national inflation levels for the month and the CBSL anticipates both headline and core inflation levels stabilizing at targeted mid-single digits during the remainder of 2018.
The Monetary Authority cautioned however, that the economy is currently operating at a level below potential and that the country’s overall fiscal performance is expected to deviate from target mainly due to the increased flood & drought related relief expenses and some slippages in revenue collection.
