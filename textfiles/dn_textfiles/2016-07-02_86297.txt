THE COACHES SAY

Nilfer Ibrahim (Isipathana College)
“Since both teams are equally good it’s going to be a cracker of a match. This Peter’s side is a balanced one unlike in the past. We have lost to them in the 7’s final year before and this has made us more determined. We have changed our game plan and patterns of play for this match. I don’t underestimate them because they are a good side. We will go out there with confidence and win the semi-final.”
Colin Denish (St Peter’s College)
“Isipathana are the league champions and we are going into this match as the underdogs. We need to capitalize and grab all the opportunities that come our way if we are to win this semi-final. We have got our pattern of play and the momentum right in our last three games where we ended up victorious. We are going into this game with the same confidence and will do everything possible to pull off a win.”
Sanath Martis (Royal College)
We have done our home work well by rectifying our previous short comings. It’s going to be a cliff hanger, but we are trying our best to win and getting to the finals.
Tevita Tulagaese (S. Thomas’ College)
“This match with Royal College should be a good one and the boys will go out there and play well while enjoying the game at the same time. We have a very good opportunity to win and let’s see what will be the outcome.”
