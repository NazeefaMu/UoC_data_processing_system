‘IPM NHRC 2018 to Revolutionize HR in a Digital World’

IPM Sri Lanka, held its Annual National Human Resource Conference at the BMICH recently which explored the opportunities and challenges for organizations, its people, human resource management and HR professionals in an increasingly digital world.
“Transformation of HR in the Digital World” was the theme of the Conference which is a much looked forward to event by the HR and business fraternity in Sri Lanka. The IPM NHRC 2018 is considered to be the largest HR conclave in South Asia.
IPM NHRC 2018 organizing committee headed by Priyankara Seneviratne, Chairman and his team put together a compelling agenda over the two days.
The Conference was inaugurated with the lighting of the traditional oil lamp by the Chief Guest Navin Dissanayake, Minister of Plantation Industries, Keynote Speaker Mark. G. Prothero, Chief Executive Officer, HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives, IPM President, Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri, IPM CEO, P. G. Tennakoon, Chairman Organizing Committee IPM NHRC 2018,Priyankara Seneviratne and other invitees.
IPM President, Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri said, “I have a personal perspective in this year’s conference theme. Digitization is the current fad, currency and focal point. In my view this is only another phase that we are going through, a phase of change and disruption.
“HR leaders, managers and policy makers have a huge challenge ahead of them when formulating national HR goals into the macro picture. I as a policy maker find it rather frustrating that we as a country do not have an HR roadmap of what human resource management, how it can be formulated, how it should be done and could be done,” the Minister said.
Several other events including panel dissuasions were held.
The grand finale of the IPM Great HR Debate was held soon after the inauguration of the Conference at which Toyota Lanka emerged as winners while MAS Capital emerged as runners up. Hayleys Plantation Sector which was selected as the organization with the most unique HR initiative in the IPM Great HR Practices competition shared their thoughts on the unique initiative with the audience.
