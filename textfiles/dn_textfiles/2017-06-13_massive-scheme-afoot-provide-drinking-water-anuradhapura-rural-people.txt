Massive scheme afoot to provide drinking water for Anuradhapura rural people

Every possible step will be taken to provide drinking water to the people in rural areas of Anuradhapura in view of the fast spreading CKDu (Chronic Kidney Disease of uncertain etiology), the Anuradhapura District Agriculture Committee (DAC) said.
The DAC head and Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake said the JICA funded Maha Kanadarawa water supply scheme is now under construction as a major step in this regard.
The kidney disease are spreading in 22 divisional secretariat divisions, healthcare surveys show. Many patients were reported from the Kebithigollewa, Rambewa, Medawachchiya, Mihintale and Padaviya divisions. The Mahakanadarawa tank based Anuradhapura north water supply project is built at a cost of Rs. 14,896 million with the financial assistance of Japan International Corporation agency, Wanninayake said.
Drinking water will be provided to 100,000 families in the Rambewa, Medawachchiya and Mihintale divisions in 75 Grama Niladhari divisions from the Mahakanadarawa water supply project. Project Director Engineer DB Gunadasa said the construction work of the project will be completed by November 2018.
The second phase of the Anuradhapura north water supply programme will see the construction of a massive water supply scheme using the water of the Wahalkada reservoir, he said.
