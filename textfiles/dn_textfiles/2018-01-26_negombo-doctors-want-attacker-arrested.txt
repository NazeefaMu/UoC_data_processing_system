Negombo doctors want attacker arrested

Government Medical Officers’ Association GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said Negombo Hospital doctors would launch a strike next Monday if the law enforcement authorities did not arrest the doctor who attacked the GMOA Executive Committee member - an observer of the recently held Sri Lanka Medical Council Election.
The injured doctor is under treatment at the National Eye Hospital. The law should be implemented against the attacker, he said. He was addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday
Dr. Herath said the attacker was posing as a consultant and providing channelling services at a private hospital in Battaramulla.
