Nations Trust Bank launches Digital Lifestyle Partner App

FriMi, a digital lifestyle partner, powered by Nations Trust Bank, was launched recently at ODEL, Colombo 07 and is a next-generation electronic payment, banking and marketing platform that allows users to make payments, send and receive money, do their banking and enjoy the best offers and discounts all through one simple App.
For the first time in Sri Lanka, using FriMi, it is now possible to open an electronic bank account 100% online without a visit to a physical location.
Every FriMi account is also a savings account with Nations Trust Bank that earns an attractive interest rate on the available balance, something not offered by any other similar service.
FriMi is accepted at a wide range of merchants and retailers and paying for purchases is as simple as walking through a checkout counter using either NFC enabled pay and go functionality, or scanning a QR code built into the app or merely by quoting the user’s mobile number or FriMi ID to the cashier. By using an Apple or Android smartphone, FriMi can be downloaded through the app store or at www.frimi.lk.
Speaking about the launch of the platform, Renuka Fernando, CEO, Nations Trust Bank said, “The launch of FriMi is a major milestone on our bank’s digital journey."
"It is the culmination of a lot of research and hard work put in over a period of time, towards our aspiration of initiating a paradigm shift in the Sri Lanka financial and payment services market. With FriMi we are providing a state of the art, transformational digital customer experience, which goes beyond the boundaries of banking.
Our bank’s vision is to enable our customer to meet their financial goals and aspirations, throughout their lifecycle. This is a decisive step towards our vision and our goal of giving all our customers an unmatched, highly personalized, financial journey based on their lifestyle needs.”
The FriMi App is available on both Android and iOS and is completely free to use with no hidden fees or charges. Users can deposit cash to their FriMi accounts at selected merchants, all Nations Trust Bank branches and CDMs, electronically via direct bank transfers and by requesting and or receiving money from other FriMi users.
