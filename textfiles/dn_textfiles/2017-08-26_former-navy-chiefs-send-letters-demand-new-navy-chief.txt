Former Navy Chiefs send letters of demand to new Navy Chief

 Former Navy Chief Commander Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda and retired Rear Admiral Vijaya Bandara have sent Letters of Demand to the newly appointed Navy Commander Admiral Travis Sinniah, stating that his recent statements to the CID earlier this year, had been extremely damaging to the reputation of former Navy Commander and Rear Admiral Vijaya Bandara.
Sinniah was called as a key witness to the ongoing high-profile case involving the alleged abduction of eleven persons in 2008 by Navy personnel. During his statements, reports confirmed that Admiral Travis Sinniah made the following statement: “Commodore Udaya Keerthi Bandara was aware of the existence of a torture chamber/detention centre in the Gunsite at the Trincomalee Navy Base and those who were detained at Gunsite numbers 1 and 2 had been murdered and the former Navy Commander and his staff were aware of it.” Taking the recent events into consideration, Attorney-at-Law Wasantha Wijewardane, Counsel for Admiral Karannagoda as well as Rear Admiral Bandara, informed Sinniah by letter dated August 13, their decision to proceed with defamation cases over the accusation.
