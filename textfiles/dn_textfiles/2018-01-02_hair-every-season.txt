The annual graduation ceremony of the Ramani Fernando Sunsilk Hair and Beauty Academy was held for the successive twelfth year to celebrate the accomplishments of the Graduating Class of 2017. Followed by the much anticipated hair show of the year ‘Hair Art 2017’, the ceremony was held at the Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo recently with the participation of Rosy Senanayake as the Chief Guest and other distinguished guests.
Choreographed by Senaka De Silva, ‘Hair Art 2017’ showcased talents and skills of 150 students from the Ramani Fernando Sunsilk Hair and Beauty Academies located in Colombo, Kandy and Negambo. The show opened with the ‘Narilatha’ dance act by the Channa Upuli Performing Arts Foundation and progressed to three themed segments. The first segment ‘ Global Hair Inspirations’ showcased hair and beauty trends from Egypt, China, Africa, Japan, Peru and Spain; this was followed by the ‘Colour Harmony’ segment which presented haircut and colour styling trends for 2018; and the final segment ‘Silhouettes After Dark’ presented hairstyling trends for long hair in 2018.
