Police commends Army soldier

The Dematagoda Police Traffic Division in a letter of appreciation to the Directorate of Army Training at the Army Headquarters has commended a soldier.
He was appreciated for supporting in arresting a fleeing driver knocking down a vendor who was crossing the road near the Mount Mary Junction along the Baseline Road.
Lance Corporal M.A.N.P.T Manathunga of 11 Sri Lanka Signal Corps (SLSC), attached to the Directorate of Training at the Army Headquarters, was in the Dematagoda area along the Baseline Road on December 12, 2017 around 4.15 pm when he spotted a king coconut vendor crossing the road pushing his cart, being knocked down by a speeding car.
The soldier immediately attended to the victim, carried him to the roadside and sent him to hospital. Then he chased the car on his motorcycle, neared the car and provided its number to the police officers serving near the Orugodawatta Junction.
Then he roughed to the Colombo National Hospital only to witness that the victim had already died. Corporal Manathunga then visited Dematagoda Police and provided the details about the car to police.
Following information given by the soldier, the driver was arrested.
The Police in the letter pointed out that the soldier is "a pride to the Army and a role model to the civil society".
