Siddhalepa commemorates UN Vesak

Siddhalepa Ayurveda Hospital exhibited Vesak lanterns made by Siddhalepa staff for the 28th consecutive year to mark Vesak from 10 to 13 at Mt. Lavinia Hospital premises. A large crowd visited the hospital to listen to Bhakthi Gee performed by Siddhalepa staff.
The newly opened Siddhalepa Anarva Hotel in Mount Lavina also organized a “Kadala Dansala” on May 11 and 12. Mount Lavinia Police staff’s Bhakthi Gee was also sponsored by Siddhalepa this time.
