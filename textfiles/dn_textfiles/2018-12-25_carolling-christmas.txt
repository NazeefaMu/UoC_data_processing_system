Carolling at Christmas

Carol singing during Advent and at Christmas is a great tradition worldwide. Whether it is pipe music played in the shops and in shopping centres or groups of singers or musicians basking at the roadside or in subways, these seasonal melodies render the festive spirit.
‘Carol’ is a medieval word of French or Anglo- Norman origin, believed to mean a circle dance, accompanied by singing. Carols commemorating the birth of Jesus were written in the 4th and 5th centuries, but they did not become associated with Christmas until the 13th century. Saint Francis of Assisi is often credited with incorporating upbeat Latin Hymns into Christmas services. In 1223 he also started Nativity plays in Italy. People in the plays sang the songs or ‘Canticles’ that told the story of Jesus’ birth during the plays. These new carols spread to France, Germany and other European Countries.
Before carol singing in public became popular, there were sometimes official carol singers called ‘waits’ because they only sang on Christmas Eve. These were bands of people led by local leaders who had the power, in the towns and villages, to take money from the public. Also at this time, orchestras and choirs were being set up in the cities of England and people wanted Christmas songs to sing. So carols, once again became popular. Many new carols such as ‘Good King Wenceslaus’ were also written during the Victorian period.
New carols services were created and became popular, as did the custom of singing carols in the streets. The popularity of both these customs still continues.
The most famous type of carol service today is the Festival of nine lessons and carols, where carols and Bible readings tell the Christmas story. Such carol services are held all over the world. In Colombo, carol services are an important part of Christmas. Leading up to Christmas, the annual carol service of the Sri Lankan police, lead by the police band and choir, was a very popular event. St. Lucia’s Cathedral in Colombo, where we worshipped, held its well attended annual carol service in the Cathedral Square. In 1962, this event was combined with the highly successful Nativity Pageant.
In the 1950’s and early 60’s, the Colombo Chetty Young Men’s Association choir ‘took to the streets’ after midnight mass. This was our ethnic community choir. This ‘tour by night’ of about 20 choristers, commenced after midnight mass. Together with the instrumentalists who accompanied the four vocal parts, the choir boarded the illuminated articulated truck with open sides. During the six hour tour, the carol truck did stop and sing two carols at each house of the community members, living in the two suburbs of Colombo. This joyous exercise continued until dawn on Christmas day. As children, we enjoyed this. It was a formidable undertaking, by the choirmaster. We had weekly rehearsals from September each year.
In the UK our experience of carolling matched the one we had in our homeland. We participated in the congregational carol singing in the churches in different parts of the UK I worked in. Of special significance was the Yorkshire Regional Health Authority carol service held at the York Minster, which is the main Cathedral in Yorkshire This Service of Nine Lessons was a fantastic event and I am privileged to be a part of, for eight to ten years of my tenure, working in the Health Service, in Yorkshire. The list of carols and music was sent in September to the lead chorister in each participating hospital.
Choristers from each hospital unit, rehearsed in four parts weekly. On the day (usually Wednesday before Christmas), all the choirs – a total of about 500 choristers - assembled at the York Minster at 1400hrs for a two hour joint rehearsal, conducted, at that time, by the retired organist of the Minster, Dr Francis Jackson. The choir did reconvene at 1900hrs in the Nave of York Minster, for the Service of Nine Lessons, which started at 1930hrs. This concert was indeed a phenomenal event.

Christmas Carols convey the Joyous message of the Birth of Jesus. Congregational Carol singing is a tradition that will continue, all over the world. In today’s secular and consumerist society, where Christmas is focused on buying gifts, eating and drinking, Christmas Carols in streets and in shopping centres, will, at least in a small way, help to focus our minds, to the significance of the festive season.
