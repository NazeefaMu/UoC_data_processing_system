Collaborating for ‘Good Karma’

Time and again leading Sri Lankan film personalities like Gamini Fonseka, Chandran Rutnam, V Vamadevan, Ravindra Randeniya and Jayantha Jayatilleke have stressed the need for collaborations to add value to local cinema.
Collaborations have facilitated the fraternity to absorb expertise and global trends in filmmaking from the international sphere. A Sri Lankan cinema personality like Errol Kelly made his name known internationally, due to his involvement in collaborative ventures.
Regional collaborations paved way for Sabeetha Perera to become the best actress in Pakistan. Hollywood movies like Bridge on the River Kwai, Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, Mountain in the Jungle, Rampage and Machan were shot in Sri Lanka on location as collaborations. Bridge on the River Kwai won a many Academy Awards exposing the scenic beauty of our country to the whole world.
At this juncture more facilities and concessions should be offered to collaborative ventures to rejuvenate local cinema and develop its market. In the process the brand Sri Lanka too will consolidate its positioning in the world map.
The Film Team and Good Karma Hospital
The Film Team (TFT) conducted a special event at JAIC Hilton with the participation of Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake, film stars Sriyani Amarasena, Lucky Dias, Sabitha Perera, Sangeetha Weeraratne, and Yashodha Wimaladharma and journalists to announce completion of its collaborative TV production, The Good Karma Hospital.
TFT is an entity formed a decade back as a Locations Service provider for production of International motion pictures in Sri Lanka.
It has convinced Tiger Aspect Productions (UK) to produce their TV series The Good Karma Hospital in Sri Lanka, which was originally scheduled to be shot in India.
Tiger Aspect’s decision to work with TFT was based on the latter’s professional and successful handling of many international film productions over the last 10 years, to name a few, Emden Men (Germany), Midnight’s Children (Canada), Bombay Velvet (India), Jekyll & Hyde (ITV-UK), Dream Hotel (Austria). TFT is poised to make Sri Lanka the ideal filming destination on forecasting the numerous and multifaceted benefits in store.
The story of TheGood Karma Hospital revolves around a junior doctor, Ruby Walker, who arrives in India looking for a job and a distraction from her heartbreak. She anticipates the sunshine and picture-perfect beaches. What she doesn’t expect are the realities of work, life and even love at an under-resourced and over-worked cottage hospital.
The TV series shot in southern Sri Lanka stars Amanda Redman, Amrita Archana, James Floyd and our own Nimmi Harasgama.
The Good Karma Hospital to be dubbed in Sinhala
The whole drama is so refreshing to watch and projects humour and entertainment at its best. One could recall the TV series Malgudi Days dubbed and telecast in Sri Lanka some years back when watching The Good Karma Hospital.
It is significant the drama shedding light on a life affirming, optimistic and contemporary story that blends with heart breaking and humour.
TFT member, veteran actor Ravindra Randeniya said The Good Karma Hospital telecast was on ITV PRIME TIME, reaching a record viewership of over seven million households in the UK. He said it has been re-commissioned for a second series to air in 2018 with filming to start in Sri Lanka in August 2017.
“We shot this TV series for five months in Galle, Weligama and Hikkaduwa. Colabarative ventures as these are very beneficial to our country as regards flow of foreign money into the country. Local artistes and technicians can enhance the status of their profession by involving in collaborative ventures. They get the opportunity to benchmark with world standards by working with experts. Our own internationally known film personality Errol Kelly is the production designer of The Good KarmaHospital,” said Randeniya.
He added, “The scenic beauty of our country is projected to the world via collaborative productions thus it is very beneficial to our tourist industry”.
Randeniya paid his courtesy to the state sector, police department, education ministry and the media for their support towards this lucrative venture.
TFT member Gopi Dharmaratnam said negotiations are underway with a reviving local TV channel to dub The Good Karma Hospital in Sinhala to be shown to Sri Lankan masses.
