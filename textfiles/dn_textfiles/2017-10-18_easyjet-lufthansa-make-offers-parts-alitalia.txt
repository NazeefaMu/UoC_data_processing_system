EasyJet, Lufthansa make offers for parts of Alitalia

Lufthansa said it hoped to establish a “new Alitalia”, but was only interested in parts of the existing business.
EasyJet said it had submitted an expression of interest but also only wanted “certain assets of a restructured Alitalia”.
Europe's airline industry is fiercely competitive, with Monarch and Air Berlin failing in recent weeks.
On Monday, the last of 110,000 Monarch customers who were abroad when the airline collapsed were flown home, according to the UK aviation regulator.
Ongoing competition from budget airlines, terror attacks in popular holiday destinations, and rising fuel prices have made it difficult for some airlines to keep going. Alitalia said it had received seven offers by the 17:00 GMT deadline on Monday and would now assess them. The Italian government has postponed the deadline for making a final decision over the Alitalia sale from 4 November to April 2018. The government also announced a further €300m (£267m) in loans on Friday to keep the carrier flying. (Gadgets)
