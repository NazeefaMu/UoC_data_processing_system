Tea bag  diaries

Apparently, there are many different ways to keep a diary and this unique artist from New York, Ruby Silvious, has discovered an amazing one. While some of us tend to throw away used tea bags after finishing our tea, Silvious reuses them - as canvases for her miniature paintings.
“The used tea bag is not very attractive. But while you may see a soggy, stained tea bag, I see a blank canvas,” the artist wrote earlier on Bored Panda.
“The visual diary records my impression of the moment using the used tea bag as a medium, altered to create a new work of art every day. I draw, paint and collage moody, evocative and sometimes whimsical art on the used teabag paper.”
Ruby Silvious began painting on tea bags in 2015 to push her creative practice and to share it on social media, hoping to spark a different kind of inspiration.
“People have this notion of what traditional art should be. I think reimagining the discarded as art inspires new forms of creativity,” claims Silvious.
“I hope that people who view my art are changed in some way, perhaps with a renewed belief in the art of the possible.”
