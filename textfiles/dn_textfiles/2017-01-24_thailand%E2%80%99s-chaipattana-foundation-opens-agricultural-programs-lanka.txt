Thailand’s Chaipattana Foundation  opens agricultural programs to Lanka

For the first time Chaipattana Foundation, a project started by the former King of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej, is opening up their sustainable based agricultural programs to Sri Lanka.
“The centre is now inviting Sri Lankan students keen in agriculture and also Agri based companies to come and study at the Bhumirak Thammachart Centre in Nakhon Nayok and take out their knowledge and implement in Sri Lanka, said Thailand Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Nopporn Adchariyavanich.
He said that the Centre offer courses ranging from one week to one month where a student would get to study all ancient theories of agriculture that is still being put to successful use. He said that they also provide accommodation and all other facilities at the centre.
Panya Pulivekin, Director of the Bhumirak Thammachart Centre in Nakhon Nayok said that students from other countries come and study and they also offer a certificate to successful candidates
The Chaipattana Foundation is a non-government organization, operating in Thailand since 1988 that develops projects of national and social benefit to the Thai people.
In 1989, the Chaipattana Foundation bought a piece of land covering an area of 6 acres near Khun Dan Dam in Nakhon Nayok Province. Later the Vajiravudh College Alumni Association under the Royal Patronage was given permission to use this piece of land as a learning project for former Majesty, King Bhumibol's Concept of Development.
Some of the products sold at the centre. 
Today, the Bhumirak Dhamachart Centre serves as a large museum which collects the concept and theories of the royal development project. It is divided into two parts including the Light & Sound Museum and the Living Museum.
While the former part is designed as a room of ideas behind key royally-initiated projects such the Royal Rainmaking and the New Theory for visitors to see, the latter part is designed as a farm displaying the real function of the ideas to promote better understanding about former King’s ideas for the royal development projects.
He said that today the centre is also a major tourist attraction and also a place frequently visited by students and agriculture schools.
He said that one simple theory introduced by the King was firstly to divide farmers land into 30-30-30-10 slots. "This means 30 per cent to pond or water reservoir, 30 per cent rice field, 30 per cent vegetable and fruit and 10 per cent to residential area."
According to the former Majesty’s theory, if farmers have water they will be able to grow enough rice, fruit and vegetables to feed their families, and may even have a surplus to sell."
He said that the Centre was created out of the King's concern to preserve nature near the newly built Khlong Tha Dan Dam, which is yet another brainchild of the former King. He said the former King said, "'Where there is forest there is moisture and where there is moisture there is rain. We must trap water at its origin by building dams, and then release the water for people to use in agriculture and this was how the dam came up in the area."
New techniques.

It was built in 2006 with an investment of 100 million baht with a dam of three kilometers long; the dam is 93 meters high making it one of the longest dams in the country. "This helped our project as well and it helped to create a new area with people who today are self sufficient."
Pulivekin, said that some of the simple sustainable agri theories can even be practiced at home. "For example if you fill a glass bottle with water tilt it at a 15% angle and leave it in the sun at 9 a.m. and take it exactly after 24 hours this water is very healthy."

He also said that puddles of water could also be blocked and kept to be sucked to the soil in the evenings enabling the earth to be moist all the time.
He said that the centre also treat human waste and convert them to electricity and the theory could be adopted successfully rural villages in Sri Lanka. We are ready to offer this technology to Sri Lanka."
Good soil is a very necessary resource for the agricultural occupation. Among former King’s various ways to improve the soil quality, there are two outstanding examples. The first one is the "use of vetiver grass" for soil conservation and erosion control. The use of vetiver grass has led Thailand to becoming one of the world's most successful and progressive centers for the application of vetiver grass technology for soil conservation and the erosion control. The success of this initiative has been recognized around the world, and led the International Erosion Control Association to present the former King, with its International Merit Award for excellent work as a soil and environment conservationist.
Some visitors to the centre. 
We also have a Vegetable Oil Refining and Bio-Diesel Integrated Production Plant which has served as a model for environmentally-friendly bio-diesel production. "This research on biodiesel production from palm oil (a brain child of former King,) has been awarded with the gold medal at the symposium of Brussels Eureka 2001.
He said that that also use a leaves of the plant, (Stevia) in place of sugar.

The former King's development concepts, theories as well as inventions received several international acclaims. "One of the most recognized acclaims is the United Nation's first Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award presented by Secretary-General, Kofi Annan."
"Annan stated that former former Majesty is the world's "Development King" who has reached out to the poorest and the most vulnerable people of Thailand - regardless of their status, ethnicity or religion."
"We are ready to offer these techniques to Sri Lankan companies which could then implement for productive use."
The novel way of storing drinking water
He said that the people in the area were poor and somewhat under educated. "These farmers and the rural locals due to implementing these simple affordable and practical approaches and techniques are able to improve their resources in order to make ends meet and become self-reliant."
"Not only should the Thai people, the fellow global citizens too also be able to gain benefits from these projects. We have reached the international arena by creating collaborations with institutions in different parts of the world and Sri Lanka too can benefit from our research and development."
He said that this concept came in to sharp focus and demand during the Asian financial crisis which started in Thailand. “Today I can say that the centre could house 6,000 people for six months at this centre and they can be fed with even river fish." (SS)
