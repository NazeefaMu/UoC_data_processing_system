Fundamental problem of Currency Depreciation

Policy-making on exchange rate and BOP
While market participants do businesses within their resources and market forces, there is an extensive network of state policy-making authorities in the area of fiscal, monetary, exchange, administrative and coordination/extension/marketing connected with exchange rate and BOP. Deliverables, policy instruments, statutory principles and powers of respective policy-making authorities along with Cabinet level supervisory lines are clear on paper. This is why some analysts blame the government for the BOP deficit and currency depreciation among many other causes.
The Central Bank always gets blamed on this subject while the names of other policymakers are hardly traced. The reason is the explicit and lead role of the Central Bank with a wide spectrum of monetary, exchange, credit and regulatory policies directly related to the subject as revealed from principles and provisions of the Monetary Law (effective from the establishment of the Central Bank in 1950) and Foreign Exchange Act (along with the Exchange Control Act operative from 1953 and repealed in July 2017).
The much-spoken intervention in the foreign exchange market to stabilize or control the exchange rate and the maintenance of the international reserve are only desk-jobs carried out by the Central Bank as there is no communication as to whether those are carried out as part of the wider monetary and foreign exchange policy aimed at finding solutions to the BOP and currency problem. Given the prevailing economic management bureaucracy of the country, the statutory roles of all state policy-making authorities are part and parcel of both the problem and the solution. However, at the last count, the exchange rate stability is the public duty of the Central Bank under both the law of the land and conventional central banking.
The problem solutions – some options
There is no doubt that the problem resolution will take at least a decade or more, given the geopolitical complexities that arise from both local and global fronts. The solution depends on whether the government, present or future, is able to align their economic policy package aggressively (monetary, fiscal, regulatory, administrative and marketing) towards the improvement of the country’s productivity to generate a BOP surplus on a sustainable basis. This is how many countries such as East Asian countries emerged in the world economy in the past. Policies such as export promotion zones are to create the productivity and comparative advantages on selected products through the ease of bureaucracy and provision of policy support within the particular zones without touching the general problem of the country’s low productivity.
China has extensively used this strategy to attract foreign direct investments in a large scale first and then to gain the productivity and competition through foreign investors/multi-national companies of the advanced market economies. As a result, productivity and competition have become borderless.
The new knowledge in the globalized world of resources, production, trade, technology and markets is now amply available for designing and implementing of new policy and business strategies. New markets are such that even corner-households around the world are in the global supply chain of the productivity, production, trade, capital and consumption that countries could utilize to uplift the living standards of the people. Therefore, Sri Lanka has no turn-back to the state-controlled closed economy model to solve the BOP problem and has to find solutions through the competition in the prevailing globalization.
As free markets are not permitted to fix the fundamental problem, the state economic management bureaucracy has to drive the solutions. Fact-finding reports and strategic reports can be made in any volumes at a cost to the public, but will not help to fix the problem unless the relevant bureaucracy touches the roots of the problem.
In this context, preparation of ultimate targets for the BOP surplus/deficit along with targets for key sub-sectors such as trade balance, current account balance, net foreign capital inflow and foreign reserve to be achieved in next 5-10 years, preparation of a list of broad policy areas and relevant authorities (from business approving authorities to the Central Bank, foreign business promoting institutions and diplomatic missions) that have statutory duties to contribute the achievement of the targets, getting plans of policy actions with targets of respective authorities (covering any area of export promotion, import substitution and foreign investment inflow as appropriate) to contribute to final targets, making required budgetary provisions for them and making them publicly accountable to respective line targets are required. This will not happen without the commanding role of the CEO and key management personnel of the state economic management team as in the case of business management firms.
If the new policy package is aggressively set in motion by the elected government, the market mechanism/private sector will eventually work to do the rest as usual. However, given the nature of public service and democracy prevailing in the country, this is by no means an easy task.
If this option is not feasible, another option is to revert the monetary system to the Currency Board system (similar to present Singapore and Hong Kong) that existed until the establishment of the Central Bank in 1950. Then, there will not be discretionary money printing against the local assets purchased by the Central Bank.
In this system, the Central Bank will print money only against the purchase of foreign exchange or global reserve currencies. In that context, people can have the currency/legal tender for economic transactions only if they run a balance of payment surplus. As a result, people will reposition all activities of the economy to gain productivity/comparative advantages for foreign trade. This is a good solution for island economies.
John Exter proposed a modern central bank for the country to have a discretionary monetary policy in view of the resource base and opportunities that Ceylon had at that time. Therefore, he empowered the Central Bank to have the national monetary policy covering both domestic front and international front to facilitate the country’s BOP (see sections 63(2), 65, 66 and 77(1) of the Monetary Law Act and 5(b) and 5(bb) of the Monetary Law Act up to 2002 -only few of provisions), foreign reserve and stabilization of international value of the currency.
However, the Central Bank has not done it continuously. Its new monetary policy approach is the one followed by the advanced market economy central banks which is the open market operations in the inter-bank overnight market to regulate its liquidity to maintain interbank interest rates within the interest rate targets announced by the Central Bank. Therefore, it is doubtful that the Central Bank will move out of this convenient desk-top monetary policy to abroad national monetary policy that has been empowered by the Parliament in 1949 as recommended by John Exter towards the BOP. However, the Central Bank as the public debt manager has been resorting to raise foreign borrowings for the government and own currency swaps with banks/foreign currency dealers at a loss to the country to build a foreign reserve in order to stabilize the exchange rate and finance BOP deficits through open market operations in the foreign exchange market. As a result, this borrowed reserve has primarily driven the money printing in the country. Therefore, nearly 70% to 85% of total money printing/Central Bank balance in the recent past has been based on the acquisition of foreign assets. In this context, the Central Bank is already a type of an unconventional Currency Board which prints money primarily backed by the proceeds of foreign borrowing as against the normal Currency Board’s system of printing money backed by the foreign trade surplus.
If both of above options are not feasible, ad-hoc policy-tinkering such as tax/tariff revisions, subsidies, administrative prices and advisory/consultancy reports prepared with the help of international experts initiated from time to time based on isolated political views would no doubt keep the economy and the BOP problem in the loop as has been in the past. In this environment, the private sector will find covered market trades and foreign exchange to finance their deficits. Illegal foreign remittances including money laundering will take place in covered markets as the country needs foreign exchange to continue with the exiting open economy model. In addition, foreign debt bubble will continue to expand to finance the official BOP deficit.
Handing the speculation connected with the currency
Meantime, as currency markets are highly speculative for quick profit on trade of currencies, governments have to use regulations to tame the currency dealers on real time basis as there are many dark corners in between the dealers and regulators. Manipulations in currency markets are globally well-known. Currencies of EMs generally do not appreciate although there are periods of stability due to tighter regulations and real business activities in the global front. In the event of lax regulations and shocks in the international economic and financial front, currency markets of some countries end up in turmoil. Those who are responsible for regulation of currency markets also should be responsible for currency turmoil too as they have not done their duty by waiting for disasters to happen. Therefore, excessive speculation or market manipulation also could be a major factor in unhealthy movements of the exchange rate. This situation has to be handled by specific regulations and investigations into market abuses of dealers by the regulators in order to curb the excessive speculation on the exchange rate.
One of the instances of currency turmoil after the Asian currency crises is the Turkey which is an economically advanced country heavily dependent on global trade and finance. Its foreign reserve declined from US$ 120 bn in November 2017 to US$ 103 bn in July 2018. Private sector foreign debt stood at about US$ 242 bn with short term debt accounting for only about 8% whereas total short-term external debt was about US$ 180 bn. Meanwhile, inflation rose to 16-18%. The central bank was handling the situation through short-term interest rates in the monetary policy to deal with capital flows as the foreign investment position was the foundation of the economy. Its currency which was around 3.8 lira per US$ in January 2018 started heavily depreciating to 6.3 on August 10, 2018. By August 13, 2018, currency depreciation rose to 6.92.
Therefore, the currency turned into turmoil causing contagion across many countries including several big European banks. At the onset of the turmoil, the central bank increased its policy interest rate by 425 basis points to 17.75% in May and June 2018. Yields on treasuries rose to 25% for two years and 22% for 10 years in Mid-August. Currency dealers were demanding more rate hikes everyday and the country’s President took the policy front to his hand and put the country on currency war front to settle the turmoil with the support of regional political dealers. As a result, the currency got back to just below 6 on August 20, 2018. However, it widely fluctuated between 6.20 and 6.50 later, despite drastic regulations, due to currency dealers pressing the central bank to raise interest rates. Inflation rose to 18%. Finally, the central bank raised one-week repo rate to 24% on September 13, 2018 by about 600 basis points and dealers were calmed down. As a result, the currency improved back to 6 per US$ within few hours. This shows that currency management is not something that can be done in standard economics due to its strong connections to geopolitical factors and speculative currency dealers.
Another example is how the Central Bank of Sri Lanka handled the speculative attack immediately after the float of the Rupee, i.e., moving to the flexible exchange rate regime without exchange rates announced by the Central Bank, on January 23, 2001. The Central Bank, similar to Turkey, implemented a tight exchange regulation policy package designed and fine-tuned under the wisdom and stewardship of the then Governor A S Jayawardena, a veteran central banker of all round, to control excessive speculation. The rupee was floated by dropping the exchange rate band of buying rate of Rs. 77.40 per US$ and selling rate of Rs. 85.13 per US$ under the managed float system that had initially commenced in November 1977 by moving out from the pegged/fixed exchange rate regime that prevailed before. As a result, the exchange rate depreciated to around Rs. 98 within the course of the next day in the inter-bank market due to collusive behaviour of some dealers identified as reckless.
Imposition of the maximum limit on forex position of banks, suspension of pre-payment of imports, 50% margin deposit on foreign currency forward sale contracts and recovery of accommodation to exporters only from export proceeds with maximum 90-day recovery period were the first-time unconventional monetary policies implemented to strengthen the supply of the dollar against the artificially speculative dollar holding in the market. The banks were examined on daily basis to ensure that they complied with the new requirements to the letter and spirit. The Governor got daily reports to follow up on the progress. With the policy package and aggressive moral suasion, the exchange rate got settled at around Rs. 85-86 within about two weeks. Few currency dealers were about to be punished, but settled amicably since the market became disciplined. This kind of market discipline cannot be achieved without an active and impartial regulator.
The same policy package was reimplemented in 2009 too to control a similar instance. Two of them, i.e., bank forex position limit and recovery of accommodation to exporters, are still effective, but with subsequent relaxations. Especially, if banks have been permitted to operate with higher limits of forex positions, they have a greater space for speculations at such times. Currency dealers care about profit and not the national interest of the currency value. Unlike in January 2001, the market now after 17 years must have developed to a high level of discipline under the surveillance of the Central Bank and any excessive depreciation of the currency has to be connected with some way of collusion of dealers if the Central Bank continues to state that the currency market conditions/fundamentals are not so adverse as various analysts explain. By now, currency dealers may have remitted out a lot of investments made in government securities to cut marked-to-market losses on currency depreciation which precipitates further currency depreciation and speculation as usual.
Once they get the currency depreciated to a high level they wish, they will get foreign investments back at cheaper prices. This is the usual speculative game seen in many countries. As these dealers and investors are well known to the Central Bank, they can be controlled only by the Central Bank. The outward-remittance of foreign exchange by low profile companies/shell-type companies (who do not earn any foreign exchange) in permitted amounts, but huge in total of all, annually to invest abroad which is not monitored by any regulator is also a significant threat to the borrowed foreign reserve of the country. This is another area which has a lot of dark corners. Therefore, a lot of micro-regulations is required in place of macroeconomic approaches to exchange rates to handle market manipulations. Only what the Government can do is to seek the assistance of friendly countries and multinational institutions to get some help to borrow Dollars. Definite consequences of the unsolved problem
In the current world economy and markets, there is no turn-back to a closed/controlled economy. If the BOP problem is not fixed through the improved productivity and doing globally competitive businesses, the BOP deficit has to be continuously financed from the Central Bank’s international reserve.
This international reserve is the foreign exchange cushion built primarily from proceeds of government foreign borrowing as there is no private sector BOP surplus for the Central Bank to purchase. In fact, foreign borrowing and international reserve are a spiral in the loop and it is the government foreign borrowing that will eventually finance the BOP deficits and protect the currency. The Central Bank projection to increase in the international reserve based on foreign receipts to the government is only a desk-top work to please the public and not a policy announcement. For example, the Central Bank in early May announced a projection for the increase in the gross foreign reserve from US$ 9.1 bn in May (a healthy level) to US$ 11 bn by mid-June 2018 out of proceeds of foreign loans and receipt on the lease of an asset to foreigners and communicated that a part of its unprecedentedly large foreign reserve could be used to trigger even a material appreciation of the rupee to prevent unwarranted depreciation of the currency, particularly as the depreciation is not justified by the underlying fundamentals. However, the gross foreign reserve at the end of June was only US$ 9.3 bn and the currency has further depreciated to about 162 to-date.
Mervyn King, the former Bank of England Governor and a veteran policy economist wrote…To retain credibility, it is important that central banks do not claim to know more than they in fact do. And it is clear that central banks are not able to provide accurate forecasts of their own actions. Policy must confront the fact that ‘stuff happens. Making forecasts is inherently difficult. They always turn out to be wrong…”
It is a terrible experience that a central bank which has so wide monetary powers to develop the foreign trade of the country and to hold a foreign reserve adequate to protect the currency projects to fulfil its national duty of maintaining a foreign reserve on the basis of government borrowings and government’s sale of controversial national assets to foreigners.
Therefore, the currency defense by the Central Bank by using the tiny, debt-ridden international reserve is only an administrative price control, despite the wide purview of the monetary and exchange policies of the Central Bank applicable to the subject. Only a part (not more than 60%) of so-called healthy foreign reserve of US$ 9 bn valued in modern accounting or forecasted US$ 11 bn is available for the currency defense due to other commitments and risks associated with foreign reserve assets. Further, this reserve is a rolled-over portfolio maintained primarily through the roll-over of government foreign debt and short-term currency swaps with banks. Therefore, given the underlying structural BOP problem, nobody can consider this kind of international reserve as a fundamental to protect the value of the currency and to maintain the investor sentiments. If the international reserve is raised to a magnitude of at least US$ 25-50 bn, we can be complacent to have some brave talks and keep the exchange rate at Rs. 160 or 155 or even 150 per US Dollar for some time. Since the market comes to know that the Central Bank keeps the exchange rate artificially over-valued through a subsidy granted from the country’s international reserve, the rising demand for cheaper foreign goods and services will eat the foreign reserve in no time. Even the short-lived memory tells us the lessons of failures of such currency defense or price control, including attempted appreciation of the currency in the recent past by selling several billions of the foreign reserve to the market.
Therefore, the direct danger of the unresolved BOP and exchange rate will be the transfer of the deed of an unmanageable stock of country’s foreign debt to the future generations. Rising foreign debt further to finance the current model of open economy and to protect the currency at whatever level possible from time to time will be a strong signal of the country’s on-going macroeconomic and systemic vulnerability. In the event currency dealers who are connected to international capital flows and foreign investors get activated at any time on various geopolitical reasons and links, the foreign debt bubble will burst and drag the country to economic and social catastrophe.
I hope above information and thoughts will provide some constructive inputs for a wider discussion to help policy-making authorities and market participants to design and implement desirable solutions in the wider national interest, despite diverse views and debates, if they really wish to commence now.
