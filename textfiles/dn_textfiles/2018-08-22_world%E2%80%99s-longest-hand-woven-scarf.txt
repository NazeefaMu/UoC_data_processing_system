World’s longest hand-woven scarf

A scarf measuring 35 inches wide and 3,772.3 feet long in Cambodia has been declared the world's largest hand-woven scarf by Guinness World Records.
The record-keeping organization said the scarf, woven from cotton in the style of a traditional krama scarf, was created by weavers from 20 Cambodian communities and visitors to the National Museum in Phnom Penh.
The scarf was measured and certified as a world record by Guinness adjudicator Swapnil Dangarikar. The record attempt was organized by the GoGo Cambodia organization. UPI
