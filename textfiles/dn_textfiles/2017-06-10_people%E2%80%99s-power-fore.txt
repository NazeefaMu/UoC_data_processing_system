People’s Power to the fore

Today we see the development of an anti racist rationalist people’s movement that critically supports the present Yahapalana government with the intention of establishment of democratic constitution. They see this change with a substantial devolution and the implementation of promises to remove corruption and violation of human rights.
Now many believe that without such a people’s movement, it will be impossible to go forward, defeating fascistic forces hell bent on conspiracy. In recent past several well attended meetings were called by the civil society leaders who worked hard for the democratic change that brought Yahapalanaya to power.
In these meetings Prof Sarath Wijesooriya, Gamini Viyangoda, Saman Rathnapriya, Weliamuna and others participated. Similar views were expressed by Azath Salley and Lakshan Dias speaking against rise of racism in the Lankan society. They point out that organised attacks were made to Christian and Muslim religious places in the recent weeks. “We have congregated here because we are losing faith in the present government. The Yahapalanaya government has been tripping and falling like small children. At first they had set backs once in three months, then monthly and now weekly. When we look at the statements of political leaders and Ministers, we see that they have been failing habitually,” said Gamini Viyangoda.
Equal political ideals
“The Yahapalanaya National Unity Government, unlike the previous coalition Governments, is very important politically. Coalition Governments were formed by parties, which had equal or almost equal political ideals. But for the first time two parties with opposing ideals have come together. This is why it is called a National Government,” he added. He noted that this was the first time a candidate came to power without representing any political party. “The candidate swore to be politically neutral, but after January 8 we saw him accepting certain responsibilities of the SLFP and the UNP. The fight for power between these two parties is augmenting day-by-day and we don’t see them equalizing.” They say sectarian party politics has entered Yahapalanaya and this why they see it falling and tripping.
“On January 8, 2015 it was the citizens of the country who truly liberated us. We were able to see how people who were hard black rocks become eroded to sand with the changes brought on January 8. The dictatorship was abolished and now we also have a strong Opposition. During the last regime, the people of our country were in fear of their lives. Even Sobitha Thera wanted to abolish the Executive Presidency before he passed away.
However, the people are losing faith in Good Governance, as promises are broken and - programmes have failed,” Prof. Wijesooriya said. “Ven. Sobitha Thera gave the previous Government a bill that consisted of 10 proposals that should be considered for good governance. However, the President and the Prime Minister dismissed these proposals. This was considered extremely disadvantageous for the Government. My main goal is for the Yahapalanaya Government to follow the conditions laid out by Sobitha Thera one day,” he added. He stated that one of the conditions of the 10 proposals had been to eradicate the Executive Presidency system.
“In one of Sobitha Thera’s birthday ceremonies the President and the Prime Minister promised to abolish it. However, this is still not carried through. From January 8 we wanted to build a new nation for the future of our children, with the help of all the people of the country. The Government should serve those who truly serve the country, instead of wasting money on the lavish lives of those who are internally involved with the Government. Many of the political leaders and high ranking Government officials of the last regime worked for their own selfish needs by committing fraud. They ran the Government in a wrong way. Those who were in the previous Government perpetually criticize Good Governance; however, they did not even admit their own past wrongs,” he added.
National democratic tasks
In any country the national democratic tasks should be completed for it to function as proper market economy accepted within the global capitalist framework. Among the tasks carried out, the democratization of the state by removing absolutist and dictatorial features in the state, and unification of the country by free association of all nationalities is most important. In the modern world, globally all eyes are watching what is happening. In spite of global powers led by US, truth inevitably comes out and leaders have to answer. The clash of opinions in UK after the terrible attack in London is an example of divisions within their societies. For an interested party, all views and deals within social groups are available for analysis.
Corbyn the Labour leader took a swipe at the Conservatives’ close alliance with Saudi Arabia and called for a clampdown on the funding of Islamist sectarian organisations in the UK. “We do need to have some difficult conversations starting with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States that have funded and fuelled extremist ideology,” he said. Corbyn questioned why, as disclosed by Guardian, PM May had failed to publish a report commissioned by David Cameron into funding of Jihad groups which is thought to focus on Saudi Arabia. At the same time the shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, said May’s statement on Sunday morning appeared to be a breach of an agreement with Labour to put aside political campaigning.
Thus the debates between the right and the left in countries such as US and UK show us the power of masses, in particular the workers in those countries. In the recent debate on environment, media exposed how multinational companies give money to Donald Trump to destroy the earth saving multinational agreements. In spite of himself, such evidence shows the power of big MNCs to push around ideological giants like fascistic Trump! Hence we cannot under estimate the power of international campaigns and international relations, in particular social and political links that represent people’s power.
Traditional left parties
In the past we saw a radical left mass movement developing in this country under the leadership of Vijaya Kumaranatunage. It was a spontaneous people’s movement that absorbed the traditional left parties. Vijaya started his political career in the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP). He later joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and became its first national organiser. He broke out from the SLFP as it stood against devolution, and he founded the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party (SLMP), which campaigned for peace demanding peace in the Sri Lankan civil war. Under his new party, he contested a Minneriya by-election and finished second, behind the UNP candidate—relegating his old party, SLFP, to third place.
In 1986, Kumaranatunage visited Jaffna, then controlled by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He visited the Nallur Murugan Temple and met with local Tamil civilians, as well as several LTTE youth leaders. In his final public address, to a large crowd in Colombo’s Campbell Park on January 28, 1988, Kumaratunge lashed out at the UNP, SLFP, and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) parties for failing to address the needs of the hour. He also voiced concerns about the SLFP’s links with the JVP, a ‘Marxist–Leninist’ Party involved in building a chauvinist patriotic movement.
In 1988, the SLMP reached an agreement with several other left-wing parties—including the LSSP, Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP), and Sri Lanka Communist Party, to form the United Socialist Alliance (USA). A few days prior to the establishment of the new alliance, Kumaranatunge was assassinated.
The agreement was signed by party leaders at his funeral. However movement collapsed without proper leadership though the USA won a large number of seats in the newly formed Provincial Councils in an election boycotted by the main opposition SLFP. It remains in the minds of radical democratic political activists who want to release LANKA from barbaric racism and the plunder of global capitalism of Donald Trump and La Pen.
