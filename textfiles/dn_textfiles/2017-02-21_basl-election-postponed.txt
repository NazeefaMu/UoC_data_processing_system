BASL election postponed

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) election scheduled to be held today (21) has been postponed due to a decision taken by Judicial Services Association (JSA) to refrain from acting as the Presiding Officers at the election, the BASL said yesterday.
BASL Secretary Amal Randeniya announced that the new date of election will be notified as soon as possible.The JSA had strongly objected to the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan, a lawyer practicing at the Private Bar in Batticaloa as a High Court Judge citing it is a violation of the constitution and judicial service tradition. In a letter to the President, the Secretary of the Association Mount Lavinia Magistrate M.M.M. Mihal had stated that this grave error can be corrected.
