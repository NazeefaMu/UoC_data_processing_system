SB dares organisers of Negombo meeting to provide attendees list

 
Social Empowerment Minister S. B. Dissanayake yesterday challenged the organisers of the former Local Councillors', meeting held in Negombo to provide the name list of the so called 1,401 who are said to have attended the meeting adding that only 750 were present and of them some 200 were defeated candidates.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday he said only 551 members out of the total 1,447 turned up for this meeting. A total of 33 former members from the Hambantota district did not turn up for the meeting. All seven MPs in the Polonnaruwa district are with President Maithripala Sirisena. "We regret about the efforts made to mislead the country".
According to Minister Dissanayake no decision has been taken to hold disciplinary inquiries against those who took part at the Negombo meeting but disciplinary inquires will be held against 10 persons named before. "Our aim is keeping the SLFP without being divided. If there will be a division, the SLFP will present excellent, educated candidates in contrast to the persons to be presented by the other side such as 'Udeni' who was caught by the Bribery and Corruption Commission while counting money received as a bribe."
Minister Dissanayake pointed out that the two articles of the SLFP Constitution amended by former President Rajapaksa to attack former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga boomeranged on him. That is how he had to step down from the Presidency of the SLFP. He totally destroyed the SLFP's minority vote base.
University Education Minister Mohan Lal Grero said that now he can carry out more work than before because he is working with Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella. "Some in both sides are dragging this government in two different sides.
Sri Lanka has received a golden opportunity to prove to the world that we are not guilty as stated by certain elements such as Channel 4. The SLFP will not be able to win an election even in 2020 without the support of the minority communities."
