Part of Colombo garbage to Karadiyana

The Kesbewa Magistrate’s Court yesterday permitted the disposal of garbage collected in the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) area to Karadiyana in Piliyandala until April 28. Municipal Commissioner V K Anura speaking to the Daily News yesterday said a part of the garbage collected in the CMC would be dumped at Karadiyana while the remainder would be sent to several other waste dumping sites. The Commissioner however, declined to name the “other sites” stating that revealing them may trigger public protests.
The Kesbewa Magistrate’s Court in May last year imposed a ban on the CMC to dump garbage collected in the municipality in Karadiyana following a motion filed by three petitioners. Upon a request made by the CMC in the wake of Meethotamulla tragedy, the Magistrate temporarily lifted the ban and allowed disposal of about half the collected garbage daily to Karadiyana temporarily.
The CMC commenced dumping garbage in Karadiyana yesterday. As reported, Police protection has also been provided to the site. The CMC collects about 800 tons of garbage daily. “We need the support of all for the onerous task of managing the Colombo’s garbage, because this garbage is not generated only by the people residing in Colombo. A large number of people in the offices , hospitals and schools in Colombo come from outstation areas.
If we are to deal only with garbage generated by the residents in Colombo, then it is a matter of about 100-150 tons,” he said.
