KEEPING POLICE MORALE HIGH

In the recent Digana incident that led to mayhem in the Kandy District, the flashpoint had been the bailing out by the Digana OIC of the four drunken youths who had allegedly assaulted a lorry driver. The latter happened to be a Sihalese and the suspects Muslims. When the suspects had been bailed out, the injured driver had been in a serious condition in hospital.
Why did the police treat the suspects lightly? A motorist causing serious injury to a pedestrian in a road accident where the pedestrian is blatantly at fault, the motorist is not released in this manner. He is detained in a police cell and produced before a magistrate at the convenience of the police.
One would usually have expected the Senior officers of the Digana OIC to have been surprised at the quick release of the suspects. Equally surprising is the fact that the police media spokesman has not come out with the reason. The public would like to know whether an inquiry was held and what were the findings. Had the OIC been bribed? Had a senior officer ordered bail? Had a politician intervened? Why did the Police of the District fail to promptly assess the sensitivity and explosive nature of the situation that led to the eruption and spread of violence?
Being a police blunder of national importance the failure of the Police Commission to initiate an investigation to ascertain the extent to which the police are culpable compels me to reasonably conclude that a politician of importance is involved!
Rabid racist organisations
Considering the fact that the country’s culture of public life has got sucked into the bottom of a cesspool it is reasonable to surmise that no investigation other than by a Special Presidential Commission comprising men and women of eminence and proven integrity will have the courage to fault a politician. Admittedly the Bond Commission is a noteworthy exemption. But that too galloped gracefully for some distance and trotted to a halt without reaching the winning post. The job was incomplete!
A question of immense concern arises with the public allegations and insinuations that the police failed to act with commitment when places of worship, shops and residences were being attacked and set on fire with impunity by criminal mobs. Whilst looking for a scapegoat, with evidence of rabid racist organisations with links to political big wigs and a handful of deviant politicos emerging, the government’s search for a huge carpet to shove the dirt under is also going on.
If a few irresponsible politicians and a sprinkling of hate goons and religious rabble linked to extremist political entities are able to transform the Sri Lanka Police that boasts of a proud history into a numb and moribund organisation it does pose a serious challenge to the governance of this country. With the recent shootings at Katunayake and Rathupaswela (albeit unlawfully by the Army) haunting the Police, guns have fallen silent. In the face of an apparent leadership vacuum the police seem to be under the delusion that they need “orders from above” to open fire even at violent mobs committing murder, grievous hurt or arson. Lacking in the knowledge of the law or acting on wrong instructions they readily shoot down motorists who may even unwittingly ignore a signal to stop. These roadside police shootings are manifestly illegal.
Police shooting at a mob committing acts of arson, murder, serious damage to property etc. is well within the law. Even a lone armed constable does not need orders from a superior to open fire under such circumstances.
Frenzied killers
Firing at a riotous mob is the only way to prevent the riot spreading resulting in further mayhem. Shooting to kill is the surest deterrent. And this is perhaps the only way to drive into the heads of frenzied killers that police mean business.
Barely one month after having learnt the above at the Police Training School that I entered as a Probationary ASP on 1st Feb. 1958, I happened to be thrown to the deep end when communal riots of a devastating nature broke out in May. With S.O.L. Gunatilleke the SP of Kalutara proving inadequate Stanley Senanayake, Director of Police Training was appointed by DIG Sydney de Soyza to oversee the District. With a state of Emergency on and Sir Oliver Goonatilleke in total command, ‘Shoot to kill’ was the order when I being the only Sinhalese among the Probationary ASP’s was put in charge of a substantial chunk of the coastal area up to Waskaduwa north of Kalutara and Bentota to the South.
Kalutara Town, Maggona and Beruwala were particularly bad. At Maggona Police had shot and killed a renowned prostitute well known as ‘Parashute’ when she was leading a gang of arsonists who were carrying cans of petrol.
Shooting with heavy, outdated, WW II Enfield.303 Rifles that gave a stinging recoil was shunned by constables who had the minimum of practice. With the G.A. Kalutara, A.M.S. Perera and the AGA Francis Pietersz extremely supportive, I was able to get about twenty shot guns and adequate No. 4 and No. 8 Cartridges from the Kalutara Kachcheri. One evening I myself fired at a crowd attempting to break into the Kalutara Pharmacy when the curfew was on.
Solely due to the unwavering leadership of Sir Oliver and his delegation of full authority to the Police, the riots that threatened to devastate the entire country soon subsided. Bandaranaike came out of virtual hiding. No death count was made. No enquiries or habeas corpus applications followed. Within a few weeks the country was back to normal.
In July 1983, when riots broke out at the Borella Kanatte I was in overall command of the Colombo Police as the DIG Metropolitan. At the helm of the state was executive President J.R. Jayewardena owing allegiance to voters. Unlike 1958 here was a powerful President, but because of his voter dependence a lame duck. SWRD, was able to side-step and hand over the baby to OEG perhaps the wisest state official we had in the 20th Century. Had the arrogant JR listened to IGP Rudra Rajasingham and General Sepala Attygalle, declared Emergency and imposed a curfew when the mayhem was approaching the Borella bazaar the police would have been able to act more effectively, albeit woefully short of manpower. The Army stunned by the Tinnavelly disaster was in a mutinous mood. This too was a worrying factor. Never had I seen JRJ in such a dejected and helpless mood.
Transparent inquiries
Although the country had suffered an irreversible set-back as never before in recent history he was convinced that the Colombo Police had done their best. It did not take too long for the OIC’s of all the Colombo Police Stations to be promoted to the rank of ASP. I am happy that most of them ended up as DIGs, Police morale continued to remain high.
If there are shortcomings on the part of the Police, condemning commissions or omissions by insinuation is cowardice. From the beginnings police officers have been punished under the Police Disciplinary code after full and transparent inquiries. Aimless general condemnation of the police by politicians, civil rights leaders and some sections of the media can be demoralizing. Demoralizing the Police can well be part of a well thought out sinister subversive plan. I trust the police intelligence units are alive to this.
When it comes to bad driving on the roads police are blamed. The authority issuing driving licenses is not even thought of. It is well known that politicians are behind the illicit timber trade, illicit sand and gem mining, cattle rustling, illegal land reclamation and even brothels and massage clinics! The broad brush used against the police is not used against these rotters. For the existence of the underworld, too the police are blamed. But who created the Kudu Rajas, Mandi Challis, Goni Billas, Wambotta’s etc.? Your guess is as good as mine. Not many weeks ago concrete evidence emerged proving the connection of politicians to the underworld. Did not a senior minister attempt to brow beat the STF Chief for attempting to arrest a notorious underworld criminal? Perhaps the minister was unaware that the incumbent STF head is the most respected Senior Officer in the Police today.
