A world of Waffles!

Whatever is happening in Sri Lanka, the food scene is really developing. Some of the biggest players in the game are Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Chinese Dragon. And now there is ‘The Waffle Café’. Now in Sri Lanka we are able access mouthwatering food which is available elsewhere in the world. Opening up the Waffle Café in Ethul Kotte is a result of Durga Kenny’s travels and it was only a matter of time before this innovative young lady executed the plan. Today the Waffle Café is growing in popularity due to its highly unique dishes. Daily News visited the Waffle Café and sampled some of the best food available.

“Normally Waffles are not the star of the show in other food outlets. It is a side dish. It comes with various other food items. At the Waffles Café it is very much the star of the show. Normally at other food outlets it is a flat kind of Waffle. It is not this deep kind of Waffle. We are the only place doing the Liege Waffle now. Give it two weeks, someone else will do it! It is totally traditional. In Belgium you would get people selling these Liege Waffles on the road. Those are very traditional and authentic. When it comes to Savory Waffles, the Waffles need to be lighter because the savories are very heavy,” said Kenny
At the Waffles Café the Liege Waffle is made out of dour. It is a ‘cooky bready feeling’. It is also made from Pearl Sugar, which is a special ingredient. When it cooks with the melting of the pearl sugar you get that crunch. You get a glaze on the top. The pearl sugar is made by the staff of the Café themselves.
“I really want to stay true to Belgium tradition in creating Waffles. There are three types of Waffles served at the café. One is the Savory Waffle, Vegetarian and the Sweet Waffles. The Sweet Waffles are served with the Liege Waffles. I have travelled to Europe and seen Vendors making it and the smell was amazing as it was winter at that time. I watched and then I learnt. There again they were serving the ‘Liege Waffles. So the concept for the Brussels and Liege Waffles are from Belgium but made in Sri Lanka.’,” pointed out Kenny.
Elsewhere Waffles would just be part of the regular Menu. Durga confessed she loves Waffles with Syrup and Butter and that too is available at the Café.
“The Waffles with Syrup and butter are so yummy! You can have that at any time of the day. There is no set time. You can have it for breakfast and you can have it for dinner. I just love Waffles. I am trying to stay true to traditional recipes. We are not just putting flour and milk and then saying – ‘here is your waffle’. We have really looked into using traditional methods. In the case of the Liege Waffles. It is full on the traditional method of making it. And that is the main thing. We want to make it the star of the show, so we have given it all our love and attention, making it really good Waffles. Not just any Waffle,” explained Kenny
A lot of places may serve it but it is different. But it is not the same as Waffles Café. It might be thinner and it won’t be as crispy.
“We sell Belgium style Waffles here – Brussels and Liege. And you should eat it, while it is hot! Customer favorites have been the Gini Kukula and Red Siam – which has the strong flavors of Thai Curry. We also do takeaways but eating ‘hot hot’ is the best! The business has picked up already and the weekends are totally packed. We have so many repeat customers, so it has been very profitable. We also serve ‘seeni sambol’ which stays true to the Sri Lankan cuisine. The Red Siam is thai curry with waffles and this is quite popular as well. So we are exploring so many possibilities,” added Kenny.
So when it comes to Waffles, Durga instructed the staff for two weeks. They came with experience of their own, but they were trained for the Waffle side of it.
“When it comes to Waffles I have been self -taught – traveled and from my readings. I love food as well. I am really interested in trying out new things. I did not take any cookery course or anything like that. It was mainly through trial and error. I also hope to open other branches which makes me really excited. I would love to! But sometimes as branches are really good, you sometimes tend to lose sight of the one you have. Then you don’t give it your all. So it is something to think about!” informed Kenny.
The choice of the location, depended mainly on the fact that the area has become so busy with Water’s Edge. Lots of people have moved towards Battaramulla and Hokandara.
“So I thought this place would have been a nice place to start. It is close to my home as well. So I can see to it most often. Initially I was nervous starting this, but people have been coming back and it has been a good response so far. And I am thankful for that. It really has caught up like wildfire! You know it is the right thing when you taste it,” stated Kenny.
Lots of families and kids come in and everything is done from scratch by our local staff in Sri Lanka.
“As much as I would like to expand the menu, the bigger the menu you lose track of how much energy you put into one dish. A lot of places do that, they have extensive menus and for example you find that their garlic bread is really good, but their soup is terrible. So I feel if we keep things limited we can always stay on track – how it tastes and looks. Sometimes people don’t order from certain things so it is stagnant. But if at all, we might expand the vegetarian section. We have got a lot of good comments for our vegetarian side,” explained Kenny.
They have quite a few foreigners coming as well, but more of a local clientele as well because of the spiciness of the food. “But even the foreigners love the Gini Kukula because it is something different for them from what they are used to.”
The café starts from 10am till 3pm in the afternoon. And then from 5pm – 10pm and Monday’s Poya days it is closed.
