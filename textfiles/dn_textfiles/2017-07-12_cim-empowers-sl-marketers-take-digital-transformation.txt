CIM empowers SL marketers to take on digital transformation

The CIM Sri Lanka annual conference this year is themed, ‘Digital Transformation – are you ready?’ The theme this year has been triggered by the understanding of the harsh reality that most businesses are not yet ready for the digital transformation that would disrupt many industries in the long term. 
Similar sentiments were common about the internet and social media earlier in the millennium, when these were seen as game-changers that would bring about the biggest challenge to businesses since the industrial revolution, and such speculations have become a reality today. 
Digital transformation is believed to make an even greater impact in comparison to the internet and social media; as it accelerates disruption of every marketplace, abolishing barriers to entry for new competitors from diverse sectors and acts as a major enabler for ambitious new startups that are able to see ‘data’ (manipulated by technology) as the ‘new oil’ or the new asset, around which they build their new business. 
The good news is that all the changes driven by this digital wave would bring marketers back to one essential question: ‘How can these digital trends help my customer?’ Followed by: ‘How are my competitors using these digital developments to steal my customers?’
 A business without a marketing-oriented digital perspective would not likely survive the next 20 or even 10 years while those that nurture true customer empathy and embrace digital trends, will continue to thrive. This is the reason that the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) has an important role to play in the digital transformation of the country.   This year, CIM Sri Lanka will present its conference goers with the opportunity to delve deeper in to the world of digital and be empowered to face the digital marketing challenges of the future. 
CIM Sri Lanka believes that this year’s conference would see the birth of digital change agents within the marketing fraternity, who would be well-equipped to write their own digital transformation success stories by asking the correct questions and taking the digital transformation discussion to the board level, and ultimately leading the digital transformation at their workplaces. 
Paul Smith, the keynote speaker at this year’s CIM Conference is an author, consultant and renowned marketer from the United Kingdom, who currently functions as an advisor and mentor in digital marketing, communications and digital transition. Graduated from Dublin, Ireland and having earned his MBA from CASS Business School, Paul Smith more popularly known as PR Smith carries over 10 years’ experience in lecturing, consulting, and is also the founder of a consortium of three universities and an e-learning company specialising in marketing which has reached out to 63 countries worldwide. 
Delivering best value to the delegates within a single day on one platform, Smith will be joined by Michael Rogers of KPMG UK and Jerome Thill, Vice President of SABRE (APAC). 
In a new and unique conference format put together by the board CIM Sri Lanka, the conference is expected to be a learning experience that would help marketers in Sri Lanka prepare for achieving marketing excellence in 2020 and beyond.
