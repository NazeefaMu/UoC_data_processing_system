Rhythm of harmony

Nadatheertha 2017, the brainchild of veteran Musician Samantha Perera’s mind, the creation of the genius of Samantha Perera, held last Friday, was a musical symphony of international standard. It was a rare opportunity for Colombo to witness a musical symphony that could be ranked as one of the best in the world.
Nadatheertha was attended by a packed audience. This goes to show that they were aware that they would witness something special. But very few would have guessed how spectacular it would be.
A humble Samantha Perera revealed his thoughts when he said that this country is going through many upheavals. Perera articulated the healing power of music. There is an English idiom that says ‘A picture is worth a thousand words’. That day at Nelum Pokuna, what transpired was worth a newspaper column. It was a wordless experience.
It was music in its most pristine and most potent form. A force that speaks to the heart before the mind. A force that compels you to get lost in it.
Perera said that dreams are powerful and dreams can come true. He said that this symphony was his dream. Indeed to get lost in a dream – in someone else’s dream, is an experience that again cannot be described in words.
This is Perera’s legacy and through it, he says, others that come after him have opportunities gifted by this legacy.
When Perera said that ‘Music is Universal’, it may sound cliché. But if you were there that night it made all the difference. If you were there that night you would have understood perfectly why people say that ‘Music is Universal’.
Perera’s companions created music that was absolutely perfect. Their instruments combined to create a masterpiece. An experience that was absolutely phenomenal. The only other performance that comes to my mind was that of Greek Composer Yanni’s concerts.
The Musical Symphony was organised jointly by the Department of Cultural Affairs and the State Advisory Board of Music on the direction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, North Western Development and Cultural Affairs.
Whether it will stand the test of memory cannot be guaranteed for the best is always yet to come, yet it was a performance that connected us to a world of sound that is not tangible, that is not describable but a world that exists. A world that only can be experienced by the senses and a world that cannot be fully understood by the mind.
Music that is lost in this world will be revived in the world to come. That is its beauty. There were very little special effects. The entire performance was balanced on instrument and voice. Calling the performers talented is an understatement. They were masterful. It was perfectly in harmony. A smooth and powerful flow.
