Rosy vows to fight for equal rights for women

There is a group of people who believe that women are incapable of doing anything. Their ideas and messages discriminate against women. This situation has come about owing to the way women were treated during the past regime, said Rosy Senanayake, UNP Mayoral candidate yesterday.
She was addressing a campaign meeting at Torrington Road, Colombo.
Senanayake added that there will be 25% women’s representation in the Colombo Municipal Council after February 10. That was made possible owing to the progressive actions of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. She thanked him for facilitating this change in local government.
Sri Lanka still has laws that are discriminatory against women. At a time when equality between men and women is upheld, Sri Lanka continues to promote ideas and laws that discriminate against women. A democracy guarantees equal treatment of all, she said, adding that a woman’s right is a human right.
“Disrespectful comments about me are spread owing to this discriminatory environment, where there are laws which determine what a woman can and cannot do; laws that permit men to do anything they wish,” Senanayake said.
She denounced such patriarchal behavior. “I will not hesitate to speak out against laws or attitudes that discriminate against women,” she said, adding that she will continue to fight for equal rights for women.
