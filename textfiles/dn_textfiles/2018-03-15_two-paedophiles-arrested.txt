Two paedophiles arrested

Two suspects who had allegedly subjected underage boys in Balangoda to serious sexual abuse were arrested by Balangoda Police at Mahiyangana recently.
Investigations revealed that they allegedly prey on unsuspecting underage boys in Balangoda by befriending them through Facebook and taking them to other areas, by providing money and mobile phones as inducements.
More recently, on or around February 22, they had allegedly abducted two 14-year-old boys resident in Belihuloya and Kirindigala and brought them back to Balangoda, after abusing them for several days. The parents of these two boys had even complained to the grama niladaris of the respective areas that the boys were missing from home.
Police said the two children were produced before the Ratnapura JMO who reported that they had been subjected to severe sexual abuse. Ratnapura SSP Buddhika Siriwardene said he had requested the OIC of Ratnapura Police Children and Women’s Bureau too to investigate this matter and submit a report.
