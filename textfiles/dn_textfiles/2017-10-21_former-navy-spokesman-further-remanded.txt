Former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and five others arrested on the charge of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009 were yesterday remanded till November 1 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
The court had earlier refused to grant bail on the suspects citing that there is no exceptional circumstances to release the suspects on bail. The former Navy Spokesman was not produced in court by prison authorities citing that he is currently receiving treatment at a hospital.
On July 12, the CID arrested the former Navy Spokesman at the Sri Lanka Navy base in Welisara following an investigation into the incident. The Colombo Fort Magistrate had earlier rejected a request made by former Navy Media Spokesman D.K.P.Dassanayake to leave the country for a foreign course.
On a previous occasion, the CID informed Court that the 11 persons who were abducted by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2008, had been taken to underground detention cells at a navy camp in Trincomalee which were supervised by a Navy Lieutenant Commander.
The missing persons had been abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009. The OIC of CID’s Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva prosecuted. Counsel Achala Seneviratne appeared for the aggrieved parties.
