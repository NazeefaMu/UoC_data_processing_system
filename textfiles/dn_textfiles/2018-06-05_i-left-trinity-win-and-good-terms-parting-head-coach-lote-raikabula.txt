I left Trinity with a win and in good terms - parting head coach Lote Raikabula

Former New Zealand All Blacks seven a side rugby legend cum Trinity College Kandy head coach Lote Raikabula parted ways with Trinity College Kandy rugby team and left to the United Kingdom last night.
Lote as he is very popularly known among the rugby fraternity in the world, in his very first year as head coach brought fame and honour to Trinity College first XV rugby team last year by enabling them to finish third in the Singer inter-school league rugby tournament. They lost only to Royal College and St. Peter’s College.
Speaking to the ‘Daily News’ a few hours before his departure, Raikabula said, “I am taking another commitment in the UK and I have left Trinity in peace not being pushed like one of the Sri Lankan local media mentioned. It’s all false. We won the Wesley game and I was the head coach. The school sent me off with a final assembly with honour.
“I left Trinity with a win and I left in good terms with them. The postponing by a week of the schools league rugby tournament clashed with my commitment in the UK. The commitment I agreed to is for a long term. So I can’t turn them down. I wish Trinity rugby all the very best in their upcoming future matches,” said the 34-year-old All Blacks player who appeared in more than 60 tournaments since his debut in 2006, 20 of which were for the winning New Zealand All Blacks seven-a-side teams.
With five IRB Sevens World Series medals, a Rugby World Cup Sevens title and two Commonwealth Games gold medals scoring over 100 tries, he is arguably one of New Zealand Sevens’ most successful players. He also played Rugby Union for Hawkes Bay and Manawatu in the Air New Zealand Cup.
