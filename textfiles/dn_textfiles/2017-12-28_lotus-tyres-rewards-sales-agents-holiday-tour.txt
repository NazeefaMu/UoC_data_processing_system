Lotus Tyres rewards sales agents with holiday tour

Samson Rubber Industries, the manufacturer and distributor of Lotus Tyres, has seen its sublime imprint of trust amongst Sri Lankans for many decades, and it honoured its sales agents and their family members with a domestic holiday recently.
There, the sales agents and their families basked themselves in the peace and luxury of the star class hotel, RIU – Ahungalle throughout two passionate days of exploration.
The sales agents who were dedicated in bringing Lotus Tyres to the doorstep of its customers leaving no space for ado while realizing sales targets, were victorious in grabbing this fabulous opportunity.
This was made available through a sales promotion programme which was organized to recognize their performance in due proportions.
The successful sales agents received certificates and souvenirs. The occasion was graced by the distinguished board of directors of Samson Rubber Industries and the Lotus Tyres team.
“We are very pleased to take this opportunity to appreciate our sales agents who were involved in a commendable service. We are prepared to initiate similar programmes even further to recognize our sales agents” said R.D.D. Abeythilake, Director of Samson Rubber Industries. Lotus Tyres has won hearts of customers island-wide under the tagline “Niyama Milata Niyama Durak” meaning, “Right mileage for the right price”. It has become a much-focused brand of tyres& tubes in recent times. Its transcending value for money is accompanied by maximum safety and quality.
The Lotus Tyres brand has a range that includes bicycle tyres and tubes, motorcycle tyres& tubes and three-wheeler tyres& tubes.
