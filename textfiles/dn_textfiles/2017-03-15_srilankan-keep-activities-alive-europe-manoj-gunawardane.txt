SriLankan to keep activities alive  in Europe - Manoj Gunawardane

SriLankan Airlines though now don’t operate direct flights to Paris and Frankfurt would still keep on their activities alive in Europe, said Regional Head of Europe and America, SriLankan, Manoj Gunawardane.
Speaking to Daily News Business at the recently concluded ITB Berlin, he said that this is the reason they were also participating at one of the world’s largest travels and aviation shows the ITB. He said that they still sell tickets and claim 20% their earlier business through series of agreements.
“The passengers are then connected to the SriLankan Airline network mostly from the Gulf or London to fly to Colombo and back.”
He said that the airline is now going through a restricting process and this is part of the airline synergies. “When things improve in the airline these two routes may come online again.” Accordingly, the last flights between Frankfurt and Colombo on UL 553/554 were operated on October 30, while UL 563/564 on November 6, 2016 concluded the operations between Paris and Colombo.
Asked if the airline was paying for these routes he answered in the negative. He also said that it would not be a great issue to get these routes back forms these three destinations. “What is currently needed is to increase more flights to London which is the only air link on the national carrier to Europe and nurse it carefully,” he said.
SriLankan operates daily flights to both Doha and Abu Dhabi and has a strong code share relationship with Etihad and Qatar through which it will continue to provide onward connectivity to European destinations it has been serving via Paris and Frankfurt, the airline said.
The Indian Sub-continent, the Middle East and the Far East will remain SriLankan’s focal markets, where the Airline will continue to explore its potential for expansion, the airline said. Meanwhile Minister of Tourism, John Amaratunga speaking at the well-attended ITB Sri Lankan Press conference said that Sri Lanka Tourism has suffered a great deal due to the pull out of these two flights during tourism peak season. “However it’s the airline’s decision and when we get back we will make representations again to get at least the Frankfurt route back by next winter.”
