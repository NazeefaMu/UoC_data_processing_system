14th United Nations Day of Vesak 2017

For the first time in Sri Lanka the 14th United Nations Day of Vesak 2017, Conference will be held in Colombo and Kandy from May 12 to 14 with the participation of a large number of local and foreign delegations. The main theme focuses on “Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace”.
Vesak is the main Buddhist religious festival in Sri Lanka. During this time, people celebrate the triple anniversary of the Buddha - his birth, attaining of Enlightenment and attaining Nirvana. It was a big achievement for Sri Lanka to have the UN willingly approve the holding of this sublime celebration in Sri Lanka.
It is a matter of great delight for us to hold this significant event in a befitting manner with the guidance and counselling of Most Venerable Mahanyake Theras of the three Chapters and also with the able and astute participation of the President, the Prime Minister o and Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana, world leaders and leaders from diverse organisations.
Sri Lanka is the most noteworthy contributor to International Vesak Day. Prof. Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera initiated and inspired a meeting of global Buddhists in 1950 CE (Buddhist Era 2493) in Sri Lanka resulting in the inauguration of the World Fellowship of Buddhists (WFB) on May 25, 1950 (2493BE) at the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy. This meeting was attended by 129 Buddhist delegates from 27 countries in Asia, Europe and America.
At this meeting, the Buddhist Flag was formally accepted and Ven. Piyarathana recommended that Vesak Day should be accepted globally as a Buddhist celebration, a proposal which was accepted and followed by the Global Buddhist fraternity. Buddhism during its existence over two millennia had developed into 3 schools – Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayna, all disciples and believers of the Sakyamuni Buddha. Prof. G.P. Malalasekera could unite all three schools of Buddhism within the World Fellowship of Buddhism and became the first president of WFB from 1950 to 1958.
Lakshman Kadirgamar too was a pioneer in making Vesak Day as an ‘Optional Holiday’ at the United Nations for the first time under its resolution 69/250/ at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 1999, requesting for the adaptation of “Vesak Day” on September 23, 1999 and at the 79th Plenary Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on December 15, 1999.
