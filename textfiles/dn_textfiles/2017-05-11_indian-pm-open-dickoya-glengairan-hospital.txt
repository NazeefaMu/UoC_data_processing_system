Indian PM to open Dickoya Glengairan Hospital

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is visiting Sri Lanka to participate at the International Vesak Day celebrations, will open the Dickoya Glengairan Hospital which was built on a Rs. 1.2 billion fund from the Indian government.
He will thereafter address a public meeting organised by Minister Palany Digambaran at Norwood grounds on May 12 at 9 am. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will also participate at these ceremonies.
All security arrangements have been strengthened by the government via Police and security forces.
Helicopters of both countries are to fly to Hatton Dunbar Grounds after security checks have been performed. Modi will then be escorted to Dickoya Glengairan and Norwood.
The work for the Glengairan Hospital started on June 4, 2011, and was completed in 2013. The opening ceremony was postponed due to various disputes.
"This hospital has some shortcomings due to lack of urgent medical equipment and doctors. We are negotiating with the Health Minister to resolve them," said the New National Organiser and Province Councillor S. Sridharan. CPC Director of Health K.A. Shanthi Samarasinghe also confirmed this.
