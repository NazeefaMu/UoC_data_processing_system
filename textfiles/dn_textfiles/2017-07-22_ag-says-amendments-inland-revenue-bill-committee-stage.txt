AG says amendments to Inland Revenue Bill at committee stage

The Attorney General yesterday informed Supreme Court that several amendments are to be brought to the proposed Inland Revenue Bill at the committee stage in Parliament.
Additional Solicitor General Farzana Jameel with Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekere appearing on behalf of the Attorney General made these remarks in response to ten Special Determination petitions challenging the Inland Revenue Bill taken up before Supreme Court yesterday.
The Attorney General insisted that Section 67(1), (2), (6) and (7) of the Bill to be deleted and will introduce new sections during the committee stage in Parliament. The sixth Schedule of the Bill relating to “Insurance Business” is to be amended.
ASG Jameel stated that the present bill was a complete departure from the existing law. “It is to provide for several omissions in the present law.
The bill is to provide for simplicity, transparency, easy administration and prevent unnecessary clogging of tax appeals. It will introduce a new system of administrative review.
Under Article 148 of the Constitution, Parliament has full control of public finance.That means Parliament can decide on the sources, allocation and means to keep checking on public finance. The present Bill gets its legitimacy from the 2017 budget proposals. The proposed law is not arbitrary.
Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appearing on behalf of the petitioners informed Court that residents and non-residents are taxed at the rates given in the first Schedule. Accordingly the highest ratios are as follows; When annual taxable income is between 1.8 M to 2.4 M, 16%; 2.4 M-3 M, 20% and Exceeding 3 M, 24%.
Therefore an individual could be liable to a maximum of 24% of his annual income, Vitharana added.
On the contrary ‘Companies’ engaged solely in the following businesses are taxed at the rate of (only) 14%; i.e:-
(a) Conducting agricultural business, (b) Providing educational services,(c) Engaged in promotion of tourism,(d) Providing information technology and (e) Business of exporting goods and services.
Therefore, the tax liability of the individuals engaging in the above trades, businesses (eg; farmers, tourist guides, teachers, IT technicians etc) may go up to 24%. However the liability of the companies engaging in the same trades, professions, businesses will remain at 14%., Mr. Vitharana said.
The petitioners’ counsel further stated that through this process, thousands of people daily engaged in the above trades, etc., will be placed in unfair competition with companies with less tax liability. This is amounting to unequal treatment and violation of Article 12(1) and violation of freedom to engage in employment, trade, vocation et (Article 14(1)(g), Article 3 of the Constitution.
Ten petitioners including MP Bandula Gunawardane and Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Secretary Amal Randeniya are seeking a declaration that bill shall become law only through a two-third majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The petitioners stated that a bill titled “Inland Revenue”, a Bill to provide for the imposition of income tax for any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2017 was presented to the Parliament and placed on Order Paper of the Parliament on July 5, 2017.
Further hearing fixed for July 24.
