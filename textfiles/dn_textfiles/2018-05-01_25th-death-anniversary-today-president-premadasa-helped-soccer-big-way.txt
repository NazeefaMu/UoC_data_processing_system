25th Death Anniversary today: President Premadasa helped soccer in a big way

Today 1st of May is the 25th death anniversary of the late President R. Premadasa, sportsman, sports benefactor and above all a great gentleman who did his best for the country. He was killed along with 17 others on 1 May 1993, at 12.45 p.m. during a May Day rally in north Colombo, by an LTTE suicide bomber. Another 38 people were injured in the bombing including seven who were seriously wounded.
The name of R. Premadasa will go down in the annals of our history not only as a nation-builder but also as a great sports promoter. He as a sports promoter and political leader gave off his best for the people regardless of caste and race.
R. Premadasa was born on 23 June 1924 at Dias Place, Colombo 11, to the family of Richard Ranasinghe (Ranasinghe Mudalali) of Kosgoda and Jayasinghe Arachchige Ensina Hamine of Batuwita, Horana. He was the oldest of five children, three sisters, and one brother. He received his primary education at Harvard Girls’ School, Dam Street, Colombo, post primary education at St. Lorenz’s College, Skinner’s Road South (now Sri Sangaraja Mawatha, Maradana) and his secondary education at St. Joseph’s College, Colombo. While attending school, he attended the Hewavitharana Daham Pasala. He completed his education at St. Joseph’s College, during the Le Goc era.
He wanted people to work and do something for the country. Today, most of the Sri Lankans, will remember his good work. This friend of the common people, departed suddenly in a bomb blast, on May Day where his party was celebrating May Day with the workers of the country. As a politician - Prime Minister and President he is the man who did a lot for the country in the same way he helped sports.
It was he who built the Kettarama Stadium (now known as R. Premadasa Stadium) for cricket with lights. Today this cricket venue can be rated as one of the best in the world.
Then for football he re-developed the Sugathadasa Stadium, and also gave a new face to the Pedris Park. Football was R. Premadasa's pet sport. The game of football came naturally to him, perhaps because football was identified with the poor man. As a young footballer, he learnt the game at Keselwatte. He introduced a rugby tournament for clubs for this he got together with Malik Samarawickrema, Y.C. Chang and Dushantha Samarasekara. This tournament was known as the R. Premadasa Trophy and became very popular. Subsequently he introduced a schools segment to this tournament. After his death this tournament was scraped.
Even after taking to politics, he was with football and football was with him. He promoted the game among the Parliamentarians. He gave unstinted support to football's controlling body. During the time of late Weerasinghe Mallimarachchi and Manilal Fernando he came out in a big way by granting Rs. 60,000 for the development of football.
R. Premadasa was a gentleman to his fingertips. He was prepared to stand for what was right even though it meant that he had to make a personal sacrifice. He took part in politics, sports and social service work to help his fellow people. He had a generous heart and would go out of his way to help countrymen - but his special concern was about those countrymen who happened to be less fortunately placed in life. For these people R. Premadasa was a real leader in need.
Even in the rough and tumble world of politics, R. Premadasa always maintained that "sport is the best reformer and the ideal one for politicians to engage in as sport has no barriers". There is no doubt that every sport in the country benefited from his true love for sports.
Today, all sports, realizes his loss. It's a void which will be very difficult to fill because he yet had so much to offer for sports and the country. It is said that no man is indispensable. When one considers R. Premadasa’s worth to society as a politician, administrator and sport promoter and a friend no one would hasten to challenge that statement.
In 1960, he married Hema Wickramatunge, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wickramatunge Arachchige Charles Appuhamy of Bandarawela, on June 23, 1964. His son, Sajith, and daughter, Dulanjali, were born to this couple.
Today Sajith is following his father’s footsteps in UNP politics.
