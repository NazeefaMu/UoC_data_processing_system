Pan Asia Bank upgrades Horana Base Hospital

Pan Asia Bank, recently initiated a country-wide CSR initiative aimed at improving hospital facilities in needy areas. As a part of endeavor staff members of Pan Asia Bank recently came forward to improve Ward No 5 of Horana Base Hospital by donating a range of required medical equipment.
They also went on to clean and colour wash the ward and attend to several renovation activities such as fixing wall fans and repairing ceiling fans.
Among the items donated to the hospital were stainless steel saline stands, barcode printers, a laminating machine, wheel chairs and bedside lockers. These items were handed over by Pan Asia Bank AGM-Operations, Harsha Kurukulasuriya to Horana Base Hospital GMO Dr. Kalubowila at a ceremony attended by doctors and nurses of the hospital and Pan Asia Bank staff.
The full day program which was conducted on October 13 was seen as a necessity to help raise the conditions of the hospital, which caters to over 62,000 internal patients and over 275,000 external patients every year. Pan Asia Bank which remains committed to uplift the living standard of the local communities through its business as well as CSR activities expects to complete several similar projects across the country in 2018.
