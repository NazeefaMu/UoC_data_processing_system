82nd Battle of the Saints': Joes certain of putting up a good performance

St. Joseph's College are confident of getting the better out of traditional rivals St. Peter's College when they confront each in their cricket encounter at the SSC grounds on Friday and Saturday.
The Darley Road school has produced some magnificent players who have gone on to represent the country with much pride. Late Gerry Gooneratne, D. S. Jayasundera (who was considered as the fastest bowler in Sri Lanka in the 1940s), Fairlie Dalpathado, Malcolm Spittel, Hector Perera (snr), Malcolm Francke (who went on to represent Queensland in the Sheffield Shield tournament in Australia) and Brian Obeysekera who played for Sri Lanka in unofficial Tests.
St.Joseph's has also produced some fine Test cricketers of the calibre of Ashley de Silva, Michael van Dort, Chaminda Vaas, Test and ODI captain Angelo Mathews, Thisara Perera, Ian Daniel and Dimuth Karunaratne.
Vaas, a fine left-arm fast bowler represented Sri Lanka with distinction claiming over 300 wickets in Test cricket in a career which spanned 14 years. His match bag of 10 wickets against New Zealand at Napier in 1995 gave Sri Lanka their first overseas Test win.
Karunaratne who came into the Test team late last year scored a superb 85 in the second innings against Australia in the third test at Sydney. Mathews has rendered yeoman service to the Sri Lanka team during the last seven years and become an integral figure in the side.
This year, the Josephians are led by Sandaruwan Rodrigo. The Darley Road school has won six matches outright against Mahanama Colombo, Maris Stella Negombo, De Mazenod, Mahinda Galle, Wesley and St. Anthony's Katugastota but they suffered defeats at the hands of Royal Colombo and St. Benedict's.
St. Joseph's will heavily depend on Malshan Rodrigo, who has been the only batsman to make a century this season. They will also depend on Revan Kelly who has scored 650 runs along with vice captain Kevin Corteling.
Shevon Fonseka and Malshan Rodrigo who has totalled more than 500 runs, Sri Lanka Youth player Jehan Daniel, Nipun Sumanasinghe, Vimukthi Peiris, Thashan Peiris and Dineth Madurawala are the others who can make useful contributions with the bat.
To avert the powerful Peterite batting pressure will be in the hands of Malshan Rodrigo and Harin Cooray who have taken over 130 wickets between them. Ruchira Ekanayake and Charuka Ullandupitiya are the others who will strengthen the bowling department.
The Josephians are coached by Asela Pathirana who will be assisted by fielding coach Dharantha Menerigama.
