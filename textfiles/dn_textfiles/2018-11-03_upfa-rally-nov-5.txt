UPFA rally on Nov. 5

The United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) will hold a protest rally on November 5 to show the people’s power.
Ministers Mahinda Samarasinghe and Nimal Siripala de Silva, while addressing the media, said they have also decided to show the power of their supporters by holding a rally near Parliament.
“We are getting ready for this rally and people can judge which party has the power of the people. Then the people, international community and media can see whether the UNP or the UPFA has the people’s support,” he added.
“We have planned to bring our supporters to Colombo to show our strength and support for the President and the Prime Minister.
“All parties in the UPFA will assist this rally,” Minister Samarasinghe said.
