Designing the future


To reach for the future through the window of the present – two young minds recently found themselves occupied by that very task. Intelligence, where the design is born and an intention full of empathy. This is the story behind that endeavor, that success. Nippon Paint celebrated the successful conclusion of the Asia Young Designer Award (AYDA) themed “You for tomorrow” future living as envisioned today, in Sri Lanka for the second consecutive year with a glamorous awards ceremony held at the Hilton Hotel Colombo recently.
AYDA 2017 was held in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA). Two winners of both Architecture and Interior Designing were given opportunities for a visit in Malaysia (sponsored by Nippon Paint) for further training with one student from each discipline being awarded Rs. 100,000.
Winning tour

“Getting an award at the stage of a student is a dream,” remarked Sachintha Fernando from the City School of Architecture, the winner of the Gold award for the Interior Design Category. “Especially, in terms of design because we don’t really have the opportunity for design competitions within Sri Lanka. It gives a good recognition to us, to our universities and toour tutors as well.”
The Gold award winner for Architecture category was Dilushan Madhuranga from the University of Moratuwa. “In student life, a design award is a rare thing especially when it’s an internationally recognized award. That means a lot,” he confirmed.
The two winners attended a three-day workshop held in Malaysia with the participation of 30 other Asia’s best young designers. During the Summit, 25 talented students represented their countries to showcase their winning design ideas in line with the theme ‘You for Tomorrow’ to a panel of 56 renowned judges from across Asia, for a chance to win the highly sought-after ‘Asia Young Designer of the Year’ title.
“In Malaysia, we got the opportunity to speak with the tutors of other students,” said Fernando. “It was a very good exposure; they tutored us on our designs, as well.
We got the opportunity to meet very important architects in the field. They taught us how to present ourselves on the international stage. And we also got the opportunity to visit the Malaysian institute of architects.”
The design
“What was meant by ‘You for Tomorrow’ in terms of design was not something futuristic,” explained Fernando. “The theme meant you should cater for the issues of tomorrow and to cater for the comfort levels of tomorrow. Our building should meet the comfort requirement of people while fulfilling their needs.”
Following this path, Fernando presented a design of a rehabilitation center for teenage mothers. “It’s a rising issue in Sri Lankan society,” she remarked. “We have to help them build their future. They have kids and their kids are our future generation.”
Fernando created the design within two categories. One for teenage mothers and one for their kids, like a daycare facility, she said.
What made her design stand out from the others was “the issue I chose and the concept for that,” explained Fernando.“I gave two different themes for teenage mothers and their kids because their mentality is different. For children, I’ve introduced a bit of a luxurious finish. And I’ve given the place for mothers a very rustic effect.
They have pallet selling stalls around their place of living so I’ve used palleted furniture for my building to give it a more homely effect, to attract the young mothers.”
We couldn’t just throw in our ideas, we had to thoroughly prove that the issue existed, stated Fernando. “Near the garbage dump [where they lived] is where the issue was. Drug addiction, child abortion, child labour, prostitution and teenage mothers.
I visited the place; I approached the young children, made conversation and recognized the issue. Then, I started researching on that area, and I got the statistics from the municipal council. My research went on for like a month, she recalled.
In order to secure the winning position, Madhuranga created a design using abandoned container boxes. “We’re trying to reduce our carbon emissions and other material wastage. So, I created a design using abandoned material we could find in Colombo harbour. I chose a vacant lot and designed a place to hang out. It can be created by using very low budget and we can spread this trend to other places.”
To make his design stand out from the rest, Madhuranga used different technology. “The technology I have used is the joinery methods used to bind containers when they’re being shipped,” he explained. “I have used the same details to join my container boxes together and pick them. Even a non-professional can look at this building and get inspired.”
“And other thing is sustainability. My design doesn’t require any new material so the carbon footprint will be very low. And it can be erected within a short period of time,” he elaborated further.
I went to the harbour and found plenty of abandoned materials.
Container trailers boxes, joinery parts, cables timber pallets and such. We met with authorities and got the records. I calculated them and found that there are many abandoned materials we can use for a design, said Madhuranga.
Learning through experience
“It was a very good motivation. When we’re doing a design, we undergo many hardtimes. This is a very good memory,” said Fernando.
“After the presentations, they held some sessions, by previous winners and they presented their works, how they stepped up the ladder in their careers. It helped us to expand the barriers of our thinking and get to the next level,” confirmed Madhuranga.
“One thing I observed is, in our country, our technological knowledge is very little compared to other countries,” he said.“And the attitude towards adapting the technology is low, especially when it comes to the digital design age.
Our hotels and aesthetically oriented designs are nice butif we don’t update our technology and use it when it comes to high rises and performance oriented designs, what happens is we have to handover our projects to foreign architects and only do the local consultant part.”
Words for eager peers
“You should work hard for your passion,” said Fernando. “To gain victory, you should identify the issues and build up a strong concept. In design, you must create useful space which can fulfill the comfortable levels of future.”
“Getting awards and participating in international conferences and events finds you recognition in the industry,” said Madhuranga. “Such events open up many other opportunities. There are so many open competitions and opportunities we often ignore. Find a little time and take part in them, it will do a bigger change that you expect.”
To seek, to seize, to improve. These enthusiastic, youthful personalities never fail to prove that there is always hope and possibility for a society like ours to reach great heights.
