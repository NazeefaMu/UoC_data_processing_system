Tobacco industry resorts to nasty gimmicks

Govt asked to protect public health policies:
The tobacco industry is influencing leaders, politicians and university lecturers to achieve their target. The industry promotes myths and lies, a Senior Lecturer attached to the Colombo University Medical Faculty Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya said.
He was addressing the media at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday.
Colombo University Medical Faculty Dean Prof. Jennifer Perera said Sri Lanka was the first Asian country and the fourth country in the world to ratify WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).
She said 180 countries had signed the FCTC. The government should protect the public health policies from the tobacco industry under this convention, she said.
Alcohol and Drug Information Centre Executive Director Pubudu Sumanasekara said over 250 news items and articles were published on behalf of the tobacco company and smoking after the government increased the tax on tobacco. Articles had no bylines. Even the editors did not know how those news and features landed in the newspapers, he said.
Verite Research Executive Director Dr. Nishan de Mel said a formula is required to decide tax on tobacco. The profit of the tobacco company has increased. Tax income of the government from tobacco has also increased. But smoking has not been reduced, he said.
