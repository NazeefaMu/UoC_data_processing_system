Chivalry

Many entrepreneurs and bosses believe that chivalry is dead. And they may certainly know what they are talking about. That is because they have been at the butt end of boorish behaviour by either colleagues or business professionals they deal with. Just this week I spoke to a young woman business executive, named Shanthini, who seemed miffed by a male colleague’s ill-mannered conduct.
And I don’t believe anyone could have blamed her. Now just picture this episode and you will certainly endorse her statement. Shanthini and her marketing executive colleague Anthony were on their way to a business meeting with a client.
When entering the glass doors to the client’s office, Anthony pushes the heavy door open and barges his way through first. He does not consider that his female colleague is just a step behind him. Without any concern for his fellow worker he releases the door which promptly closes in the young woman’s face.
As expected, Shanthini is quite upset at Anthony’s obvious lack of manners. Clearly, Anthony a young executive ambitiously attempting to claw his way to the top has displayed callous disregard for conduct expected of a gentleman. As a high-flying managerial prospect did he not realise that it is customary for a gentleman to not only open any door for a lady, but to respectfully usher her through before making his own way in? As a matter of fact, whoever reaches a door first, irrespective of gender, needs to hold the door open for the person behind. It is such a simple task and yet so many of us fail to do it.
Anthony is a far cry from the noble Sir Walter Raleigh who flung his cloak over a puddle so that Queen Elizabeth 1 would not muddy her dainty feet. Not that he was expected to stoop to such deeds of gallantry at any event. But the art of being a gentleman is not as simple and well defined as it used to be during Elizabethan times.
So let us revert to the question that haunts the convention of ethics in family, community, business, and personal relationships. It is right to ask ourselves, whether chivalry is really dead. Many entrepreneurs think so. More significantly, do we display chivalry in our business, courtesy in expression, and generosity in activity? Courtesy, generosity, and a chivalrous attitude must survive if commerce is to be carried out smoothly, if deals are to be made and relationships are to be maintained.
Yes certainly, rude behaviour is on the rise posing a hazard to businesses both big and small. There is a high price one has to pay for this incivility, because it can damage business prospects to a great extent. Worse still it can wipe out an enterprise altogether.
How many times have we been met with rudeness, poor customer service, a lack of political correctness, or improper etiquette? I am certain we all have, at one time or another. And, as a result, as you are obviously aware we resolve never to return. Yet, because we don’t speak out or report the incident, the problem persists, creating an environment in which a lack of respect, courtesy, and customer service flourish.
It should be the responsibility of every management to provide training resources if they expect their enterprises to succeed. Training in consulting services, productivity and efficiency is no doubt important. But more important is the one that is becoming a lost art in today’s business world. That tool is the everyday practice of common professional courtesy.
To be sure, there is a tremendous amount of pressure in today’s business world, particularly in the harsh economic environment we are all dealing with. Pressure may be a reason for a lack of courtesy, but it is certainly no excuse for it. In fact in the turbulent market we are facing professional courtesy is more important than ever. There are many examples of a lack of courtesy in the workplace, some of which we have all been guilty of at one time or another.
It all comes down to being respectful of people’s time and valuing it as much as you do your own. Returning phone calls and emails, particularly if you reached out to someone and asked them for something, is an acknowledgment that their time is as important as yours and that you appreciate their efforts. Other things, like focusing on proper introductions, handshakes and greetings, convey respect for peers, clients, and business associates, and go a long way in cultivating other people’s image of you in the workplace.
Everyone, and that includes the customer, the staff and the entrepreneur, must take personal responsibility in demanding the restitution of those attributes that have been lost or thought to be dead. And that means chivalry in the workplace and in business.
Any entrepreneur’s essential code of conduct and practice is to be kind, polite, customer friendly and responsible for civility in the business that he/she runs. It is important that we consider the needs of the customer and that we treat others as we would want to be treated. When someone is rude or acts completely out of character, refuse to partake in the incivility or to respond with like sentiment.
It is unacceptable and rudeness should be politely acknowledged and filtered through a courteous response that signifies the entrepreneur’s creed of character, morals, and values. Good manners open doors that degrees, position and money cannot. As entrepreneurs, learning the importance of interpersonal skills based on courtesy, knowledge, and respect for others can generate opportunities, build relationships, and create a solid customer base.
Chivalry isn’t dead, nor should any business owner or customer allow it to be.
Courtesy is a very important act of expression in a business setting. Smother people with politeness and kindness. Use your words generously to everyone around you. To be courteous is to be liked and remembered. These are two things that every business wants for who will buy from a place they dislike or couldn’t remember.
Be courteous in words and in actions to generate a positive force that everyone will be attracted to. People are attracted by positive energy like a moth to a flame and your etiquette will be the generator and motivator for people to come to you. In business, courtesy is too important to ignore and those who do will be cast out eventually.
In a business world full of stress and pressure, a little professional courtesy can be a key to your success. And the good news is that the ability to be courteous is in all of us . We may have set it aside for a while, but we can reinstate it and practice it just as easily! [email protected]
