Youth on pilgrimage drowns in Deduru Oya

A youth who came with a group of pilgrims to worship and get blessings of the historic Hindu Kovil of Munneswaram, Chilaw, died of drowning at Deduru Oya.
He was identified as A.Christopher, 24, a resident of Nuwara-Eliya. He had accompanied a group of his colleagues who work with him in a factory of Wattala.
After fulfilling rituals at the Shrine, he had been to have a bath in Dedu Oya. While swimming, he found himself in a difficulty. He was rescued and rushed to the Chilaw Base Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
