Police officers granted bail in assault case

Three police officers who had allegedly assaulted two youths, including an army soldier, were granted bail after being ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 25,000 by the Horana Magistrate, recently.
The incident had occurred at two locations, with the first assault taking place at a bus stand in the Poruwadanda area in Ingiriya and the second, at the Ingiriya Police Station, once the victims were transported there by the suspects.
The case is to be heard again at the Horana Magistrate’s Court on August 13. Investigations are continuing.
