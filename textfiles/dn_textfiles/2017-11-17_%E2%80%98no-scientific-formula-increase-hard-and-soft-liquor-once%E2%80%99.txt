‘No scientific formula to increase hard and soft liquor at once’

As the proposed pricing formula on alcoholic beverages in the 2018 Budget becomes a highly contested topic, co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara questioned critics as to how they proposed to increase the prices of both soft as well as hard liquor at the same time.
“Earlier, the tax on alcohol was decided on a standard litre of alcohol but no one knows what this is based on. Taxing was ad hoc and ineffective,” he said.
He was addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing on Wednesday.
Thus, a tax of Rs. 190 was charged for beverages with five percent alcohol or less, and a tax of Rs. 315 for those above five percent. In addition, foreign alcoholic beverages had an additional customs, PAL and VAT taxes imposed on them.
“To amend this, the Budget followed a taxation system based on the percentage of alcohol in the drink, the same system which is followed internationally,” explained the Minister as he stressed that this was more simplified and easier to follow.
He added that it was pointless to simply stress on increasing prices of alcohol without a scientific basis, as the more prices increased, more people were likely to resort to illegal drinks such as moonshine.
“A poor man who can no longer afford a bottle of arrack is going to drink moonshine which is more dangerous. We need to have a different programme to stop them from drinking that rather than worrying about beer,” stressed Jayasekara.
Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, highlighting a study conducted by the University of Colombo, stated that Sri Lanka took the number one position in Asia when it came to the consumption of hard liquor.
“This study states that in Sri Lanka, 13 percent consume beer, 2 percent wine and 85 percent other hard liquor such as arrack,” said Minister Karunathilake.
In certain districts such as Nuwara Eliya, close to 85 percent consume moonshine, he added.
Minister Jayasekara noted that the real problem was the unregulated moonshine with a much higher percentage of alcohol and not beer.
“It is not true that with decreasing beer prices, all will start drinking beer or that the youth will start drinking. We have to realize that the youth today have other drugs, much more potent at their disposal,” said Jayasekara. He explained that the President too was not in favour of the beer price decreasing and asked to increase it, but there was no scientific formula which could increase the prices of both soft and hard liquor at once.
