When they say '' I do ''

Senali Perera
As the world awaits a much loved prince and his lady to say “I do,” there are only so many details to be curious about such a special day. UK’s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are getting ready for a remarkably unique wedding which will take place in just a few days.
In March, Kensington Palace revealed that the wedding will be “shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too. This wedding, like all weddings, will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the characters and values of the Bride and Groom.”
 The proposal 
“It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet, and natural and very romantic,” said the former American actress of the proposal during the couple’s first sit-down interview with the British Broadcast Corporation (BBC). The beautiful moment was shared by the couple as they roasted a chicken at home.
“She didn’t even let me finish. She said ‘Can I say yes,’” the prince shared. “Then there were hugs and I had the ring on my finger. “I was like ‘Can I give you the ring?’ It was a really nice moment. Just the two of us.”
 
A remarkable ring 
Harry designed the ring, which was then made by court jewelers Cleave and Company using one diamond sourced from Botswana and two smaller stones from Princess Diana’s collection.
“The ring is obviously yellow gold because that’s [Markle’s] favorite and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana and the little diamonds either side are from my mother’s jewelry collection, to make sure that she’s with us on this crazy journey together,” Harry told the BBC. Harry often refers to Botswana as his “second home;” the couple also recently vacationed to the African country for Meghan’s birthday.
“I first went to Botswana in 1997, straight after my mum died. My dad told my brother and me we were going to Africa to get away from it all. This is where I feel more like myself than anywhere else in the world,” the Prince told ABC News. “I have this intense sense of complete relaxation and normality here.”
 
The big day 
The wedding is on Saturday, May 19 at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a “very special place” for the couple in their relationship so far. The service will begin at 12pm.
After the ceremony, at 1pm, the newlyweds will then undertake a two mile tour of Windsor greeting well-wishers. Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George’s Hall, for the first of two receptions. The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales.
 
A special best man 
The chosen date falls on the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley, a match that Prince Harry’s best man, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William usually attends as president of the Football Association to present the trophy. The May date may also have been selected in order to give the Duchess of Cambridge time to recover after the birth of her third child, Prince Louis, who arrived in April, this year.
 
The guest-list 
The guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, and was taken both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small, and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.
Using American ink on English card, each invite has been printed in gold and black, then burnished to bring out the shine, and gilded around the edge. The three-feathered badge of the Prince of Wales is given pride of place in the centre, reports vogue.co.uk
According to telegraph, other guests will include members of Markle’s family - her mother Doria Ragland and father Thomas Markle Snr and many members of the royal family.
 
Tennis star Serena Williams and Markle’s former Suits co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Patrick J Adams and Wendell Pierce could also be on the list.
Markle may also choose some grown-up bridesmaids from her close set of friends - most likely Canadian stylist Jessica Mulroney and Indian actress and philanthropist Priyanka Chopra. She might even pick a best woman.
Markle, who was a UN women’s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. They will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop “obey him” and “serve him” from the religious proceedings, telegraph further reports.
 
Music with an American slant 
Markle will bring an “American slant” to the Royal Wedding’s musical repertoire, according to orchestra conductor Christopher Warren-Green who will be leading musicians during the ceremony, announced express.co.uk
“The theme, just like anybody’s wedding, has to reflect something, and what that something is I’m not going to say. I think it’s safe for me to say without a doubt we will have an American slant to this wedding – of course.” said the orchestra conductor to express.co.uk
 
Outside of tradition 
Markle and Prince Harry have commissioned Claire Ptak, owner of London-based Violet Bakery, to make a lemon elderflower cake with buttercream frosting and decorated with fresh flowers for their big day, reports foodnetwork. The cake is a (delicious) break from the traditional fruitcake, which has been served at royal weddings for generations. Prince William and Duchess Kate only slightly skirted tradition at their wedding by having a chocolate biscuit groom’s cake served alongside a traditional eight-tier fruitcake.
 
Princess or Duchess? 
Harry is sixth in line to the throne and most insiders believe that if the Queen hands him a royal dukedom, like Prince William received upon his 2011 wedding, Prince Harry will be made the Duke of Sussex or Duke of Connaught on his own wedding day which would make Markle the Duchess of each too, mirroring Kate’s title of the Duchess of Cambridge. When Catherine Middleton and Prince William were pronounced “man and wife” in 2011, she automatically became Her Royal Highness, Princess William of Wales. The overwhelming likelihood is that Markle will in turn, officially become HRH Princess Henry of Wales. This is due to rules governing the British crown, only those born into the royal family can use the title Prince or Princess, followed by their first name.
 
Wedding gifts 
The couple have requested that guests skip the wedding gifts and donate to the following: CHIVA (Children’s HIV Association), Crisis (a UK-based homelessness charity), the Myna Mahila Foundation (a charity that supports women in Mumbai’s urban slums), Scotty’s Little Soldiers (which helps bereaved Armed Forces children), StreetGames (a foundation using sport to change lives), Surfers against Sewage and The Wilderness Foundation UK (which promotes the enjoyment of wild nature).
If you remember letting out a sigh of adoration on the wedding days of Prince Charles and Diana or Prince William and Kate, then, be prepared – another grand day is just around the corner. Ready those dreamy eyes and excited heart, join the joy of a royal love story, of a much anticipated “I do.”
