CDS returns

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne who had left the country on an official visit to Mexico despite being summoned by the CID to record a statement in the case pertaining to the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008-2009, had returned to the country yesterday.
He had landed at the BIA on-board a flight from Doha, Qatar, at around 01.45 last morning.
Admiral Wijegunaratne had left the country on September 10 to participate at Mexico’s 28th Independence Day Celebrations.
A CID official told the Daily News that Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne had only notified the CID of his official engagement after he had left the country.
He was summoned to give a statement with regard to the abduction of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009. Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had ordered the CID to take necessary action to arrest the former Navy Commander and Chief of Defence Staff on August 29 in the event there is sufficient evidence.
