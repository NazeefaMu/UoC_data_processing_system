Pietersz stands vindicated through the performance of his students

We refer to the article in the Daily News titled “Foreign coach Pietersz failed in his task” – SLTA, which was published on 24 April.
The facts are that amongst the players coached by Eric Pietersz is a member of the Junior Federation Cup team, a reservist for the World Tennis Juniors and currently five trialists for the ITF Under 12 tournament in Nepal.
In addition in the four tournaments held this year for ranking purposes, players from the squad trained by Eric Pietersz have performed exceptionally well as demonstrated in their achievements.

It is noteworthy that amongst those who were winners of events are those who had not won any event previously.
The SLTA contends the coach’s package costs Rs 800,000 and is therefore a ‘waste of money’. More than half of this cost is met through fees ranging from Rs 3000 per month for outstation players to Rs 25,000 per month for full time players. And the value of the investment is clearly borne out by results.
The SLTA commenced this program promising two years of uninterrupted training. However the SLTA decided to terminate the program in October last year after just eight months, without prior notice to parents/students, without any explanation for termination and without any discussion with parents of students who committed to this program. However, following appeals by the parents to the Sports Minister, the Minister directed the SLTA to continue the coaching program for a further six months and made a monthly contribution of Rs 200,000. Therefore the SLTA has only to bear a cost of Rs 200,000 a month which is surely not too much for a national association dedicated to the promotion of the sport.
Further in order to continue the program, parents have proposed to increase the fees by a further 25 percent. This is because Eric Pietersz’s coaching programming is an excellent one, which needs to be sustained. It is the best that the SLTA has introduced both in terms of training and equal access for children of all backgrounds who show promise. However the SLTA is determined to end the program, without substantive reasons and without taking into account the willingness of the parents to make further financial contribution to sustain it.
The parents of all students in the program are glad that the Sports Minister has seen value in this program and has supported it so far and believe that its continuation will not only benefit children who are part of the program, but uplift the standard of tennis overall.
