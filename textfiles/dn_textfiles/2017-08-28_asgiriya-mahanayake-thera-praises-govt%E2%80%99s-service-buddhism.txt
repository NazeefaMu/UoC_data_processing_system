Asgiriya Mahanayake Thera praises Govt.’s service to Buddhism

The great service rendered by the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe towards creating a Buddhist revival by developing Buddhist temples in the country, came in for special praise by Asgiriya Chief Prelate Most Ven Warakapola Gnanaratana Mahanayake Thera.
The occasion was the laying of foundation stones for a new Dharmasala and Daham Pasala building at the Bodhimalkada Purana Viharaya, Udagunnepana on August 25.
The Asgiriya Chief Prelate said the Government was engaged in this commendable service even deploying the services of the forces and this service had been lauded by the Maha Sangha on many occasions.
The Mahanayake Thera said a programme was underway to develop access roads to nearly 300 temples and Dagobas in the country undertaken by Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella and this was a very prudent and timely intervention to supplement Dayaka Sabhas which could not muster sufficient funds for such work from the donations of their membership who were not that affluent.
The Chief Prelate said the government’s active intervention to uplift Buddhism had also created a resurgence among the Buddhist public too.
Viharadhipathi, Mahiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya Ven. Urulewatte Dhammarakkhitha Thera, Ven Narampanawe Ananda Thera, Ven. Muruddeniye Dhammaratana Thera, Diyawadana Nilame of the Sri Dalada Maligawa Pradeep Nilanga Dela and the Basnayake Nilames of the four main devalayas in Kandy also participated.
