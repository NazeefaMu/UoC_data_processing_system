Snake diet !

The latest diet trend buzzing around the health world is the Snake Diet.Cole Robinson, a trainer developed the diet after being frustrated with advise his clients were receiving from the coaches and trainer, he explained on his website.
The concept of the meal plan is to literally eat like a snake. Having one big meal and let that sustain you for a while.
On his website, Robinson explained the diet's three phases:
l Clear your liver of toxins by fasting for 48 hours and drink apple cider vinegar and what he calls a "snake juice", which is an "essential mineral replacement", the Snake diet website claims.
l Phase two includes fasting on and off.
l Next phase is all about "maintenance" and learning to understand when your body is hungry.
On Youtube, Robinson goes into more details about the diet and claims the diet can cure diabetes, herpes, inflammation and aid weight loss.
Now down to the big question: Is it safe?
Experts say there is no evidence to suggest it is and would not recommend it. “I would not recommend it to anyone for even a short-term trial, as it is not based on any clear evidence nor does it have any clinical evidence that is peer-reviewed to support the program,” says Julie Upton, R.D., and co-founder of Appetite for Health, told Women's Health.
Beth Warren, R.D.N., founder of Beth Warren Nutrition and author of Living a Real Life with Real Food, agreed.
"You can’t live healthfully on a fast long term," registered dietitian Sonya Angelone, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics said.
