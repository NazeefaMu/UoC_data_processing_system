Registration process for international schools formalised

The Cabinet has approved formalising a registration process for international schools.
Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister and co-Cabinet spokesman Gayantha Karunathilake said Cabinet granted approval to the proposal by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to commence the re-registration of international schools under the Companies Act, on the recommendations of the Education Ministry until a formal legal framework is developed.
Karunathilake said a Cabinet Sub Committee will study the establishment of legal provisions with respect to registration, accreditation, regulation, certification of quality and administration of international schools, teacher's training and making Sinhala, Tamil and Religion and History compulsory for Sri Lankan students in international schools and to grant their recommendation.
The minister said these measures have been taken since there is trend of mushrooming substandard international schools across the country without a proper registration process.
