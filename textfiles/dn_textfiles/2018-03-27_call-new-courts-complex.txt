Call for new courts complex

The century-old main building of the Matugama Magistrate’s court is in a dilapidated condition. Matugama Bar Association President Sumanadasa Hapuhetti has requested the government to construct a new building to house the Matugama court complex consisting of the district court, magistrate’s court, and additional magistrate’s court.
He made this request at the Matugama Division Coordinating Committee meeting, which was presided over by Western Provincial Councillor and Matugama Division UNP Chief Organiser Jagath Vithana and Matugama SLFP Organiser Sumithra Priyangani Abeyweera.
There are three courts functioning inside the old building. Joint President Jagath Vithana directed the Division Secretary to bring this to the notice of the relevant ministry immediately.
