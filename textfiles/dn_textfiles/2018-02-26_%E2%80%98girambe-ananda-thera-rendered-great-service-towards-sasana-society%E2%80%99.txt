‘Girambe Ananda Thera rendered great service towards Sasana, society’

The cremation of the Most Ven. Girambe Ananda Anunayake Thera, Viharadhipati of the Sri Sarananda Maha Piriven Viharaya, Anuradhapura was held under state patronage at the Anuradhapura Harischandra Park amidst a large gathering including VIPs last Saturday.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a funeral oration said the late Thera rendered a great service towards the Sambuddha Sasana and society by moving forward overcoming various obstacles on his path. Following in the footsteps of Walisingha Harischandra, who began the Buddhist revival in the Raja Rata, the Ven. Girambe Ananda Thera came and settled down in Anuradhapura and set up the Sarananda Maha Pirivena and many Buddhist Viharyas there and abroad.

He had set up a new Sangha generation which was a pride to the Sarananda Sangha clan and the great Sasana service rendered by him is eternally etched in the hearts and minds of all, the Prime Minister said.
The Ven. Girambe Ananda Thera, who held several important positions in the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya, was gifted with great management skills. He was outspoken on matters which concerned the Buddha Sasana, the Premier said.
He toured the country delivering religious discourses. Although he gave Buddhism its pre-eminent place, he never criticised or harmed other religions.Although he had opportunities to settle down in Colombo or Kandy, he stayed back in Anuradhapura and paid special attention and care to backward villages in the region. Villagers which benefited from his service were many and that was one reason why people everywhere were saddened about his demise, the Prime Minister said
The late Ven. Girambe Ananda Thera offered leadership in matters concerning politics. He offered vital counsel to the late Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake, the late Presidents J.R. Jayewardene and R. Premadasa by closely associating with them, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said that there were even times when the late Thera criticised him. The late Thera said he criticised him (Prime Minister) with good intentions to correct him. The movement they launched towards establishment of good governance succeeded partly due to the silent leadership offered by the late Thera.
The best way to pay homage to the late Thera was to carry forward the service rendered by him. While thanking the late Thera for his service, the Prime Minister wished the late Thera the eternal bliss of Nibbana.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the late Thera rendered an epochal service towards creating a good society. He had occasion to associate with the late Thera for several decades. The Sarananda Pirivena started by him rendered a great service towards Bhikkhu education.
He assisted in ordaining 1,000 Samanera bhikkhus during the Buddha Jayanthi Celebrations held in 2006. During the 1983 Communal riots, the late Thera offered succour and solace to hundreds of innocent Tamil civilians. The late Thera’s demise was a great loss to the country in general and the Ramanna Nikayaya in particular.
The Most Ven. Napane Pemasiri Mahanayaka Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya and the late Ananda Thera took steps to propagate the Buddha Dhamma here and abroad and rendered an immense social service. He was an exemplary bhikkhu who was loved and adored by people especially in Raja Rata, Kurunegala and Kandy regions.
