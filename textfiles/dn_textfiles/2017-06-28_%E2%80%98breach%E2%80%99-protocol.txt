That ‘breach’ of protocol

Sri Lanka’s envoy in Japan Ganganath Dissanayake has been given a rap on the knuckles by the higher echelons of the Yahapalanaya government for extending protocol assistance and courtesies to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during the latter’s visit to that country. The envoy, by way of explanation had stated that he was acting in terms of the instructions he received from the Foreign Ministry, which wanted the protocol assistance and courtesies be extended to the former President and his entourage, citing two circulars in this regard. However, it was pointed out by the higher authorities that there was only one circular that is applicable and this permitted protocol assistance and courtesies to be extended only to the President, Prime Minister, Speaker, Leader of the Opposition and state ministers. Ganganath, in his response, has also cited an instance, where during a visit to Japan last year by Rajapaksa, the Foreign Ministry had deferred from the latest instructions. Since he had not received a response from the ministry seeking a clarification he had proceeded with the original instructions.
Be that as it may, nobody will begrudge the protocol and courtesies extended to a former Head of State during his/ her visit to another country, never mind any circulars to this effect. On the contrary, cold shouldering a Lankan Head of State in a foreign country by the government will smack of, not just ingratitude, but could also bring public opprobrium on the country’s rulers and allegations of envy, nay revenge. However, the dignitary concerned should also act and conduct himself/herself in a manner that befits the extension of such official courtesies of the state and desist in any way from being critical of the incumbent regime, openly or by innuendo.
However, this was the last thing that Rajapaksa has been doing during his foreign visits so far undertaken since his ouster from office two and a half years ago. On all these occasions Rajapaksa never missed an opportunity to badmouth the government on foreign soil, and what is more, make pronouncements that could even have an economic impact on the country. In Japan, during his latest visit, Rajapaksa stated that Sri Lankan businessmen in Japan, particularly vehicle importers, were complaining that they were no longer able to survive due to the ‘disastrous policies’ of the Yahapalanaya government. One would have thought that Sri Lankan businessmen in Japan hardly relied on Sri Lankan government policies to prosper as businessmen in Japan and particularly dependent on Sri Lanka for their vehicle exports.
But the statement, coming from a former Head of State of Sri Lanka, no doubt, could create doubts among prospective Japanese investors to the country as to the state of its economy. Enjoying the protocol assistance and diplomatic courtesies extended by the Sri Lankan envoy, Rajapaksa, addressing a gathering of Sri Lankans says that all Lankans living in Japan were critical of the Yahapalanaya government and was clamouring for a regime change. What is more, the envoy had gone the whole hog and extended official courtesies to Rajapaksa and his entourage up to the point of customs clearance after being privy to all that was said against the government by MR in Japan. Is it therefore anything to wonder at the highest in the land being incensed at the official courtesies being extended to Rajapaksa ala the pithy Sinhala saying Illan kewa (asked for and got it.)
It is time that the government lay down in explicit terms as to who should receive diplomatic protocol and official courtesies during their visits abroad. Rajapaksa’s, indeed, was a private visit and certainly did not warrant such niceties- not going by his past performances anyway, when abroad. Rajapaksa himself should consider his position with circumspection. He is, after all, a former Head of State and ought to know better. He should take a leaf out of the book of his predecessors and conduct himself with the dignity and honour befitting that of a former Head of State. JRJ took it easy after retirement, confining himself to after dinner speeches and gracing selected events as Chief Guest. DBW was virtually unheard of after he exited the scene. CBK no doubt is still in the limelight but never aspired for political office after remaining at the helm for just over a decade. Mahinda Rajapaksa broke with this tradition and once more ventured into electoral politics, after serving two terms as President and failed going for a third.
In that context, MR is the only retired Head of State among Sri Lankan leaders who has opted to stay put, even though he has passed the psalmist’s life span of three score and ten years, perhaps still harbouring the prospect of grabbing the crown that was which was taken away from him. Rajapaksa cannot be found fault with, though, for trying to extend his political career and also for his attacks on the government as an Opposition MP, except when he goes beyond the ken and demeans himself and the high office he once held, in his quest for power.
