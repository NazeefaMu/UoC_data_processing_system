Queen Anula - The shadow of Cleopatra

In the new criticism , the moment where the characters achieve realization, awareness or a feeling of knowledge after which events are seen through the prism of light in the story is called epiphany. Mohan Raj Madawala uses the so called insight lavishly throughout his novel Rajina.
Queen Anula who reigned the country in 47BC is described as a murderous and lecherous queen who sought lustful companionship of a number of husbands. In any national historical legends that kind of branded vendetta can be observed. But most probably a sincere account of as to how such incidents occurred might not have been recorded. In reflecting this type of controversial issues availability of a penetrating vision on the part of an author plays an important role.
It is essential to perceive the traditional history in an anthropological view and on the other hand with a humanitarian vision . This concept, in criticism, is identified as New Historicism. Mohan Raj’s ‘Rajina’ , when looking at that perspective , could be categorized as a novel written in the light of New Historicism.
Prof. Vimal Dissanayake, distinguishing the ‘New and Old History” from ‘New Historicism’ states that the ‘Old History is based on chronicles and literature whereas the the ‘New Historicism’ deals with the contemporary and also circumstantial documents as well. Mohan too seems not to have kept an absolute trust solely on the chronicles, but it is obvious that he has referred to the other contemporary historical documents as well as the history of Egypt and Cleopatra. It is a significant approach in creation of historical fictions
The name Anula, the queen, though considered as a nymphomaniac character by the common people, one might feel, when reading the novel ‘Rajina’ that she is a very sensitve woman of humanitarian qualities blended with sensuality. It is according to the common practice of attributing the final responsibility of any diplomatic issue upon the ruler, that the queen Anula has been recorded in the history as a murderous and a Jezebel.
Each of Anula’s husbands died as a result of insidious conspiracies in the state. Those who instigated such conspiracies were the representatives of various social forces of the time. But just because of the fact that it was Anula’s husbands who were murdered, the blame easily fell on her.
According to ‘Meda Midula’ by Senarathna Weerasinghe, a translation of George Bernard Shaw’s ‘Days with Bernard Shaw’ (1949) it is evident that promoting or tarnishing an image of either of a historical or contemporary person occur based on social requirements. This reality seemingly has an impact on creating an unfavorable image on Anula’s character.
It’s true that Anula had to be the wife of many men. Her first husband was the King Mahanaga. Later on she was compelled to be the wife of someone else who uses her only to quench the thirst for lust. But Anula developed an attachment which would harmonize with internal sexual and emotional rhythm of each other.
It was a carter by the name of Thissa who subsequently became a minister of her court and later on the one and only love of her life. In D.H.Lawrence’s ‘Fantasia of Unconcious’ this reality is described. According to Lawrence there is a tendency for those with equal sexual and emotional (mental) to amalgamate.
These relationships occur irrespective of the accepted religious, cultural or ethical values. It is not difficult for lay immature, ignorant people to come to conclusions about the lives of others. Thus the heresy about certain people would become popular topics for daily gossip. But actually speaking it is only by a mature sensible person with a broad understanding of humanity and knowledge of subtle epistemological nature, who could pass down to earth judgement over such issues. Dr. Philip C. Margo in his ‘Life Strategies’ states that it is better to maintain silence on the part of those incapable, rather than voice their opinion on intricate and sensitive problems of people.
Mohan Raj Madawala’s ‘Rajina’ can be identifies as an attempt to cast epiphany in connection with the sensitive character of queen Anula, demolishing all the dark patches attributed to her by the people who are immature and of little education.
