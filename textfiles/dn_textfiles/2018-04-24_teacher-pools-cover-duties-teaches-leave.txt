Teacher pools to cover duties of teaches on leave

 
The Education Ministry has drawn attention to establish a zonal base teacher pools to cover duties of the teachers, who are on leave for long periods.
It has been revealed that around 10,000 teachers are on leave annually citing various reasons such as maternity leave, accident leave, training etc.
This situation is a great hindrance for the smooth function of school education, the Education Ministry said.  
Expressing his concern, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam instructed education officials to establish teacher pools, zonal wise.
Accordingly, a teacher pool will be established in each education zone.
The teachers of the pool will be deployed to relevant schools to cover duties of the teachers, who are on leave for long periods.
