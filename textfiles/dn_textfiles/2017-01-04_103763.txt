All political parties should work for country’s progress: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at the ceremony to lay the foundation stone for the Volkswagen motor assembly plant in Kuliyapitiya yesterday said that the people had to choose between providing jobs to the youth through foreign investments or handing the country once again over to a group which robbed the state of its resources. He observed that the people of the country had sacrificed immensely from the time of the war and that it was the duty of all political parties to help provide the people with the benefits they deserve.
“They should all work for the country’s progress,” the Prime Minister said.
The ceremony was presided over by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Prime Minister further stated,  “Many have asked me when the motor vehicle manufacturing plant in Kuliyapitiya was to start. They ridiculed it. The establishment of the plant can be taken as one of the first decisions taken by President Sirisena soon after he took office. Thereafter, we embarked on the path to establish a motor vehicle manufacturing plant in Sri Lanka. Though we
received permission to go ahead, the project was delayed by a year due not being able to find suitable land for it. The plant has the capacity to provide around 2,500 direct jobs. “Prior to this, I participated in the opening of the Pannala Marks Company,” the Prime Minister said. “The company initially has the capacity to provide 3,000 jobs. Once we regain the GSP plus concession, it will be able to provide 2000 more jobs. On this day alone, we have started projects which will provide close to 7,500 jobs to people,” the Premier said.
“By next Thursday or Friday, several more factories are scheduled to start,” he said.
They will create around 3,000 - 4,000 jobs. The Hambantota development programme this year alone is set to create 10,000 jobs. This shows that within a week alone, we have managed to provide around 20,000 jobs.
The factories which would provide 20,000 jobs will commence before President Maithripala Sirisena’s inauguration anniversary on January 8.
“Neither the President nor I will be satisfied by that however. The youth of this country need more jobs. For the last 30 years, we have suffered the impacts of war, so our development was restricted. We expected great progress to take place after the war, we hoped that the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and Burghers would get together but none of that happened. In the end we decided to choose Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate and take our country towards true development,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
“We triumphed even through the suppression of that time. Thereafter, we promised to give the youth jobs. At this point, you must note the state of the country we took over. When we took over, revenue stood at 10 percent of GDP. This was not sufficient to meet our recurrent expenditure or to meet our loan repayments. We could not even beg for that money. Today our income has grown to be able to support our recurrent expenditure,” the Prime Minister added.
“The country was facing a massive debt burden. Our goal is to reduce that burden by the end of this year. We aim to not hand over that burden to the next generation. The President as well as I are visiting countries around the world to win over their confidence. We have started all programs having established a sound foundation. But there is more to be done. At the end of 2015, the establishment of a national government under the leadership of President Sirisena was just one step in that direction. The speed at which we have moved for several years has not been sufficient, we need to move faster. We have not yet pushed the accelerator to the foot board yet. In the next five years we hope to embark on a great journey and we have the support of all going ahead,”Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
