Property donated by Dr. Shiva Chinnathambi
Govt. to probe former Colombo University VC

The government is planning to probe former Colombo University Vice Chancellor Kumara Hirimburegama for handing over campus land to a private company, Parliament was told yesterday.
A property donated by late Dr. Shiva Chinnathambi to set up a girls hostel was
given on contract by the former Vice Chancellor of the Colombo University Kumara Hirimburegama to a private company to run a mall for two years, University Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He said the CID and the Presidential Commission looking into corruption have been notified of this and they are investigating the matter.
The minister also said the CID is investigating what happened to the furniture and other goods that were in the house at the time it was donated. JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake raising a question said the CID has a complete report of the furniture that had been there in the house and an MP sitting in the front row in Parliament had allegedly taken them away.
That particular MP was sitting on the fifth seat from the seat of the Leader of the House. If possible, the government could take him into custody.
Minister Kiriella said this in response to the oral question raised by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa.
