Health Ministry launches National Policy on Health Information

The Health Ministry launched the National Policy on Health Information in Colombo during a ceremony held at the BMICH with the participation of many stakeholders, yesterday. Cabinet approval was granted for this policy on January 3.
Addressing the gathering, Acting Director General of Health services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said, a National Policy is required in order to assure the security of health information.
Some health information can be used for dangerous purposes. Strict safety regulations should be followed. Yet people do not like to have an identification number for them due to the fear of revealing privacy.
Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa said, we need accurate, updated, reliable and quality information in order to deliver a better health care service to the public. Many other speakers from various institutions addressed the gathering.
The National Policy on Health Information provides directions under five thematic areas. They are, health information related resources, indicators and data elements, data and information management, data/information security, client privacy, confidentiality and ethics and e-Health and innovations.
