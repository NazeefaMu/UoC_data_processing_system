Megapolis Ministry to hold Avurudu festival

The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry has currently made preparations to hold a Sinhala and Tamil New Year (Avurudu) festival titled Suryabhishekaya on April 8.
The festival would consist of a Mega Spring Festival with games and activities at Torrington Grounds, a cultural show with the participation of 1,200 performing artistes at the Independence Square and a musical evening at Arcade Independence Square.
The festival would commence with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, along with local and foreign dignitaries.
“People usually celebrate Avurudu at their villages, but we need to bring it to the city as well. This festival would be a new experience for citizens living in urban areas and we expect to use this ceremony as a tourist attraction,” Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said at a press conference, yesterday.
“Our objective is to showcase Sri Lanka's cultural diversity to a wider audience. Those who appreciate Sri Lankan culture would benefit from this event,” the media statement stated; “Food and clothing available at this festival would be authentic products from local entrepreneurs. No money was provided by the state to organise this event,” the minister added.
