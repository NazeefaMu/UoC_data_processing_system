Senior students visit massage clinics

NWP Councillor alleges:
Senior students of leading schools in Kuliyapitiya reportedly had visited ayurveda treatment centres in the Kurunegala urban area seeking massages wasting money given to them by their parents for tuition fees.
NWP Councillor Samanpriya Herath raised the issue at the NWP monthly meeting recently. North Western Province (NWP) Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake said he would take the issue seriously as students could become accustomed to numerous bad habits by visiting massage clinics. The NWP Councillor said that most of the centres operate illegally and that police raided 12 such centres in the NWP during the past six months
