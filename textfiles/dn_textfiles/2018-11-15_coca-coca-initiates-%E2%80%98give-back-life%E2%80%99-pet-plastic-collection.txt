Coca-Coca initiates ‘Give Back Life’ PET plastic collection

Further expanding the scope of its ‘Give Back Life’ PET plastic collection and recycling campaign, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka, with its recycling partner Eco Spindles joined hands with LAUGFS Petroleum, to place ‘Give Back Life’ PET plastic collection bins at the Koswatte service station to enable customers to dispose their PET plastic bottles responsibly when visiting the area.
Management from Coca-Cola and LAUGFS Petroleum gathered together with volunteers to educate customers as they drove through the service station during the launch.
Customers entering the service station will be prompted by the educational signage to bring in their PET plastic bottles to be disposed appropriately for recycling purposes. All collected PET plastic bottles will be given new life by being converted into brushes, brooms, shoes and clothing. The symbol “1” inside a triangle in a plastic bottle indicates PET which is Polyethylene Terephthalate. This symbol is normally found in packaging containing soft drinks, juices, cooking oil, water, personal care and cosmetic products.
LAUGFS Koswatte has one of the highest footfalls of 6,000 – 7,000 vehicles per day. At the launch, the management teams and volunteers distributed educational leaflets to customers whilst giving them awareness on how the simple action of choosing to dispose of their PET plastics in a Give Back Life bin could translate to many long-term benefits. Coca-Cola conducted training programmes for the two staff shifts which operate the station throughout the week whom wholeheartedly endorsed the campaign to spread this valuable message to recycle PET plastic bottles and thereby not only provide alternative livelihoods to people but improve the beautiful environment in Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the occasion Mahesh Weerasena CEO, LAUGFS Petroleum said, “We are delighted to partner with Coca-Cola’s ‘Give Back Life’ PET plastic collection and recycling program which is very much in line with our company values. As a company that is mindful of its responsibility to the future generation, we are looking to see how we can collaborate further on this great initiative, especially with our recently launched model solar powered fuel station in Pepiliyana.
