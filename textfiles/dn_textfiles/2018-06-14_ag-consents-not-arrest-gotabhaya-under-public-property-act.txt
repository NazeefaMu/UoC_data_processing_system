AG consents not to arrest Gotabhaya under Public Property Act

The Court of Appeal ordered to continue an order preventing Gotabhaya Rajapaksa being arrested under the Public Property Act over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana were built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
The order was made in view of submissions and consent of both lawyers of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Attorney General.
Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara made this order pursuant to a writ petition filed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
Accordingly, the order issued by Court of Appeal dated April 5, 2016 preventing Gotabhaya Rajapaksa being arrested, will be prevailed without any time bar.
