Vaiko, Thirumavalavan ask Centre not to back SL

India’s MDMK general secretary Vaiko and VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan on Monday appealed to the Centre not to support Sri Lanka during the ongoing United Nations Human Rights Council meeting, since the island government had not implemented the council’s resolution in 2015 to set up a hybrid mechanism to probe the war crimes during the military offensive against the LTTE in 2009.
Vaiko, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution in 2015, paving the way for an independent impartial investigation by international jurists into the alleged war crimes committed by the Sri Lankan army in 2009. But, Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had declared that the island nation would not permit any jurist from any country into Lanka for the investigation into the happenings of 2009.
High Commissioner for United Nations Human Rights Council Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein made a statement criticising the slow progress in addressing alleged wartime crimes. He requested the Union government to take necessary steps to change the Indian Government’s position in the HRC in favor of an independent international investigation.
