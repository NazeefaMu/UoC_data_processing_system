Students suspended for ragging

A batch of 17 second-year students of the Oluvil South Eastern University’s Commerce and Management Faculty have been suspended and banned from entering the Faculty premises till May 19 for continuous ragging of first-year technology students.
Vice Chancellor N.M.M. Najim said, “The suspension was made following reports that these second-year students had taken a group of freshers into the adjoining forest and beaten them up on the pretext of ragging.
If ragging continued in this manner, those responsible would be denied hostel accommodation and ‘Mahapola’ allowances.”
