Dananjaya plays captain’s knock to steer Lanka to win

A captain’s knock of 92 not out by Nipun Dananjaya off 112 balls with seven fours saw Sri Lanka beat India by five wickets with 26 balls to spare in the second Under 19 ODI and square the five-match series 1-all at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Chasing 194 for victory, the Sri Lanka rode on a 92-run fourth wicket partnership between Dananjaya and Pasindu Sooriyabandara who contributed 52 off 71 balls (5 fours) to reach their target comfortably.
Sri Lanka lost Navod Paranavithana to the fifth ball of the innings but recovered through the partnership to register a handsome win.
The Lankan bowlers also played their part earlier with fast bowler Navin Nirmal Fernando striking twice off his first three overs to reduce India to 23-2. He had Anuj Rawat, out for three and Atharwa Taide for eight runs both caught behind by wicketkeeper Nishan Madushka.
Left-arm spinner Shashika Dulshan continued the good work with three wickets for 27 runs that included the wicket of Pavan Shah for 49 scored off 64 balls with 4 fours.
The third ODI will take place at the SSC grounds on Sunday (August 4).
