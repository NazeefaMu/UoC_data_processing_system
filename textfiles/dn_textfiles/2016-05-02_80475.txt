SLFP CC to decide on Kirulapone rally participants

 
It is up to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Central Committee to decide what to do in connection with the SLFP MPs who took part in the Kirulapone May Day rally, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
President Maithripala Sirisena said that the SLFP Central Committee will be summoned this week, he said. Addressing the media at his office in Colombo today, Musthapha said President Sirisena acts democratically in the SLFP.
The SLFP May Day rally was held in Galle. It was a historic May Day rally for the SLFP with the highest number of participants ever. The space was not adequate to accommodate all. According to Minister Musthapha, there is no legal base for the proposal passed in the Northern Provincial Council in connection with establishing a federal system. Anybody can express any idea but two third of the parliament and referendum is required for such a proposal.
Sri Lanka will be a unitary state for ever. "I say this with a responsibility," the minister said. Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nannayakkara said a huge crowd gathered to Samanola grounds, Galle for the SLFP May Day rally. The people showed the country the importance of following the leader of the political party by taking part in the SLFP May Day rally in large numbers. This is the largest ever crowd took part in an SLFP May Day rally. Participants from 40 electorates could not enter into the grounds due to over crowding, he said.
