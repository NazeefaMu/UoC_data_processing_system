SLT Mobitel strengthen ties with ANCL

SLT Mobitel Chief Operating Officer, Nalin Perera addressing the press yesterday said that “It is indeed a privilege for SLT Mobitel to take part in sponsoring the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year yet again as this programme has successfully paved way for many players from school to club and national level in the past few years.
As the National Mobile Service Provider, it is our duty to ensure that we play a significant role to promote sports in the country and we will not limit this to Cricket but also extend to other sports as well. It is our belief that sports plays a key role in personality and character development of a person and this will build a healthy and strong nation for the future.” he further said.
