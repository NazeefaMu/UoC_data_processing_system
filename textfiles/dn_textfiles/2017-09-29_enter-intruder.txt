Enter Intruder

The dramatists of the British School in Colombo are a versatile group of thespians. Their adaptability has enabled them to stage Pygmalion which My Fair Lady was based on and now they are preparing for a supernatural play called ‘The Intruder’. Dramatic Moves features these resilient students whose outstanding talent and grasp of the fundamentals of drama have enabled them to deliver some memorable performances.
“At the present we are auditioning for ‘Anything Goes’, which is the Cole Porter musical. We are going to stage it next year in March 22, 23 and 24. We are going through the auditioning process for that, and then once we establish the cast we will go into rehearsals and the crew will start to work. That will be a big event with 50 plus cast,” said The British School in Colombo, Head of Drama, Shane Meiklejohn.
“The Intruder” is a bit of a dark drama that requires considerable skill. And the dramatists of BSC are certainly not lacking in skill. Indeed the fact that they can switch from a play like Pygmalion to ‘The Intruder’ is proof of their talent as both plays deal with different themes.
“We have a team of students who will present the mysterious symbolist play, The Intruder by the nineteenth century Belgian playwright Maurice Maeterlinck for entry in the CBB Drama Competition in October. The Intruder is also for their O/Ls. Last year we staged Pygmalion which was what they based my Fair Lady on. We decided to go with the actual script of Pygmalion and the original text, but we incorporated some song and dance in that. So that was a lot of fun,” Meiklejohn said.
The dramatists of BSC certainly have good breeding. There inter-house competition is very competitive. “There is also our inter-house drama competition between all the houses which is very exciting. It will take part in late October. They have to formulate a team of around 15 students from a cross section from year seven all the way up to year 13. They have to incorporate some movement into it as well as dialogue and they should be specific to the theme and they need to use some music. So they have to be fairly creative and develop something original. So we try to bring in some industry professionals and some of the performing arts teachers here to be the judges for it,” Meiklejohn explained.
Because of drama any student can build up his or her self –esteem and be able to express themselves. One of the most important and vital qualities that a person can possess is self- expression. Putting your thoughts into the correct words, articulation, the ability to meaningfully communicate and it also teaches them skills in vocal and physical expressions which are very useful in public speaking and presentation. It is the whole idea of ensemble – working together in theater is very important.
“When you have these creative goals together there is a lot of sharing of ideas and sharing of skills which is wonderful. The creative side I must emphasize on because we teach them everything from technical stuff such as lighting and sound to artistic design on the stage as well as acting theories and styles. The students learn about how it touches on culture and all the arts integrated. You learn skills like quick thinking and timing and agility and creativity and spontaneity. It is a good way for team building and such skills. You also learn improvisation. The students are very creative and switched on about a lot of things in the world. They are very interested in developing character and story- telling and evoking story through acting,” Meiklejohn said.
Good grounding
Findlay Tattersall, year 11 who plays Oliver, the Uncle in The Intruder, spoke how fascinating the play ‘The Intruder’ is. Supernatural films have always had a spellbinding effect on the human psyche.
“The play that we are doing here is in an eerie setting and it is in the late 90’s. Superstition of ghosts and the supernatural was very prevalent during that time. Some of the characters in the play are a little ‘creeped out’ and even some of the characters are not willing to admit that they are a little ‘freaked out’! My character is Oliver who plays the role of the stubborn uncle. He is quite nice and friendly but sometimes he is a little bit stubborn,” said Tattersall.
The play itself kind of gets you ready for what is to happen, it kind of sets things in place. You don’t know what is going to happen yet. You sort of anticipate what is going to happen. It is very interesting and I rather enjoy it.
“Practices have been going on well. We started last year. Everyone is very enthusiastic. So we have seen each other over the holidays. We see how everything is built step by step. And we get to where we are now because now we are having costumes and make up. So it is all a really interesting experience,” said Tattersall.
BSC Drama is perfect because of the good grounding it gives its students in drama. BSC teaches their students’ life lessons. The productions were all fundamentals because they all taught these students valuable lessons.
“Each and every single one makes you ready. I want to do acting as a career in life. So doing drama at BSC is the best chance of doing what I want to do in the future. Certain group work you need to learn because these people are people I don’t normally work with, which is nice because that prepares you for what comes later in life. So you learn about different acting styles. Everyone helps each other. And that is another BSC attribute. We are all getting ready for the production itself. If someone is anxious or nervous so we give him or her a nudge which helps. So we get through. If you are the creative type I would say Drama is the thing because it makes you familiar with so many disciplines like acting, directing, writing screen plays or handling the lights. It gives you a confidence boost,” explained Tattersall.
A major theme
Udara Kularatne, year 11 who plays the Grandmother in The Intruder, spoke of death as a major theme. Death in any play is a complicated issue to deal with and many cultures represent death in so many ways.
“I play the blind grandmother in the Intruder. It is a play set in the late 90’s. It is basically about the supernatural element. Death is a major theme. It is how death comes and takes people away. And me, being the blind grandmother I can sense it because of my wisdom and maybe because of how old I am,” said Kularatne.
Thorough research is the best method to mastering your character. You need to have a ‘feel’ for your character.
“I am better at playing younger characters than older characters. So by playing the blind grandmother I am trying to face the challenge. To get into the skin of a character you can watch youtube videos such as old people acting in movies. So you observe those people. And you can even read upon blindness. How a blind person would feel. Drama is not as easy as some people think. Do it if you like to do it. If you like being on stage and speaking to big audiences and if you like acting and the written element. Then do it. There is an element of fun as well,” said Kularatne.
Very different ideas
Liana Lawrence, year 11 plays Ursula, the grand daughter in The Intruder felt that the time gap has to be dealt with when trying to perfect her role.
“To get into the skin of my character I have to imagine myself in the situation and try and feel how this young girl would feel and her mindset, because things were different in that era. She is young and innocent. It is very different to modern young girls. So I had to do quite a lot of research into it to get into that personality. She is the one the grand mother has most trust in. Me and the grandmother had to work on our personal relationship as well to show that in the play such as how we trust each other. Otherwise it would not be realistic at all,” said Lawrence.
The most interesting thing about life is that so many people respond differently to the same situation. Different people have very different ideas about how to respond to a similar experience.
“In drama I get to work with so many different individuals and find out how people think about similar situations. Quite a few of us got together through our holidays and work through our lines and getting into the mood and emotions of the characters. When I acted in Pygmalion it was fun! I got to know a lot of people. The plot of Pygmalion was about a street girl who had been brought up in the poor areas of London and she is basically taken into care by a philosopher and he taught her how to act like a lady. He took her from a poor girl selling flowers on the streets into something more refined,” explained Lawrence.
Stage fright
Theekshana Nawinne, year 11 plays Paul, the Father in The Intruder stated that when he does something he gives it 100 percent. He is very serious about what he wants to do in life.
“There are humorous characters on stage and I have seen them in society. People are not exactly the same but somewhere along those lines. I have not performed Shakespearean plays but I have studied a lot of them. My favorite play probably is Pygmalion. It was very thrilling. In a very serious play I was like the comic relief,” said Nawinne.
Every single drama I have done is pretty much unforgettable says Nawinne stressing that when he does something he puts his entire soul into it. To him each play is different and it is this uniqueness that appeals to him. It is what makes his effort worthwhile.
“Through drama I have learnt to be a very professional speaker. It has helped me with my public speaking. In drama you have to speak to large audiences. Drama is a very good way of expressing yourself. Any actor has stage fright. In my first performance I was a little bit shaky and I was very anxious. Once you get used to acting little by little you get better. Also my friends helped me a lot,” said Nawinne
For a good production you need to have a dedicated cast. You need a very good director. There are assistant directors and choreographers. All those people come together. When they put in their 100 percent you have an amazing play. It requires a lot of hard work, dedication and effort.
