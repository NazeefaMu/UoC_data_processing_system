HC permits Tiran to travel abroad

The Colombo High Court yesterday permitted former Parliamentarian Tiran Alles to travel overseas for three weeks.
Former Parliamentarian Tiran Alles’ passport was impounded by Court in connection with the controversial RADA case and he had sought Colombo High Court’s permission to travel abroad.
Alles requested the Colombo High Court through his lawyers that his passport be temporally released for him to travel abroad for medical purpose. High Court Judge Wikum Kaluarachchi permitted the former MP to travel Singapore from December 10 to January 4.
The case filed against four persons including former MP Tiran Alles and former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan in connection with a Rs. 200 million misappropriation allegedly taken place at the RADA in 2006, was fixed for January 22 by the Colombo High Court.
