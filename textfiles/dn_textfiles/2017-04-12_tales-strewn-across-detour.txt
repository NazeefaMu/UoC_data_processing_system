Tales strewn across a detour

Instead of reflecting just as words on their reading-glasses, ManjulaWediwardena is back in the readers’ minds and thoughts with his third collection of short stories named Beauty of viciousness and other stories from Rathmalana. The book is the first collection of a planned series of short stories based on Rathmalana, the city that Wediwardena lived and grew up.
Wediwardena has published his second collection of short stories called ‘Saint Judas’ eleven years after the banning of his maiden collection of short stories ‘Mary named Maria’ in 2000. Those who had an opportunity to read ‘Judas’ will definitely look for this new collection of ‘viciousness’ with hidden beauty. This piece of observation is on Wediwardena’s writing style of short stories in his new collection.
According to Tolstoy, “All great literature is one of two stories; a man goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town”. Wediwardena as a writer, poet and a journalist adds value to that quote by going on various journeys in life as a man from town and sharing his stories with strangers coming to town.
Outdated definitions
Keeping Manjula Wediwardena’s new short story collection on my desk with a cup of coffee (now cold) waiting to giveaway the first sip, I’m hesitant to agree with outdated definitions such as “A short story should be a short piece of fiction that can be read in one sitting” (Edgar Allan Poe). Though Wediwardena’s stories can be read in one sitting, the hardest is to avoid the spaces and voids he naturally creates in-between his lines. Those traps are formed for some readers to just ‘topple’, for some to ‘sink’ and for some to dive in. There is no escape from them. Whoever reads Wediwardena’s stories will topple, sink or choose to dive into those emotional, rational and ideological spaces. Therefore, an effective reader going through Wediwardena’s short stories once, would find them forcing him or her to re-read.
Judas Iscariot is known for the kiss and betrayal of Jesus to the Sanhedrin for thirty silver coins. His name is generally considered as a synonym for betrayal or treason. Being a writer famous for naming his books with controversial titles, Wediwardena shows the saint in Judas in his second collection of short stories (Saint Judas). The short story titled ‘Saint Judas’ implanted a new lens in the readers’ inner eye to take a sensible tour through history and philosophy. Following the same, the title of Wediwardena’s new collection is also conveying messages, releasing signals and radiations through to the conscience of conscious human beings, inviting them to see some ‘beauty in viciousness’ without pretending to be viciously beautiful.
Writers move to the city from distant villages to make their dreams come true. Then they start to write blaming the city and embroidering what they miss in the village. What they pretend to forget is the place on which they keep their feet steady while creating such masterpieces. Wediwardena loves the brimstone on which he was born and embraces its viciousness, seeing its underlying beauty of humanity. As Garcia Marquez once said, “a true writer (friend) is the one who holds your hand and touches your heart”, Wediwardena stretches both his hands out to the readers to hold and walk with him through six short stories, tapping on their minds opening the door to their true sanity.
Manipulated spelling
The collection reassures Wediwardena’s unique writing style and its ability to caress the hidden softness within corruption and cruelty. Carefully picked structure, theme and language of each story imply his shrewdness in literature. Best example is the manipulated spelling of the title. Throughout the book he explores humanity affected by the vicious cycles of power, poverty, love and hatred. When describing his writing style of short stories, quoting the phrase “smile with tears” is not an exaggeration because of his unique way of twisting thoughts and endings of each story. When one of his stories ends in a hilarious but also vicious kind of way, another story will end with “continuing endings”. Wediwardena is incredibly capable of twisting thoughts and behaviour of his characters and play with readers’ expectations of the story. Finally he surprises the reader with something utterly unexpected and let them shut the book with a million of thoughts about the story they just read.
Wediwardena discusses how women are abused through love and relationships in any society. An appreciable fact in his style of writing is that he never uses his ink, paper and time to poke directly on the readers’ eyeballs. He blows a single grain of dust into their intuition and let it grow as a pearl, hurting and stirring their thoughts, directing them to look at the society through their inner eyes. Readers can agree or disagree with this fact after reading ‘Until tonight turns into dawn’ and ‘Beauty of Viciousness’.
Wediwardena explains that there is no difference between a woman in the city and a woman from village in his first short story.
“Now, I can only see her feet that are polished and flattened by wearing high-heels.” Even though ‘she’ wears high heels as a lady from town, the whole story of a woman’s destiny is written in just a handful of words. Reading through the pages and diving into the voids between lines the reader realises that a woman’s destiny never changes regardless of what they wear (high-heals, flats or nothing) or where they live (village or town).
Single thread
Further, there is a beautiful detailed explanation of a night outside the protagonist’s house in this particular story. Someone can argue that it is not relevant as this is a short story. But, just as Tolstoy’s short stories, Wediwardena’s stories are interlaced with a single thread. An omission of just one word or even a single punctuation mark of his paragraphs will cause the whole story to collapse. The explanation of the night in this story symbolises the guilt that the writer feels (and its beauty) when leaving his home to see his two mistresses (a mother and daughter) just the night before his wedding. The amazing ending of this story happens with twisted thoughts and symbols.
Experimental way
‘Meeting Adam’ invites readers to be rational to look back on Sri Lankan history as well as biblical history and rethink. Wediwardena consciously gifts the whole story through some intoxicated thoughts of a doped young man who imagines that he was a butterfly. The story’s end is structured in a very unique and experimental way which I chose not to explain here and kill the excitement of reading it in full.
‘He stopped sucking on his dummy’ reveals another side of the society which is suppressed and kept a secret by the authorities as well as the corrupted intellectuals exploiting their own professions. The writer explains how has the system been adjusted, twisted, turned and bent in order to justify their abusive actions and what had lead them into such situations. Skilfully addressing all layers of the society, Wediwardena has not forgotten to inject the corruptions within the cultural as well as traditional circles into this story.
Forte of Wediwardena’s poetic fictions is the hidden morals in those so-called voids he creates between lines. Even if a reader consciously leaps over one void, he or she would accidentally topple into another within the same story. ‘The touch of a rebel’s skinny hand’ is one example. ‘The touch of a rebel’s skinny hand’ holds the readers’ hand to walk a rebellious hike into the insurgent period in Sri Lanka which had never seen a glorious ending. It explains how the innocent youth of the country had been lead into disasters through fake personalities and socio-political structures. This story knocks on the older generation’s heart and forces to question themselves of their actions and decisions made in their youth. It also exhibits how the innocence of young age is taken for granted by the tainted political movements even today.
Target straight
As a journalist, poet and a writer, Manjula Wediwardena can be considered as the most proclaimed explorer of literature in Sri Lanka during the past two decades. Not only he valiantly creates his own poetic versions of Sinhala words but also uses them to hit the target straight, without the slightest mistake. For such a skill he could be called as “The sniper of words” (in my personal opinion). His newly created and used words are then followed by the young generation of poets and writers (wisely as well as blindly).
Wediwardena’s success is obviously backed by his voyages through various walks of life as a true human being who stands by his words and believes in his actions. When the events were lining up to put a full stop to his excursions, Wediwardena had flung himself in the air to fly and land on somewhere else in the world which had eventually granted him a pass to explore the world literature. Though he lives oceans apart, Sri Lankan literature is still fortunate to be nurtured by his contributions.
The interlacing of themes, style and literature of this new book of short stories can be considered as something that is capable of marking a turning point in the history of Sri Lankan short story.
