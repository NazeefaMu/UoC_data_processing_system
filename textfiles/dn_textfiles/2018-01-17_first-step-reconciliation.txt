First step of reconciliation

The preceding week, from January 8 to 14, turned out to be a resourceful one for the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry. The objective was promoting reconciliation among different ethnicities and religious groups. How far these objectives will materialise, we are yet to witness.
Sri Lanka underwent a three-decade-long civil war coupled with disharmony and disunity among different communities. The move of the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry, we fervently believe, is timely especially in creating a conducive environment for the coexistence of different communities. The unity in diversity is the universal term which integrates the different communities with different cultures and beliefs as one nation at the time of their country’s diversity. People in the past failed to make national reconciliation among the communities in Sri Lanka that paved the way for several conflicts and bitter and unpleasant incidents in the country.
Peace-building programme
Unlike its previous clan, Sri Lanka’s new generation has nurtured a positive attitude towards ethnic harmony. They are more focused on leading a peaceful and prosperous life. In the aftermath of war, the UNDP initiated a peace-building programme in collaboration with the Education Ministry. The real reconciliation began at this juncture.
The theme of the programme was Community for Peace. I had the privilege to work with the UN officials as the coordinator for Puttalam district. They selected the terror-ridden districts of Jaffna and Mannar from the Northern Province and Trincomalee from the Eastern Province.
These districts were merged with Puttalam district. In every district, five schools were selected for the programme through the assistance of zonal directors of respective districts. Then they arranged cricket matches among the students within the district and made them familiarise with each other. The students made exchange visits to each district.
Different communities
During the visits, the Sinhalese students secured a rare opportunity to mingle with Tamils and Muslims and vice versa. They played cricket matches and witnessed many cultural shows to understand the culture and tradition of particular community. Students exchanged their addresses and they are still maintaining the friendship.
Some teachers and parents, who accompanied the students, had an opportunity with their counterparts. To my knowledge, this is the real reconciliation among different communities to grab the first-hand experience by physically and practically visiting them.
Likewise, the ministry can also arrange some programmes to assemble the different communities at one point in order to make real reconciliation in the country. This is a good idea to arrange special assemblies in schools across the country to stress the importance of national integration and reconciliation. The duty of every principal and teacher is giving a clear picture about this week in every classroom. It helps treat their fellow countrymen as children of one mother. It is also significant to arrange peaceful meetings among religious leaders to create cordial and smooth function of the society.
The women’s associations can also play a pivotal role in promoting integration and reconciliation. Above all, we should eradicate the discriminatory mentality secluding people by their caste and creed. To make real reconciliation, every Sri Lankan should make a change in their mind that we all are Sri Lankans. Yet we still believe in different faiths. There are countries like Singapore, Malaysia where different communities live together without major issues. Their unity in diversity really brought them to the higher stage in the social, economic and political aspects.
Moreover, to establish everlasting peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka we should learn each other’s language. The language has also been considered one of the influential factors in reconciliation process because the misunderstanding formed through lack of understanding.
The great leader from South Africa, Nelson Mandela, said: If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart. Thus without language, one cannot talk to people and understand them. One cannot share their hopes and aspirations and grasp their history. Other factors such as compromising or give and take policy, flexibility, empathy and pluralism will also confirm stable reconciliation in the country. Hence let us all determine ourselves to work hard to propel the reconciliation process efficiently and effectively to create better Sri Lanka.
