The National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) plans to implement a two-year programme with the intention of creating a drug-free Sri Lanka by 2020.
Speaking at a media conference held yesterday at the NDDCB office, NDDCB Chairman Prof. Ravindra Fernando said the two-year programme will be implemented in collaboration with the Presidential Secretariat, Sri Lanka Police, Sri Lanka Federation of Non-Governmental Organizations Against Drug Abuse (SL FONGOADA) and other related institutions.
The programme will commence at the national level and will expand up to the international level drug prevention campaign, said the Chairman. According to the statistics of the NDDCB, the total number of drug-related arrests was 79,378 in 2016 and compared with 2015, drug-related arrests had decreased by four percent in 2016.
Out of the total drug-related arrests, 35 percent was related to heroin and 60 percent was related to cannabis. Around 60 percent of drug-related arrests were reported from the Western Province and nine percent had been reported from the Southern Province.
