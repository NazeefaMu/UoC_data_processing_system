Queenstown goes to bat for Sri Lankan family facing deportation

Several hundred people marched through the centre of Queenstown today in support of a Sri Lankan family facing deportation.
An appeal has been lodged with the Immigration and Protection Tribunal on behalf of Dinesha Amarasinghe, her husband and their three sons after their visas were revoked.
Problems arose when Mrs Amarasinghe was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
Today’s march was organised by National MP for Clutha-Southland, Hamish Walker, who said he will meet with the Associate Immigration Minister to discuss the case.
“The kids are okay at school but what I am asking for is a work visa be issued to Sam so he can work while the case is before the tribunal. It’s very unlikely the minister will intervene with the tribunal so this is really just a march of support.” Hamish Walker said the family were an important part of the Queenstown community. - RNZ
