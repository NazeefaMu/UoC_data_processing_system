Estimates called for free eye lenses

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had informed all Consultant Eye Surgeons to provide estimates for the next year to supply free eye lenses for patients who undergo eye surgeries in State hospitals, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, a special discussion had taken place at the Health Ministry recently in connection with ensuring an uninterrupted supply of all types of eye lenses for patients free of charge. All eye lenses provided from State hospitals are of high quality.
Providing eye lenses free of charge for patients commenced under a concept of Minister Senaratne. The programme commenced this year. Since then, patients receive eye lenses free of charge from State hospitals. Earlier, they spent several thousands of rupees to buy eye lenses, he said.
During the meeting, it was decided to take over the mobile eye clinic owned by Vision 2020 Programme and conduct eye clinics island wide. Minister Senaratne pledged to provide the machines required to perform eye surgeries, he added.
