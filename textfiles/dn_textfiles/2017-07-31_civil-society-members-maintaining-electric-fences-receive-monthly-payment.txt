Civil society members maintaining electric fences to receive monthly payment'

"A monthly payment will be provided to members of agrarian societies and other social bodies appointed to maintain the electric fences, erected to prevent elephants from invading villages," Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena said.
The minister was addressing Wildlife Department officials, and members of agrarian societies at a meeting held at the Monaragala District Secretariat Auditorium recently. She said electric fences about 3,861 Km long were erected and being maintained by over 850 Civil Defense Officers. The minister said civil officers alone could not maintain the fences and the Civil Defence Department was not able to employ more officials in this regard either. "As an alternative, the members of agrarian societies and other social bodies are to be employed under the direction of the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama, she said.
Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry Secretary R.M.D.B. Meegasmulla, Wildlife Conservation Department Acting Director General M.G.C. Suriyabandara, Monaragala Additional District Secretary W.A. Dharmasiri, the Wildlife Conservation Department officials and the members of agrarian societies were present.
