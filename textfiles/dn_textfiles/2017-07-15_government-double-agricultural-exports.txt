Government to double agricultural exports

The government plans to double the 30 percent agricultural export by introducing new technology.
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said although the price of paddy was high, the income did not increase owing to the low harvest.
The paddy harvest dropped from 4,200 mt per hectare to 3,700 during the previous regime due to the low quality fertilizer given by the previous government, Gamage said during a press conference held at the Information Department auditorium yesterday.
“Countries like China and Vietnam obtain a harvest of 7,500 mt of paddy per hectare. Farmers in Sammanthurai reap a harvest of 6,500 mt per hectare while it drops to 4,500 mt in Uhana and 3,500 mt in other areas,” Minister Gamage said. “This disparity is a result of the practices they use in their cultivation. We are planning to introduce technology and increase the harvest per hectare”.
Gamage said the government has also decided grant loans for those who use technology and for new businesses at an interest rate of 6.5 percent. He added that the rest of the interest rate will be borne by the government to increase production for export.
“The government will allocate money through the next budget for this purpose,” Gamage said. “We are compelled to do so.If we don’t how could we settle the interest rates of the loans of the Rajapaksa regime.”
He said that the government has a plan to double the 30 percent agricultural export by introducing technology. “Countries like China and Vietnam get a harvest of 7,500 mt of paddy per hectare. Farmers in Sammanthurai reap a harvest of 6,500 mt per hectare while it drops to 4,500 mt in Uhana and 3,500 mt in other areas,” Minister Gamage said. “This disparity is a result of the practices they use in their cultivation. We are planning to introduce technology and increase the harvest per hectare”.
He also said that the government has a plan to create an opportunity for women to increase their income by maintaining a home garden. He added that with the provision of pepper, cinnamon and minor crops to 2.5 million households, the government has a plan to increase production.
