Root attributes success in Lanka  to Bayliss and Farbrace

The contributions made by head coach Trevor Bayliss and his assistant Paul Farbrace towards England’s remarkable success on their current tour of Sri Lanka where they have won the ODI and Test series and the one-off T20I has been less spoken of these days.
With England in with a chance of pulling off a 3-0 whitewash in the three-match Test series at the SSC grounds where the third and final Test commences today Joe Root the England captain paid a glowing tribute to the two coaches who had transformed the team into a formidable unit where they enjoy no. 1 ranking status in ODIs, are on the verge of displacing South Africa as the no. 2 Test team and are placed third in T20Is.
“They’ve been brilliant, very knowledgeable about the different grounds how they historically played, what they’ve seen with their time here in Sri Lanka and obviously have an inside of a few of their players,” said Root at the pre-match press conference held at the SSC yesterday.
Bayliss was Sri Lanka’s coach from August 2007 till the end of the 2011 World Cup where Sri Lanka were runner-up to India. Farbrace was coach of Sri Lanka from December 2013 till the end of the 2014 World T20 which Sri Lanka won.
“They’ve been brilliant in games, well prepared for this tour and they’ve been a big driving force in getting us to where we have got to. Been great to have their experience and know-how in these conditions,” said Root.
Talking of a 3-0 whitewash Root said if his team can achieve that it “would be massive”.
“We’ve set out that we want to get to a certain destination and over the course of this winter we’ve so far played some good cricket. One area where we’ve not been as good as we can be in the past is winning back to back games and this would be a great opportunity for us to show we’re becoming more consistent, that we’re finding ways of winning and playing good cricket for longer periods of time,” said Root.
“There has been only two other sides who have won 3-0 out here in Test cricket so it would be a brilliant achievement which would fill us with a huge amount of confidence going into the rest of the winter.”
Only Ricky Ponting’s Australians in 2004 and Virat Kohli’s Indians in 2017 have won a Test series 3-0 in Sri Lanka before.
England for today’s Test have rested one of their two main pacies James Anderson and included Stuart Broad for his first match of the series.
“It’s a great luxury to have isn’t it? For that amount of experience to be around the squad and offering so much to the group has been excellent. We’ve played in conditions where we’ve not needed that much seam bowling in the middle but he’s been raring to go and doing everything he can. He’s got the opportunity to play this week and I’m sure he’ll be desperate to put in a really strong performance and show he’s very skilful in these conditions,” said Root of Broad.
