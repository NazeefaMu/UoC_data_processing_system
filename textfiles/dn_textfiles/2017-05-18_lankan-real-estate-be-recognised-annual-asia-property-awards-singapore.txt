Lankan real estate to be recognised at annual Asia Property Awards in Singapore

Sri Lanka’s real-estate industry will be honoured at the region’s most prestigious real estate awards show – the PropertyGuru Asia Property Awards 2017, which will be held on November, 7 and 8 at Sand Expo and Convention Centre in Singapore.
Celebrating its 12th year, the premier awards series will go Asia-wide with Sri Lanka, India, Mongolia, Laos and the Maldives joining as new markets in the 2017 series. Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau will also be incorporated into the two-night grand finale in Singapore.
Sri Lanka, along with the rest of regional markets, are slated to compete on the second night of the grand final, with Singapore’s domestic winners to be announced on the first night.
“It has been an exciting journey for the Asia Property Awards after joining PropertyGuru last year. Our expanded awards scheme is a tribute to the strength of the Asian real estate industry,” said Terry Blackburn, founder and managing director of the Awards.
“Fair judgment and transparency of process are at the heart of the Awards and we’re delighted to introduce the awards system to Asia’s rapidly growing property markets. As we explore new countries for the platform, we will ensure that the PropertyGuru’s Asia Property Awards truly is the region’s benchmark for the finest real estate developers, developments and design in the region.”
Several esteemed experts from across Sri Lanka’s real estate industry will come together to uncover and celebrate as they adjudicate at the domestic awards over the next few months, including nominations, site visits and judges’ deliberations under the guidance of the Awards’ official supervisor.
The 2017 PropertyGuru Asia Property Awards (Sri Lanka) panel will be chaired by Dr. Nirmal De Silva, director and founding CEO at Paramount Realty. Completing the panel of experts are: Stephanie Balendra, director at SB Realtors (Private) Limited; Roshan Madawela, director and founding CEO at Research Intelligence Unit; Prof. Chitra Weddikkra, managing director at QServe Pte Ltd; Steven Mayes, managing director at JLL Sri Lanka; and Sanjana Fernando, CEO at Wolvert Apartments.
"As an emerging market, Sri Lanka has exemplified tremendous real estate potential. The decision to include Sri Lanka in the prestigious Asia Property Awards programme is indeed great news for the industry,” said head judge De Silva. “This will provide a platform for the local industry to showcase their capabilities to a wider audience and be recognised at a global level. I consider it a privilege to be part of this event and looking forward to the same.”
Domestic winners from Sri Lanka will compete for regional accolades, including categories for the Best Developer, Best Mixed Use Development and Best Universal Design Development in Asia.
“It is of course a fantastic honour for Sri Lanka to be included in the Asia Property Awards series for the first time. It’s great news for the island’s real estate sector and we hope it will serve to uplift the local players to the regional level and beyond,” commented M. Madawela. Entries are being accepted now until 25 August.
