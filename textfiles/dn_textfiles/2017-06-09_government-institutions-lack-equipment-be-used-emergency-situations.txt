Handunetti was moving an adjournment motion on the recent flood and landslide havoc in the country.
The Parliament facilitated nine and half hours debate on the disaster situation extending the sitting time till 8pm yesterday. 
Oral questions and questions under the Standing Orders 23 (2) usually taken up at the commencement of sittings were postponed and the debate continued without a lunch break to facilitate more time for the debate.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the sitting time was extended as many members wanted to speak at the debate. 
MP Handunnetti who moved the motion said many areas were flooded since the river banks are not properly maintained.
He urged the Government to build anicuts at necessary places and invest money on new technological equipment such as ‘Watermasters’ which are used for dredging, piling and raking. 
The MP also said that the families evacuated due to landslides are resettled in same risky places.
He said Morawakakanda and Ayagama are examples for this claim. 
He also said the Government would need Rs 8,886 million to pay compensation for the lost lives and fully damaged houses.
