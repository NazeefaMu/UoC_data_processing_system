Took correct decision on October 26
Will resolve political  instability within a week

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, assured the nation that the current political instability will be resolved in a week.
The President said his decision to appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister was a right decision taken by him for the sake of the country and its posterity.
Making a special statement yesterday at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s special convention held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium, he said he will not appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister even if he brought letters signed by all the 225 members of the Legislature.
“I have no personal issues with him, but he is a politician who does not suit the country. His vision and the way of thinking does not suit this country,” the President said.
The President added that Wickremesinghe lacked a sense of patriotism, national identity and respect for cultural values and ethos.
“The people in the North have been taken for a ride by Wickremesinghe. He hesitates to solve issues of the people in the Northern province,” he said. He added that his decision on Octomber 26 to sack Wickremesinghe is correct.
The President added that he issued five Gazzette notifications using executive powers. “These gazettes were signed using my powers with an intention of building a new society free from corruption and fraud”, he said.
This political crisis may sometimes be a novel experience to our country after 1948 but it is no longer a novel phenomenon for the rest of the countries in the world, he said
The President said that many countries where democracy reigns, witnessed this type of crisis. “Germany did not have a government for over six months as Chancellor Angela Merkel did not have required majority”, he saidHe added that Italy did not have a government for over five weeks after a General Election . “Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was removed all of a sudden,” he said.
The President also condemned clashes that took place in Parliament.He said issued should be addressed not physically but ideologically.
The President said similar clashes in parliaments are reported from many countries and it is not a new phenomenon.
The President added that the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal did not issue their final determination over a number of petitions against his decisions. The court issued interim orders and a number of petitions are to be taken up. They are not murder cases. They are not rape cases. They are political cases.
The President added that the people in the country have difference of opinions over these political cases. “I always have respect towards the judiciary and I will accept the decisions taken by the court always,”he said.
He said the people in the country had different opinions over the judiciary in the country.One group of people say that the judiciary is very impartial and independent.Another group of people say it is not so. There are difference of opinions among various groups of people,”he said.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party has the strength to defeat extreme right wing policies of UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the SLFP has always represented the common masses.
He said that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe murdered the good governance concept and that he stood by patiently for over three years.
The President added that Cabinet colleagues and the government group are well aware of this situation.
He said that there is no dispute in the country but there is a political crisis which has resulted in this tense situation.
