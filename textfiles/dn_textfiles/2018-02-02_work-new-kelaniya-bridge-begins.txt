Work on new Kelaniya Bridge begins

 Construction work has begun on the proposed elevated Kelaniya Bridge, complete with a spillway bridge as a part of the Expressway network linking all parts of the country.
This bridge with six lanes will be linked to the Colombo - Katunayake Expressway according to plans formulated by the Higher Education and Highways Ministry.
The project is funded by the Japan International Co-operation Agency. This new bridge, once completed, is expected to ease the present traffic congestion on the existing Japan - Sri Lanka Friendship Kelaniya Bridge.
