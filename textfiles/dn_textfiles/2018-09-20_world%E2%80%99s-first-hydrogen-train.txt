World’s  first hydrogen  train

The train also makes little to no noise and will be joining Germany’s growing network of noiseless, zero-emission trains.
It is widely known that vehicular pollution is one of the leading contributors to pollution. Showing the way to curb emissions, Germany has rolled out the world’s first train that runs on hydrogen power. This pollution-free train has batteries made of lithium-ion that is used in mobile phones and home appliances. Additionally, the train is equipped with fuel cells that produce electricity through chemical reaction involving hydrogen molecules. The train emits no carbon dioxide and emits only steam and water droplets.  Moreover, this train can run at a speed of 140 km per hour.
The train also makes little to no noise and will be joining Germany’s growing network of noiseless, zero-emission trains. These trains can also carry up to 300 passengers at one time.
