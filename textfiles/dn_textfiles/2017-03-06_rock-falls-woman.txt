Rock falls on woman

A 63-year-old woman named T.G. Leelawathi of Ambalawa was injured and admitted to Hemmatagama hospital when a rock slid from a mound of earth removed by a backhoe machine, engaged in the Mawanelle Gampola road widening project, fell on her head as she was passing the spot at Hemmatagama on Saturday.
She was transferred to Gampola hospital as she was complaining of pain in the head, Hemmatagama hospital Chief Medical Officer M.J.D.B. Fernando said.
