Second 4-day U19 Test v India
Lankan bowlers sent on a leather hunt

Left-handed opener Atharwa Taide and Pawan Shah hit massive centuries as India sent the Lankan bowlers on a leather hunt rattling off an impressive 428-4 wickets by the close of the first day in the second Under 19 four-day test at Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium in Hambantota yesterday.
Winning the toss and batting first India lost their first wicket at 40, but a massive second wicket partnership of 263 between Taide and Shah saw them post an imposing total by the close.
Taide who scored 113 in the first U19 Test at the NCC, was dismissed for 177 scored off 172 balls with 20 fours and 3 sixes and Shah was unbeaten on 177 having hit 19 fours in his 227-ball innings.
Once the stand was broken Sri Lanka managed to grab two more wickets cheaply through run outs but overall it was India’s day.
The match continues today.
