Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson wins 200m gold

 
Elaine Thompson blasted to the 200m Olympic title this morning, earning Jamaica another sprint double as she had already claimed the 100m gold earlier in the Rio 2016 Games.
The 24-year-old left her main rival, Dafne Schippers, stumbling in her wake as she crossed the line a season's best 21.78 seconds. The Dutchwoman finished in 21.88 and the USA's Tori Bowie took bronze in 22.15.
"My school motto was 'let the light shine' and I let my light shine tonight," said Thompson. "It's a big surprise to me because I have had a hamstring injury. You must overcome these things and tonight I am standing here with a gold. To beat Dafne Schippers is a hard run."
