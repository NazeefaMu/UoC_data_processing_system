Minister vows to release previous regime’s abductions list

Four computerized pages of abductions that occurred during the previous regime have been reported and the list will be declared soon, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone for the proposed Accident and Emergency Treatment Unit at the Kegalle hospital, to be constructed at a cost of Rs. 3,700 million.
He said no abductions have taken place under this government. During the previous regime, abductions, murders, etc. had taken place.
According to Minister Senaratne, a medical ward complex for cardiology will be constructed at the Kegalle hospital at a cost of Rs. 250 million. He added that prices at private hospitals will be regulated in another two weeks.
“The government faced various obstacles when the price of 48 drugs was slashed offering a great relief to the public. Likewise, the prices at private hospitals will be regulated,” he said.
“One private hospital had charged Rs. 2.3 million for a heart surgery and the patient had died. The heart surgeon had not taken his fee,” he added. There are compassionate doctors like him,” the minister added.
Several politicians and officials were present on the occasion.
