A day in the life of a freelancer

It’s commonplace for literary journals to interview well-known writers and, at some point, to ask them about their process, what their days look like.
When I was a younger woman, back in the days when I longed to call myself a “writer,” but knew that I had not yet established any kind of writerly authority to claim the mantle, I remember reading an interview with Graham Greene. He explained how he was able to write one novel per year: he told his interlocutor that he held himself to a standard of 500 words per day—no more, no less—and that, in the course of a year, that would produce a novel.
At about that same time, I was struggling to be a writer, an ambition that took a direct hit after being sexually harassed by my writing professor—although at the time, I thought it was my fault—I had even fantasized that if my life’s ambitions were to come true, some day I would live in a cottage by the sea, and I would support myself by writing.
Thirty years after that fantasy, I do live in a bungalow 300 yards from the Atlantic Ocean, close to a beach unknown to tourists. And I support myself with my writing. On one hand, I know that I am living a dream life, and in today’s parlance, I’m “grateful” for the way that my life has turned out.
So, why was I sobbing earlier this week as if I had awoken to discover that I was Willy Loman, being worn out by the constant struggle?
If someone were to ask me about my writing process, it would not bear any resemblance to Graham Greene’s. I am up most days between 4 and 5 am. I consider those wee hours to be my time for reading the news, surfing the internet, looking for new things to write about. Depending on how much time is already scheduled during my day, I may begin working on my first freelance article by 5 am, with the goal being that I will have the standard 800-1200 words for most internet content written, edited, and emailed to an editor by 9 am.
After I get the first article out of the way, I may spend an hour or two looking at various internet boards where editors post calls for material, and, if I have an idea for something I think will fit, I prepare and send off pitches. I also send pitches to editors with whom I’ve previously worked to see if I can sell them any new ideas for stories I have rattling around in my brain. I prepare pitches for future publications, too. Since I review books, I receive galleys months in advance.
If I am trying to get an assignment reviewing a certain book, it means contacting a print magazine editor several months in advance. Different magazines are operating on different editorial calendars, so I time my pitches to whatever month each magazine editor is taking pitches for.
During the day, I also read: research materials, book galleys, follow online newspaper stories and current events, whatever material I may need to know in order to formulate ideas.
Sometimes, I sit down in front of my laptop at 4 am and, except to go to the bathroom or to make coffee, I don’t get up until mid-afternoon. I can’t remember the last time that breakfast or lunch didn’t comprise some type of meal replacement biscuits or cheese and crackers. I eat a decent dinner, but during the workday, there isn’t time to fix a healthy lunch.
What drives me through my day is panic. I have to hustle. I have to pitch every weekday in order to make certain that I always have work lined up.
The internet has created an enormous, yawping need for content. Each day, some sites are putting out the equivalent of a daily magazine. They are reliant on freelance writers to supply them with articles.
But for each 800-1200 words that I write for my usual clients, the average compensation I receive is between $100 and $150 for each article (a range of between 8 and 19 cents per word). I know I am lucky. I am able to consistently secure writing jobs that pay that much. I know from watching the boards that a lot of outlets are paying between $25 and $50 for the same number of words. As shocking as that low number is, lots of writers still compete for those slots.
The reason I hustle is simple. As a grownup with a car payment, rent, insurance, utility bills, and all of the expenses of daily life, I need to write 30 articles per month just to break even. And that covers my expenses, but doesn’t pay for extras like dinners out, clothes, or anything that isn’t a necessity. What keeps me from having to write 30 articles per month are those golden assignments that pay three to four the rates of ordinary articles. If I can manage one of those per week, it can help relieve some of the incessant pressure. - Lit Hub
