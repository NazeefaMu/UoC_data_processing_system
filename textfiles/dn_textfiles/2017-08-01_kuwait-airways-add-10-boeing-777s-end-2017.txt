Kuwait Airways to add 10 Boeing 777s by end 2017

Kuwait Airways, the national carrier of the State of Kuwait, will take delivery of 10 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft by the end of the year and one aircraft would fly to Colombo on August 2.
The new aircraft take Kuwait Airways’ operational fleet up to 26 and is further proof of the airline’s commitment to improving its on-board product offering, seat capacity and increasing frequencies across its 38-destination international network.

Kuwait Airways’ aircraft acquisition plan also includes the 25 Airbus aircraft on order, the first of which are set to be delivered from 2019.
“The delivery of the seventh Boeing 777-300 ER last week was yet another significant milestone on Kuwait Airways’ journey of transformation as we progress towards the goals - and implement the corresponding aircraft acquisition strategy - set out in the comprehensive, five-year plan, announced in September 2016,” said Ebrahim Al-Khuzam, CEO, Kuwait Airways.
“With the Kuwaiti Government clearly aligned and in full support of ensuring the ongoing and future success of the official national carrier, we are pleased to note a continuing trend of a return in passenger confidence.
"This has been reflected in the increasing number of passengers coming over to Kuwait Airways - numbers well above the regional average growth rates,” Al-Khuzam added.
At the conclusion of the airline’s transformation plan (2021), Kuwait Airways will have the youngest commercial airline fleet in the world.
Meanwhile Kuwait Airways also announced an increase in frequencies to Colombo after the recent runway upgrade at Bandaranaike International Airport.
“The airline has now increased flights from daily operations to weekly 10 flights with the latest Airbus A330-200 aircraft and will now offer a passenger capacity of 8,900 seats and a cargo capacity of 462 tons in to and out of Colombo, said Sudesh Rupasinghe, Country Manager, Kuwait Airways.
Kuwait Airways will be the only airline to offer consistent First Class operation, flatbed and Wi-Fi on all flights from Colombo and will connect to all major European hubs, USA and the Middle East with convenient connections. All passengers to these destinations would also enjoy lounge facilities and can fly on the new Boeing 777-300ER aircraft.
The current schedule from Colombo to Kuwait will provide convenient connections and increased frequencies for passengers beyond Kuwait to the Middle East, Europe and USA. Kuwait commenced its operation to Colombo way back in 1973 with over 44 years of continual service to Sri Lanka.
