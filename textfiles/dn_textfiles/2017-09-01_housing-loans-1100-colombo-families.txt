Over 2 million families living without houses are to be vested with 40 model villages countrywide under a housing programme launched by Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
The housing programme ‘Samatta Sevena’ is to build houses countrywide through the National Housing Development Authority.
Further, over 450 Uda Gama villages are being constructed in many parts of the country including North and East.
Housing loans were provided to 1,100 families in Colombo during a ceremony at Temple Trees under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Housing Construction Minister Sajth Pramadasa, Deputy Minister Indika Bandara, Ministry Secretary, NHDA Chairman S. Palansooriya and Colombo District Members of Parliament also participated.
