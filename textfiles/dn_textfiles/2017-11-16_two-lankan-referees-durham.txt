Two Lankan referees to Durham

Two top up and coming rugby referees Hasun Praneeth Weranga Horange and Mohamed Aaqil Jamaldeen left for U.K. yesterday on an official invitation from the Durham County Rugby Football Union Referees’ Society.
The invitation was sent on behalf of the Durham County Rugby Football Union Referees’ Society by secretary John S. Denham. The program which started few days back will come to end on November 21. For the two Sri Lankans accommodation is provided by the Durham Referees’ Society during this period. This is going to be a good experience as one of the two referees will get a chance to blow in UK. Earlier referees like Roshan Deen, Dilroy Fernando, Anil Jayasinghe and Aruna Jayasekara have attended similar types of refereeing courses in the UK.
The Durham County Rugby Football Referees Society was founded in 1895 and the body is responsible for appointing referees to all clubs up to level 5 within county Durham, covering all fixtures. This society offers training and development opportunities to referees.
