Threat to coconut growers
With much against the wishes of coconut growers a container load of husked coconuts were imported to the country. With pressure build up opposition the move and in accordance with the laws of the country, the consignment was not allowed to be cleared by customers. It is understood certain attempts are now been made to amend the Quarantine Act in order to allow free imports of coconuts.
At present coconut growers are faced with problems on mite infection; Weligama Leaf Wilt and Caterpillar infection in (Mundel area) and imports of Coconuts could add more problems. Therefore strict Quarantine Laws should be enforced to safeguard the coconut growing industry where 700,000 coconut growers are depending for their livelihood.
Also 70/80 per cent of the harvest is used for domestic consumption and any harm will create a political uprise in the country, bearing in mind coconut is the second stable diet of the average Sri Lankan next to rice.
