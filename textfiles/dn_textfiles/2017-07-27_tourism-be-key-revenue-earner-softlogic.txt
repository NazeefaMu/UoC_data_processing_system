Tourism to be key revenue earner for Softlogic

Softlogic Holdings anticipates that the tourism sector will emerge as a key contributor to Group earnings over the medium-term, supported by substantial earnings contributions from Mövenpick Hotel Colombo, strong performance of its resort, Centara Ceysands Resort & Spa Sri Lanka and the upcoming apartment project in the latter part of 2017, the Group said its latest annual report.
The Group is well positioned to benefit from the anticipated boom in the country’s tourism sector.
Its partnerships with reputed hospitality brands are expected to serve the company’s tourism sector arm well in both its resort and city hotel and the group will persistently strive to ensure that guest expectations are satisfied.
