Beira Lake Intervention Area Development Plan launched

The Beira Lake Intervention Area Development Plan was launched by the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champaka Ranawaka, yesterday. Subsequent to the launch, the Beira Lake area will now be referred to as Ran Masu Pura.
The proposed zoning plan of the Urban Development Authority hopes to get the optimum economic value of the area and realize the highly livable and economically vibrant megapolis that the government has envisioned for the nation.
The financial support to the proposed zoning plan will be provided by the World Bank. The plan proposes to develop lands in the immediate vicinity of Beira Lake for hotels and tourism activities. Lands located near Vauxhall Street are to accommodate a leisure park for the public.
The launching ceremony was held at JAIC Hilton Colombo, yesterday morning, with the participation of Singaporean experts facilitating the project, officials of the Urban Development Authority and other stakeholders.
Minister Ranawaka addressing the gathering said, “There was a time people coined a term, ‘All garbage goes to Beira Lake.’ This Beira Lake area which was once a glorious economic hub in the country turned into an area full of anti-social activities.”
“Now our main object is to develop the Multimodal Transport Hub at Fort/Pettah area where the Beira Lake vicinity will become an important part. We have already called for proposals from investors for the first step of this Multimodal Transport Hub and the second stage of the project will start in 2018,” Minister Ranawaka said.
“By 2023, we will establish the Light Railway, the elevated highway and modernized railway facility, all of which will be interconnected with the proposed Multimodal Transport Hub.
The area surrounding Beira Lake, which will be directly connected with this hub, will also be developed as the main economic area connecting with the Port City project,” Minister Ranawaka added.
Minister Ranawaka said land development is the most important part of this project. “There are lands owned by several government agencies and there is more land which belongs to both the government and private individuals or companies. Most of the government agencies, such as the Ports Authority and Lanka Sathosa, have agreed to release their lands for the proposed project. The Beira Lake Intervention Area Development Plan includes the systematic strategy to develop all these lands. The first stage of such land development will begin by 2018,” he said.
Minister Ranawaka while pointing out that the people living in Vauxhall area will be moving out willingly to make space for the development project, commended President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for allocating Rs. 1300 million for the relocation programme of the people. He also observed that this allocation expedited the Beira Lake development project.
Minister Ranawaka expressed his confidence that the development project will turn the Beira Lake area into a resource-park and a wealth-centre which will become a gold mine that contributes the most to the development of the country.
