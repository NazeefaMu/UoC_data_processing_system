Biggest wave ever surfed

Surfer Rodrigo Koxa rode a 80ft monster wave at Nazaré in Portugal on November 8, 2017.
He managed to break the world record for riding the biggest wave ever surfed as confirmed on Saturday night at the World Surf League’s Big Wave Awards in California.
Koxa, who risked his life catching the 24-metre wave, said winning the award was ‘the best day of my life.’
Earlier, the record was set by Garrett McNamara in 2011 when he rode a wave measuring 78 feet.
Also at the awards, Koxa’s compatriot Lucas Chianca was awarded the Best Men’s Overall Performance trophy. The 22-year-old won the Nazare Challenge earlier this year.
The Best Women’s Overall Performance went to Hawaiian surfer Paige Alms for the third time in her career.
