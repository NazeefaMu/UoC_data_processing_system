Follow example set by Japanese  fans during FIFA World Cup
Sri Lankan cricket fans  clean stadium post loss

The Japanese football fans set new standards of courteous behavior during FIFA World Cup 2018 when they cleaned the stadium stands post their team’s match. Even their football team got highly appreciated for showing high level of etiquettes post their World Cup loss as they cleaned their green room and left a thank you note for the host nation, Russia.
Though the football World Cup is over, this noble act by the Japanese fans and the team is still serving as an inspiration to others, and the latest to follow their footsteps are the Sri Lankan cricket fans. Though they lost the third and series deciding ODI match against South Africa in Pallekele stadium in Kandy on Sunday, few young Sri Lankan fans still went ahead and cleaned the stands. The act was highly appreciated by Sri Lankan media and their cricket board.
Sri Lanka Cricket Board shared the video on their Twitter handle where fans can be seen collecting plastic bottles, empty packets and eatables and putting them in a waste disposal bag.
