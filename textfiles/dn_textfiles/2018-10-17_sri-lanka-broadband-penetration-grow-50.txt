Sri Lanka broadband penetration to grow at 50%

Sri Lanka’s broadband penetration will soar from 17% to 50% in the coming 3-5 years, according to a report by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
These details were spelled out at the Asia-Pacific WTTx (fixed wireless access) summit at Shangrila-La Hotel Colombo yesterday with the theme ‘Bring Affordable and Fast Fixed Wireless Broadband to Every Household’.
‘With more diversified mobile applications happening in the home, fixed wireless access will be a crucial ingredient in bringing wide coverage and low cost in providing universal broadband services,” the report further said. GTI, Informa and Huawei hosted this summit and discussions were centered on accelerating the growth of Asia-Pacific household penetration, advancing the affordability of favorable policies and regulations, and gathering more partners to forge an end-to-end industry ecosystem.
At this summit, Huawei together with Asia-Pacific ICT regulators, leading operators and industry organizations launched a joint declaration called ‘Bridge the Digital Divide, Accelerate Broadband to Households’ to endeavor to create a sustainable industry environment for the development of fixed wireless broadband.
The event saw ICT regulators engage in discussion on how fixed wireless broadband can achieve the maximum usage for the development of society by policies and regulations including spectrum, tax, land and subsidies.
WTTx is a home broadband technology using 4G/4.5G technologies to deliver cost-effective fiber-like wireless broadband access to unconnected households. Low deployment costs and operating expenses are among WTTx’s greatest advantages.
During the summit, Pradeep de Almeida, Dialog Group Chief Technology Officer, said, “Current subscriber and data growth demands faster network roll-outs and affordable services. We have identified WTTx to be the fastest way to cater to this demand. WTTx is used to rapidly capture the customer demand and provision the services for home broadband.”
Tide Xu, Chief Strategy Office of Wireless Product Line, Huawei, said in his opening speech, “Huawei will keep customer-centric, continuous innovation to provide best experience, cost effective solution for a better connected intelligent Asia-Pacific.”
By 2017, the accumulated WTTx user numbers had reached 50 million globally. With WTTx, wireless broadband connectivity to unconnected households can be achieved 75% cheaper and 90% faster when compared to fixed-line deployments, delivering a return on investment to operators in less than three years.
