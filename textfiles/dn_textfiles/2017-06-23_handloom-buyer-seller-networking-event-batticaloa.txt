Handloom buyer-seller networking  event in Batticaloa

A maarketing clinic and buyer-seller networking event will be held by Lanka Socail Ventures on June 25 at Palamunai Handloom Training Centre, in Ariyampathy, Batticaloa from 2.00 pm to 5.00 pm.
Leading handloom business establishments with concern for social responsibility will be introduced to an established group of handloom entrepreneurs from Batticaloa, who are part of the Accelerator Programme for Handloom SMEs in Batticaloa District, to explore the possibility of broadening market opportunities.
This programme is part of the Sustaining and Nurturing Rural Agro-Industrial Social Enterprises Project (SUNRISE), initiated and funded by Oxfam and implemented by Lanka Social Ventures, in the Eastern Province. This group of handloom entrepreneurs are being guided and supported with technical and business skills to further expand their business by Lanka Social Ventures.
The National Design Centre has already conducted a programme introducing them to 100 new designs. These entrepreneurs use 5 to 10 machines in their industries and have a work force between 5 to 20.
These entrepreneurs will continue to receive technical and business advice, product and process innovation support, finance and market access facilitation and coaching and guidance for personal entrepreneurial skills development from Lanka Social Ventures over a period of twelve months. The National Design Centre, National Enterprise Development Authority, Textile Industry Development, and Ministry of Industry and Commerce are also providing expert inputs and insights to the group of handloom entrepreneurs.
