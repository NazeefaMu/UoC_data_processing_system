Heartbrok14en cat walks 12 miles to find his family

When Toby the cat was taken away from his home, he really missed his family. He missed them so much he left his new home and walked 12 miles to try and track them down.
But when he finally arrived his family was far from happy to see him. They had given him away because they no longer wanted him, so they couldn’t believe it when he turned up on their doorstep.
Toby’s commitment to finding them wasn’t enough to change their minds so they took him to a shelter and asked staff to put him down. Luckily, the shelter contacted a nearby animal charity and explained what had happened.
The SPCA animal shelter in North Carolina agreed to take him in and shared his incredible story on social media.
They wrote: “When Toby’s family no longer wanted him, they gave him to another family. But Toby missed them, and walked 12 miles back to his home. When he arrived, he was met with heartbreak. The family he thought had loved him took him to a shelter and asked staff to euthanize him. The shelter called us at the SPCA to ask if we could take him in and help him find a new family. Of course we said YES!”
Toby’s story has since been shared thousands of times by people across the world. And all the publicity has had a fantastic result, as he has a new home. He was adopted by Michele, who lives in New Hampshire.
He’s settling into his new home, which he shared with his two new cat brothers.
