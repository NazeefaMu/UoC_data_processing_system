Interbrand releases 2017  Best Global Brands Report

Interbrand, the world’s largest and most influential brand consultancy, has announced the Best Global Brands for 2017.
Now in its 18th year, the theme of this year’s Best Global Brands report is “Growth In A Changing World”, and examines three key components: People, Technology and Brands.
The combined total value of the world’s top brands, US$1,871,730 million, is an increase of 4.2% from the previous year while 42% of that amount can be found in the Top 10 brands on the table.
Interbrand has named Apple, Google, and Microsoft as the three most valuable brands in the world, with technology as the dominant sector. This year, the list also features three new entrants: Ferrari at No. 88, and Netflix and Salesforce.com, who make their first appearance on the list, at No. 78 and No. 84.
“We are living in one of the most exciting periods of change – societal, technological, industrial – that impacts every aspect of commerce and life,” said Jez Frampton, Global CEO of Interbrand. “In this ever-shifting context, growth becomes more challenging, which is why businesses need brands more than ever. The Best Global Brands understand that brands are the platform for growth.”
For five consecutive years, Apple and Google continue to hold the top positions. Apple’s brand value grew by 3 percent to US$ 184,154 million, as Google’s brand value grew by 6% to US$141,703 million. Microsoft rose to No. 3, as one of 16 brands with double-digit percent growth.
Closely following Coca-Cola at No. 4 is Amazon, Samsung, Toyota, and Facebook, which breaks into the Top 10 for the first-time at No. 8 (up from No. 15 last year). Mercedes-Benz and IBM round out the Top 10. Frampton said the most significant change in the list is the continued rise of technology-centric brands, especially among the Top 10.
The five Top Growing Brands include Facebook (48 percent growth) who leads for the second year running, Amazon (29%), Adobe (19%), Adidas (17%), and Starbucks (16%).
More than half of the Best Global Brands came from four sectors: Automotive (16), Technology (15), Financial Services (12), and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (9). Retail is the top growing sector in percentage terms (19%), followed by Sporting Goods (10%), Technology (8%), Logistics (7%), and Financial Services (6%).
Commenting on the 2017 annual report, Ashish Mishra, Interbrand India Managing India, said, “‘Growth In A Changing World” is best exemplified by South Asian markets which include one of the world’s fastest growth markets and the one that is undergoing maximum change. Our objective through Best Global Brands and the Best Sri Lankan Brands league table launching in November 2017 is to raise the bar for Sri Lankan brands through our global best practices. For example, Samsung, which entered the ranking in 2001 and is now ranked at No. 6 invested heavily in R&D to improve its product.
Second, it developed a brand platform and brand architecture that laid the foundation for all marketing activities. This meant that they could shape people’s perceptions in a coordinated and consistent manner, while creating greater impact and operational efficiencies at the same time.”
Michel Nugawela, CEO, MND/Sri Lanka partner for Interbrand, said, “Interbrand’s Best Sri Lankan Brands league table would be modeled on Best Global Brands so the world’s gold standard in brand valuation methodology will be used for the ranking.
As well as providing a rigorously analyzed valuation number, Interbrand’s methodology also brings together market, brand, competitor, and financial data into a single, value-based framework within which the performance of the brand can be assessed and improved, and the financial impact of investing in the brand quantified.”
Interbrand’s Best Global Brands, the most prestigious brand ranking table globally, identifies the 100 most valuable global brands by analyzing the many ways a brand benefits an organization.
The Best Global Brands methodology was the first brand valuation method to become ISO certified.
The ranking is based on a combination of attributes that contribute to a brand’s cumulative value: the financial performance of the branded products and services; the role the brand plays in influencing customer choice; and the strength the brand has to command a premium price or secure earnings for the company.
