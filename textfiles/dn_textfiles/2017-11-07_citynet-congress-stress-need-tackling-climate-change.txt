CityNet Congress stress need to tackling climate change

Leaders attending the 8th ever CityNet Congress stressed the importance of cities tackling climate change and furthering development in a sustainable way through the United Nations’ SDGs.
“What we are finding is that these two goals, promoting climate-friendly development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, are very much linked to each other. That also makes this politically important for leaders in our cities,” CityNet Secretary General Dr.Vijay Jagannathan at a press conference yesterday.
Jagannathan explained that member cities in CityNet could stand to learn from each other, especially those which have been through similar problems and overcome them, and progress as a result.
“It is much easier for a city like Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur to learn from Seoul rather than London, because there is institutional memory of how the challenges were faced.
And similarly, there are lessons to be learned for some of our cities in less developed countries on how Kuala Lumpur or Bangkok have achieved and reached what they have today,” Jagannathan said.
“Here in Colombo, many of our members, especially those from South Asia, are quite surprised to see how much economic development has taken place.How much Colombo is looking more like a city of Southeast Asia than South Asia.”
Mayor Park-won Soon of Seoul, South Korea, the president of CityNet, said that the function, role, and mandate of CityNet should be expanded going forth.
“The reason why is because the challenges that cities face have changed drastically over the past few years,” Soon said, emphasising climate change and economic inequality as two key challenges.
“It is against this backdrop that the 8th CityNet Congress is being held.”
Finally, both Jagannathan and Mayor Park-won Soon insisted that in order for CityNet to properly carry out its mission and implement more of its initiatives, more funding of the association was necessary.
Soon also noted that CityNet has been at the forefront of many projects in Colombo, including the Water and Wastewater Treatment system in Colombo.
CityNet is the largest association of urban stakeholders in the Asia Pacific region. Established in 1987 with the support of UNESCAP, UNDP, and UN-Habitat, the network currently includes over 138 member cities from 22 countries.
CityNet Congress 2017 is taking place from November 6th to 8th at the Colombo Hilton, under the theme “Our City, Our Future: Sharing Local Solutions for Sustainable Development.” This is the second time Colombo has hosted the CityNet Congress, which is held every four years
