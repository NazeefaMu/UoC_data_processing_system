Windies look for redemption with Holder's return

 
West Indies will welcome the return of their captain Jason Holder for the third and final one-day international at the Pallekele Stadium today.
Holder sat out the second ODI played at the R Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday following an ICC suspension for his team's slow over rate, and saw West Indies lose to Sri Lanka by eight wickets on the D/L rule.
The result gave Sri Lanka a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
Today's game as the first two is likely to be affected by bad weather and West Indies with the return of their captain will be looking to salvage something out of a lost series. They also lost the two-Test series to Sri Lanka 2-0.
"There is rain around so we will have to watch that, but once we get a chance to play we will be giving all we got," said Holder at the pre-match press conference.
"We have left Colombo and come here to Kandy so we hope the change will bring a better result," the 24-year-old allrounder said.
"Every match is important. We need to win tomorrow... we are also looking at the bigger picture, and every match has points attached to it. So we need to win to get points and looking to move up the (ICC One-Day) rankings table."
Sri Lanka are not looking to make any big changes but skipper Angelo Mathews hinted that leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay may be given a chance to make his ODI debut at the expense of one of the spinners.
