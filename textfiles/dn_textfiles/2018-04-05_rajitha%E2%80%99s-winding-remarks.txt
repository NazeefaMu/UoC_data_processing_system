Rajitha’s winding up remarks

Making the winding up speech in Parliament, Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne fired salvos at the Joint Opposition detailing on the mirage of charges against the JO MPs and the close associates and family members of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He brought the FCID and CID files and PRECIFAC reports to the Chamber and referred to the cases in them one by one. He vowed that these cases would be expedited in the coming days and the culprits would be prosecuted before long
