AG TO CHALLENGE JOHNSTON’S ACQUITTAL

The Attorney General will file a revision application in the Court of Appeal challenging the Kurunegala High Court’s judgement to acquit and release former Minister and Kurunegala District MP Johnston Fernando and three others.
This is in connection with the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 5.2 million in public funds case.
Attorney General’s Department sources said yesterday that the Attorney General is to file a revision application challenging the Kurunegala High Court’s judgement dated October 17, 2018.
The Kurunegala High Court ordered to acquit and release former Minister Johnston Fernando, former Lak Sathosa Chairman K.M. Fernando and the former Minister’s Private Secretary Raj Mohideen Mohamod Sakeer, taking into consideration the contradictions of evidence in the prosecution witnesses.
They were acquitted and released from all the charges even without leading defence’s evidence.
Meanwhile, a revision application filed by Johnston Fernando seeking an Interim Order directing the Kurunegala High Court to release him on bail was yesterday fixed for inquiry on June 26 next year in the Supreme Court. Johnston Fernando filed this revision petition prior to the Kurunegala High Court judgement was delivered. A revision application filed by former Minister Johnston Fernando seeking an interim order to release on bail had been refused by Court of Appeal.
The Attorney General alleged that Johnston Fernando as then Minister in charge of the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) had allegedly ordered that goods worth over Rs. 5.2 million be released from three CWE warehouses in Yanthampalawa, Wehera and Mallawapitiya in the Kurunegala District during the North Western Provincial Council Election in September 2013.
