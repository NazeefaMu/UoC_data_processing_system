The Earl and Countess of Wessex visit Temple of the Tooth, Trinity College

 
Earl of Wessex, Prince Edward, and the Countess of Wessex, Princess Sophie, paid a visit to the Temple of the Scared Tool Relic and Trinity College, Kandy this morning.
A special religious ceremony was organized at the Temple of the Tooth Relic to invoke blessings on the Royal couple.
They arrived in Sri Lanka last afternoon on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II, to celebrate the 70th Independence Day, scheduled to be held at the Galle Face Green on February 4.
The British High Commission in Colombo said that “the Earl and Countess will travel to Colombo and other parts of Sri Lanka, celebrating the long-standing friendship between the two countries and shared interest in the Commonwealth, youth development and education,”.
