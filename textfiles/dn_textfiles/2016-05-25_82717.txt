While refusing to grant leave to proceed with the petition, the Supreme Court two Judge Bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Nalin Perera observed that there is no legal basis to proceed with the petition.
The Supreme Court observed that in accordance with Section 64 of the Parliament Election Act, the secretary of a recognised political party has power to nominate a member of the party to fill the vacancy.

The CPA maintained that in terms of Article 99A of the Constitution, only a person whose name was included in the district nomination papers or national list submitted by the relevant political party, is entitled to be nominated to fill such a vacancy.
In its petition, the CPA stated that the appointment of a person as a Member of Parliament contrary to the provisions of the Constitution violates several rights guaranteed under the Constitution and in particular the franchise which is part of the sovereignty of the people.
The petitioners further argued that any attempt to interpret legislation in a manner contrary to the provisions of the Constitution would imperil the supremacy of the Constitution, which is the cornerstone of constitutional democracy.
Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appeared for the Attorney General. Senior Counsel Viran Corea appeared for the petitioners. President’s Counsel Faiz Mustapha appeared for Field Martial Sarath Fonseka.
