SLTB should not be dragged into politics - Transport Minister

Sri Lanka Transport Board which made financial progress during the past three years should not be brought back to the abyss due to politics, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
The Minister said that every employee has a right to bear any political opinion and therefore, it is the responsibility of the SLTB trade unions to get their support in a democratic manner. The Minister was speaking at a ceremony to symbolically hand over the salary increments to the employees, which were made after six years, at Sethsiripaya on Saturday.
He requested all political parties not to use any public property for political activities. He said he has advised the SLTB Chairman and the Secretary to his Ministry not to issue SLTB buses free of charge for any political activity as well. But, anyone or political party can hire a bus by making the due payments, which in return will increase the income of the Board. With the increments made after six years, the basic salary of the drivers, conductors, mechanics, labourers and security officers has been increased from Rs. 14, 250 to Rs. 25, 550. Under the second phase, the basic salary of the executive grade will be increased.
