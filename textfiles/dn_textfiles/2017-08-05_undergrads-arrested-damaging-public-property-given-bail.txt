Undergrads arrested for damaging public property given bail

Three University undergraduates arrested on charges of causing damage to public property by forcibly entering the premises of the Ministry of Health during an anti-SAITM protest were yesterday ordered to be released on bail by Colombo High Court.
The Colombo High Court made this order taking into consideration three revision applications filed on behalf of the suspects challenging Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court decision to granting of bail.
Each of them were ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.10,000 with three sureties of one million rupees. A revision application filed by IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekera is to be heard on August 8.
The suspects were charged under the Public Property Act.
