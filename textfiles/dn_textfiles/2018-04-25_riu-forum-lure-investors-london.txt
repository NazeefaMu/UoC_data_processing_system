RIU forum to lure investors in London

The Research Intelligence Unit, (RIU) a research and consultancy with a global presence will host its annual edition of RIU Investor Forum on Thursday May 17 2018 at the Sri Lanka High Commission in London, UK.
RIU hosts these annual events with the aim of promoting and channeling investment into Sri Lanka from among the high net worth individuals (HNI) living overseas while also building strong interest among the investor community based in key global financial hubs.
A special feature at this years’ event would be the endorsement of the event by the Sri Lanka’s Minister of Finance, the Mangala Samaraweera, who’s statement will read at the event.
The key note address at the event will be made by the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.
The event will also include guest speakers who will make presentations on real estate in Sri Lanka as well as London. Among them would be Sri Lankan Architect Nilesh De Silva who will make a presentation on trends in design for villas and luxury property in the island. Foreign investors have shown confidence towards investing in Sri Lanka as foreign direct investment (FDI) into Sri Lanka has grown to over $ 1.63 billion in 2017, doubling the 802 million dollars achieved in the previous year.
“The UK is easily the most significant diaspora market for Sri Lanka both in terms of quality and quantity.
We look forward to concluding yet another successful event in the UK together with our sponsors and associates,” Roshan Madawela, Head of the Research Intelligence Unit said commenting on the upcoming event.
Altair, the 68-storey luxury residential apartment complex which fronts the Beira Lake in Colombo, Prime Lands (Pvt) Ltd, a leading company in property development and Royal Property Holdings, a building construction firm based in Colombo, Sri Lanka are the lead sponsors of the event.
Event partners include Lamudi, an international property portal, the Oxford Business Group, a research firm based in the UK, the Big Issue Sri Lanka, a Sri Lankan magazine and Eye-Travel.
