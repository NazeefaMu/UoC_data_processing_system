The all-day dining restaurant, ‘Weligama Kitchen’, spreads across different zones while ‘The Big Fish’ is a chef driven restaurant offering gourmet seafood. ‘Mirissa Baking Company’ provides freshly-baked desserts and snacks, accompanied by a selection of fine coffee, fresh juices and specialty drinks and there is also ‘Surf’s Up’ the pool bar.
