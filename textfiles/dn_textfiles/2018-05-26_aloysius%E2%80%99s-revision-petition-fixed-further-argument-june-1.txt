Aloysius’s revision petition fixed for further argument for June 1

A revision application filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena seeking an Interim Order to release them on bail was yesterday fixed for further argument on June 1 by the Court of Appeal.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC appearing for the Attorney General informed Court that there is no illegality in the order made by the Colombo Fort Magistrate regarding their bail.
President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana had informed Court that the prosecutors have followed an illegal procedure by presenting the Presidential Commission into Central Bank Bond issue before Magistrate in order to mislead the Magistrate’s. He argued that bail has been refused after perusing the recommendations made by the Presidential Commission without having a proper magisterial inquiry into the issue.
In reply to the submissions made by petitioners’ counsel Marapana, SASG Kodagoda informed court that the had filed a B report coupled with statements of evidence following a comprehensive investigation.
When the matter came up before Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne, the matter was fixed for further argument on June 1.
The suspects were remanded in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issuance.
Arjun Aloysius states that by his application he was seeking Court’s Jurisdiction to the set aside order dated March 9, 2018 of the Colombo High Court in Revision Application No. HCRA 22/2018.
The High Court refused notice in the said Revision Application for affirming order dated 16-02-2018 made by the Fort Magistrate’s Court in proceedings bearing No.B/8266/18, refusing them bail and committing the petitioner to remand custody.
Aloysius states that he was arrested and produced before the Fort Magistrate’s Court on February 4, 2018 and committed to remand custody by the Fort Magistrate’s Court on February 4 and February 16 and thereafter, at the behest of and on the strength of further reports filed by the Criminal Investigation Department, in connection with an investigation commenced upon a complaint dated 25-11-2016, made by the Central Bank Governor.
Filing this petition through Counsel Sanath Wijewardena, Arjun Aloysius said he was arrested at his residence at 7.30 am on February 4 by Criminal Investigation Department officers, acting under the supervision of the Attorney General.
The Petitioner had not, up to his time of arrest, been notified or summoned by the Criminal Investigation Department, for the recording of a statement from him in connection with the said purported investigation or complaint made by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
On February 4, 2018, upon the Counsel appearing for the Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena moving that the matter be called on the morning of 05-02-2018, for making their legal submissions on behalf of the suspects with regard to their release on bail, the Magistrate made order that the matter be called before the said Court on 05-02-2018 and committed the petitioner and the other suspect to remand custody, Aloysius said.
The Magistrate made order that the written submissions of the petitioner and the fourth suspect Palisena be filed on 07-02-2018 and proceeded to make order committing them to remand custody, without making any order as to the grant or refusal of bail.
Aloysius states that accordingly, aggrieved by the said order dated 16-02-2018 of the Fort Magistrate, he preferred a Revision Application against same to the High Court of the Provinces of the Western Province Holden in Colombo [HCRA 22/2018] wherein he invoked the Revisionary jurisdiction of the said Court on the grounds.
Aloysius states that on 09-03-2018, the Judge of the High Court of the Provinces of the Western Province in Colombo, delivered his Order refusing the issuance of Notice in the said Revision Application to the Respondents. In this application, the petitioner had cited the OIC of CID (Unit 3), the Director of CID and the Attorney General as respondents.
