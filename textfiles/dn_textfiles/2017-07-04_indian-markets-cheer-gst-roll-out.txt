Indian markets cheer GST roll out

Indian markets rejoiced at the far- reaching tax reform GST, sending the benchmark Sensex higher by over 300 points -- its biggest single-day surge in a month -- on emergence of a big rally in FMCG and auto counters.
The across-the-board buying helped the BSE flagship index close at a fresh one-week high of 31,221.62 and took the broader Nifty to finish 94 points higher at 9,615. PTI
