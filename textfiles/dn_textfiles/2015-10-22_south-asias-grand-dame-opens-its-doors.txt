South Asia's Grand Dame opens its doors

Some of the most elegant and historic cultural icons of our times - vintage hotels - have withstood the ravages of time to emerge as icons, imbued with a regal charm that is unparalleled. These are some of the heritage hotels around the world, which enjoy an exalted status as the ultimate vintage luxury destinations of all time. These architectural gems were discovered around the time the Suez Canal was opened for transatlantic steamers in 1869, thereby shortening the journey from the West to the East and promoting the early version of tourism as we know it today. The Galle Face Hotel is privileged to be counted amongst one of these elite properties. The hotel stands proud as one of the oldest hotels east of the Suez in this exclusive group.
Founded in 1864, the Galle Face Hotel is one of the landmarks in Asia with a rich colonial history and is arguably one of the best heritage hotels in the world. The Galle Face Hotel was originally built by four British entrepreneurs and is among the few remaining colonial hotels in operation today in Asia. In 2012 it became the first hotel in the country to be featured on a postage stamp. No visit to Sri Lanka is complete without staying at the elegant historic award winning hotel, which reflects the grandeur of a bygone era yet offering modern comfort for today's traveler. Despite many renovations over the years, the period detail of the Galle Face Hotel has been preserved in its architecture and façade.

Galle Face Hotel has also played host to famous sporting personalities of yore such as Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers, Sir Len Hutton and Mike Brearley.

Together with my team we intend to follow the mantra of 'Personable Service' to each individual guest that walks into Galle Face Hotel to enjoy its timeless grandeur. To ensure this every team member of the hotel will be trained with international standards of luxury hospitality. To make this a reality, I have team that diligently provides individual training to each team member on many areas such as customizing a menu, teaching the importance of the balance of ingredients, inspecting and identifying each touch point of the property to provide clear entry to the property and to further expand the hotel's service offerings to its clientele", Galle Face Hotel General Manager Antony Paton stated.
