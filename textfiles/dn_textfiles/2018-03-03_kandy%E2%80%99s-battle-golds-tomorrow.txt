KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP :
Kandy’s Battle of the Golds tomorrow

Kandy’s first cricket big match is the 20th encounter between Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St. Paul’s) College and Sri Rahula College called the “Battle of the Gold’s” that will take place at the Pallekelle International Stadium today and tomorrow. They are also the two of the oldest schools in Kandy. Cricket is one of the major sports at the two schools. Sri Sumangala has a long history which is 139 years old originating under the name St. Paul’s College as a junior school of Trinity College. After laying the first brick on 8 February 1879 after 100 years in the 1980s, the name was changed to Wariyapola Sri Sumangala College. They first played cricket in 1894. The school gave up the sport and after an 87-year-long layoff; they re-started cricket in 1981.
This was largely due to the efforts of former Sri Lanka cricketer and Kandy Municipal Council Commissioner the late D.H. de Silva. He coached them to play cricket. Special mention must be made of D.D.T. Alwis, a long time coach. Sri Rahula College Katugastota is also one of the oldest cricket playing schools having started the game of cricket in 1890’s but gave it up a few years later and were more involved with football, athletics and hockey. However, in the 1970’s they came back with cricket. A big hand should go to Aubrey Kuruppu, who did his best as coach. Aubrey is a former S. Thomas’ College, Combined Schools, University of Peradeniya, Saracens SC, Central Province and Sri Lanka President’s XI cricketer and cricket commentator.
He trained many cricketers to come up in the game, unfortunately though, when they come up to under 17 level they are being snatched up by other schools. It is going to be two good days of cricket if the weather stays good with batsmen expected to dominate the game. The luck of the coin will go a long way in deciding the outcome of the match.
Fazil says goodbye on his own terms
A match winner and a draw card wherever he plays ruggerite Fazil Marija ended his career with the Clifford Cup finals on Sunday. Now 36, Fazil bid farewell at Longden Place. There's little doubt Marija's rugby career will always be etched in the minds of all rugby players and not be forgotten.
He loved the game, was a good team man and was someone who was very passionate about the game. He prepared very well and gave his all to his club and country. He thanked his family for their support and patience with his long rugby career, and the man who made him international class level ‘Mr. Rugby’ Malik Samawickrema. The way Marija played the game is a model for all young players coming up and to Sri Lanka rugby.
