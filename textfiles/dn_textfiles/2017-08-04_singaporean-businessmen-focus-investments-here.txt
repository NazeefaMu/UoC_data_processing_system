Singaporean  businessmen focus on investments here

A 35-member group of Small and Medium Entrepreneurs from Singapore called on Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne at the Finance Ministry recently, to discuss investment opportunities in Sri Lanka.
The Singaporean delegation headed by Group Executive Chairman of Ong and Ong Group Ong Tze Boon said since Sri Lanka has negotiated bilateral trade agreements with countries, it would be an ideal opportunity for investors to reach the international market via Sri Lanka.
State Minister Wickramaratne said Sri Lanka invited Singapore businessmen who represent the small and medium sector to seize the opportunity to enter the world market through Sri Lanka by investing in the country.
