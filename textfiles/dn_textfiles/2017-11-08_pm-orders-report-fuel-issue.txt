PM orders report on fuel issue

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has called for an immediate report on the current fuel crisis affecting the country from all stakeholders, Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference held at ‘Sirikotha’ UNP Headquarters yesterday, Bandara said the government will take several important decisions once this report was received.
This will help uncover whether anyone was responsible for creating this fuel crisis or it was the result of a conspiracy hatched to inconvenience the government.
Bandara said a request will also be made to appoint a commission to investigate this matter.
He said the shortage will end by November 9 or 10 since a fresh fuel shipment was due in the island on November 8, night.
Bandara blamed the previous Rajapaksa regime for spending enormous funds on unnecessary development projects and neglecting the more important refinery projects. He said nearly 2.5 million dollars were required to improve refinery facilities which the government ought to undertake forthwith.
When there were adequate facilities to store 90,000 metric tonnes of fuel sufficient to last for 45 to 50 days it was intriguing to see as to why officials waited till the last moment till stocks were totally depleted.
He said resolving the fuel crisis was a government responsibility which could have been easily averted.
