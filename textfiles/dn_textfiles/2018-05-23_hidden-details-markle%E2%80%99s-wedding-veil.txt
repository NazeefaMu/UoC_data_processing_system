Hidden details of Markle’s wedding veil

It doesn’t even need to be said at this point, but we’ll say it anyway: Meghan Markle wowed us all when she arrived at the royal wedding. That simple, elegant dress. That bun. The way she looked at Prince Harry.
And, of course, that veil.
At five metres long, the veil is quite the statement piece, giving a subtle nod to Diana’s extra-long train on her wedding.
Now, sketches from Claire Waight Keller have revealed more of the hidden details of the veil, along with details of how it was created. Kensington Palace has confirmed that Meghan asked to have all 53 countries of the Commonwealth represented on her veil, with each country’s flowers hand-embroidered in silk threads and organza.
Workers from Givenchy spent hundreds of hours sewing the designs, washing their hands every thirty minutes to keep the tulle and threads pristine. Each flower had to be unique and detailed.
The majority of the flowers trailed the back of the veil. For the the front, Meghan had selected two favourites: Wintersweet, which grows in the grounds of Kensington Palace in front of Nottingham Cottage, and the Calfornia poppy, the state flower of California, where Meghan was born. Sweet.
Here’s the full list of every flower embroidered on to the veil, in case you’re curious.

Markle’s wedding dress has been designed by the acclaimed British designer, Clare Waight Keller. Waight Keller last year became the first female Artistic Director at the historic French fashion house Givenchy.
After meeting Waight Keller in early 2018, Markle chose to work with her for her timeless and elegant aesthetic, impeccable tailoring, and relaxed demeanour. Markle also wanted to highlight the success of a leading British talent who has now served as the creative head of three globally influential fashion houses – Pringle of Scotland, Chloé, and now Givenchy.
