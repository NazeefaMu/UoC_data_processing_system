RFMTA calls for removal of SLMC VP

Ruhunu Faculty of Medicine Teachers’ Association (RFMTA) has sent a letter to the Registrar of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) requesting removal of the SLMC Vice President, RFMTA Secretary Dr. Arjuna De Silva said.
According to Dr. Silva, SLMC has agreed upon the minimum entry criteria for Sri Lankan medical faculties at a previous meeting. This decision was taken after discussing this matter at length with the respective faculty boards.
The decision was that the lowest grades obtained by students in the preceding year would be considered.
When this matter was discussed at the Cabinet, the above decision was changed and they agreed upon two Cs and one S as the minimum entry criteria.
Minister Dr. Rajitha Senarathne has mentioned at a press conference that the state medical faculty Deans also have endorsed this change.
Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had mentioned the same fact at one of Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva’s committee meetings in the presence of the SLMC Vice President and representatives from RFMTA, GMOA and AMS.
In the same meeting, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne mentioned that President Maithripala Sirisena had communicated with Deans, pointing to the fact that SLMC Vice President and Deans are in agreement with this decision.
“The SLMC Vice President had never objected to this at that time. Therefore we strongly believe that the SLMC Vice President is behind this dramatic change of minimum entry criteria and acted as representative of all Deans of state medical faculties without any consent from the other Deans,” he said.
At another SLMC meeting the SLMC Vice President has voiced and emphasized the ideas to award SLMC recognition to SAITM ‘graduates’ without an extra
training for community medicine, psychiatry and forensic medicine when most of the other members of the SLMC council were emphasizing that an extra training is mandatory for the above subjects. Trying to undermined the quality of medical education of the country and trying to ignore the collective decision making process of the medical faculties is an unacceptable behaviour from a Dean of a of state medical faculty. We strongly believe that the collective decision of the SLMC council members should go forward and implemented rather than implementing the Vice President’s own idea. We believe that since the SLMC Vice President has undue advantage of behaving as a representative of other Deans and SLMC. Considering the above fact, Ruhuna Faculty of Medicine Teachers Association (RFMTA) request SLMC to consider removal the SLMC Vice President, he added.
