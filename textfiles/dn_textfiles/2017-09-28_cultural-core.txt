Cultural Core

She has taken Sri Lankan culture to the world. Young, concerned and full of ideas Julia Wijesinghe wants to make a difference. She has been bestowed with the title of Young Ambassador for Sri Lankan Cultures by the US Embassy in Sri Lanka for her exceptional effort in showcasing Sri Lankan history, culture and values to the world.
The founder of the first Sri Lankan museum in the world which is outside Sri Lanka, Julia began her unique venture when she was merely 18 years old.
“My inspiration comes from the goals and dreams that I have aspired to achieve since I was 15 years old. My parents, Lakruwana and Jayantha Wijesinghe, have done a lot for the Sri Lankan community, including opening the first Sri Lankan restaurant in USA, in New York City. As a result of seeing them take pride in their culture, it inspired me to do something on my own to represent my country as well. Although I was raised in the States, my parents took me to Sri Lanka every year.
“This gave me the opportunity to experience Sri Lanka’s historic sites and its rich heritage,” Julia explained adding that her aim in opening ‘Sri Lankan Art and Cultural Museum NY’ was to safeguard Sri Lankan tradition and not let it fade.
She has laboured three years to turn her dream into a reality. Finally her efforts paid off as the museum opened doors to the public on March 27. Since New York is a cultural melting pot, Julia needed to put on her thinking cap to organise the museum in a manner so that it stood out and lured visitors. The task was no cake walk. You need to know what you are representing and you need to possess a thirst for knowledge to carry off the task.
“I learnt many things about Sri Lanka during my visits and from reading books. I met the Veddas, and tried to learn their language. The first historical place I went to in Sri Lanka was the Kelanyia Temple. It is very special to me because my parents got married there.
“Then I started to travel to places like Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and other historic sites. When I went to these places I wanted to learn more so I would question everything. Gathering all the artifacts and artwork that I required was a challenge indeed. All this would not have been possible without my father’s help. He has set up a foundation to help young school children in Ratnapura too. He is obsessed with antiques and whenever we visit Sri Lanka we would go somewhere new. I always look forward to my visits to Sri Lanka. I also collect more items for my museum there,” Julia mused.
Julia is studying at The College of Staten Island In New York, majoring in computer science. Due to her studies the ‘Sri Lankan Art and Cultural Museum NY’ is open only on weekends. Weekends are a treat for visitors because they get to experience Sri Lanka’s rich heritage with a tour of the museum with Julia as well as a chance to indulge in traditional Sri Lankan food at the restaurant buffet.
“A lot of people see me as the leader of Sri Lankan cultures to the world. I was featured in The New Yorker Magazine too. I have had positive feedback from Sri Lanka as well because they feel proud of me because I have shared Sri Lankan heritage with the world,” Julia said.
The museum which is combined with Lakruwana restaurant, comprises of many artifacts like Buddha statues (replicas and originals), ceremonial weapons, musical instruments, cooking implements, temple objects, a rubber-tree log, gemstones, and statues of Hindu deities like Krishna and Ganesha. Books about Vaddas and Sri Lankan rituals make up the small library. Paintings done with kithul and a collection of ayurvedic medicial masks adorn the walls. There is a special section for tea and coconut exhibits. Julia says that the most popular piece in the museum is the sculpture of the Buddha during his seven-year penance which is sculpted using metal junk. She says that she wishes to add some ola leaf manuscripts (puskola poth) to her collection.
‘Sri Lankan Art and Cultural Museum NY’ represents every religion and culture of all the ethnic groups in Sri Lanka.
“Our culture is unique in a lot of aspects, whether it is the food we eat or the way our families are. There is one thing in Sri Lanka that no other country has. We may be a small country on the map, but our culture and history are diverse and fascinating. I have always believed in unity, and I know a lot about other religions as well,” Julia noted.
She is also passionate about dancing. She does a lot of natya kathak and Bharathanatyam. She used to do ballet but now trains in Kandyan dancing.
“My future plans are to excel in computer science and have a job in that position. The most important thing is to continue with my museum and share our Sri Lankan pride with the world to signify how awesome we are as Sri Lankans. I wish to bring my museum to a bigger place and make it a landmark. I am keen on spreading awareness and letting the world know where we stand,” Julia opined.
Her message to Sri Lankan youth at home and across the world is to care for each other and unite as a family.
“We need to show the world what we are made of. You should always muster a smile and bring light to anyone you see because you never know when you’ll make someone’s day even brighter,” she added with a smile.
