Bush fires rage over temperate lands

From the United Sates, across Greece, Portugal and Spain to distant Australia Bush fires have devastated vast regions killing hundreds of people and destroying thousands of residential and commercial buildings.
In the United States it was the district of California that was affected. Over 1,000 homes were destroyed and 37,000 rendered homeless. The total area devastated amounts to 4.25 million hectares.
Greece was the worst affected country. Over 91 persons died and another 25 have gone missing. The Government is facing a crisis situation over alleged inefficiency in managing the disaster.
France is also slightly affected. Portugal and bordering regions of Spain have also recorded bush fires with 60 killed in the former.
In Australia 40,000 hectares of land were destroyed including settlements.
Global temperature rise resulting in Earth’s warming and its attendant frequent fluctuations of weather causing long periods of drought as well as sudden floods, storms etc. seem to be some of the natural causes leading to the sudden vagaries of weather. Long spells of drought with no considerable rain as well as high winds and low humidity are said to be the natural factors that cause bush fires. However, there are also man-made factors. Among them the irrational clearing of beach front forests, unregulated construction of residential quarters in close proximity to each other lack of town planning predominate. Lack of disaster preparedness as well as poor disaster management has also contributed to aggravate the situation.
Another fire phenomenon that was witnessed simultaneously in the last few weeks was the eruption of a series of volcanoes in Guatemala, Hawaii, Indonesia and Jamaica. It has been observed that there is an increase of volcanic activity during recent times. Changes in the rotational speed of the Earth due to the attraction of the Sun and the Moon, and movement of tectonic plates are said to be partly responsible for this phenomenon. Whatever it is bush fires are being complemented by a natural fire festival too.
Pope Francis opposes death penalty
His Holiness Pope Francis has once again come out openly against the imposition of capital punishment. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the death penalty now is no longer admissible under any circumstances.
The Vatican announced on Thursday Pope Francis approved changes to the compendium of Catholic teaching published under Pope John Paul II.
“The death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person,” reads the Catechism of the Catholic Church now on the death penalty, with the addition that the Church “works with determination for its abolition worldwide.”
The statement released by the Vatican’s press office on Thursday says that Francis approved the new changes to point number 2267 of the Catechism on May 11, 2018, during a meeting with the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Spanish Cardinal Luis Ladabaria.
As it’s been re-written, the Catechism now also says that “Recourse to the death penalty on the part of legitimate authority, following a fair trial, was long considered an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good.”
Yet today, “there is an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes. In addition, a new understanding has emerged of the significance of penal sanctions imposed by the state.”
“Lastly, more effective systems of detention have been developed, which ensure the due protection of citizens but, at the same time, do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption,” reads the Catechism now.
Capital punishment is still implemented in 53 countries including the United States, China, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Japan among others.
Tough days ahead for Imran Khan
Tough days are ahead for Prime Minister Imran Khan. He will face a hostile Parliament, weakened economy with an increased debt burden, sour relations with the United States and India, a considerable youth population demanding employment and challenges from diverse insurgent and religious groups.
The United States as already warned Pakistan’s new government that IMF dollars should not be used to bail out Pakistan’s debt to China under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). It is an undue interference in the internal affairs of Pakistan for with whom it deals in its economic relations cannot be a concern for third parties.
So far the tidings are good. Imran Khan has promised United States and the telephone conversation between Modi and Khan seems to have a beneficial effect that could yield a thaw in Indo-Pakistan relations. Some analysts also predict that Imran Khan’s mediation would become useful in Afghanistan as the US has decided in pursue its plan B- negotiations to contain the Taliban insurgency. On the domestic front the PTI of Imran Khan has been able to work out a strategy for a coalition government that has strengthened its parliamentary strength. The BNP has joined it. The latter has been also offered the Chief Minister post in Balochistan. Four independent MPS have already joined the PTI.
In any case Imran Khan has also to tread carefully and slowly to re-balance relations between the civilian administration and the powerful military whose signature is evident in the political development of the country.
