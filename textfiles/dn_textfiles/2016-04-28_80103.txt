Japan’s Uchiyama flattened as record hopes vanish

 
Wednesday: Japan's Takashi Uchiyama suffered a shock defeat by Panama's Jezreel Corrales on Wednesday, a brutal second-round knockout dashing his hopes of a 12th defence of his WBA super featherweight title.
The 36-year-old Uchiyama, considered Japan's best pound-for-pound boxer in recent years, had never tasted defeat in his professional career -- until Corrales unleashed a violent flurry of punches to flatter the champion. Uchiyama, who won the belt from Mexican Juan Carlos Salgado in 2010, had been looking to overhaul Yoko Gushiken's Japanese record of 13 title defences between 1976 and 1981. But the Nagasaki-born tough guy, dubbed "Knockout Dynamite" by Japanese fans and media, was sent crashing to the canvas three times in the second round by top-ranked challenger Corrales, who put Uchiyama out of his misery with a vicious left hook.
Corrales entered the ring with a skeleton mask and the fight quickly turned into a horror story for Uchiyama, who was caught flush on the chin by the southpaw early in the first round. - AFP
