Congestion easing on Expressway

The heavy rush of vehicles observed on the Southern Expressway due to the New Year and people visiting their Southern hometowns up to Saturday noon, eased by Sunday April 15, a spokesperson for the highway administration said. He said the Godagama and Pinnawala entrances to the highway had a slight vehicle congestion on Sunday.
However, it was also slightly lesser than the congestion seen on April 14.
