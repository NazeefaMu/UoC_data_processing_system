Harassed student writes to President against Principal

The nine year old school girl who won back her right to schooling after being expelled from a school in Ganemulla over rumours of HIV, has written to the President, once again, asking that he intervene to ensure that she can sit for her scholarship exam.
In March 2017, a group of parents protested at the school asking that they remove the child over false rumours that she had contracted HIV. They had spread rumours that because her mother was a volunteer at an AIDS prevention programme, she too would have contracted the disease and passed it on to the child. As a result, the principal had asked the child to leave the school.
However, with the intervention of the Human Rights Commission, the school was forced to take the child back.
The child in her letter to the President dated February 22, 2018 has stated that her principal continued to berate her and that on February 19, he had called her and in front of all in school showed the media coverage on her and stated ‘There, it is -----AIDS story’.
She also informed the President that the school authorities continued to harass her and this harassment has prevented her from going to school and sit for her scholarship exam.
“My father, mother and I live in a rented house. We don’t have many facilities in this house. Please help me get an education.I am the first in every exam.I am sorry to have disturbed you”, appealed the girl to the President.
Calls made to the Presidential Secretariat Citizen’s mail section could not verify whether the President had received her letter. The President is on a two day visit to Pakistan.
