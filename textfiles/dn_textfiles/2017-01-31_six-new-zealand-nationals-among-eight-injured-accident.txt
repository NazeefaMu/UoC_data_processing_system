Eight persons, including six New Zealand nationals were injured in a road accident on the Colombo - Kandy Main Road at Kalalpitiya, Nittambuwa yesterday.
The van proceeding to Kandy with the foreigners had collided with the car. The injured were admitted to Wathupitiwala Hospital. Wathupitiwala Hospital director Dr. Sisira Wijesundera said three foreign males, three foreign females and drivers of both vehicles involved in the accident were admitted to hospital.
Dr. Wijesundara said no one sustained serious injuries.
“The foreigners injured in the accident told me they had prior plans to leave the country this evening,” he said.
“Since, they have prepared all documents for their travel, they requested me to allow them to leave. I have directed their request to the DMO,” Dr. Wijesundara said.
