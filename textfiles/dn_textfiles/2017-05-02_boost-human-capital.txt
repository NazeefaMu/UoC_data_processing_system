Boost human capital

Many countries love to boast about their economic strengths. Many of the countries in the global economic landscape largely based around the Gross National Product (GNP), to show their growth rate. There is, however, an overlooked non-economic indicator, namely, the Human Development Index (HDI). Any nation’s strength lies on the Human potential of the labour force of that country.
HDI is derived from the theme of ‘Human Development,’ which is fundamentally about enlarging individual choices. The theme was formed by Mahbub ul Haq, a Pakistani economist who worked with the well- known Indian economist Amartya Sen. In Ul Haq’s, Sen’s and their colleagues’ view, economic indicators did not fully describe the state of a country. They argued that in place of economic indicators should be human-centred indicators focused, on widening human choices. Ul Haq thus wrote the first Human Development Report in 1990 and created the HDI to quantify Human Development. HDI and Human Development Reports rapidly shifted the global development arena.
They emphasized on the strength of the human capital and helped shift donor nations attention towards human needs and also slightly helped formulate global goals such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and their successor, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Development should be about people rather than about digits
Human development is not a widely known or utilized concept in Sri Lanka. Many of the Sri Lankan organisations still rely on the financial and pure economic-based measurements for economic growth. However, HDI shows that progress and development should be about people rather than about digits. Many of the private and public sector organisations in Sri Lanka follow the digits rather than potential of the Human factor. Many of the statistics in the public and private sector do not reveal the strength of the Human capital and the potential lies within such an asset. Therefore, organisations lag behind without reaping the benefit of strength of human capital in their organisations.
Innovation and entrepreneurship in a country which drives the way forward emanates from the human capital. Innovation and entrepreneurship are the keys to any nation’s future. Book smarts will only take a person so far. There are only so many traditional careers and job types known to the present generation. The majority of students today must be groomed in the art of learning, assimilating and using knowledge and honing skill sets so they can be flexible enough to capably work in professions yet unknown to us at this present.
The global employment market
The global employment market is an increasingly competitive place. Asians would strive to go West for better educational and work opportunities; but there seems to be a turnaround over the last decade where many Westerners are looking to come East. They go to places like China, India, Hong Kong and Singapore to explore burgeoning opportunities, with China leading the way by attracting close to half a million foreign students, third after the U.S. and UK. As well, Western workers are looking to China and Asian tigers for employment experiences to embellish their resumes. Singapore is a highly service-driven economy, hungry for foreign workers at all levels of the skills spectrum. Getting a work permit is easy enough if you have the right skills with such an open market.
HDI brings about a moral dimension to development, showing people’s opportunities can be improved, especially through components such as increasing access to education, improving the health of the human capital. As we move on with local or global development goals, we need to emphasize on human development construct rather than towards economic targets.
Harnessing the human potential to cater to the development process of the country has been the key area discussed. In Sri Lanka, youth, those between the ages of 15-29, account for nearly 26% of the total population in the country. As Sri Lanka move towards a transition to an upper middle income economy, many of the changes driving modern economies up the income ladder, such as technological innovation and globalization, will immensely benefit the skilled and educated youth of the country. However, it is imperative to ensure that they are being provided with the necessary skills and resources to improve their capacity to engage in the development activities of the country.
Despite Sri Lanka being on track in achieving many of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), further attention should be given to youth development, supporting them to overcome the challenges including unemployment, poverty and educational dilemmas, and help them seize the opportunities in the global arena. Therefore, Sri Lanka needs to mindfully address the many constraints faced by the youth to fully integrate them in the political, economic and social continuum of the country.
Most of the Y-generation in developed nations has been given ample opportunities to secure a well rounded education as well as access to some form of relevant work-ready training. They should by all accounts, be equipped for some form of skilled employment. In many South East Asian countries when a job requiring a specialized skills set is advertised in the newspapers, prospective job seekers based anywhere in the world may look at the advertisement and apply for the job. It is a competitive, global work market indeed. Sri Lanka needs to think the way forward in giving ample opportunities to the Human capital of this country to enrich their lives as well as skills and knowledge to serve this country.
Sustainability of the health-care and social support systems
Investment in re-skilling retirees is one alternative to go. While Japan, the US and Britain are focusing much of their attention on the sustainability of their health-care and social support systems to enable their silver generation to live comfortably, Singapore is encouraging its mid-career workers and retirees to upgrade and re-skill themselves (with up to 85% funding from the government) to take on higher-skilled work or second careers. Fifty years ago when the life expectancy in the nation was pegged at 66.7 years, it made sense to expect retirees to enjoy their life without having to worry about how they were going to afford to maintain their not-so-expensive lifestyle for a decade or so. Today, life expectancy in Singapore is one of the highest in the world at 84.7 years. This translates to almost twenty more years of life, a generation in fact, much of it still very productive.
Government with the private sector partnership need to craft a well recognized rewarding system to strengthen the potential of the human capital of this country. The pioneer generation of citizens, personalities who placed our mother nation in the world map with dignity, Tri-forces who dedicated their lives to serve this nation are few examples need to be rewarded with well-subsidized medical care, public housing as well as means-tested cash supplements. Public and private sector organisations need to enhance the provision of health insurance and housing schemes, increase more access for training and development on appropriate skills and knowledge of the human capital of the respective organisations. Maintaining equity and equality in the aforesaid provisions are really important to sustain the human potential within the organisations. The percentage of marginalized citizens will be then minimal in this island nation.
Necessity of National Think Tank
In order to express the views and opinions of the human capital on development with the aim of creating a positive change in the country there is a necessity of a national think tank. Many of the positive ideas could be considered for the development of this country. If we do not identify the potential of human capital of this country, it will lead to many socio-economic issues that many of us are currently facing. The future of this country greatly depends on the current and its emerging workforce. There is an ever growing population of young minds who find them wanting to use their skills to pursue careers in various industries? However, are there opportunities available for them within the country currently, and if not, are there policies being set in place or steps being taken to do so? Smartest, brightest people leaving the country crisis where the “brains” of the nation are not contributing anything to the country or its future, and there is a huge flow of cash out of the country.
If policymakers and corporate could see the potential of the workforce and adequately have opportunities available for them, the end effect could quite literally take Sri Lanka to new heights.
