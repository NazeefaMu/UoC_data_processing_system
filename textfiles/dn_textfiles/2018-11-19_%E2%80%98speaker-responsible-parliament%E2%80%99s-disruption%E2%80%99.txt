‘Speaker responsible for Parliament’s disruption’

Going by the happenings in Parliament today, one can expect one or two Parliamentarians to lose their lives in the future. If that happens the Speaker should be held responsible for it, because he has created this situation in the House, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was speaking at a meeting of the Angunukolapelessa SLFP Bala Mandalaya, at his residence on Saturday. About 2,000 SLFPers attended the meeting.
Minister Amaraweera said the Speaker had no powers to appoint a Prime Minister or a Cabinet of Ministers to dissolve Parliament. Only the President was empowered to take such action by the Constitution.
A Speaker ought to be an impartial. He cannot pass judgements on actions taken by the President. But the opposite was happening today.
Today, the Speaker was trying to act beyond the powers vested in him. President Maithripala Sirisena used his Constitutional powers and appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister because he commanded a majority in Parliament. If it was considered wrong, the UNP should have gone to the Supreme Court to get an interpretation about it. Without doing such a thing, the UNP went on a shouting spree to disrupt Parliamentary proceedings.
For the first time in Parliament’s history, a Speaker arrived in the chamber escorted by a battalion of policemen.
That was the reason why government MPs were agitated in Parliament. Government MPs would not have acted in this manner if the Speaker arrived in the Chamber according to normal tradition.
The so-called no-confidence motion was passed in a most unparliamentary manner. The way it was adopted was against all Parliamentary norms. The rowdy scenes in Parliament were caused by actions taken by the Speaker against standing orders.
The President had already announced the procedure to be adopted in passing a no-confidence motion. If that was done, the President would abide by the decision taken.
