More power to be purchased from private sector

Cabinet has decided to purchase 60 megawatts of power through an open international competitive bidding process for a short term period of six months starting from February.
This 60MW is to be installed at three or more suitable locations to ease the transmission constraints that has arisen in the Central and Southern Provinces.
According to the recommendations made by Public Utilities Commission, more generation capacity should be added to the national grid to ensure uninterrupted power supply.
Met Department said adequate rainfall could not be expected during the coming 4 months and therefor it is not prudent to rely on the existing hydropower capacity of 1,350MW which is 30 percent of the 3,900MW of total installed capacity. (LBO)
