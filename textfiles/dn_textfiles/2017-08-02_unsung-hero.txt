Unsung hero

A promising left-handed opener and an all-rounder played his school cricket for Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa, and made his first class debut for the Police Sports Club at the age of 18 years. A useful off-break bowler, he displayed impressive skill with both bat and ball to earn a spot in the Sri Lanka U19 side. Although unrelated to Sanath Jayasuriya, he is a steady run-getter with a good technique and a penchant for long innings.
His most notable memory is signing up for the Chittagong Kings in the second season of the Bangladesh Premier League. In the 2013 edition of the Champions League T20, he has represented the Kandurata Maroons, the winners of the Super Fours T20 competition in Sri Lanka.
He then went on to represent Sri Lanka national cricket team as an all rounder. Presently he is turning out for Chilaw Marians Cricket Club. Today we go off the field with this unsung hero in Shehan Jayasuriya.

Q: What made you enter the world of sports?
A: Ever since I was little I always held a cricket ball in my hand wherever I went or whatever I was doing. I used to watch cricket matches with my dad. He noticed that I had an interest in cricket. He is the one who helped me get started. After that, my love for cricket grew day by day.
Q: What’s your favourite holiday destination?
A: New York.
Q: What is the greatest accomplishment in your life?
A: Being selected into the Sri Lankan national team.
Q: What's the best compliment you have received?
A: The best compliment I received was public opinion that I have a good future and I can be a great asset to the national side. It means a lot when cricket loving people have faith in me. I can't go on this journey alone. I need as much support as I can get.
Q: Are you doing what you believe in, or are you settling for what you are doing?
A: I am doing what I believe in. I believe that one day my hard work will pay off and my cricket skills will get noticed because I feel that I deserve to be in a higher position than I am right now.
Q: Who has supported you the most?
A: My parents, closest friends and coaches.
Q: What are the top priorities in your life?
A: Family, friends and cricket.
Q: If you had one day left to live, what would you do?
A: It may sound silly but I would eat everything that I can. I have to restrict what I eat now to be fit enough to play cricket since I have a very slow metabolism. It is very annoying to have to watch what I eat.
Q: What do you do for fun?
A: During my free time what I enjoy most is relaxing at home. But I also like enjoying the outdoors and being adventurous for example hiking, swimming, water sports, and bike riding to name a few.
Q: What was your most unforgettable memory/ incident?
A: The first match I played for the national team, it was a T20 verses Pakistan on August 1, 2015. I scored 40+ runs and got the wicket of Shahid Afridi.
Q: Who do you sometimes compare yourself to?
A: I don't compare myself to anyone. I feel everyone is unique and has different ways and beliefs on life. If I were to compare myself to others I wouldn't be able to make a name for myself.
Q: Are you happy with all your achievements?
A: I feel that I haven't been able to achieve the best of my capabilities because the chances I get to show my abilities are slim to none.
Q: How would you describe yourself in two words?
A: Unsung Hero.
