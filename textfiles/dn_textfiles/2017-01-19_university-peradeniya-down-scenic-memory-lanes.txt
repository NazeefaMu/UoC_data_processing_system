University of Peradeniya: Down scenic memory lanes

It is great news for the undergraduates turned senior citizens. It is welcome news for those who are in the evening of their lives who wish to renew the past memories. It is surprising news for the few living to go down memory lane, refreshing the enthusiasm, the interest, the experience and excitement that illumined their lives.
We still have pleasant recollections of our stay at Peradeniya. The news item calling for all graduates of pre-seventy era to provide information and furnish details of their stay at the University of Peradeniya is unique and beyond expression.

The organizers should be congratulated and honoured for the bold decision and the splendid opportunity provided. The deep bond with the institution and how it played a vital role in their lives cannot be erased from their minds. Gone are the days when they enjoyed the fruits of life and education replete with quality and excellence. Many reminisce the past glory.
There are some enthusiastic, outstanding personalities who are worthy of praise at Golden Jubilee celebrations. They have taken great interest in bringing the old faces together. Somasundaram popularly and affectionally known as ‘Jolly’ to his friends commemorated the great day of Group 56 (Aug 20-2006). Thilak Ranaviraja and Sena Thoradeniya who organized the GT of 1961 batch and Neville Perera and Kularatna are just a few names among hundreds who actively participated in the honoured task.

The institution is located on a site which is stunningly beautiful with nature's beauty reigning supreme. The person behind this supreme gift to the paradise isle was Sir Ivor Jennings, the founder vice-chancellor, an intellectual genius. The pioneer and the gifted architect Shirley de Alwis rendered a tremendous service, which then with its majesty and grandeur ranked as the most prestigious in the globe. It was truly an important milestone in our history. Academically, the dedicated service of the pioneer was not single-handed.
He was assisted by a galaxy of academics. The students during the period were fortunate to have received their education from the most learned scholars, professors and lecturers who were willing to accomplish the gigantic task.
They had strong intellect to plan, guide and plead the students to success. The undergrads were forging ahead with hardly any problem, whatsoever. The so-called “ragging” then was simple fun which everybody enjoyed. The students in this heaven on earth mindfully started the day, with thoughts of serious studies, enchanted by the scenic beauty and encouraged by the atmosphere. It was hard work filled with joy. It always remained a memorable glittering period in their lives. It is with great pride that we recall the good old days.

Peradeniya as the residential university, the first of its kind, was created for the intelligentsia bent on learning with one aim in their lives – getting out with a brilliant academic achievement worthy of a rewarding career and refinement in life. Indiscipline or instability was unheard of. Instead, there was perfect peace and harmony which we could be proud of reminiscing even today. The undergrads were well aware of their responsibilities, rights, and duties. There were no tragic situations of any calibre. The smooth functioning of the honoured institution was never disrupted. We could be proud that discipline has been very important in the glorious past. Repeating it once more, as old as we are, we can be truly proud that we were a truly disciplined set of students. We are grateful that it offered the undergrads the best of everything that anyone could ever dream of. Well equipped with luxurious residential halls, comfortable lecture halls, first class library, a good sports complex and many other comforts (when modern technology was nonexistent), learning was a lifelong pleasure and a guarantee for a successful future. This was further facilitated by the medium of instruction which was English in accordance with the British system.
Undergraduates possessed a sound knowledge of English and a high standard was maintained. It was the first institution to offer degrees in the English medium which provided them with the best career opportunities. They became accomplished graduates fit to serve anywhere in the globe, serving humanity. In addition to the excellent facilities, with the best staff, the study programmes and curriculum then, was the most advanced on par with modern teaching methods. Each semester was a new learning experience. The multicultural outlook and background helped them to acquire a broad outlook. There was the strong tradition of quality in every aspect. It is a well-known fact that the university offered the best and illumined the lives of almost everyone of that era. The glory of the university still lingers in our hearts.
The University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, the oldest, largest and the most well-known with its glorious past, did everything quite successfully in its own way setting an example to the subsequent universities which were to come up later. It still remains as the most important and the highest centre of learning in Mother Lanka. Its colourful history does not end here. It has touched the hearts and minds of thousands with a deep sense of affection.
