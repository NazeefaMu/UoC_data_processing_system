All political parties united in drafting the Constitution: Kiriella

Tamil MP’s opposed when the constitution was being drafted by Sirimavo Bandaranaike and J.R. Jayawardene. This is the first time in the country’s history that all political parties are working together in drafting a constitution including the Tamil parties, said Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
The Minister expressed these views at the commencement of development of a road which the British captured during King Sri Wickrama Rajasingha’s reign in Medamulana, Teldeniya. The Minister said during the past Presidential election they spoke of the need for a new Constitution at meetings. “During the Parliamentary Election we spoke of a need of a new Constitution. Only the people who strived for President Maithripala Sirisena’s victory understood the necessity of a new Constitution. All political parties in parliament are included in an oversight committee which is involved in drafting a new constitution. This has never occurred before. No Tamil party participated in drafting a Constitution during Sirimavo Bandaranaike and J.R. Jayawardene’s rule. We will put the constitution to a referendum and see what the people’s verdict is.
