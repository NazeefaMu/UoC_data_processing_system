Moves to restrict jumbo entry

The shrub jungle in Ashraff Nagar at Oluvil in the Addalaichenai DS division is being cleared to restrict wild elephants from entering the settlement areas.
The operation is carried out under the instructions of Addalaichenai Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman A. L. Amanullah.
Property damages due to wild elephants had increased in the villages in Addalaichenai in the recent past. Residents undergo many difficulties due to wild elephants that invade the areas often. Wild elephants are invading the villages in search of food and water.
Residents say elephants have attacked houses, damaged household goods, trees, coconut saplings, home gardens and other crop cultivations while devastating paddy lands. Residents live in a state of fear. As a result, the livelihoods of the people are affected and they urge authorities to take immediate action in this regard.
