Prevailing dry weather has caused salt water intrusion into Kalu Ganga: NWSDB GM

The prevailing dry weather has caused a salt water intrusion in Kalu Ganga, National Water Supply and Drainage Board General Manager Engineer G.A. Kumararatne said.
Kumararatne said the water intakes from the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Gin Ganga rivers are still normal.
“We are unable to take water from Deduru Oya. So our option is to take water from Kurunegala lake,” he said.
The water supply to the Kurunegala town is reduced to about 12 hours a day since last week, due to the receding water level of the Deduru Oya, Kumararatne said.
“There is no significant change in the river water levels at the moment. We are building up small barriers to build up water for intake,” he said.
“However, a salt water intrusion is evident in Kalu Ganga. The NWSDB is looking into the situation,” Kumararatne said. He said by the end of February the condition may change if the drought continues.
“We may have to opt for a water supply control by the end of February. We may have to reduce the number of hours for the water supply,” he said.
He said Sri Lanka has deep wells running up for 52,000 meters depth not affected by the last August, September and October drought season.
“Apart from Vavuniya, other deep well schemes will continue as usual,” Kumararatne said.
He said the domestic consumption may rise as the drought proceeds.
“We can predict rises in using water for non drinking purposes such as washing and cleaning, which will ultimately cause a demand exceeding the contribution ability,” he said.
The GM also said that around 130 extra water bowsers are supplying water for elevated areas.
Director of Irrigation (Water Management & training) Engineer S. Mohanarajah said a sound rain fall was expected in this season, but the received rain fall is enough only to fill 40 percent of the reservoirs.
“The main problem is the drought, not the cultivation. The drought will affect the next Yala season cultivation. If we don’t get water in this season, we will not be able to give water for Yala Kannaya. This is our main problem,” he said.
“We asked the farmers not to start cultivation very early. But some of them have started following the last rain fall due to the recent atmospheric depression. We will be able to safeguard 40 percent of the cultivation,” Mohanarajah explained.
“Our water storage is about 27 percent island wide, and we are going to do a strict and well planned water management,” he said.
“Some farmers have not started cultivating yet. They ask whether they can commence now, but we are holding them back, he said. Since we are in short of water, it is not advisable to start cultivating now,” he also said.
“We have to save some water for domestic purposes as well. The Irrigation Department is responsible for the water sources. The Water Board distribute water for domestic purposes in areas such as Kantale, Murutawela, Galle, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Batticaloa districts.” Mohanarajah said.
As much as we need to release water for cultivation, we need to prioritise reserving the drinkable water as well, he pointed out.
Ceylon Electricity Board Chairman Anura Wijepala said the government is encouraging the public to choose renewable energy sources such as solar power in similar demanding situations. Department of Wildlife Conservation Media Spokesperson Hasini Sarathchandra said they are well equipped to minimise the impacts of the drought on the wildlife.
Sarathchandra pointed out the water was pumped into water holes within the national parks from nearby water sources such as streams or rivers in previous drought season, .
“In the last drought season, we pumped water from the Menik River to the Yala National Park. Solar power was used to activate the generators to pump water from the river. The same method is used in Kumana and Wilpattu parks. The Wildlife Department is to introduce the same method to other national parks as well,” Sarathchandra said. A special observation patrolling will be introduced in all the national parks following the drought, Sarathchandra said.
“The animals are vulnerable to be hunted more in rought seasons,” she said.
