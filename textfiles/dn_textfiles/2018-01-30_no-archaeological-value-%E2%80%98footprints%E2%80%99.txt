No archaeological value to ‘footprints’

The Archaeology Department yesterday said there was no archaeological value attached to the ‘footprints’ found in the New Fogmore area of the Guardmore Tea Estate in Maskeliya.
Archaeology Director General Prof. P. B. Mandawala said a team from the Department was sent to inspect the site and according to their report and expert opinions obtained from professionals in the field, they had come to the conclusion that someone had drawn footprints over a natural feature to come up with this unique pattern on the stone.
The ‘footprints’ which caused quite a stir in the area had residents perform religious ceremonies over it, thinking that this was the footprint of the Hindu deity Hanuman.
