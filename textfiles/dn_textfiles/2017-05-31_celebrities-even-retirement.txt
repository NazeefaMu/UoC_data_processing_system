Celebrities even in retirement

They may have retired from international cricket two years ago but Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene still continue to hog the limelight in the cricket world sometimes more than the Sri Lanka cricket team whom they were staunch members of not so long ago.
The two cricketing legends inseparable in many ways during their playing career and even after, are making waves even during their retirement. While Sangakkara, the incredible run machine continues to light up the English cricket fields representing county Surrey and setting up new batting records, Jayawardene, one of the astute captain’s produced by the country is in great demand for his coaching skills. No sooner had he guided Mumbai Indians to a landmark third IPL title in the 10th edition of the cash-rich league with an astonishing one-run win over Rising Pune Supergiants Jayawardene is grabbed by Bangladesh Premier League side Khulna Titans on a two-year contract.
Jayawardene who succeeded former Australian captain Ricky Ponting as coach of Mumbai Indians will replace another former Australian Stuart Law as Khulna Titans coach.
"We were thrilled to see him win the IPL recently as the coach of the Mumbai Indians. I am sure all of us at Titans will learn a lot from him and the tournament will be enriched by his presence," Khulna Titans Managing Director Kazi Inam Ahmed said. The fifth edition of the BPL is set to begin on November 4.
In addition to his coaching stints Jayawardene who turned 40 four days ago, still continues to actively participate in the game having signed with English county Lancashire to play in the NatWest T20 Blast during the current season.
“He (Mahela) is not registered as an overseas player, having received a spousal visa through his Danish wife, and will be available for the entire competition. There is no formal coaching element to his deal with the Red Rose county, but as head coach of Indian Premier League franchise Mumbai Indians he will be a huge source of information and advice for the club’s younger players,” The Guardian (London) reported.
“Lancashire’s coach, Glen Chapple, said: “Mahela is a truly world-class batsman who scores runs all around the wicket. He’s a true competitor and a winner too. He is a legend of the game and is one of the greatest batsmen to have played cricket in the modern era. It will be a fantastic opportunity for our young players to learn off him and for our fans to watch one of the game’s greats.” The NatWest T20 Blast is due to commence from July 7.
Having signalled his intention to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the ongoing county season Sangakkara, the former Sri Lanka captain certainly wants to make a memorable exit from Surrey and on a high where his name will be treasured and remembered for time immemorial.
SANGA MISSES WORLD RECORD
Having reeled off five consecutive first-class centuries for Surrey, a record for the county, Sangakkara narrowly missed out joining the distinguished company of Australian Don Bradman, Englishman Charles Fry and South African Mike Procter who have made six centuries in a row.
Despite the ICC Champions trophy being around the corner and the ODI series between England and South Africa currently on, it has been difficult for the English media to keep Sangakkara’s master class batting performances out of the news. He started his record breaking run with 136 against Lancashire, followed by 105 against Warwickshire and 124 (n.o.) against Hampshire before celebrating the unveiling of his portrait at the Home of Cricket – Lord’s by scoring a century in each innings (114 & 120) against Middlesex.
Following the end of the drawn contest against Middlesex, Sangakkara told BBC Sport: 'You try to fight the inevitable but you need to get out while you're ahead. It's the last time I'll play a four-day game here at Lord's. I'll be 40 in a few months this is about the end of my time in county cricket.”
Even before the dust had settled on that twin centuries at Lord’s, Sangakkara was on the road towards rescuing Surrey from a disastrous start stroking his way to an imperious double century against county table leaders Essex. Thanks to Sangakkara’s monumental innings Surrey recovered from 31-5 to post a healthy 369. In the second innings too Surrey had to rely on Sangakkara’s experience to escape with a draw after being reduced to 177-7. The elegant left-hander was well within reach of joining the likes of Bradman, Fry and Procter with six consecutive centuries when he was dismissed for 84 in the second innings.
Nevertheless the season is not half over yet and more batting records are expected to tumble before Sangakkara finally bows out. He is already the leading run-getter in English first-class cricket this season with an aggregate of 876 runs from 5 matches (8 innings) at an average of 109.50 that includes 5 centuries and 2 fifties.
Sangakkara’s one-time former teammate, current Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews said of his exploits: "He's just a freak. He keeps scoring hundreds and hundreds. He's got the Surrey record as well and I'm pretty sure he's going to break many more records in his last season."
As any cricketer will tell you all the runs you score are not worth the effort if it does not help your team to win the title. Helping Surrey win the Championship will be the best farewell Sangakkara can give the county. Surrey are currently lying second, a point behind Essex.
