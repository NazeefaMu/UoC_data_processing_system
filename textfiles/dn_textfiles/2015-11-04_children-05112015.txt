[Children]-05.11.2015

Feel the life
Dear Children,
Ask your grandparents about their early days. Ask them how they spent their leisure time. So how is your life different from that of your grandparents? The answer is not as complicated as today's busy lifestyles I suppose!
Unlike the days of your grand parents, today the society has changed a lot. Due to the advancement of science and technology many new technological devices have come up. Out of all these, the most significant devices are those that link people with each other irrespective of where they live.
Through electronic mail, Facebook, Twitter, Skype or through any other similar communication mode you can be in touch with anyone of your choice. Isn't it strange that sometimes we communicate often with those who live far away from us, with these new devices, but fail even to talk to those who live close to us? Social media has changed the lives of billions of people across the globe. You too are among them. Sometimes we spend hours on facebook or other social media. When the entire day or your study hours are spent on social media, you will end up as a failure. You won't be able to live up to the expectations of your parents.
Similarly when you are trapped in a digital world you will hardly get time to appreciate the things that are around you. You may not get time to admire nature, the greatest source of inspiration for great writers, poets and philosophers. Have you ever walked on a lush green meadow listening to the songs of birds and enjoying the sight of trees laden with flowers. Have you ever been close enough to a water fall to hear the music of the water as it glides down a rock. These are the best ways to feel the pulse of nature. So if your parents accuse you of spending too much time on Facebook or Twitter, remember that it's for your own good.
Bye for now, Aunty Sanju
Elephant
The elephant is perhaps the strongest and the largest wild animal in the world. The elephants can, however, be tamed and trained to serve their masters.
The elephant has four legs which are fat and long like pillars. It has two large ears like big fans, a long trunk, but a short tail with a tuft of thin hair at the end. Its eyes are small. The male elephant has two long teeth known as tusks. It lives on leaves, stems of banana trees or small soft plants, grains etc.
There are two categories of elephants: Indian and African. African elephants are bigger than their counterparts. The elephant is an intelligent animal. In ancient days, it was used in war or hunting. Now-a-days, the elephant can be seen in a circus show or zoo. There are tamed elephants who obey their masters. An elephant is also used in the woods for pulling big logs of timber from one place to another. The elephant generally lives for more than one hundred years. It is a good friend to mankind, if it can be properly trained for a particular purpose.

My father is my superhero
Ben Ten, Superman, Spiderman... there are tons of them. But for me, my father is my superhero. I chose this topic to thank my father for his love, for playing a major role and influencing my life.
Amma says the first word I said was 'thatha'. The happiest moment everyday in my life is when he knocks at the door in the evening after returning from office. As he enters there is so much excitement. He hugs me, kisses me and carries me on his shoulder as if we are meetings after ages. Several times in a day he says 'I love you Arjun'. He is my inspiration. He guides me like a lighthouse guides ships. He has always been a good listener, understands me, trusts me and advices me.
Every evening we play games together. Thatha teaches me to be powerful, self-reliant and courageous. We have dinner together. Sometimes I demand to have dinner out, and though he is tired and hates hotel food, he would take me out cheerfully, cracking all jokes on the way. He teaches me the importance of family bonds and sacrifice.
When I am sick, he will be with me throughout my illness. When amma scolds me, he will always say - my son - he is the best, he is the winner. He has never scolded me till date.
He has taught me many valuable lessons on positive thinking. He never says 'no' for anything. He has made me set my goals and every night before I sleep. He says, love everything in this universe and the universe will give you back everything you desire. Those who don't believe in superheroes have never met my father. Even when I am all grown up, I know, that I will be glad that I have my own, unique, superhero and best friend. He is the one and only one who can make me smile in any circumstance. He is my father.

My ambition
Man should have some ambition in life. When I will grow up, I want to became a soldier to serve my motherland. That is my ambition in life.
Among my friends, some want to become doctors, engineers, lawyers, or professors. But I want to become an army personnel. Why? Because I consider myself brave, disciplined, healthy, and perfectly fit to become an army man. I am already doing cadetting to achieve my goal.
I enjoy the parade or the long march, and love to hear the war drums and the bugle during my training. The uniform encourages me. As I stand in front of a mirror, I see in my mind's eye my future adult self as an army officer reflected in the mirror.
A soldier has to be a patriot. He has to be an honest fighter who should not care for his own life to save the freedom of his motherland. A good soldier is adored by all. He is a dedicated soul for the great cause of protecting the integrity and sovereignty of his country. He must be a complete man with sound health, strong body, and a clear and broad mind. He is the pride of his countrymen.If a soldier wins in a war, he becomes a hero. If he dies in the war, he becomes a martyr. Thus he is worshiped either as a hero or as a martyr. I wanted to be remembered like that even after I die.

Memories
Memories are of many types, some harsh and some soft like feathers. We love to be reminded about good memories because they sooth our minds.
One such memory is of childhood. It affects our matured life so our childhood has to be nurtured properly. Some peoples take advantage of poor children by giving them harsh work to do which are beyond their capability and strength. Children are innocent. They do not know good or bad. They do not believe in divisions. They find their happiness in things like toys, rain, marbles etc.
When our childhood is tarnished, it affects our personality when we grow up. The childhood has to be nurtured of both the rich and poor children. So let us take action and make sure everyone has happy childhood memories.
