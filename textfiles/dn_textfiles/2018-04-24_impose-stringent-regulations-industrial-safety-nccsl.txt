Impose stringent regulations on industrial safety - NCCSL

The industrial committee of the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka will soon carry out a study with regard to industrial safety and hazard rules and regulations in factories.
They will also provide recommendations to the government to avert possible tragedies, similar to the recent Horana rubber factory ammonia gas incident. Speaking to Daily News Business, President National Chamber of Commerce Sujeewa Samaraweera, stressed the need for the government to impose stringent rules and regulations in relation to industrial safely at least to control any possible events of this nature.
Samaraweera also noted that Sri Lankan industrialists should take moral responsibility towards workers as well as the environment when they conduct business operations at factories. “This is not a matter of rules or regulations; this is about their moral responsibilities towards workers and environment.”
Noting that Sri Lanka has seen a rapid increase in industrial hazards in the recent past, Samaraweera pointed out that it’s a common scenario most of the time that both employees and employers in factories are reluctant to follow given safety instructions in Sri Lanka.
“It is the responsibility of employers as well as the employees to adhere to certain safety rules and regulations, when it comes to performing their tasks at factories,” he noted.
