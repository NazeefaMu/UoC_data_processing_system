Make peace,  make jazz

Wow! Just wow! Wycliffe Gordon was recently in the island! I mean this guy is as big as Beyonce! He is an American jazz trombonist, arranger, composer, band leader, and music educator. He also sings and plays didgeridoo, trumpet, tuba, and piano. Daily News managed to catch up with Gordon and spoke all about his love for music.
“When I visited Germany in October 1989, the wall that stood between West Berlin and East Berlin, it was still there. So I went to one of the check points, to learn about the history. So I could appreciate what we as the human race have had to endure throughout history in many different cultures. And I was in Germany for around five days. So we were staying in the hotel and I felt the discrimination. I mean if looks could kill!! I thought they hated me because of my brown color. Later on in the tour I came to understand that that was not it at all! They were simply not happy with the relations they had with America! So it was an American thing and not a black and a white thing! Then when I played at a concert, some of the same people were there and they were not frowning! They were smiling! They were laughing and singing! They were dancing! And to this date I have never forgotten that image. I saw firsthand how music can make everyone happy! And how it can make us celebrate! The same people who seemed to be disgusted with me and who looked like they did not want me to exist – they were smiling!,” said Gordon.
And that was a day Gordon never forgot! He feels that one important issue when it comes to music is how you reach the people. When you reach people they come to your concert and feel better about life. Gordon pointed out that the music they have shared gives them a wonderful feeling.
“I am here with my band to celebrate 70 years of Sri Lanka’s independence and the great relationship Sri Lanka has with the United States. So I was called over here to basically to do what I love to do and that is make music. As many have before me, I am here as an ambassador playing jazz from the United States. So this is all about promoting world peace which is basically what jazz is about. It is something that unites people. So I was called by the US embassy to come over here. And I was really elated about coming here,” said Gordon.
Gordon grew up in a household with music. His father studied classical piano and performed in Church. So his family heard a lot of classical music such as Piano music. And Gordon attended church and heard a lot of gospel music. Gordon listened to the radio but did not hear Jazz until he was 13 or 14 years old.
“I took an interest in jazz in 1980 when I was thirteen, while listening to jazz records inherited from my great-aunt. The collection included a five-LP anthology. I fell in love with the music of New Orleans. That was what kind of caught my ear. A lot of my colleagues listened to the popular jazz of that time. I was listening to the classics such as Louis Armstrong and Fletcher Henderson. That was my introduction to jazz and little did I know it would consume my life and become something I loved doing,” said Gordon.
Gordon loved music but also loved to do sports. But given the choice between playing football and doing band in High School, he discovered he loved music much more.
“I was introduced to it by my father who always had music in the house. At age 12 I started playing my first band instrument – the Trombone. So this continued throughout junior high school, high school and college. I am a former star of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra and the Wynton Marsalis Septet. Then I pursued my own career as a soloist and I taught at universities and brings me to where I am today,” explained Gordon.
Gordon still performs, teaches, compose, arranges and has his own publishing company and record company.
“Learning about music has been great and learning about the business side of music is also great. So now I am in Sri Lanka with my own band, and I am having a great time. I have always performed alongside some really great band members. I have really received a lot of encouragement in life by the people that matter. So there was nothing I thought I could not do. First and foremost in the beginning of my formative years, as a teenager I was really influenced by people who touched my life. You may get moments where you will be discouraged by anything – things you see in the world. I have always kept my mind open and when I was growing up in music I never thought there was anything I could not do. When I left the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, it was difficult at first, but I wanted to try everything I learnt as a composer. I did not have anything to feel anxious about. I have had very supportive parents, and my band director always told me that I could do anything I put my mind to, and those words never left me. So I have just kept on going,” pointed out Gordon.
Gordon spoke of music as a Universal language. He loved sports and playing football, but at an early age he saw the effect music had on people. He is thrilled that now he is traveling to places that he had only read about.
“Making music is a wonderful feeling. It is never about the applause. We love music because we also like people to enjoy what we are doing. I am always trying to read my audience keeping in mind – Berlin. When it comes to music, you see people at war, suddenly unite and sitting side by side, listening to music. So I thought to myself – Wow! This is the power of music. You are welcomed! Now music is a part of who I am and what I do,” added Gordon.
Gordon’s message to any young person is to find out what you love to do and just do it. Gordon wakes up each day just loving the fact that he is going to do what he loves to do. There is something great about that. Coming to Sri Lanka he was well received by us. And that really makes him positive. And that comes out in the music. He has gotten a really great vibe by Sri Lankans.
“I love it here in Sri Lanka and I have been here before and coming here again gives me a really different perspective and it is a good feeling I get. So you just need to seize the opportunities you get in life. I just like dealing with people. The music that came from that humanitarian Louis Armstrong was just full of love. He had a great influence on me. That was why people loved Louis Armstrong. He knew the people did not know any better because there was a lot of racism at that time. He gave everything and did not hurt anyone,” stated Gordon. Gordon believes the best of people. He believes in us. They will remember Sri Lanka for a long time to come.
The great Wycliffe Gordon and his International All Stars toured Sri Lanka in February staging performances and master classes in Colombo, Galle, and Matara, bringing the best America has to offer.
