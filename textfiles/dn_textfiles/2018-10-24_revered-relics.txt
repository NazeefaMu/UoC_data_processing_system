Revered  relics

Mahamevna Meditation Centre will exhibit and deposit the sacred relics of Siri Indaka Saman Sathbudu Pagoda at the Bandarawela branch on November 18 from 8 am to 10 pm. The Bandarawela branch was opened by Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thera as a part of the Mahamevna network in 2007. Located 10 kilometres off main city, the centre is home to local as well as foreign resident monks. The Meditation Centre organizes programmes on Buddhist teachings and meditation courses for the foreign resident laity. Siri Indiaka is a deity associated with Mount Namunukula. The pagoda will contain the relics of the Buddha as well as Arahants such as Venerable Angulimala Thera.
