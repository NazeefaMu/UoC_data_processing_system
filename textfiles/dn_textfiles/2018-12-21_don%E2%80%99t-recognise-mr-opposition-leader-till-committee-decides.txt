UNP, TNA MPs request Speaker :
Don’t recognise M.R. as Opposition Leader till Committee decides

Several UNP and TNA MPs had submitted a letter to Speaker Kau Jayasuriya on Wednesday (19) requesting that the Speaker refrain from recognising Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Leader of the Opposition until a committee appointed decides on his eligibility to hold this post.
Speaking to the Daily News Minister of Labour, Trade Union Relations and Social Empowerment Daya Gamage said the letter signed by several UNP and TNA members had been handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
Those who signed the letter were Daya Gamage, Ashu Marasinghe, Rohini Wijeratne, N.P. Colonne, N.S. Thaufeek, Ranjan Ramanayake, Jayampathy Wickramaratne, Palitha Range Bandara and TNA-MP M.A. Sumanthiran.
The letter states that Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected to Parliament in August 2015 from the UPFA to represent the Kurunegala District.
However Mahinda Rajapaksa and several others had obtained membership of the SLPP on or around November 11th 2018. It also notes that neither Mahinda Rajapaksa nor any of the other members who obtained membership of the SLPP had denied it.
“The very fact that Mahinda Rajapaksa and the several other Members of Parliament have joined the SLPP would amount to the cessation of their membership of the political party on whose nomination paper their names appeared at the time of their becoming members of parliament.”
The MPs in their letter claim that the continued presence of Mahinda Rajapaksa and other members in the House is an infringement of Article 4 of the Constitution. Therefore, these MPs had requested that the Speaker appoint a Committee consisting of 11 members who would investigate the eligibility of Mahinda Rajapaksa and others who had obtained SLPP membership, to hold their positions as MPs and present a report within two months of the first sitting.
However, speaking to the Daily News, UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said that he had also written to the Speaker confirming that Mahinda Rajapaksa and others are still members of the UPFA. However, he said nothing had been mentioned in the letter about them obtaining membership of the SLPP.
