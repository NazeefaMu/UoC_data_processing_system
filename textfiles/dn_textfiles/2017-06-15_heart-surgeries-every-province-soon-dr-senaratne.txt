Heart surgeries in every province soon - Dr. Senaratne

The government will establish mini heart surgery theatres (cath labs) in every province, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
‘‘We are in the process of establishing a cardiac catheterisation laboratory in every province. This will help minimise the out of pocket expenses of heart patients while reducing the waiting period for surgeries, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said addressing the Sri Lanka Heart Association’s 17th Annual Academic Sessions held in Colombo recently.
Dr. Senaratne said the Health Ministry spends a large percentage of its Rs.85 billion budget to provide free services for interventional, surgical and medical management of cardiac patients in Sri Lanka.
He said the government’s efforts in fighting non-communicable diseases or “life style diseases”, such as setting up of healthy life style centers islandwide, introduction of traffic light systems of control for sugar, salt and trans-fats, restrictions in tobacco and alcohol marketing will also help in mitigating this trend.
‘‘Cardiology services are available in all major hospitals with the appointment of consultant cardiologists to all provincial and district General Hospitals,’’ he said.
‘‘We are also in the process of revising the procurement procedures to ensure a continuous supply of stents, balloons and catheters to ensure smooth running of the newly setup chain of cath labs.
“It is also my wish to upgrade the national cardiology unit at NHSL,’’ the minister said.
