SLIM Brand Excellence Awards today

The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) is hosting the 16th SLIM Brand Excellence Awards at the BMICH today (November 21). This year's theme “Exhibit Your Masterpiece” will once again shine the spotlight on the importance of branding in creating a competitive edge in the marketplace. The highly anticipated event will recognize popular brands vying for awards across 13 hotly contested categories.
The Brand Excellence Awards are the highlight of the year for Sri Lanka's brand marketing fraternity. An honour well-earned, as they have the distinction of being the only awards ceremony in the country which recognise brands and the contributions made by brand custodians towards their success.
This has led to brand managers taking great pride and interest in participating in this event.
