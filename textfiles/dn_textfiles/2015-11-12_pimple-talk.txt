Pimple-Talk !

In today's Beauty Talk Hasini Gunasekera of International Academy of Beauticians answers to Tn'C queries on causes of acne and prevention tips.
Q: Why do we get pimples?
A: The exact cause of acne is not known, but hormones called androgens can play a role. Androgens increase in both boys and girls during puberty. Androgens make the skin's oil glands get larger and make more sebum. Androgens also can increase because of hormonal changes related to pregnancy or starting or stopping birth control pills.
Genetics may also matter. If your parents had acne, you may have inherited that tendency.
Some medications can cause acne.
Cosmetics that have a greasy consistency may also clog pores. Water-based products are less likely to cause acne than oil-based makeup.
Other things that can make acne worse include:
* Picking or squeezing blemishes
* Changing hormone levels in adolescent girls and adult women two to seven days before the start of the menstrual period
* Stress
Pimples are mostly common in teenagers but today we see pimples in adults as well.
Adult Acne
Stress or changes in your hormone levels can be a main cause.
Teenage Acne
Almost all teens get acne. It happens when an oily substance called sebum clogs pores.
Pimples usually pop up on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders. Acne isn't a serious health risk, though severe acne can cause permanent scars. Acne can also damage self-esteem.
Q: Is there any permanent remedy for pimples?
A: Excess sebum secretion of skin is the primary cause of acne. Therefore there's no permanent remedy for pimples. But cleanliness will be a great support in reducing the possibility of having breakouts.
Q: What are your best tips for taking care of pimply skin?
A: Ice
Ice can be used to quickly reduce the redness, swelling and inflammation of pimples. It helps in improving blood circulation to the affected area, and in tightening the skin pores and removing dirt and oil accumulated on the skin. You can use ice cubes or crushed ice, whichever is convenient.
Tea Tree Oil
Tea tree oil is excellent for treating acne and pimples. It has antibacterial properties that help fight the bacteria that cause these skin problems.
Plus, its soothing properties help reduce the redness and inflammation of pimples. It also helps dry out blackheads and whiteheads.
* Just dip a cotton ball in tea tree essential oil and dab it on the affected area. Rinse your face after 15 to 20 minutes.
Note: Steer clear of tea tree oil if you have sensitive skin.
Lemon
Another quick way to get rid of pimples is the use of lemon juice, which is rich in vitamin C. Lemon juice helps pimples dry up faster. Be sure to use fresh lemon juice and not bottled juice, which has preservatives. Dip a clean cotton swab in fresh lemon juice and apply it to the pimples before going to bed.
Q: Acne affected people should not go for facials. Your advice?
A: For those with oily skin, a facial massage with creams or moisturizers is not advised,but anyhow facial treatment for oily skin includes deep cleansing with very mild exfoliation, toning, mask and use of high frequency machine. The masks and other procedures help remove excess oils, shrink the pores and make the skin soft.
However a facial must be performed under a well trained beautician to avoid any problems that can be caused by the improper choice of product and process.
Q: Dermatologists recommend oil-free soap for those affected with acne. But beauticians usually recommend different types of face wash? Which option should one stick to?
A: It's important to wash your face each night to remove the surface oil and makeup that can contribute to acne, but you don't want a cleanser that strips your skin of all its moisture because if the skin is too dry, it will actually produce more oil to further complicate acne.
A product that is capable of cleansing gently without irritating your skin and it's oil-free, soap-free and hypoallergenic is best suited for acne prone skin.
Q: Any remedy to get rid of adult acne?
A: Taking sufficient rest and drinking plenty of water is important. If acne is not settling, best to get advice from a dermatologist.
Q: Usually oily skin can lead to acne flare-ups. However acne can be seen on dry skin as well. Reasons?
A: If you're struggling with dry skin, and acne, then in all likelihood your skin-care routine is the major cause of the problem. Using drying soaps or harsh scrubs, overdoing cleansing, applying toners with alcohol or other irritating ingredients, not using lightweight moisturizers, and not taking proper care daily all add up to a disaster for your skin.
Your skin simply cannot survive the neglect, the wrong skin care routine or overdoing things can cause skin to be both oily and dry. The products you use matter a lot!
