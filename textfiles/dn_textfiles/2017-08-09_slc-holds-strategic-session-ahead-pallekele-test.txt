SLC holds strategic session ahead of Pallekele Test

The Sri Lanka team, it’s High Performance and Specialist resource team, the national selectors and officials of Sri Lanka Cricket spent a productive afternoon in Colombo today (Monday) at a strategic session aimed at recouping and regrouping ahead of the 3rd Test starting in Pallekelle on August 12.
Players, resource staff and officials alike shared in an open discourse with respect to technical, strategic, medical, psychological and personal data and requirements of individual players, as well as the team, states an SLC media release.
Speaking during the ‘Brain Storming’ session SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala commended the players for their fight back against India in the second innings of the SSC Test, and advised them to believe in themselves as a talented and capable team of players.
“We have some of the most talented players in the world, and you prove this in bursts. We also have some of the best cricketing knowledge and intelligence available in our resource and support team, so I advise you to use the science and strategic resources to make these performances consistent,” Sumathipala said.
Head coach Nic Pothas, trainer Nick Lee, and physio Nirmalan Thanabalasingham made presentations with respect to sports medical and injury management as well as training and workload management explaining and expanding on the ongoing process. The two of them also reiterated that each individual player should be given the time and confidence to establish themselves, their personal strategy and their role in the team in order to perform to their full potential with consistency.
Speaking on behalf of the players Test captain Dinesh Chandimal and former captain Angelo Mathews both noted the technical and psychological support and resources being provided by SLC, and the individual talent of each player. They further noted that the strategic and scientific training plans implemented by SLC are paying dividends but would need more time to show definite results in game situations. They thanked SLC and the selectors for their continued faith and support even in the face of public pressures.
Former Sri Lanka captain and mentor Aravinda de Silva also addressed the team, encouraging them to have confidence in themselves and play to their strengths. He further advised the young players to focus on their talent and capabilities, giving their best for their country and to not be discouraged by extraneous elements that seek to demoralize them via social media and gossip sites.
Chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya noted that with the correct roadmap and procedures in place, tangible, positive results were a matter of time and requested everyone to stay focused and remain positive with the 2019 World Cup as their singular goal.
Sri Lanka are currently facing what is perceived to be a ‘slump’ in their performances and ranking, as it invests in rectifying a series of administrative and strategic missteps over the past several years.
Sri Lanka dominated the cricket world since 1996 to 2014 in all three formats of the game, however a lack in strategic investment in areas such as injury and player management during this time has resulted in a longer than anticipated re-building period after the retirement of several senior players.
The ‘slump’ is a cyclic phase experienced by every great cricketing nation, and has been witnessed with Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand and even India two years ago. The elected administration of SLC has prioritised the identification and rectification of these key areas and has over the past year invested in the best technical and professional resources for the national team, which together with a structured and effective action plan will in time lead Sri Lanka back to its rightful place on the global cricketing arena.
Cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha closed the session by reminding everyone that Sri Lankans are not only some of the most talented and intelligent cricketers in the world, but are one of the most resilient, strong and courageous people who have always strived for greatness, and invited every passionate cricket lover to stand behind the team with patience and belief as One Team One Nation.
