Stage set for talents

Chokolaate Centrestage 2018 returns for the third consecutive year on October 26 at the Bishop’s College auditorium. Auditions in the solo singing, group singing, band, rapping and beat boxing categories will be held on September 29. Those between the ages of 13-21 are encouraged to visit the Chokolaate Facebook fanpage for details on the application process and deadlines.
Established in 2006, the Chokolaate Magazine has come a long way over the last few decades. The main objective behind the launch of the magazine at the time was to create a platform that highlights the talents of the younger generation and also provide more opportunities where teenagers from all over the country are allowed to showcase their blossoming talents. Centrestage is its second endeavor after the immensely successful Chokolaate Mother daughter Fashion Designer Contest that concluded for the ninth time this year.
This year hoping to further reach the youth of the nation, Chokolaate will host a series of Open Mic performances for singers, rappers, stand-up comedians and poets. The first event was held on August 21 from 6:30pm onwards at Tea Talk and saw an array of fresh new talent being unveiled setting the stage for applications for the upcoming talent show.
