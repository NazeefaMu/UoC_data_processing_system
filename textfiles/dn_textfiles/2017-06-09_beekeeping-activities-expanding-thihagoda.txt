Beekeeping activities expanding in Thihagoda

Thihagoda Vidhatha Resource Centre has successfully initiated beekeeping projects in the division at the moment.
According to project officers attached to Thihagoda Vidhata Resource Centre, these development programmes have commenced at Grama Niladhari division level in the Thihagoda Divisional Secretariat area. They are in progress in the Akkarapanaha Grama Niladhari division. Most members of low-income families are successfully engaging in them.
As an encouragement for beekeepers, resources such as bee boxes and masks will be given free of charge to them.
In addition, measures have been taken to provide them with training, instructions and the technical know-how relating to bee-keeping. Considering the progress, programmes will be extended to the rest of the Grama Niladhari areas in the Thihagoda Divisional Secretariat Division. More members of low-income families are also expected to be employed through this, project officials said.
Economic empowerment of low-income families through these projects is the primary objective, project officials added.
