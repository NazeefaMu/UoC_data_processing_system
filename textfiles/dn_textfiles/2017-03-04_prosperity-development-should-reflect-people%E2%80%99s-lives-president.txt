Prosperity of development should reflect in people’s lives: President

Every government should give prominence for people’s essential requirements; food, housing, health and education. Low income families have to face many problems due to politicians who work for their private agendas without identifying matters of priority, said President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President vested the second phase of the ‘Laksanda Sevana’ Housing complex in Salamulla, Kolonnawa in the public on Thursday. The housing complex consists of 396 houses.
“The beauty we see in new roads and stunning high rise buildings should also be seen in the lives of the people. Though physical development pleases the eye, it is useless if its unable to beautify the lives of the people,” he said.
“The objective of the current government is to economically boost the people in the country.
The development of every sector has now been expedited.
The government will succeed in showing great progress in all sectors, including housing, urban development, agriculture, education and health,” the President said.“Some groups engage in protests with many allegations levelled against the government.
Even some media channels see only the bad side. I request them not to bring destruction to the country by over using their democratic freedom and rights,” the president added.
The Laksada Sevana housing scheme costing Rs 1,188 million, will be given to 280 families in Sedawatta and Wadullawatta to those who were displaced due to the construction of the new Kelaniya bridge parallel to the old Kelaniya bridge.
The Laksada Sevana housing scheme was constructed parallel to the Divisuru Purawara which was implemented by the Urban Development Authority under the guidance of the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development to improve facilities in urban areas in the Colombo city with less facilities. Each house comprises 450 sq. ft. with a living room, two bedrooms, kitchen, balcony and sanitary facilities.
Expansion of the road system, construction of community centres and development of the infrastructure facilities will be completed parallel to the construction of this housing scheme.
The President opened the housing scheme by unveiling a plaque and inspected the Laksada Sevana housing scheme.
President Sirisena symbolically handed over the keys to several recipients of the houses marking the event. Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Lakshman Kiriella, Arjuna Ranatunga, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna and dignitaries including the Japanese Ambassador participated.
