Dilhara Fernando recalled at 36 to play against Aussies

 
Sri Lanka’s dearth in their fast bowling stocks has forced the selectors to include 36-year old former Sri Lanka quick Dilhara Fernando in the playing eleven of the SL Board President’s team for the 3-day practice match against the touring Australians commencing at the P Sara Oval today.
Fernando who has been overlooked for national selection since 2012 with the exception of a fleeting appearance against India in a T20I in February this year still plays first-class cricket for SSC in the Premier League and has 315 first-class wickets at an average of 30.28.
Fernando leads a trio of fast bowlers who are largely inexperienced and includes Moors SC left-arm fast bowler Vimukthi Perera and Nisala Tharaka of current Premier league champions Tamil Union.
Test all-rounder Milinda Siriwardana leads the team that includes exciting players like top order bat Shehan Jayasuriya, and all-rounders Dasun Shanaka, Chaturanga de Silva and Asela Gunaratne who have all represented the country in one format of the other.
Madhawa Warnapura, a prolific opening bat for Bloomfield like his father Bandula Warnapura – Sri Lanka first Test captain also finds a place in the eleven.
SRI LANKA BOARD PRESIDENT’S XI: Madawa Warnapura, Osanda Fernando, Manoj Sarathchandra (wk), Asela Gunaratne, Shehan Jayasuriya, Milinda Siriwardana (captain), Dasun Shanaka, Chathuranga de Silva, Nisala Tharaka, Vimukthi Perera, Dilhara Fernando. STANDBYS: Lasith Embuldeniya, Chamika Karunaratne.
