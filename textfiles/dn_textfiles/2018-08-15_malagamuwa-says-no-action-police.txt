Death threat to his life:
Malagamuwa says no action from police

Dilantha Malagamuwa has lodged a complaint at Police Headquarters on July 08, regarding a threat to his life. He alleged that no action had been taken by the police to investigate the threats made on his life.
However, when contacted by the Daily News, Police Spokesman Superintendent of Police Ruwan Gunasekara said the DIG had forwarded the complaint to the Kelaniya SSP through the Western Province Senior DIG for full investigation. The allegations are that the investigations were not being done by the police, he said.
“When I inquired from the Kelaniya Police, they said that they had on several occasions tried, but had not been able to obtain a statement from Malagamuwa, as his house in Battaramulla had been closed and they were unable to contact him by phone as it was non-responsive.
Somehow, I managed to get in touch with Malagamuwa and I connected him with the DIG in order to facilitate investigations,” the Police Spokesman said.
According to police sources, the threat to Dilantha’s life is over a land dispute of a tea estate in Mathale, where a former Kelaniya provincial politician had given a contract to kill Dilantha to an underworld member currently in prison. It is said that the contract to kill Malagamuwa had been given to underworld figure Kosgoda Tharaka, the Police Spokesman added.
SP Gunasekara said that the investigations are now underway regarding the threat to the life of motor racing champion Dilantha Malagamuwa.
