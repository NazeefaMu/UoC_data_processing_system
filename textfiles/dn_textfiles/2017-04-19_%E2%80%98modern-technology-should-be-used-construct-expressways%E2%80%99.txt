‘Modern technology should be used to construct expressways’

Sri Lanka should use modern technology to construct express ways without creating environmental hazards in the country, SLFP Youth Front Chairman and former Parliamentarian Shantha Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday.
He said expressways should be constructed on concrete columns. The Central Express Way from Colombo to Kandy and many others are to be constructed in due course. “If the modern technology is not used, the country would become a desert soon,” Bandara said.
Bandara said the Country is still using old technology to construct express ways. He said paddy fields and marsh lands were filled with the soil excavated from mountains that resulted in environmental hazards.
