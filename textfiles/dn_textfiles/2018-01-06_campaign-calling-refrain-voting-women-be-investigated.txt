Campaign calling to refrain from voting for women to be investigated

Political campaigns urging voters not to vote for female candidates, especially in the Eastern and North Western coasts, have come under the scrutiny of the Elections Commission.
“We received a serious complaint from the Eastern Province, wherein Pudukuduirippu, a female candidate stated that she had been prevented from coming to hand in her nomination. We are carrying out an investigation into it and a special police team has been sent to ascertain details,” said Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya.
He was addressing a media briefing at the Election Secretariat, yesterday.
In a separate incident, complaints were made to the Election Secretariat that in Puttalam, certain parties had used loudspeakers from religious institutions asking people to not vote for women.
“We are watching these regions closely,” said Deshapriya, who explained that two teams would be sent on January 8 to ascertain details of the situation in these areas. District officers are also studying the areas closely and are expected to inform the Secretariat if additional security is needed for female candidates in certain areas.
“If there are any barriers preventing the freedom to vote, the Elections Commission will not hesitate to postpone elections in these areas,” said Deshapriya.
The police have also launched a hotline 0113024884 to lodge complaints regarding intimidation of female candidates.
Deshapriya noted that it was futile to ask for women candidates to be defeated under the new system. The 25 percent quota ensures that 15 percent of the First Past the Post (wards) list have female candidates be nominated whilst 10 percent be voted in through Proportional Representation (PR).
The wards with the First Past the Post system have only one candidate representing each party and thus the voter votes for the party and not a specific candidate on the ballot paper. This would ensure that any female candidate nominated for such a ward, automatically wins if her party wins. With wards under PR, more than one candidate would contest and it is up to the party to recommend the members to this ward, based on whether they qualify or not. Here, the Elections Commission has the power to inform parties to nominate more women if the relevant party has not been able to elect enough women through the First Past the Post system.
