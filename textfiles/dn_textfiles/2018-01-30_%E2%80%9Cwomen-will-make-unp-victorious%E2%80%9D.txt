“Women will make UNP victorious”

The Lak Vanitha United Front and women in Tissamaharama electorate have come under one umbrella to give the biggest-ever victory to the UNP at the forthcoming local government elections, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He was addressing an election rally at the Tissamaharama bus stand.
He said that never in the history of an election have women been so active in politics as today.
It was the leader of the UNP and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who brought women to the forefront in local government bodies.
“I have been vested with the duty of raising the economic and social conditions of the women in the Hambantota district,” the Minister said. “There was an era when women were confined to the kitchen, but today they have broken that barrier and come to the forefront in various spheres.
The sole intention of the women who contest the forthcoming local government elections is to create a free and just society without corruption and malpractice.”
The Minister said Tissamaharama electorate is one of the fastest developing areas under his leadership.
He said he would solve the burning problem of to jobless youth in Tissamaharama before the next Presidential Election.
