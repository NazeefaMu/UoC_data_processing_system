Citizens' Mail

Whither are we, as a nation?
If we consider our progress for the last 60 years, we cannot be happy.
Financially, our country is not in a stable good position. This is not a secret. The government is telling that we are in a debt crisis.
Our GDP is very low compared to a country like Singapore.
Our salaries are very low compared to other progressive countries.
What has happened to our industries? Can we be happy?
Did we have peace and harmony in our country during the last 40 years? What is the position now?
Have we been able to settle our disputes satisfactorily?
All these failures indicate one thing. There is something wrong with our values. About 50 years back, we respected our teachers and our native doctors. We respected our religious leaders. We respected our politicians who were doing a real service to the country. They never came to politics to earn money or accumulate wealth.
See what has happened today. We respect people by looking at the luxury car they are using. The bracelet they are wearing. The luxury houses they have. A number of foreign trips they make. The mobile phones they use.
Take an actor or actress. We respect her or him from their outer look. The perfumes they use. Their makeups. The expensive dresses they wear. We do not value their real talent.
We must understand that our values define us.
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is not an act. It is a habit.
