Hathuru without Hathuro will be the one to watch

Our recent failure at the P Sara Oval against Bangladesh will still leave a bad taste in our mouths, it may even look spineless to the experienced reader, but for those who have played the game even at school level should understand the appalling pressures a fairly rookie side like us had to face.
Armchair critics will go to town and paint it with rainbow colours. Therefore one can go to the extent and say “only by complete non participation do we have any chance of retaining our self-respect.”
By the time this article is out, already the first ODI would have taken place.However it would be interesting to look at this narration of how Bangladesh qualified for the quarterfinals of the 2015 World Cup, on 9 March 2015.
England won the toss and elected to bat, skipper Morgan thought that the wicket and the atmospheric conditions would suit swing bowling, opened with James Anderson, one of the best swing bowlers in the world.
He did not disappoint, his skipper, he swung the ball away late, to the Bangladeshi top order, resulting in danger man Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayess nicking to slips and getting out early, both were gone for two runs apiece. Mahumudullah and Sarkar avoided further damage to the Bangladeshi innings by batting sensibly and consolidating, they put on 86 invaluable runs together, and then a Chris Jordan bouncer got Sarkar out caught behind for a well compiled 40. In walked Mustfiqur Rahim, the pocket rocket arguably the best batsman in the side then, he gave support to the inform Mahumudullah and started turning things around in favour of them, Rahim was cheeky he cut good length balls past point for fours and slog swept the English bowlers at will, Mahumudullah the more orthodox in approach kept piling the runs to reach a well-deserved century, a first by a Bangladeshi player in a World Cup, but he was unable to extend his innings further, getting run out to a brilliant piece of fielding by Chris Woakes, a direct hit! He scored 103 off 138 balls; soon after, Rahim who was going great guns at the other end, fell at 89 off 79 balls, Broad got him caught by Jordan, their partnership produced 141 rapid runs which were invaluable to the team.
The English bowlers came into their own at the death, to restrict Bangladesh to 257 for 7 at the end of their innings. James Anderson bowled best for England capturing 2 for 45.
England were confident of passing the Bangladeshi total which was gettable and started with Ian Bell and Moin Ali, Ali went for the bowling from the word go and played some streaky shots and at 19, a terrible misunderstanding between the two batsmen and Ali was run out. Alex Hales newly installed to the side walked in and did not last long, caught behind off Mortaza the skipper, who bowled well, Hales contribution was insignificant. Bell was subdued at the other end, finding runs difficult to come by, and Rubel Hossain who was the fastest bowler from both sides got one to lift and Bell went caught behind edging. Hossein with his tail up bowled two bouncers to Morgan the new man in, he managed to get out of the way to the first one but got hold of the next one and what looked like a six was magnificently taken by Shakib Al Hassan in the deep. Root came and went edging, and England was 163 for 6. In came the danger man Butler, who was showing his class not only as a pinch hitter but batted with responsibility.
Just as he was taking England towards their goal with a half a century under his belt, unfortunately Taskin Ahmed had other ideas and bowled a beauty and he edged it and he was gone, the game tilted towards Bangladesh but Chris Woakes, showed aggression and had other ideas. But the other end was exposed, and Rubel Hossein bowled two reverse swinging balls knocking the stumps of both Broad and Anderson, Bangladesh won the match and qualified for the quarterfinals and their crowd was jubilant. Mahumadullah was the “Man of the Match.”
Even at that time Bangladesh was coached by Chandika Hathurusingha. It was mentioned in some quarters that if “Hathu’ had his say in team selection, he was confident of winning the World Cup for Bangladesh in 2015. Hathurusingha’s name is splashed across newspapers in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at present and everybody wants him to coach Sri Lanka.
His coaching at Bangladesh has been outstanding for some time and he deserved all the praise that was lavished upon him. Chandika Hathurusingha if he makes up his mind to take up the job of coaching Sri Lanka, he might clear the kitchen first cause too many cooks could spoil the broth.
I feel that Chandika Hathurusingha has all the ingredients such as tactical insight, man management skills, a firm chin, endless patience and a powerful set of lungs to become one of the best coaches in the cricketing world.
