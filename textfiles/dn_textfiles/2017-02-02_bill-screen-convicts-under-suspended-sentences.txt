Bill to screen convicts under suspended sentences

Prevention of Crimes Ordinance to be amended :
Fingerprinting for new offences:
Cabinet this week approved a bill which would amend the Prevention of Crimes Ordinance to allow the police (through a court order) to keep under supervision an accused in a case of a suspended sentence, if he has a proven previous conviction until the expiry of the suspended sentence.
The proposal made by Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe will be gazetted soon and presented to Parliament for approval. The amendments also sought to make provisions in the Ordinance to obtain fingerprints for new offenses by including them in the relevant schedule.
At present fingerprints can only be obtained regarding offences which are already listed in the Ordinance.
The Minister in his proposal had also stated that his predecessor in 2014 had also submitted a proposal to amend the Ordinance to allow those accused in new crimes to be fingerprinted before the trial. He explained in the Cabinet memorandum that the need to amend the Ordinance had risen as the gravity of new crimes included in the legislation needed to have those accused fingerprinted to confirm their identity and facilitate their supervision.
