Accordingly, China Merchants Port Holdings issued the ‘One Belt One Road’ corporate bonds at a coupon rate of 5.15% a year for a term of three years to qualified investors and shall be entitled to adjust the annual coupon rate at the end of the first and second year after the issue of corporate bonds.
