Labour Ministry to spend Rs. 500 m for development of Sabaragamuwa Province

The Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Ministry plans to spend Rs. 500 million allocated from the budget for the development of the Sabaragamuwa Province to address the needs of the public.
Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said he is expecting to get more funds from the President for essential development projects of the province. He was participating in a meeting held in Sankapala, Embilipitiya. The Minister said all development activities of Sabaragamuwa Province would be implemented with the aid of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) members elected to local government bodies and added that they would also be the village-level representatives of the President.
He further said that the UPFA has a clear vision, plan, and a process of developing villages through local government bodies. Therefore, it is useless to elect members from a party with no clear vision and plan for local government bodies.
“Nobody can destroy the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), but a group SLFPers is attempting to destroy the party by forming the Pohottuwa party,” the minister said. Minister Seneviratne added that the Pohottuwa party Chairman G. L. Peiris has no ability to identify the real needs of ordinary people and that he doesn’t have the ability to take practical decisions. The minister also questioned whether the Pohottuwa party has a policy.
All members of the Pohottuwa party are attempting to fulfil their wishes by marketting the popularity and people’s attraction of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
