Laggala new town construction work faulty

Although construction work on buildings underway in the Laggala new town, that would accommodate state institutions removed form Laggala to make way for the Moragahakande and Kaluganga reservoirs, are nearing completion, they are threatened of destruction before their opening, said Matale District Parliamentarian and Laggala UNP Chief Organiser Rohini Kaviratne.
She expressed this sentiment when she visited the Laggala new town to inspect buildings which are being built by the Mahaweli Authority, following representations made to her by the public in the area.
Kaviratna said when preparations were made to erect the Moragahakanda reservoir, scientists and experts from nearly five foreign countries who visited the area on an inspection of the site had advised to abandon the project, but the President relaunched construction work. It would be undertaken with the use of new technology to prevent any damage. But she wished to record her opposition to this proposal. Now that the Moragahakande reservoir project was at its final stages of completion, it would become the hill country Tsunami Catastrophe, unless new technology was used to secure it with the use of new technological innovations.
Although she had discussed this position with the President, he had confirmed that State institutions would be shifted there soon. However, many buildings now under construction by contractors and the Mahaweli Authority officials had already shown signs of cracking.
