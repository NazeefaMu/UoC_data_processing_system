Don’t be explicit just say Oochikapips!

I explained in a recent journalism lecture last week how euphemisms are usually employed to avoid saying anything controversial or indiscreet and can be really witty and out-and-out comical at times. From classic literature to movies and from boardrooms to drawing rooms, euphemisms are extensively used everywhere when talking about politics, sex, violence, or any other topics that are deemed as taboo or inappropriate in civil society.
What’s more, euphemisms can make your dialogues more poetic, add a certain amount of sophistication to them and make them sound more proper and right. Euphemisms are an easy way to express oneself in a nice way without hurting or shocking anyone. It helps people master the skills of polite conversation better. Today you don’t call a person who had over-imbibed ‘a drunken sot’. A drunkard will be described as ‘convivial’ or ‘cheery’.
‘Unbearably garrulous’ is ‘sociable’ or the dread ‘ebullient’. ‘Lively wit’ means a penchant for telling cruel and unfunny stories. ‘Austere’ and ‘reserved’ mean joyless and depressed. Someone with a foul temper ‘did not suffer fools gladly’. ‘Uncontrollable appetites’ of all sorts such as indulged in by most of our politicos and their sycophants may earn the ultimate accolade: ‘They lived life to the full.’ Such euphemisms are a pleasant echo of an age when private lives enjoyed a degree of protective discretion that now seems unimaginable in Sri Lanka.
That left room for ‘a confirmed bachelor’ - a homosexual - or someone ‘burdened by occasional irregularities in his private life’ the benefit of the doubt. It left the reader guessing whether the problem was indecent exposure, adultery or cross-dressing. Besides the homosexual label is now taboo and a polite expression would be ‘Batting for the other side.’ All right now, the proper word for second-hand such as ‘a used car’ now is ‘pre-owned’.
Yes certainly pre-owned is a polite way of placing more value on an object and making its present owner more comfortable. But don’t ever dare to be so crass as to apply the term to a divorcée, a widow or a woman separated from her husband. Now that would be what is referred to as a dysphemism the opposite of euphemism.
The ultimate dysphemism was spewed out regularly by an obnoxious newsman nicknamed ‘The Duke’. He could not resist yelling rudely whenever a mature grand dame passed by his desk with: “Panchikawatte, Parana Badu!” He was nicely put in his place by one of the more fiery ‘dragon ladies’ who fired back: “Naaki hujjakkuwata no start other than a crank start.” She alluded to him as a vintage rattle-trap who needed a crank start.
When ‘old’ goes with wine, we think good vintage. With furniture, we think antiques, and might even smell the polish. With painting, we think of the great Masters. When ‘old’ goes with money, we think upper-crust establishment and the aristocracy. But when ‘old’ goes with a person we’re on different terrain. Yes the word ‘old’ does seem to have negative connotations.
We’ve arrived in the use-by-date domain. Just as the ‘young’ and the ‘new’are valued for having spent less time on the planet, so the ‘not young’ and the ‘not new’ are devalued. It’s a short step from devalued to demeaned. Meanwhile, the caption alongside a new beauty product – ‘Age Less’ - feels less like a noun or adjective than an imperative verb.
No, no one ages these days in the geriatric sense. Many of us may be elders and referred to as elderly, but there are no ‘oldsters’. And heaven forbid if you use some of the more disrespectfully offensive terms such as old fogies, geezers, crones, grumpies, antiques or senile, decrepit and fossils. No none of those nasty terms should be in usage unless you want a smack on the kisser by some of the more feisty ‘Recycled Teenagers’ as we call ourselves.
The term ‘veteran’ is not a bad one. And what’s wrong in labelling the grander-ones among us as ‘Silver Surfers,’ ‘Golden Agers’ and ‘Goldies.’ Still, it’s not all bad news. Agatha Christie once said she loved being married to an archaeologist. As she got older, he appreciated her more.
But euphemisms can also be benign, even necessary. Sometimes the need to prevent hurt feelings justifiably takes precedence over clarity. For instance all living monuments to adulterous relationships are not called ‘illegitimate’ or B******s. They are termed ‘Offspring on the wrong side of the blanket.’
Politically correct euphemisms are among the most pernicious. Good and bad become ‘appropriate’ or ‘inappropriate’.
A ghastly problem such as a constitutional crisis becomes a less alarming ‘challenging issue’. No, no politicians the world over are all Honourable men and they never lie. They are simply, ‘economical with the truth.’
Of course my favourite area for euphemisms deals with that ever popular recreation that is a combination of procreation and sensation that has led to the foundation of the human race. Yes, in a culture that still has trouble dealing with this topic, euphemisms abound. Just look at some of the ways we can talk about having intercourse. The more polite terms for it range from: ‘The birds and the bees,’ ‘Acting like rabbits’, ‘Making love’ to, ‘Getting it on’, ‘Hanky panky’, ‘Cheeky time’, or ‘Making Whoopee.’
Thanks to some people it is frowned upon in company to even say you are going to the toilet. The most common is ‘going to the loo’. People also use such expressions as ‘taking a pit stop’, ‘test the plumbing’, ‘spend a penny’, ‘Sprinkle tinkle’ and I love the one women use ‘I am going to powder my nose’. After all, euphemisms are unpleasant truths wearing diplomatic cologne.
All right then but why do we anglicized Sri Lankans favour the American and British terms for even a simple act as going to the bathroom. When my parents berated me for openly saying ‘I want to pee-pee’ or some such ‘crude’ term in company when I was six, I decided to coin a term for it.
It is a euphemism even the grandkids use today and given by the family’s disparate global locations will soon find its way into the Oxford Dictionary. Okay all you Sri Lankans take my cue while heading for the toilet: Don’t be explicit, just say ‘Oochikapips!’
