Has coach Ford gone on vacation or quit?

Following the Sri Lanka cricket team’s return to the country on June 14 from the ICC Champions Trophy there has been a lot of speculation going around that head coach Graham Ford has quit his job and gone home to South Africa.
With the Sri Lanka Cricket hierarchy in London attending the ICC meetings there is no way of confirming whether Ford has actually left or gone on vacation.
However SLC vice president K Mathivanan who is looking after the affairs of SLC at the moment said that Ford has not indicated anything about quitting his post in writing nor has he made any official commitment towards that end.
“Ford as we are aware has gone on vacation for a week to South Africa and we expect him to be back by next week for the start of the Zimbabwe series,” said Mathivanan.
“It is common practice that Ford goes on a vacation after a tour and this is nothing new.”
The speculation comes from a news report that Ford did not leave with his minimum travel gear but with all his bags and that too after having a long talk with the SLC hierarchy following the Champions Trophy.
Sri Lanka won only of their three Group B matches (against India) losing to South Africa and Pakistan and failed to qualify for the knockout stage.
Mathivanan pointed out that Ford cannot just leave without informing his employer SLC giving sufficient time as per his contract because he is contracted till the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
