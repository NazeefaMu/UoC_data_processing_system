Lalith, Anusha seek bail; applications to be heard today

Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita sought bail from the Colombo High Court through two bail applications.
They were sentenced to three-years’ rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million TRC funds.
Two bail applications were filed before the Colombo High Court through their lawyers and these applications are to be heard today before High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
On September 7, Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC over the controversial ‘sil redi’ (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
On a previous occasion, the two accused filed appeal petitions, challenging the judegment of the Colombo High Court.
