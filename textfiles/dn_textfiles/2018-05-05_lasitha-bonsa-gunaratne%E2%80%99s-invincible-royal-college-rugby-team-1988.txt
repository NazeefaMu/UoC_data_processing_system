Lasitha 'Bonsa' Gunaratne’s invincible Royal College rugby team of 1988

When the Royal team of 88 whipped
All their opponents, one asked,
“Of all rugby teams, is this the best team that’s ever been?”
For 15 players played and 16 matches won, Is no mean feat you know my son?
And so we set our Daily News scribe
To see what was the best side
Which was the best team ever?
A question that comes up frequently during the Bradby season (the ‘Bradby’ needs no introduction to the rugby community, but for the record, it is the pinnacle of Sri Lanka rugby; a two-match affair between Royal and Trinity). The Royal College team of thirty years ago in 1988, was it the best team ever? The answer is a big ‘yes’ according to many Royalists, as well as Trinitians. The Royal team of 1988, led by inspirational leader Lasitha ‘Bonsa' Gunaratne, won the league and the knock-out tournament. They beat Trinity in the first leg 24-0 (Colombo) and 13-0 in the second leg (Kandy).
Royal’s season extended to include a two-match tour of Hong Kong. The Royal boys of ’88 won both games under ‘Bonsa’ Gunaratne beating Stanley Fort Military Academy (37-22) and Hong Kong Combined Schools team (8-6), and thereby remained unbeaten over 16 matches. That’s a very rare achievement for a school side in a Sri Lanka school’s rugby season, and a record that remains to-date.
Spectacular number eight, ‘Bonsa’ Gunaratne’s team, won the Bradby Shield in ’88 after losing to Trinity three years in a row from 1985-87. Gunaratne’s team also added the knock-out title (that time, it was the Premadasa Trophy) to the trophy cupboard of Royal College for the first time, after Isipathaana had won the knock-out championship in ’86 under Chandana Deepthi, and Tyrrel Rajapakse’s Trinity ‘lions’ won the second edition in ’87. The ‘Pathana’ team of ’86 and the ‘lions’ of ’87 were also champion teams, as were the Thomian teams from ’89-91.
Thus the ’86-91 period saw six champion teams from four different schools. That the Thomians remained unbeaten from ’89-91 is a remarkable feat. Was the Royal team of ’88 the best? It is a difficult call, because, on the one hand, it is a matter of perspective, and on the other hand, it depends on the analytical lens one uses. The Royal team of ’88 is definitely up there with the very best, and to many it is the best team ever. Is it the best team of all Royal teams? Definitely yes. Zulki Hamid’s Royal boys of 2002 were another remarkable lot; their 83-0 record against Trinity would surely stand the test of time, yet they were not an ‘all-conquering’ side, whereas ‘Bonsa’s’ team of ’88 won all their matches.
They beat Dharmaraja (34-0), Vidyartha (36-9), Ananda (18-3), St. Peter’s (19-3), Isipathana (24-9), S. Thomas’ (10-9), St. Joseph's (17-4), Zahira (42-0). In the Knockout tournament for the R.Premadasa Trophy - quarter finals Royal beat Wesley (13-11) in the semis beat Ananda (11-6), and final beat Isipathana (13-0).
In the Royal team of ’88, the forwards were formidable. Heavy prop forwards Mahima Wijesinghe and Madhawa Chandrasekera were granite-hard, while reliable hooker Niroshan Jayasinghe hooked well against his counterparts throughout the entire season, ensuring an abundance of possession. The two second row forwards Janoda Thoradeniya (vice-captain of the rugby team, and captain of the Royal basketball team in 1988) and Thilina Balasuriya were excellent in the line outs and in loose play. Alfred Hensman and Ruwan Jayasuriya, the two flankers constantly rattled the opposition and tackled them to a standstill. Skipper Lasitha ‘Bonza’ was a tall, powerful and highly mobile number eight, with great footwork.
Royal had a sensational three quarter line that year and they were simply outstanding. Chanaka Seneviratne and Sanjeeva Abeysinghe formed the halves combination. The Royal team of ’88 was unfortunate to miss-out on the services of exceptional fly-half Druvi Perera, who played rugby in Australia before returning to Royal in 1986. Perera, in his early teens, even played fly-half for CR & FC ‘sevens’ team. But, as fate would have it, he had to hang his boots early into the ’87 season, due to injury. Sanjeeva Abeysinghe was no Druvi Perera.
But Abeysinghe had his own bag of tricks, and was exceptional in his own right. Royal’s three-quarter moves often ended in tries through centres Anura Dhammika, New Zealander Bruce Cameron, wingers Somesh Selvaratnam, Tilak Silva and full back Shantha Fernando, joining the line forming the overlap. Fernando also had an outstanding season with his fine kicking boot slotting over many penalties and conversions being a footballer himself scoring over 130 points thus becoming the highest points scorer in that season. Royal’s quintessential captain of ’88, Lasitha Gunaratne played as a prop forward in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987 for Royal College along with his elder brother Roshan Gunaratne.
Lasitha also represented CR & FC as a young boy playing as prop forward, at the age of 17. He was up against veteran club players such as Norman Silva, Hafeel Marso, J.K. Shanthikumar, Ali Sabri, Ravi ‘Python’ Wijenathan, K.M. Navaratne, Sidath Nagahawatte, Razali Noordeen, Saman Jayasinghe, Hisham Abdeen, Nalin de Silva, Rex Anthony, Panda Wijeratne, Ajantha Samarakoon, Palitha Siriwardena and late Parakrama Samaraweera to name a few, yet came out successful against them in the end. ‘Bonsa’ is the youngest player to captain CR at the age of 22, and also the first CR & FC rugby skipper to captain in three different years in 1992, 1993 and in 1995 as well. He also captained the Sri Lanka under 19 sevens team in the Roslyn Park seven a side tournament in England in 1988, and played for the Sri Lanka national under 24 team in 1987. He was recruited to the senior national team while still a schoolboy at the age of 18 to play as prop forward in the Sri Lanka national fifteen a side team in the 1988 rugby Asiad.
Winners take chances.
Like everyone else they fear failing,
But they refuse to let fear control them.
Winners don't give up.
When life gets rough they hang in
Until the going gets better.
Winners are flexible.
They realize there is more than one way
And they are willing to try others.
Winners know they are not perfect.
They respect their weaknesses
While making the most of their strengths.
Winners fall but they don't stay down.
They stubbornly refuse to let a fall
Keep them from climbing.
Winners don't blame fate for their failures
Nor luck for their successes.
Winners accept responsibility for their lives.
Winners are positive thinkers who see well in all things.
From the ordinary they make the extraordinary.
Winners believe in the path they have chosen.
Even when it's hard,
Even when others can't see where they are going.
Winners are patient.
They know a goal is only as worthy
As the effort that's required to achieve it.
Winners are people like you.
They make this world a better place to be.........
(Dedicated above to the 1988 Royal College victorious leader Lasitha 'Bonsa' Gunaratne, from his entire 88 rugby team mates).
