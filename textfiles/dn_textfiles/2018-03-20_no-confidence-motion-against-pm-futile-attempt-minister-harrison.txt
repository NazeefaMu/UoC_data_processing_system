No confidence motion against PM a futile attempt - Minister Harrison

The Joint Opposition’s no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be rejected by a majority in the Parliament, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison said yesterday. Harrison also said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s talks on toppling the government is easier said than done.
Minister Harrison made these observations at an event held to distribute agricultural equipment to farmers at Nachchadoowa, Anuradhapura.
Asked on the comments made by former President Rajapaksa to foreign media on toppling of the government, Harrison said this is not the first time such groundless statements have been made. “Sometime back also Rajapaksa said that this government will be toppled in two months. Two months have gone by now. It will not be as easy as they think it would be.” Harrison said.
Asked on the no confidence motion set out by the Joint Opposition, Minister Harrison said no UNP MP has or will sign the no confidence motion. “They are bragging about all kinds of MPs who are going to sign this no confidence motion. But they have got the signatures of only forty or so. No one else has signed it. They don’t have a majority. So it is very clear that this no confidence motion is rejected by the majority.” Harrison pointed out. He also said that they are aware of Sri Lanka Freedom Party members signing the said no confidence motion. However, Harrison expressed his confidence, saying that the government still can secure a majority without them. “No need to be agitated by such a move.” he added.
“This is not a one party led government. We have a coalition government with number of political parties in favour of it. So we must work together as a team. That is the responsibility of every partner. If they cannot be supportive, they should leave the government and hold on to their own opinions. That is what is proper. Criticizing the government while being partners of it, is a shameless act.” Harrison also said.
When asked about the Treasury bond issue and the involvement of Former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran, Minister Harrison said that all those who are involved in corrupted cases will be brought to book despite their loyalties.
Asked on the recent Local Government Election, Minister Harrison said, President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed to the SLFP and UNP to work together and establish power in certain LG councils. “Several more political parties have agreed to support us. Accordingly, the government will be able to secure power in most of the LG councils.” he explained.
Minister Harrison also said that the government will learn from lessons and move on to win the Provincial Council election. Asked on the fertilizer subsidy, Minister Harrison said farmers were not in favour of the limitations brought by the government, and said he is ready to amend them over time.
