Govt cannot be toppled by dashing coconuts: Mangala

 
Referring to the coconut dashing rituals practiced by the joint opposition, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said that this only shows the bankruptcy and lack of political foresight by those loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Samaraweera in a lighter vein said if former President Rajapaksa wants to learn about how to topple governments he should consult him instead of engaging in futile exercises such as coconut dashing.
He said that acts like coconut dashing goes on to show the desperation and the lack of political stability within the Rajapaksa group.
Samaraweera noted the above replying to queries by the media after opening a private business enterprise in the Kurunegala.
