TNA to make final decision on NCM today

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) will make a final decision on the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) at 10 am today.
TNA Leader R.Sampanthan met his Parliamentary group on two occasions yesterday, one prior to meeting President Maithripala Sirisena and one after, but the group could not arrive at a final consensus on both occasions.
It is learnt that opinion has been divided within the alliance with regard to opposing the NCM and though the leadership has asked that they vote against it, several other partners had proposed that they abstain from the vote.
TNA MP D.Siddarthan speaking to the Daily News, however stated that it is likely that most would vote against the NCM.
TNA sources revealed that Sampanthan and Mavai Senathirajah had met the President in the morning and thereafter, the TNA leader together with the Parliamentary Group met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at a separate meeting.
At the meeting with the Prime Minister, they had put forward several demands in exchange for their support today and it is learnt that the Prime Minister was agreeable to them. The TNA had asked that the Prime Minister provide them with a written assurance. The latter had agreed.
Siddarthan in the meantime also noted that they could not support a motion brought forward by the Joint Opposition; a group which has always been against the Tamil cause. “Another question we have is, even if the motion is passed, who will be the next Prime Minister? We cannot vote to pass this without knowing that.
The Prime Minister has not been against us and unless we know who will be the next Prime Minister, we cannot support this motion,” he said further. The TNA has 16 MPs in Parliament.
