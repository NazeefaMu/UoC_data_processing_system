MR’s suitability to hold Opposition Leader post
COURTS SHOULD DECIDE ON MPs PARTY MEMBERSHIP - SPEAKER

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that whether a Member of Parliament belongs to a certain party or not is a matter for the courts of law to determine.
The Speaker said that he will not intervene to decide the party membership of any MP.
The Speaker had made the above observation with reference to arguments on the suitability of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to hold the Opposition Leader post.
The UNP and TNA objected to appointing Rajapaksa as the Opposition Leader alleging that former President Rajapaksa’s Parliament seat has fallen vacant as one month had lapsed since he ceased to be a member of SLFP after obtaining the SLPP membership.
The Speaker pointed out that he followed the Standing Orders when he announced that Rajapaksa would be the Opposition Leader.
“Parliamentarian R. Sampanthan is a mature and respected leader who always thinks about the country. It is not in my purview to decide on the party membership of any MP. It must be decided by the courts,” he noted.
The Speaker had made the above comments during a meeting with multi-religious representatives on Wednesday at the Speaker’s Official Residence.
