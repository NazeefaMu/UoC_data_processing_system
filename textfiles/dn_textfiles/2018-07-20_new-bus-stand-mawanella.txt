New bus stand for Mawanella

Fulfilling a long-felt need of the people of the Mawanella area, steps were taken to construct a new bus stand at the Mawanella town by the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council.
The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council allocated Rs. 70 million for the construction of the new bus stand and a shopping complex. It is planned to construct the new bus stand and shopping complex at the town centre where the old bus stand is situated.
Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayake said after visiting the project area recently, that the construction work of the bus stand will be completed within a short time with modern facilities and standards.
As there is no proper holding place for public transport buses, the people face hardships especially during rainy days and sunny days.
Accordingly, a four-storeyed building providing space for shops will be constructed along with the proposed bus stand. Under this project, 80 shops at the bus stand will be removed and given proper places at the new building complex.
