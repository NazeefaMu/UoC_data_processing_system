Focus on cyber ethics - PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said cyber space had become a major platform for obtaining information and knowledge in the modern world.
“It had also become a major guide in uplifting living conditions, human development and social reform process. Resultantly new challenges are posed to human society”
The Premier added that time had come to pay attention on cyber ethics since challenges were posed to human freedom and rights and individual liberty through cyber space.
He believed that good governance should be operated through cyber space to obtain a balance between free flow of information and individual freedom.
