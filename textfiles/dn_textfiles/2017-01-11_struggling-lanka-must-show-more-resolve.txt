Struggling Lanka must show more resolve

The news that Cricket South Africa has decided to replace a scheduled tour by Sri Lanka with India in 2017-18 is certainly disturbing and should not be treated lightly by Sri Lanka Cricket.
In the words of Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive Haroon Lorgat: “I've given an indication to Sri Lanka that that tour is unlikely. We've got a very packed season coming up, starting with Bangladesh in the early season. We've got India touring for four Test matches plus five ODIs and three T20s, and then we follow with Australia for four Test matches. It's very unlikely, and I've already given the indication to Sri Lanka that they should avail themselves to someone else.”
What it means is that Sri Lanka are no longer a team that attracts spectators or sponsorships and the ongoing tour to South Africa is a clear indication of that. It is no secret that CSA has suffered untold losses during the first two Tests of the three-Test series with both matches ending inside the distance and more than a day to spare. And CSA foresees further losses in the third Test starting at Johannesburg on January 12 and in the three T20 Internationals and five One-Day Internationals to follow which on South Africa’s current form Sri Lanka look no-hopers even before the toss unless by some miracle they can turn things around.
CSA’s decision to scrap the tour there by Sri Lanka and replace them with India does not abode well for the country’s cricket future and it goes back to the days when Sri Lanka who were struggling to find their feet on the Test arena in the eighties and early nineties had to fight tooth and nail with other established Test nations for international matches.
However Ashley de Silva, CEO of Sri Lanka Cricket denied that CSA’s decision to replace Sri Lanka with another nation had anything to do with financial losses. “Following our current tour to South Africa we are scheduled to tour them again at the end of 2017 and South Africa are due to visit us in 2018. So it is too many back to back tours with one nation. According to the FTP (Future Tours Program) the tour is still on but we will discuss the matter and take a final call at the ICC chief executives meeting in Dubai next month,” said De Silva.
Even without the tour to South Africa at the end of 2017, Sri Lanka will still have a lot of matches scheduled for the year. Following the current tour to South Africa which ends on February 10, Sri Lanka’s schedule for the rest of the year is:
March – host Bangladesh for 2 Tests, 3 ODIs and 2 T20Is
May – to England for ICC Champions Trophy
June-July – host Zimbabwe for 2 Tests and 3 ODIs
August-September – host India for 3 Tests, 5 ODIs and 1 T20I
October-November – tour UAE (Pakistan) for 3 Tests, 5 ODIs and 2 T20Is.
So despite Sri Lanka’s disappointing show in South Africa where the team is still in the stages of rebuilding following the retirements of iconic players like Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan and the absence from the firing line of Lasith Malinga (recuperating from a knee injury), they have enough cricket lined-up with three series at home to enable the young ‘uns in the team to establish themselves as truly international cricketers.
Every team goes through lean phases following the retirement of top players and Sri Lanka are no exception. They have over the years gone through such periods but had sufficient replacements to bridge the gaps that existed. What is taking the current team so long is the batting which lacks discipline and resolve. This comes from a poor domestic competition where there are plenty of loose balls to score runs off, but whereas in the international circuit they rarely find one coming their way. And eventually when it comes the batsman tries to capitalize on it and in his over eagerness to score, he either plays the ball too early, mistimes it or plays a rash shot which leads to his dismissal.
The current problem the national team is facing in South Africa is with their batting which has not shown the discipline, skill and patience that is required to build an innings. The South African bowlers know it’s only a matter of time before the batsman loses his patience and goes for an expansive stroke that gets him out. So all they have to do is to keep bowling a tight line and length and test the batsmen’s discipline. The type of bowling Sri Lanka is facing in South Africa is a far cry from what they come up in their domestic matches. That is where the batsmen have a big gap to bridge. So until that hole is plugged Sri Lanka will fail to put up sufficient runs of the board for their bowlers to bowl at. It is said that the first innings of any match is the most important and in this aspect Sri Lanka has failed miserably in the first two Tests being dismissed for totals of 205 at Port Elizabeth and 110 at Cape Town, which has seen them unable to put any pressure on the South Africans at any stage of the game. Losing is all part and parcel of the game. If the present side can learn from its mistakes, that will be a moral victory for the team and its future.
