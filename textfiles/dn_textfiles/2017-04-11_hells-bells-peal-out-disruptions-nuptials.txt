Hells-bells peal out at disruptions of nuptials!

Funny moments seem to crop up at certain weddings I have been privileged to attend over the years. What makes them so humorous is that they are unexpected and aren’t supposed to happen.
In my youth I was accorded the singular honour of being chosen as the Best Man by more than a dozen bridegrooms. No small wonder then that I have seen more than my fair share of wedding disasters and side-splitting cameos enacted that set events into a whirligig of fun.
Nobody knows better than I that even the most meticulously mapped out wedding plans can turn into total disarray. All it takes is to set a tiny spark to trigger a powder-keg situation that erupts in laughter. I have been both behind the scenes and in the forefront of so many weddings and have witnessed some of the wildest and weirdest goings-on imaginable.
Now veteran Best Men such as I are hardly intimidated by any sort of hustle and bustle and are great guys to have at your side when things go wrong. All this brings me to the exciting subject of elopements and runaway brides. You see the original duty of a ‘Best Man’was to serve as armed backup for the groom in case he had to resort to kidnapping his intended bride away from disapproving parents. The ‘best’ part of that title refers to his skill with a sword, should the need arise.
As in medieval times I have twice served in this role quite admirably, sans the swashbuckling swordplay, of course. The most effective weapon in my arsenal was my rapier wit combined with a two-fisted punching ability. Now tradition has it that the Best Man stands guard next to the groom right up through the exchange of vows and later outside the newly-weds bedroom door.
As mentioned earlier I was obliged to perform the former function a dozen times with due diligence. But I desisted from executing the honeymoon suite vigil. Still it seemed like a load of fun to organise a bit of a conspiracy with the groomsmen to knock on the honeymooners’ door and announce loudly: “Room service!”
The moment the exasperated groom opened the door the entire insufferable bunch would barge in and demand that the groom join his attendants in finishing off an entire bottle.
There was the unforgettable incident when a terrified friend of mine named Gaspar made an emergency midnight call at my home. Trembling with trepidation he explained that his girlfriend’s father had threatened to fill him full of buckshot unless he agreed to marry his daughter within the week.
So the following evening, armed with a bottle of premium liquor, we paid the old boy a visit. Gaspar gasped out his request for an eight-month reprieve. Following a slug or three of the good stuff all differences were sunk and the old boy was transformed into the epitome of the convivial father-figure.
At the end of the discussion he began waxing poetic saying: “My son, my son, this will be a match made in Heaven.” Gaspar and I did not dare express our contradictory thoughts that it appeared more like a match made in the other hot place.
Yes siree, I have seen them all, from shotgun weddings to reception crashers to groom, and groomsman becoming utterly un-groomed and staggeringly unsteady as a result of the stag party the night before. It is a time in which both the groom and his retinue are all struggling with pre-marital jitters which is a completely normal phenomenon.
Just three hours before the church ceremony the groom elect, my friend Desi, suffered what seemed the worst attack of ‘cold feet’ I have ever witnessed as an attending best man. He was still tormented from the effects of his stag bash.
His two groomsmen and I could not fathom whether his anxiety was triggered by stress over the wedding planning or about the marriage itself. Yet what was abundantly clear was that poor Desi was a raging bundle of nerves. Attempting to calm himself he made the mistake of downing a couple of more shots of vodka which made matters far worse.
We were now faced with the terrifying prospect that the wedding would have to be called off. He was hardly in a fit state to walk up the aisle much less sit up straight. So we tried every trick in the book as well as out of it to sober him up.
The methods ranged from frog-matching him into a cold shower over and over again while force-feeding him copious quantities of iced water, lime juice and strong black coffee. With only an hour to go he finally threw up, regurgitating gallons of double distilled grog reminiscent of an oil gusher.
He was cold-showered again and forced to brush his teeth although he did seem still a bit groggy. He was then marinated in aftershave before we helped him slide into his tuxedo. Only the red in his eyes gave away any evidence of the ravages of the monumental binge he had suffered the night before. Except for a hysterical giggle the tension and stress appeared to have left him. He seemed well and truly unplastered.
All seemed to go well as we marched down the aisle. The ceremony appeared to be a pretty smooth affair until it came to the part of the wedding vows where Desi when asked by the priest about the ‘for better or for worse part’ giggled and exclaimed: “I’ll try!” And when asked to repeat after the priest the words ‘love and trust’ he said: “shove and lust!”
But all hell broke loose when it came for the five-year-old ring bearer to approach the couple. The whole episode seemed like a few clowns short of a circus as he then took the cushion with the ring and flung it at the little flower girl who had been making faces at him. It took a groomsman a good while to find it while crawling on his hands and knees.
He then returned with the ring and made the gravest mistake of his life by pulling the recalcitrant brat’s ear. The little bounder stepped aside and kicked his attacker squarely on his shin. Then as his adversary bent he let off with a mighty unnerving, “Hiyy-ahh!” At the same time he executed an unerring and unexpected snap-kick to his tormentor’s mid-section. And the moral of the story? Never raise your hand to a feisty kid. It leaves your groin unprotected.
You could hear the crunching sound of impact distinctly on the wedding video. A ding-a-ling-a-ling bells of hell thwack! The groomsman was now rolling around on the ground, clutching his bruised gonads, cursing under his breath and humming sweet hymns in a soprano-like voice.
