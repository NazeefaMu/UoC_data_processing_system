Our critics have  no credentials

New Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe has been compelled to face a tough state of affairs with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Union actions instigated by the Hambantota Port Agreement. All the same, the senior minister assures that the agreement with China will not compromise the country’s economic independence and sovereignty.
The original agreement, Minister Samarasinghe emphasises, has already been amended to safeguard the country’s interests. The clauses were added to enable variation of the agreement with reference to future requirements and exigencies both foreign and domestic.
Q: Several Trade Unions of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) launched a strike against the leasing out of the Hambantota Port Tank complex and Trincomalee Petroleum Tank complex to China and India. Yet, the unperturbed government gave the green light. Will this action not lead to any aggravation of the situation?
A: Initially, as a former Labour Minister, I must say that I have a high respect for Trade Unions. Throughout my public life, I have encouraged open and frank dialogue with them. They have an interesting and valuable perspective on matters of public policy and governance. When I took office as Ports and Shipping Minister in May, I took special efforts to ensure that our dialogue with the Unions was a candid, healthy and mutually respectful one.
That said it is the Government’s ultimate responsibility to ensure economic security and development. Sometimes, we have to decide what the best available option is to strengthen the economy and cater to the welfare of the people as a whole. Mind you, sometimes these are inescapable options that are the legacy of the previous era. We have to address and redress the shortcomings of yesteryear and look ahead to ensure the rights and aspirations of future generations of the Sri Lankans. That is the onerous duty cast on any responsible government. We cannot step down from that responsibility in the face of the trades unions or any other group. It is our duty to take decisions, sometimes tough ones, and make a call based on current needs and priorities.
We took a long close look at the draft concession agreement based on the framework agreement concluded last year. It went through several iterations since the beginning of the decade. We consulted stakeholders and our chosen foreign partner and we worked out the best possible solution available at the present juncture. Moreover, we kept the Cabinet of Ministers, the sovereign legislature, and the public informed of the new clauses introduced to protect Sri Lanka’s national interests. Just last Tuesday I enlightened the public by way of a media conference of the salient features of the agreement. I think this level of transparency is very rare, if not unprecedented, in modern Sri Lankan history when it comes to an agreement of this nature.
Q: Other services have also warned that they will join the CPC workers if a favourable solution would not be offered by the government. Any precaution to attend to this matter?
A: President Maithripala Sirisena has given us a clear mandate. His principle and overriding concern is not to compromise Sri Lanka’s economic independence and sovereignty. In line with the President’s thinking, we have done our utmost to safeguard the national interest and to make this vast investment a going and a viable concern of direct benefit to the people of this country. I outlined the numbers involved last Tuesday.
It is relatively easy to criticise some governmental action or another. However the pre-existing alternatives are unthinkable. The situation was rapidly becoming unsustainable. As it stood, the financial viability of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority was challenged by the huge debt burden. Now we will see a turnaround in the short space of time and the realisation of the vast potential of Hambantota in particular.
At this moment I think this is the most favourable solution that can be devised. I do not think that a debt repayment of Rs. 9.1 billion annually and a consolidated loss of Rs. 46.7 billion from 2011 to 2016 is a very favourable scenario to maintain. If the trade unions want to see the most favourable outcome, they should study the entire picture.
Q: The Opposition claims that the Government is selling out the strategically important state assets to foreign counterparts to salvage a badly managed economy. What is your response to this?
A: That is laughable. At no time did we ever agree to sell one square centimeter of territory. Indeed we have reduced the extent of land to be governed by the agreement. Those who spread these canards for their own narrow political ends are doing a great disservice to the country. The Sri Lankan people are well aware of who planned to alienate sovereign territory and what a long-term commercial lease is, by comparison. I have explained in detail the extent of the rights and obligations arising out of the agreement. Nowhere does it contemplate sale of any assets – movable or immovable. Even the operational assets will be owned by two Sri Lankan companies and will be subject to Sri Lankan law.
Q: President agreed to accommodate the demands of the Trade Union Collective by way of amendments to the Hambantota Port Agreement. Will there be amendments to the agreement?
A: As I said, there could be variations to the agreement signed by the principal parties at any point in the future. If and when any such amendment is deemed necessary, proper negotiations must be conducted with a formal consensus reached.
That is how international commercial relations work. If we, as a small island nation, wish to take full advantage of the economic and other benefits of such partnerships with international players, we have to guarantee certainty and sanctity of contractual obligations. Investors and partners look for stability as a precondition for entering a market.
We have prior experience of such arrangements being disrupted due to short-term political needs. We cannot go down that road any more if we are to be taken seriously as an investment destination and be considered a viable international partner.
Our approach must be serious, well-informed and professional. It applies to all future governments of this country.
Q: It was reported a few months back that the Government has already scaled down the Hambantota Agreement in the face of trade union protests?
A: We consulted as many stakeholders as we could. We modified the agreement in consultation with the foreign partner. I don’t think any pressure group, political formation, trade union or any other party had influence on this process. We have a vision and want to see that vision brought to fruition.
However, we are also a responsive administration in keeping with the tenets of good governance. We listened and accommodated whatever we could without compromising the letter and spirit of the overall consensus. It is no secret what we have done.
The national legislature – consisted of the elected representatives of the Sri Lankan people - is fully aware of what the scope and content of the agreement entails.
Q: You have been made to face a tough situation as the new Ports and Shipping Minister.
A: I welcome the challenge. As long as we are guided by the President and Prime Minister and their clear and positive vision for the future, I am certain that we in the administration can deliver what was promised.
After all, what we are doing today will only amount to the benefit of future Sri Lankans who dream of a safer, more secure and more prosperous future. I am happy to face any difficulty and work towards making a worthwhile contribution to ensure that dream comes true.
