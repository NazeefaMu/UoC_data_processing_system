RTC launches next race season on August 20

Due to the inclement weather, the launch of the forthcoming race season set for August 6 has been postponed to August 20.
The Nuwara Eliya race course has received 103mls of rainfall this month with 45mls this week, while further rain is predicted over the next 10 days
“Due to the continuous rain the training track has been closed for six days over the last two weeks severely interfering with the preparation of the horses for the race meeting on August 6, said CEO of the RTC Wayne Wood.
“The Thoroughbred Auction that was also scheduled to be held will also now take place subsequent to the race meeting on August 20.
“We regret any inconvenience caused but the decision has been taken with the welfare of the horses in mind which is our first priority” said Wood.
“Seven races are programmed for the meeting on August 20, for which just under Rs 2,000,000 in prize money will be distributed. The feature race will be The RTC Breeze up Auction Class 1 Handicap over 1400M. Entries will close at 10am on August 15.”
“The club is eagerly awaiting the arrival of a new set of starting gates, while the new saddling and sampling area will be completed for the races on the 20th,” said Wood . As always spectators are assured of a weekend of fun up in little England, complete with gala fashion shows, musical shows, children’s entertainment, good food, and of course, Racing at the Highest Level’.
