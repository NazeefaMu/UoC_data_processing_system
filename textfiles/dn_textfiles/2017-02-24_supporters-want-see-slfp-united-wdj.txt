Supporters want to see the SLFP united: WDJ

The time has come to save the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) shedding all differences that exist within the party, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said. According to Seneviratne, all SLFP supporters want to see the party stand united and defeat its opponent, the UNP. Nobody wants to see a divided SLFP, he said after the opening of two new roads constructed at Keeragala at Rs. 5.4 million.
"The people do not like to see SLFPers who stood together for decades blame each other over minor issues and divide. They want to see them all united. To achieve this we need to overlook minor issues and get together," the Minister said.
He said many development projects have been completed on behalf of the people spending over Rs. 65 million on road construction. The other requirements of the area will be also addressed, the minister added.
