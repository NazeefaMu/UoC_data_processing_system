Indian Govt unveils draft UDAN scheme for int’l routes

The Indian Aviation Centre has unveiled a draft scheme for extending the affordable air travel programme UDAN to international circuits, with state governments identifying the routes for operation.
The draft International Air Connectivity (IAC) scheme envisages to increase the international ticketing to 20 crore by 2027.
“The scheme is to be made operational only for states, which demonstrate their commitment to implement and provide the requisite support for promoting operations under the scheme,” the draft reads. Stakeholders inputs and comment have been sought till September 4.
UDAN was launched in 2016 to make air travel affordable for people through subsidised ticket rates and to provide air connectivity to smaller towns.
Some states and aviation leaders had earlier suggested to expand the UDAN scheme overseas.
The Assam government has, in fact, announced Rs 100 crore as viability gap funding to promote international air connectivity from Guwahati.
SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh had earlier this year pitched for an initiative on the lines of the regional connectivity scheme UDAN that can encourage Indian airlines to fly overseas.
According to the draft scheme, state governments will identify the routes to be connected, and airline operators will assess demand on the identified routes and submit proposals for providing connectivity.
