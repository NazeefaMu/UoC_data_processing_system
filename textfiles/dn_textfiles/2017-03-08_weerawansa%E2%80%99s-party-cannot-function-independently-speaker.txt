Weerawansa’s party cannot function independently: Speaker

 
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in Parliament today (8) that National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa’s party cannot function independently.
Parliamentary proceedings were suspended for ten minutes following a clash which occurred after making the statement.
MP Weerawansa requested the Speaker on April 2, last year to allow five members of the NFF to function as an independent group in the Opposition.
