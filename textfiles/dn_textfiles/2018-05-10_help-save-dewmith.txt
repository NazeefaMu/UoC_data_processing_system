Help save Dewmith

Deshaja Dewmith (16) of C 02/G 01, Himbutu Uyana Housing Scheme, Mulleriyawa is diagnosed as having a Dural Arterio Venous Fistula fed by multiple branches arising from both external carotid arteries by consultant doctors Nihal Wijewardena and Lakmali Paranahewa.
A procedure of this nature in the absence of unforeseen complications is estimated to cost around Rs. 9 million.
Doctors have decided to have the operation performed by Prof. Santhosh Joseph at the Chennai Sri Ramachandra Medical College. Accordingly, under doctors’ advice, DSA scan and reports were sent to specialist Dr. Santhosh Joseph, the professor at the Chennai Sri Ramachandra Medical College. After scrutinising scans and reports the Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre (SRMC) has said the cost estimate for the operation to be between USD 31,000 to 40,000 as medical bill excluding ICU charges. The total medical bill and expenses would be around Rs 9 m for the operation to be performed in India.
Dewmith's father has collected Rs. 3 m and another Rs. 6 m is needed to save his son's life.
