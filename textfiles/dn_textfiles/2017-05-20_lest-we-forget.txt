Lest We forget

War Heroes commemoration:
They gave their tomorrow for our today:
Thousands of valiant service personnel who made the supreme sacrifice to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka were remembered by grateful Sri Lankans around the country.
People in many areas organised religious programmes, blood donation campaigns, alms giving and commemorative events in remembrance of the valiant soldiers who sacrificed their life and limb for the country.
The National War Hero Commemoration was held at the War Hero Memorial yesterday evening under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and parliamentarians representing the government and opposition. President Maithripala Siripala placed floral tributes at the War Hero Memorial as a mark of respect to thousands of Security Forces personnel who made the supreme sacrifice for their motherland.
The War Hero commemorations were also organised by many Provincial Councils during the past few days.
The Security Forces defeated the LTTE terrorists who were demanding for a separate state. The Security Forces succeeded in annihilating one of the most ruthless terrorist outfits in the world.
The terrorists held thousand of people in the North as hostages and they were denied of their all rights. The valiant Security Forces ensured the people's right to live in the North and East by liberating the areas held by the terrorists. Their mission did not end with the victory over terrorism. They made many contributions thereafter to help build the lives of the people who were affected by the war.
The Sri Lanka Army was actively involved in resettlement of people who were displaced by the conflict and they built houses for these people. Their assistance and dedication to uplift the living standards of the people affected by the war in the aftermath of 30 years of terrorism is highly commendable and these brave men have left an indelible imprint in the hearts and minds of the people.
