Water scarcity in Anuradhapura
Tanks below 50-percent capacity

As water scarcity prevails with the ongoing drought in the Anuradhapura district, the Disaster Management Ministry and Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake had made preparations to distribute dry food ration bags, each worth Rs. 5,000, to around 70,000 drought-stricken families from July 25 onward.
Distributions that were planned for the month of May had been postponed due to lack of funds. The Anuradhapura Government Agent told the Daily News that the number of beneficiaries for rations were decreased from 149,000 to 72,000, in accordance with the criteria stated in a circular that was passed by the Disaster Management Ministry.
He added that he had planned to hold discussions with Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake, in order to increase the number of beneficiaries.
At present, around 10,000 families in the Mahawilachchiya, Nochchiyagama, Kahatagasdigiliya and Palugaswewa areas are being provided with drinking water with the use of bowsers. It had been predicted that if the district were to not receive rainfall soon, the drinking water scarcity would expanded to about 100 Grama Niladhari divisions in the Thirappane, Nuwaragam Palatha, Medawachchiya, Kebitigollewa and Padaviya areas.
Anuradhapura District Irrigation Director Prasanna Silva, upon submitting a report with regard to the current water levels of the 13 major tanks located in Anuradhapura, Rajangane, Hurulu Wewa and Padaviya, said the water scarcity was so high that Yala cultivation under the Padaviya, Wahalkada and Mahawilachchiya reservoirs had been abandoned. Only the Rajanganaya, Angamuwa and Thuruwila tanks had water levels at or above 50-percent capacity due to the additional Mahaweli water being supplied to them.
According to Anuradhapura District Agriculture Committee sources, the total acreage being cultivated utilising the 13 major tanks under normal conditions, is 7,0000 acres, whereas during the 2018 Yala season, only 30,000 acres had been cultivated with paddy and additional crops. “We have planned to request the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to provide 150,000 acre-feet of Mahaweli water to the Nuwara Wewa, Hurulu Wewa, Tissa Wewa, as well as the Nachchaduwa and Thuruwila reservoirs,” a committee spokesperson said, “There have been numerous complaints from irrigation, water supply and drainage authorities as well as farmer organisations, that Mahaweli water flowing along feeder canals to the Hurulu Wewa and Tissa Wewa, was being tapped by certain hoteliers and farmers, preventing the complete water quota from reaching the tanks.”
“This in turn, would dwindle the area of irrigable lands depending on the said tanks,” they added.
At a recent District Coordinating Committee (DCC) meeting held on July 16, Anuradhapura Government Agent Wanninayake appointed a special committee comprising of divisional secretaries, irrigation engineers, land officers and Grama Niladharis, to investigate the alleged illicit water-tapping.
