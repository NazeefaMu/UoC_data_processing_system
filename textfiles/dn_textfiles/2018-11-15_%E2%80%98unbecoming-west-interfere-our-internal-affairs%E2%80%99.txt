‘Unbecoming of the West to interfere in our internal affairs’

It is very unbecoming of Western countries to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. It is the country’s good fortune to see the sale of local assets to foreign nations halted with a change of government, the Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter, Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Mahanayake Thera said.
The Chief Prelate expressed these sentiments delivering an anusasana when Buddasasna Minister Udaya Gammanpila called on him and received his blessings after assuming duties in his new Ministry on Tuesday afternoon.
Earlier the Minister visited the Sri Dalada Maligawa and worshipped the Sacred Tooth Relic and called on the Malwatte Prelate at his temple and received his blessing too.
Ven. Anamaduwe Sri Dharmmadassi Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter said a state of political instability was witnessed in the country recently.
The ability to save the country’s assets from sale to foreigners was a most welcome move.
But it would take some time for the country to earn benefits accruing from that move.
Minister Gammanpila said some foreign countries had been enraged over the political changes which occurred in Sri Lanka recently.
Foreign countries were very powerful and as such we should not try to clash with them. We should settle our internal problems in a peaceful and amicable manner without leaving room for external inference.
He said the recent political change was effected in a very secretive manner evading the hawk eye of foreign agents operating in this country.
It was so secretive that even Shiranthi Rajapaksa was unaware that Mahinda Rajapaksa was being sworn in as the new Prime Minister, as she was attending a wedding reception at that moment.
Minister Gammanpila said the UNP received only 29.65 per cent of total votes at the recent Local Government Elections. Its opponent parties received 70 per cent of the total votes. Holding an election is the most democratic move taken by any country. An opposition should agitate only if elections were not being held.
