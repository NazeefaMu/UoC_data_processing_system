UNP created environment for women to join politics – PM

The government has created the change of increasing women representation at grass roots level with the forthcoming local elections. The groundwork for this change was laid by the UNP, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said it was the UNP which created the environment for women to join politics.
“Therefore, men and women have a responsibility of electing the maximum number of women at the forthcoming election,” the Prime Minister said.
“I assure you that other legal steps will be taken to encourage women’s voice and bring in all relevant legal enactments to give more weight to the opinion of women, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. The Prime Minister made this observation addressing a meeting of the Kotte Electorate UNP Central Organisation held at the ‘Sirikotha’ UNP Headquarters in Pitakotte on December 8. The Prime Minister said women encountered problems in both the political and employment spheres.
“In order to address them increased women representation should be ensured at the forthcoming election as an initial step towards resolving them,” the Prime Minister said.
“Although we obtained the right to universal suffrage in 1932, it was mostly males who indulged in politics,” the Premier said.
“It was the male population which was dominant in the education sector too. But this situation changed with the 1977 political revolution,” Prieme Minister Wickremesinghe said. “Today, women were dominant in the teaching, medical professions as well as state private and self employment sectors,” the Premier said. “As such, all women should join hands and support the UNP at the forthcoming election because the party would do its best to empower women both politically and economically,” the Premier said.
“Women are playing a major role in the countries three main income earing sectors, namely, the foreign employment, garment and tea producing sectors.Eventhough women constitute the bigger portion of the population they had not received a proper representation or status in the country,” the PM said. “The UNP which understood this situation raised a voice on their behalf as far back as 2010 stating that the existing system did not offerwomen their due place in society. The UNP also campaigned for minimum female representations at Pradesheeya Sabhas. The Rajapaksa regime failed to heed their request for women representations,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
“Instead of heeding this request the Rajapaksa regime honoured the chairman of the Akuressa Pradeshiya Sabha who boated about seducing 100 women.
There were thousands of women in the North and South Who had lost their husbands in the war. But, past rulers did not provide any relief to them either,” the Premier added. “The Rajapaksa regime failed to do anything to prevent harassment against women,” the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister said ensuring womens representation at future elections was one of the promises made during the last Presidential election by fielding Maithripala Sirisena as the Common Candidate. “Today, the election system has been changed to a mixture of the Ward and Preferential Votes system.
The UNP agreed to this system on the basis of ensuring 25 percent womens representation. If women did not gain enough representation through the Ward system they could be given prominence on the Preferential list,” the Prime Minister said.
