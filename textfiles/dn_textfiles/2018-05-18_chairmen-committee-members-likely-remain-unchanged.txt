COPE, COPA and Public Accounts Committees:
Chairmen, Committee Members likely to remain unchanged

The Chairmen and Members of Committees on Public Finance, Public Enterprises and Public Accounts are likely to remain unchanged.
The Government has proposed to re-appoint the same Chairmen and members to these committees at a Party Leaders’ Meeting yesterday.
The party leaders met subsequent to a meeting of the Selection Committee chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya at the Parliament Complex. However, a final decision on those appointments had not been arrived at the meeting. The new appointments will be announced in Parliament by the Speaker next week.
The COPE, COPA and Public Accounts Committee stood dissolved following the prorogation of Parliament on April 12.
During the previous Parliamentary session, JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti headed the COPE, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna headed the COPA and TNA MP M A Sumanthiran headed the Public Finance Committee. Each committee comprises 24 members reflecting the party composition in the House. The committee members in their first meeting have to agree on a Chairman.
