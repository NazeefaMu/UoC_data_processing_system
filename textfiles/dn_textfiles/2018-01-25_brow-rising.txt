Brow  rising!

Be it hair or brows, you need to understand how your hair grows and how to work with what you have, rather than trying to go with your whims. Perfectly shaped eyebrows can make a statement and are envied by many. If eyebrows really do frame your face, they had better be on point. Here is some expert advice for grooming or taming your unruly brows.
Aftercare post eyebrow threading
Avoid the following for at least 24 hours after eyebrow threading:
<U+F06E> Touching the area as the pores are open and infection can occur.
<U+F06E> Sauna, steam room and hot tubs as the pores are open and infection can occur.
<U+F06E> Swimming as irritation can occur.
<U+F06E> Perfumed products.
<U+F06E> Applying make-up to the area as the pores are open and infection can occur.
Apply a cold compress to the area if irritation occurs within the hour following a treatment.
Follow this general homecare advice as well:
<U+F06E> Apply a soothing antiseptic cream (such as aloe vera) to calm and sooth any redness.
<U+F06E> Groom the eyebrows into shape using a brow/lash brush.
<U+F06E>To maintain a nice brow shape, it is advisable to return for an eyebrow tidy in two to four weeks.
Flattening eyebrows which stick up straight
Trim your eyebrows to remove hairs that are too long and unruly. To do an accurate trim, comb brow hairs upwards towards your hairline. Use your small grooming scissors to trim any brow hairs that extend beyond the upper eyebrow line. Hold the grooming scissors at one end of the brow line and slowly follow along the brow line for a clean cut. Repeat the same steps for the opposite side.
Smooth clear mascara over the eyebrow. Pull the wand out of the tube and apply it directly to the eyebrow, similar to combing through the eyebrow. This will keep thick eyebrows in place after you have combed them into your desired shape.
Growing eyebrows naturally
1. Castor oil
Castor oil is one of the most effective remedies to boost the growth of your eyebrows. It contains protein, vitamins, fatty acids and antioxidants that nourish the hair follicles and promote hair growth.
 
2. Olive oil
Olive oil is also good for your eyebrows. Being rich in vitamin E, olive oil can help your eyebrow hair grow faster and thicker. It will also help keep it dark-hued.
 
3. Milk
You can also use milk to grow your eyebrows thicker. Milk contains protein as well as other nutrients that nourishes hair roots and improves hair growth.
 
4. Egg yolk
The hair of the eyebrows is made up of keratin protein, and egg is a great source of protein. Thus, it can help improve the health of your hair, which in turn will make your eyebrows thick.
Disadvantages of threading
 
<U+F06E> Pain
Depending on the threader’s skill and your skin’s sensitivity, eyebrow threading may be painful. Several hairs can be pulled out with one roll of the thread. If you have very thick eyebrows, eyebrow threading will involve more pulling and therefore more chances of feeling pain.
 
<U+F06E> Infection
Since eyebrow threading removes hair from its follicle, the hair follicle may get infected. Bacteria may grow in the tiny pockets left by the pulled out hair. The condition is known as folliculitis and it often appears as small, white-headed pimples around one or more hair follicles. They may itch and in mild cases, they will often go away in a few days.
 
<U+F06E> Allergic reaction
In some cases, the threader may apply some soothing lotion after threading the eyebrow. The pores are open at this time and if you have sensitive skin, you may develop an allergic reaction to it. To prevent any allergic reactions, make sure any lotion or gel used is hypoallergenic and you are not allergic to the any of the ingredients in it.
Threading tips
 
<U+F06E> Your facial hair doesn't have to be a certain length to go for threading. However, excessive facial hair threading will leave you with an irritated skin. That is the reason you should not overdo it.
 
<U+F06E> Avoid exfoliating your skin on the day of your facial hair threading appointment. When your skin is exfoliated, it becomes more sensitive with threading, and this might lead to redness.
 
<U+F06E> Hydration is the key to making your skin less sensitive before threading. Make sure to load up on water. It is a small trick you can use to prepare your skin for facial hair threading.
 
<U+F06E> Before you start the facial hair threading process, wash your face with ice-cold water! You can also massage the area with an ice cube. This will numb your skin, and will make everything a little less painful.
