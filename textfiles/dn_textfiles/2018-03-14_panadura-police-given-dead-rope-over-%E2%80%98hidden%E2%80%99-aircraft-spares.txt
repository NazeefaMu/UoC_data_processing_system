Panadura Police given dead rope over ‘hidden’ aircraft spares

Panadura South Police conducting investigations with the Kalutara District Crime Investigation Unit officials, into the stock of allegedly ‘hidden’ aircraft spare parts in the possession of a retired Sri Lanka Air Force engineer have not found any wrongdoing on the part of the engineer.
Acting on a tip-off, the police raided the engineer’s house in Alubomulla, Panadura, on Monday, and discovered the stock of spare parts of a condemned aircraft. However, the engineer, in his statement to the police, said he had purchased the condemned stocks of an aircraft belonging to a private firm by paying Rs.5 lakhs. Subsequently, he brought the stock to his house at Alubomulla from Bandaranaike International Airport. Thereafter, he had sold an aircraft part to a businessman in Ja-Ela to use at a playground. The engineer also possessed the necessary documents for the purchase.
Panadura Police could not find any evidence of misappropriation or theft in this case. Two senior officers of the Sri Lanka Air Force had also visited the scene and inspected the stock of aircraft spare parts.
Panadura Police who had summoned local media persons (not of the Lake House group) to the scene to publicise the story, found the tip-off ended in a dead rope.
