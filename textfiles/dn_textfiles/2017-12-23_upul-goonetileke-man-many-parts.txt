Whilst at Sri Sumangala I played for the under 13 cricket team and participated at the under 12, 14 and 15 age groups sports meets. My events were high jump and 200 metres. I represented my alma mater at the Western Group Meet and I was unsuccessful.

As soon as I got the appointment the Principal there appointed me as the Master in Charge of Sports in addition to my duties. During my tenure of service five athletes came up to National School Level and one athlete won an event at the National Schools Sports Meet held at Anuradhapura. From there I was transferred to Mahanama College, Panadura.
Q - Did the Principal at Mahanama assign you as the Master in Charge of Sports?
A - When I went to Mahanama there was softball cricket. I commenced an inter school softball cricket tournament for Kalutara District Schools and we won the championship. Ravindra Pushpakumara was a student of mine and noticing his talents I encouraged him to join St. John's College. Later he went onto play Test cricket for Sri Lanka. Then I started the under 15 girls and boys volleyball. In the meantime I played for the Department of Education in the State Services cricket tournaments. Some of my colleagues were Pushpa Gunathilake, Austin Fernando and Kodituwakku. From there I was tranferred to Sri Sumangala College Panadura in 1992.

Our cricket coach was Tilak Fernando. Later L. W. Somathilake took over as the Principal. During my service over there I organized the Big Matches with arch rivals Moratu Vidyalaya. We won under Jayathu Nilaweera after 21 years and again we won under Iresh Pushpakumara. Our coaches were Rohan Soysa and Sumith Prasanna. Then Dilruwan Perera and Kithuruwan Vithanage shone in the under 13 and under 15 teams and Sudesh Umayanga toured Sharjah with the Sri Lanka under 15 team. Also Lahiru Wimukthi toured Malaysia. Amila Perera represented Sri Lanka "A" team. In addition I was in charge of scouting. With the help of old boys I managed to put up the side wickets and to re-construct the grounds and to build the air conditioned cricket room. I also organized the Inter House Sports Meets. In 2013 I was transferred to St. John's College, Panadura.
Q - Were you appointed as the MIC sports over there?

Ranasinghe and the captain was Harshana Salgado. Then the present Principal Harshana Peiris took over and he kept his faith in me and allowed me to carry on. In 2016/17 we beat St. Thomas’, Matara and won the division two title under Nadun Harshana Ahangama and the coach was G. Ranasinghe. We got the fullest support and help from Sarath Jayawardene, Christoper Fernando, Upali Suraweera, Old Boys Cricket Wing and the parents. In addition Ushantha Gunaratne and Eranga Gunaratna too helped us. In addition to cricket I organized the Annual Sports Meets. I am an official of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association for more than one and a half decades and presently an Executive Committee Member and a Member of the Organizing Committee.
