Malaysia to host  ITB in 2019

ITB Berlin 2018 will take place from Wednesday to Sunday, 7 to 11 March.
ITB Berlin is the World’s Leading Travel Trade Show. In 2017 a total of 10,000 companies and organizations from 184 countries exhibited their products and services to around 169,000 visitors, who included 109,000 trade visitors. Parallel with the show the ITB Berlin Convention, the largest event of its kind, will be held from Wednesday, 7 to Saturday, 10 March 2018.
A spectacular conclusion to the ITB Grand Finale on Sunday, 11 March 2018 will be the official final event of ITB Berlin, featuring dance performances from Zambia, Malaysia and the Dominican Republic. From 3.30 to 5 p.m., together with a host of different cultures, exhibitors, guests and visitors will be celebrating a spectacular ending to the 52nd ITB Berlin.
Mary Amiri, the award-winning event and television presenter, will moderate the colourful programme of events which is traditionally organised by exhibitors.
The Kecak, a traditional dance from Indonesia, will have visitors longing for faraway destinations. It is one of Bali’s most famous artistic creations, and with its delicate hand movements the dance is also an expression of Hindu mythology.
Towards the end of the Grand Finale 2018 visitors can look forward to the ceremonial ‘passing of the baton’ from one partner country, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, to another, Malaysia, the partner country of ITB Berlin 2019.
