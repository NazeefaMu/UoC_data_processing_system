Easy? NO! Worth it?  Absolutely!


As we celebrated 'World No Tobacco Day' (May 31), it is important that we look at the implementation of the WHO-Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) which is included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that world leaders adopted in September 2015 at the UN General Assembly.
It is recognized as one of the "means of implementation" to reach the overall health goal (SDG3) and a target on non-communicable diseases (NDCs). It is a huge achievement. Governments have agreed to support mechanisms to raise awareness and mobilise resources for FCTC implementation. It is also agreed that governments should increase tobacco taxes in order to address the NCDs and tobacco epidemics and mobilize additional resources for development.
Several other achievements have been accompanied by many other commitments on health and development, including a call to set national spending targets for health, education, sanitation and other public services.
However, we have a role and duty to ensure that governments know that the world community has endorsed the FCTC and its measures, and how effective they can be.
Tobacco control advocates need to play a huge role in awareness raising - Goal3, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (3.4) and reduce by one third, premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being (3a).
The SDGs represent a global consensus on how to achieve a sustainable future for everyone. All countries are expected to be guided by the goals when preparing their plans and policies for the next 15 years.
It is important that the international community including United Nations agencies, the World Bank and regional development banks and public and private donors to assist governments to reach the SDGs
Tobacco use naturally undermines public health and sustainable development in a country. Almost 70 percent of global deaths are caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung diseases. These diseases have one major risk factor in common- tobacco use. Over 1 billion people use tobacco today and unless we take action now, tobacco will cause 1 billion deaths worldwide this century and 80 percent of this would occur in low and middle-income countries.
Tobacco use also costs national economies enormously through increased healthcare costs and decreased productivity. It is estimated that over the next 20 years, the economic loss associated with tobacco related disease will be US$12 trillion.
Tobacco use also worsens health disparities and aggravates the problem of poverty since the poorest people spend less on essentials such as food, education and healthcare.
Pricing mechanisms
In this context, there is a clear roadmap for effective, feasible and globally endorsed action. The World Health Organization's WHO - Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) has been recognised in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a critical tool to help achieve well-being for all - at all ages.
The FCTC is one of the only three international conventions explicitly referenced in the SDGs appearing as target 3a - "a means of implementation" for Goal 3.4 on NCDs.
Tobacco control is inexpensive and highly effective. At an average cost of US$.05 per person to implement in low-and middle-income countries, tobacco taxation is the least costly of all tobacco control policies. And tobacco taxation creates more revenue for governments than it costs to implement. Similarly, raising tobacco taxes is the single most effective way to reduce consumption of tobacco products and in turn it diminishes detrimental effects of tobacco use on health and development.
Globally raising the tax on a pack of 20 cigarettes by the equivalent of one dollar would increase average price by 42 percent and results in 81 million fewer deaths. Higher taxes also discourage minors from taking up smoking in the first place.
While increased tobacco taxes boost good health, they can also provide governments with significant additional revenue. It is estimated that a global increase in tobacco tax of the equivalent of one dollar would result in an extra US$141 billion in revenue for governments. The extra revenue generated by tax increases can, in turn, be used to finance other development priorities. In fact, tobacco taxes are a key tool to finance Sustainable Development Goals.
Tobacco control is also a good way to build capacity to deal with other development challenges. As a relatively simple form of tax, involving a small number of taxpayers (tobacco producers and importers), implementing and administering tobacco taxes can help pave the way for taxes on other unhealthy commodities, or for other more complicated forms of tax such as value-added tax (VAT).
Evidence suggests that the availability of single cigarettes poses a potential threat to public health because they may be more affordable and accessible than packs especially to youth and people with fewer resources. As countries implement tobacco-control policies, proven to reduce tobacco use, the availability of single cigarettes could potentially undermine the effectiveness of strong policies.
Although Sri Lanka has fully implemented Article 11 of the FCTC, since 2015, there is no evidence however, that PHWs have contributed significantly to a reduction in the consumption of cigarettes. The impact of PHWs cannot be estimated because concurrently there has been a sharp increase in the tax on tobacco products. Informal evidence suggests that in Sri Lanka very few purchase cigarettes as packets. Therefore, PHWs cannot significantly influence the reduction of smoking cigarettes, where people mostly purchase cigarettes in singles. Single sticks are often displayed, sold and consumed without consumers ever having been exposed to warning labels placed on the pack. As such, people who consume single cigarettes may be less likely to be exposed to graphic warnings. Consequently, the whole purpose of using Pictorial Health Warnings (PHW) in cigarette packets is lost.
Single stick facilitates smoking among regular youth users and may encourage youth non-smokers to experiment with smoking.
On this World No Tobacco Day, we urge the Sri Lanka government to ban single cigarette and mini pack (less than 20 cigarettes) sales as well.

The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control
The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is the first treaty negotiated under the auspices of the World Health Organization. The WHO FCTC is an evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health. The WHO FCTC represents a paradigm shift in developing a regulatory strategy to address addictive substances; in contrast to previous drug control treaties, the WHO FCTC asserts the importance of demand reduction strategies as well as supply issues.
The WHO FCTC opened for signature on June 16 to June 22, 2003 in Geneva, and thereafter at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Depositary of the treaty, from June 30, 2003 to June 29, 2004. The treaty, which is now closed for signature, has 168 Signatories, including the European Community, which makes it one of the most widely embraced treaties in UN history.
The core demand reduction provisions in the WHO FCTC are contained in articles 6-14:
• Price and tax measures to reduce the demand for tobacco, and
• Non-price measures to reduce the demand for tobacco, namely:
-Protection from exposure to tobacco smoke;
-Regulation of the contents of tobacco products;
-Regulation of tobacco product disclosures;
-Packaging and labelling of tobacco products;
-Education, communication, training and public awareness;
-Tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; and,
-Demand reduction measures concerning tobacco
dependence and cessation.
The core supply reduction provisions in the WHO FCTC
are contained in articles 15-17:
-Illicit trade in tobacco products;
-Sales to and by minors; and,
-Provision of support for economically viable
alternative activities.
