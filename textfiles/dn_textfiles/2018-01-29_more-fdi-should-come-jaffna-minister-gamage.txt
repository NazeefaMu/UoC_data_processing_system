More FDI should come to Jaffna - Minister Gamage

The Sri Lanka public sector is heavily loaded with unwanted staff and this is a huge burden to the State said Minister of Primary Industries Daya Gamage.
Speaking at the inauguration of the ninth edition of Jaffna International Trade Fair he said that when compared to India, which has one public servant for every 1,000 of its population, Sri Lanka has public servants which are one-fifth of its total population.
“They include one million who were recruited during the previous regime,” he noted.
Minister Gamage also appreciated the efforts by the Northern people to uplift their lives and said his Primary Industries Ministry has made many plans to develop Jaffna and other districts in the province.
State Minister however mentioned that the government’s efforts have been insufficient, in getting private sector contributions towards starting enterprises in Jaffna. “More FDI should come to Jaffna,” he said.
The Minister said that his Ministry has launched several programs which include distribution of five million TEJC mango plants, ensuring a market for cinnamon, pepper, turmeric and other spices and assisting in the development of the fisheries sector.
He said that this year the exhibition organized by Lanka Exhibitors (LECS) has attracted a 72 member delegation from India and the Northern entrepreneurs should try to woo them to invest in the North- East and also look at sharing the Indian technology by way of joint ventures.
“Technology and investments should be derived from Indian entrepreneurs visiting the event,” he noted.
Gamage said the exhibition has also given an ideal opportunity for entrepreneurs to kick start their business in the North.
