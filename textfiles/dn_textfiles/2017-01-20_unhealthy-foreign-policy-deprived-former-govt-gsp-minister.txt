Unhealthy foreign policy deprived former govt. of GSP+: Minister

The previous government could not obtain international support due to its unhealthy foreign policy, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He said that it was deprived of the GSP plus facility in 2010 due to the same reason and this government could obtain it as the government has been able to convince the international community that the country has a political willingness for reconciliation.
The minister was speaking at a press conference at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party auditorium yesterday. Minister Samarasinghe also said that the reluctance of the previous leader to listen to them placed the country in jeopardy. He added that he went to Geneva during the previous regime as the Human Rights Minister. He added that he kept the former president informed of the developments in Geneva but he was not ready to listen to them. “So during the last sessions I had nothing to answer to them”, said Minister Samarasinghe. “Some nations were on the verge of imposing economic sanctions on Sri Lanka as well.”
He added that it was due to this reason the former President held the Presidential election before two years of the expiry of his term,” the minister said.
Minister Samarasinghe further said that there was no condition agreed to y the government to get the GSP plus facility.
He said that a particular media had carried the news that the government had agreed to a number of conditions in its effort to get the GSP plus facility which is totally misleading.
He also said that the European Union said at a conference that the countries that were granted the GSP plus facility have to ratify only 27 treaties. “We have already entered into those treaties “ said Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe. “We also have to implement them as we have ratified those treaties.”
He also said that it was not enough only to ratify those treaties but needed to be implemented and we would be monitored continuously of the developments. He added that even the GSP plus is not a facility granted forever.
He added that the country was deprived of the GSP plus facility in 2010 and this government was able to get it back this year. He added that this zero duty facility would be applied for around 700 types of exports to countries in the European Union. He also added that according to the experts’ views the garment exports will get an extra income of US$ 2 billion within two years.
The Minister added that at the cabinet meeting the Ministers also asked the Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva, as the Foreign Minister was not present ,to explain matters in the news item on the alleged ‘conditions’ and he assured that there was no such conditions and he would submit them to cabinet if there were any. Minister Samarasinghe also said that the the proposed 2017-2021 human rights action plan was decided to be presented along with the request for the GSP plus even before it was presented to the European Union. He added that however it was not a new one. He added same was presented during the previous regime.
This proposal was presented before the Cabinet for their views. However the media had misleadingly carried the word ‘homosexuality’ which were not included in the amendments. He added that it was the view of some members that the term ‘non discrimination on gender and sexual orientation’ could be interpreted in many ways and the same was removed on the
instruction of the President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Minister also said that this action plan has proposals to protect the people’s civil and political right but also the economic and social rights too. Lakshman Seneviratne and Arundika Fernando also participated at the press conference.
