Amaraweera UPFA General Secretary

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has been appointed United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary yesterday, UPFA sources told the Daily News last night.
The UPFA executive committee decided to appoint Amaraweera as its new General Secretary at a special meeting held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena at President's House.
Minister Amaraweera is the first member of the SLFP hailing from down south to hold the position of UPFA General Secretary. Former UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha has also been appointed UPFA Deputy Chairman at this meeting. This position fell vacant after the death of Prof. Wishva Warnapala.
