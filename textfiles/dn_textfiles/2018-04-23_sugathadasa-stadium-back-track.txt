Junior trials from April 23-26
Sugathadasa Stadium back on track

After a two-year lapse the Sugathadasa Stadium is gearing up again for athletic events with the Junior National trials scheduled to be worked off from April 23 to 26. This trial will serve for selection of junior athletes who will represent Sri Lanka at three international junior championships to be held this year namely, the South Asian Junior Athletics Championship (SAJAC) 5-6 May, Asian Junior Athletics Championship in June and IAAF World Junior Championship in July.
According to the vice president of the Athletic Association of Sri Lanka (AASL) G.L.S. Perera, so far 2600 entries have been received and the athletic selectors comprising Wimalasena Perera (chairman), D.A. Jayaratne and Saman Kumara will announce the athletes who have been selected for the Sri Lanka pool on the same day.
“Sri Lanka will be hosting the Junior South Asian Athletic Championship at the Sugathadasa Stadium first week of May and we expecting a total participation nearly 200 athletes from 7 nations with India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal and host Sri Lanka having confirmed,” said Perera.
“Only Afghanistan will not be sending a team to the competition. The regional competition will serve as an ideal opportunity for the young athletes to excel at international meet,” he said.
