Uva Rhinos led by former Sri Lankan vice captain in 1990 and Assistant Superintend of Prisons Fazeer Laheer won the inaugural Signature Masters Hockey League 2017 held over the weekend at the Astro Turf.
The team, powered by Goodness of Hope, comprised of hockey legends, won against strong Colombo Dragons by a solitary goal in the second half after a scoreless half time.
C.K. Gunapala, Uva Rhino’s full back and ex-national player who represented Sri Lanka from 1997 to 2002, scored the goal off a penalty corner at 12th minute of the game giving the winning goal to his team.
The first ever Sri Lanka Masters Signature Hockey League featuring the legends, sometimes playing for the first time since they retired in 1980s was organised by Sri Lanka Masters National Hockey Association.
In the group matches, champions Uva in A group beat Colombo Wolves by 3-0 (Godwin Solomons-2, Gunapala-1), drew against both Matale Vipers with 1-1 (goal scorers: M.Maheer for Vipers, D. Abeyratne for Rhinos) and Merc Spiders (0-0) before facing the finals against the formidable group B top team, Colombo Dragons. For Uva, Pala Wijesekera, a double international who led Sri Lanka national football team from 1983-87 and represented hockey for the country in 1984-86, Asitha Dharmasiriwardhana, former Mercantile and Commercial Bank captain between 1994-1996, and K. Keerthi, former national cap from 1993-96 including for the 1995 SAF Games gave a solid defence in the middle.
Sameera Perera, 2012 Sri Lankan hockey captain and a national cap for more than a decade controlled the game beautifully at the centre with all his experience.
Manzer jahn, 1992 Sri Lankan national captain for the seven nation’s hockey trophy in Singapore, Dammika Abeyrathne, a former Sri Lankan cap between 1997-2005, Godwin Solomans who served as the forward for the national team from 1996-2002, and Asitha Wijekoon (1998 Sri Lanka Schools captain) formed a strong forward line for the champions.
M.F. Laheer (senior), ex-national cap from 1977-1984 and Shihar Aneez who represented Sri Lanka in 1996 helped the team from the back and goal post.
The runners up Colombo Dragons, powered by Hameedia won against Colombo Tuskers by 4-0 (M. Joseph, M. Gunawardena, A. Panditharathne, Ganegoda), Kandy Lions by 1-0 (Ganegoda), and Matale Panthers by 3-0 (AlHaj-2, A.Panditharathne-1). They emerged unbeaten leader in the group B.
The first Masters Hockey League’s main sponsor was Hameedia's Signature brand, a household name for men’s ready-made garments in Sri Lanka and co- sponsor is Singer Sri Lanka Ltd.
Each team was powered by individual corporate similar to IPL-style.
In Plate finals, Kandy Lions beat Merc Spider by 1-0 (Saman Wandalen). Colombo Tuskers beat Matale Vipers by 1-0 (C. Praveen) in the Bowl final while Matale Panthers beat Colombo Wolves by 2-1 (Leanus Jayasekara for Wolves, D.B. Dissanayake and M.M. Mulafer for
Panthers) to win the shield champions.
“Masters can do a major role in reviving hockey in this country if we all can get together genuinely without any political motives,” said Sarath Wimalasinghe, Sri Lankan hockey captain for the first ever Asia Cup in Karachi in 1982.
