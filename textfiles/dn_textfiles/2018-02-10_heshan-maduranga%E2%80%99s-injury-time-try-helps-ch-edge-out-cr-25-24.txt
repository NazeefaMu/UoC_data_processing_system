Heshan Maduranga’s injury time try helps CH edge out CR 25-24

CH and FC propelled by their wing three quarter Heshan Maduranga's spectacular injury time try, scored a brilliant 25 points (4 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) to 24 (3 tries, 3 conversion, 1 penalty) win over CR & FC in their Dialog ‘A’ Division League Rugby tournament second round match played at CR grounds in Longden Place yesterday, thus winning the Nizar Hadji Omar memorial trophy after eight long years. CH were trailing 17-15 at the breather.
It was CH's forwards who paved the way for this victory. The CH ‘eight’ especially Sudarshana Muthuthanttri, Yoshitha Rajapaksha, Chathura Dilshan and Sasanka Ariyaratne gave a terrific display to outplay their famed counterparts in the loose.
CR & FC were let down by their three quarters who delayed their passes which saw them being ‘nailed’ time and again by their opposite numbers and also ‘knocked on’ at crucial moments which resulted in their speedy centre Kavindu Perera being kept in cold storage but on the few occasions he got possession Kavindu made some threatening runs before he was brought down in the nick of time by a desperate CH defence.
The CR & FC outfit went in to half time leading 17-15 with tries coming from captain cum centre Kavindu Perera and number eight Omalka Gunaratne. With fly half Tharinda Ratwatte slotting in both the conversion as well as the solitary penalty.
Mean while for the CH the two tries were scored by flanker Yoshitha Rajapaksha and fly half Samuel Maduwantha. While Maduwantha put over the solitary conversion and the penalty. After the breather CH and FC surged into a 20-17 lead when their prop forward Chathura Dilshan powered his way to fall over for an unconverted try by the right corner flag. Maduwantha missed the conversion.
Soon after CR & FC grabbed the lead when their second row forward Charana Chamikara scored a try under the post which fly half Ratwatte fired across the conversion. CR led 24-20.
In the last minute of play CH won the ball from a ruck and fly half Maduwantha set the three quarters in motion and winger Heshan Maduranga put the finishing touches to the move by diving over by the right corner flag for a splendid try. Maduwantha missed the conversion but CH and FC ran out worthy winners by 25 points to 24.
