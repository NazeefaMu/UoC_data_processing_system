UNP to field its own candidate

UNP General Secretary Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday assured that the UNP will field its own candidate at the next Presidential Election.
He was responding to a question raised by a journalist at the media conference held yesterday at the Government Information Department.
Responding to the same question, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the SLFP has not yet taken a decision whether they are nominating a common candidate or not.
“People will be able to find the answer to that question in the near future,” said the Minister.
