Aussies ready to let loose ‘big four’ pacemen

SYDNEY, MONDAY: Australia are relishing the prospect of uniting their “big four” pace attack for the first time at the Champions Trophy -- and sending a message to England ahead of the Ashes.
Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson are all fit and poised to bowl together given conducive conditions at the tournament in England and Wales.
In Australia they are seen as potentially the most potent pace quartet since the mighty West Indies teams of the 1970s, ‘80s and ‘90s.
Injuries have prevented the strike bowlers from playing together in the same Australian squad and coach Darren Lehmann is licking his lips at the opportunity to let them loose.
“It’s the first time we’ve had the big four available,” Lehmann said.
“It would be great to see them go at it and see how they go. They’re quality players and we’ve got a quality squad.” AFP
