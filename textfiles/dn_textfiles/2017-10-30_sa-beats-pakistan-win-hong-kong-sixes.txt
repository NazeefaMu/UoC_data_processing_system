SA beats Pakistan to win Hong Kong Sixes

KOWLOON, Sunday: Aubrey Swanepole captain of South Africa won a last ball final by two wickets beating five-time champions Pakistan in a thrilling game of the Hong Kong Sixes at Kowloon on Sunday.
South Africa required four off the final ball and the captain led his team from the front to score that all important boundary off Sohail Khan who bowled a superb final over.
South Africa were the defending champs when the tournament was last held in 2012.
Pakistan invited to bat scored were dismissed for 123 with three balls to spare in the eight-ball five-over final with Hammad Azam scoring 41 and Sohail Khan 46. Sarel Erwee with his off-breaks picked up two wickets for 25.
South Africa’s run chase was spearheaded by their captain Swanepole who scored 38 not out after Erwee (39) and Ferisco Adams (20) had given them a good launch pad.
Sri Lanka led by all-rounder Farveez Maharoof bowed out of the Hong Kong Sixes 2017 when they were beaten by hosts Hong Kong in the Plate semi-final played at Kowloon on Sunday.
Hong Kong raced to 114 in their 5 overs inclusive of 13 sixes and Sri Lanka could reply with only 81-4 in their quota of overs with Banuka Rajapaksa making a top score of 30 and Maharoof 20 not out.
MCC won the other Plate semi-final beating Bangladesh by four wickets to set up a final with Hong Kong.
Hong Kong went onto win the Plate in a record run chase overhauling MCC’s total of 113-1 with four balls to spare scoring 116-1 hitting 14 sixes in their innings.
Overall Sri Lanka won only one match in the entire tournament against Australia by 16 runs, but lost to Bangladesh, New Zealand and South Africa in the group stage and in the Plate semi-final to Hong Kong.
Sri Lanka’s squad included Maharoof, Tillekaratne Sampath, Angelo Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Banuka Rajapaksa, Ramith Rambukwella and Andy Solomons.
