Social esteem Vs national worth

Most of the people in our country are living for themselves, for their future personal advancement, personal prosperity and security, personal economic stability and freedom, freedom from want and deprivation, and laying a firm foundation for their continued steadiness and progress. A good many are constrained to do so. These people have little or no thought of the larger society, their contribution to its necessary economic growth and political stability and community solidarity or its well-being, and fellow feeling for others that would enhance the lives of all.
It is the time that all of us cared about the values we live by before we expect others to take notice and respect our values. All could be induced to be also conscious of the environment and pollution.
VALIDITY AND VALUES OF IDEALS
This being the wide-ranging picture and state of affairs in our country, we should be asking ourselves whether we should have a set of strong and stable national values that we cherish and promote. What are the most important values, ideals and goals that most of the Sri Lankan parents, school principals and teachers hold out to their children and students under them?
Have any serious sociological investigations ever made a study of what they are, or questioned or examined their validity and value and their effect on the general character of communities and our Sri Lankan society? Is there, and if there, what are the marked differences evident in the values among the Sinhala people, Tamil people, the Burghers, the Muslims, the Malays, bilingual people and those speaking the mother tongue and English, and the people in various economic strata in Sri Lanka?
No serious and well recognized sociological, psychological and anthropological research has been done either by the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Planning or any Sri Lankan university or Research Institute. Anyway, we in Sri Lanka do not base ourselves on serious studies or research to know the real state of affairs or even to know whether the existing trends in society needs correcting or amending or furthering for the better and more acceptable ways of social integration, community solidarity, social health and stability of our national life.
If there needs to be social engineering, planned placement of sizeable groups of people in selected locations for development, that too, of course always needs to be based on objective and valid data and uphold immutable human values. Very often these are done for political gain rather than for national benefit.
This is because, politicians at the summit of national power, staid, sedate and generally unremarkable as they are, are led more by their primitive hunches of self-advantage than by any socio-economic, socio-cultural or scientific-technological studies and researches that are done or need to be done. Indeed these studies may not be done for the simple reason that they are not taken notice of by those who should take notice of them, at least to initiate a discussion that is of some use to the community. Obviously, politicians should have genuine caring for objective fact and they should have the intellectual depth to consider appropriate and in the manner, they deserve those matters that are of importance to the national community.
Unfortunately, one can observe politicians in parliament (who have got their university degrees, professional qualifications and even doctorates and others below GCE Ordinary Level and even below Grade Nine) who seem to be intellectually stunted and are anything but creative in temperament. Some have been known to have bought doctorates (!) for financial considerations from doubtful sources (!)
Our primary national values should form the base and foundation of our national social order and be the primary component of our national society. These values should guide our way of life and behaviour.
ORDER OF VALUES
In the hierarchy of the values we uphold, truth, justice and devotion to our Nation and all its people should hold the foremost place. Human dignity, fundamental rights, equality, freedom, democracy, devotion to duty and honesty are values that all of us need to uphold; they are worth striving for and they are worthwhile measurements that people make use of to assess the acceptable standards of our national life. Besides, there is honour and mutual respect, formal courtesy and social manners and social and individual esteem and admiration that are valued.
We desire many of these social values as a Nation and wish to see the most important of them clearly incorporated in the New Constitution as the general standard and the acceptable order of norms that over the years will be at the summit of the subconscious level in the minds of all the people. They will spring on to the conscious and active level when the occasion demands.
People arrange their preferences and give primary importance between alternatives according to the understanding, desirability and sensitivity they ascribe to these values. There are many who for selfish political reasons speak of these values as ‘imports from the west’ when they are called upon to explain the breach of these values when they were in power. In any case, we decry the inattention to these human values by the national authorities in our past history.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to ask ourselves whether all of us Sri Lankan people embrace these values with equal commitment irrespective of caste, creed, ethnicity, culture and gender and whether all of us without exception consider it worthwhile and ready to sacrifice things of lesser value to uphold these values we hold as foremost.
It is the function of these values to uphold the equal dignity and rights of all citizens, irrespective of their social background and standing. Upholding these values promotes social order and stability in society. In sociology, value has a meaning different from that in philosophy or economics.
In the sphere of economics, value means a price. So economically, just as commercial commodities, the services of a doctor, nurse, lawyer, a teacher, domestic help, a gardener, a clerk, a factory worker or any employed person has a minimum wage, a nominal price, even though none of their services can be ‘priced’ because of the ‘human quotient’ in the service rendered by a human being of immeasurable human dignity. This is an aspect that most do not appreciate or value except perhaps when they retire from ‘service’. No monetary value can or should be set to the service of the clergy.
PRICED CLERGY
It seems there are among some of the religious clergy too who stipulate a price for their ‘services’ which is indeed a disgrace. Jesus said, “You received without charge, give without charge. Provide yourself with no gold or silver, not even with a few coppers for your purses, with no haversack for your journey or spare tunic or footwear or a staff, for the workman deserves his keep”. (Matthew 10.8-10). St. Paul who followed Jesus Christ so faithfully and understood Him so well, declared, ‘Observe not the letter of the law, but the spirit of the law’ (2 Cor 3.6) to emphasize that being faithful to the spirit of the law was far more important than to meticulously follow the letter whereby the very purpose of the law is disregarded.
It is unfortunate that there are men and women supposed to be witnesses of a religious way of life who live for gold and silver and even wear millions worth of gold on their person (!) and amass wealth and even exploit the ignorant and the poor, including superstitious politicians, who come to them in their moments of distress?
How do the politicians of today who have put themselves forward on the pretext of social service, accumulate wealth by all sorts of questionable means? Also, how many of our learned lawyers pedantically scrutinize the letter of the law and miss the spirit and purpose of it and belittle justice? What are the social values of the professionals?
The manner in which some of the highest values we esteem have been upheld by those in humbler positions of life puts to shame not only the well-to-do but also those professionals who would go to any length to make financial gains unworthy of their social standing.
There has persisted over the years a solid stratum of social values among a cross section of all our people in our society irrespective of their station in life. Otherwise, our Nation could not have survived even to this extent. The more than 62% of the voters who on January 8, 2015 especially opted for a cleaner democracy were people who held on to national values one would like to see all uphold.
For a nation to have sound values it is necessary that these basic values are inculcated to all of our younger generation in our homes and schools and in our Daham Paselas. Unless they do so, all of them become empty shells without any value. In fact, these values should be sharpened, refined and presented in more sophisticated ways as the students advance in their studies.
