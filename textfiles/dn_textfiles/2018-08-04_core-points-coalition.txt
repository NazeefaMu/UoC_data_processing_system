Core points of coalition

After the presidential elections and the general elections in 2015, the national unity government was formed by the two main political parties of the country – the SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena and the UNP led by Ranil Wickremesinghe. The regime change brought about by the defeat of the Rajapaksa government gave much hope to the people of this country who wanted a new administration guided by the democratic principles of justice, equality and good governance. There was a serious erosion of the democratic rights of the people during the Rajapaksa administration which was authoritarian. The formation of the coalition government signified a deviation from the political culture of eternal confrontation between the two main political parties, the UNP and the SLFP.
The National Unity Government was able to take some constructive steps for bringing about national reconciliation. It should be appreciated that the former government under President Mahinda Rajapaksa gave attention to some urgent existential needs such as the reconstruction of school and hospital buildings, reconstruction of roads and railways and making facilities available for people to engage in their economic activities such as farming and fishing. But, there was a very significant deficit in the post-war reconciliation process. It was the failure on the part of the government to understand the need for healing the wounds in the hearts and minds of the people of both sides.
Reconciliation means uniting the hearts and minds of the people who were already separated. It can be stated that certain activities of the government and the armed forces have played a negative role in the reconciliation process. For example, the celebration of victory by the government after defeating the LTTE at the final stage of the war in 2009, symbolizes according to the mindset of the Tamil people, the victory of the Sinhalese fighters (the armed forces of the Sri Lankan government) by defeating the Tamil fighters (LTTE). They consider the Sri Lankan armed forces consisting predominantly of Sinhalese soldiers as an army of the Sinhalese people who were fighting for the Sinhalese. As such, the decision of the present government to discontinue the holding of victory parades and to have events only for the commemoration of the death of the members of the armed forces and civilians in all parts of the country including the North and East, is highly commendable. As a result of the war, not only the combatants, several thousands of civilians also died in the North and East. The nature of the phenomenon of war is such that civilian deaths cannot be totally avoided.
Enactment of progressive legislation
The National Unity Government was able to get some progressive legislation passed in Parliament. For example, The 19th Amendment to the Constitution reduced the powers of the President substantially, by creating the Constitutional Council and other independent commissions such as the Public Service Commission, the National Police Commission, the Human Rights Commission and the Commission to investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.
The establishment of these independent commissions contributed substantially to the restoration of the independence of the judiciary and good governance in the country. Acts of Parliament for the establishment of the Office of Missing Persons, the Judicature (amendment) Act aimed at expediting the cases involving economic and financial crimes of very serious nature, the Enforced Disappearances Act, the Right to Information Act are several other legislative enactments that can contribute to national reconciliation and good governance. For getting this legislation passed by a majority, extension of cooperation by some opposition parties in Parliament, specially the TNA and the JVP, to the ruling coalition was another positive tendency in Sri Lankan politics. The contribution made by the TNA and its leader R. Sampandan, as the leader of the Opposition, is commendable.
The TNA represented the vast majority of Tamil voters in the North and East. The other political parties representing Tamils in the North and East did not have substantial public support.
Formation of the National Unity Government
The split that occurred in the SLFP before the presidential elections of 2015 resulted in one faction led by Maithripala Sirisena cooperating with the UNP for nominating a common presidential candidate and after the presidential elections and the general elections, forming the National Unity Government which is a coalition of the two main political parties in the country.
The other faction of the SLFP led by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, remained in the opposition and adopted a confrontationist approach to the unity government. It formed a separate political party – the SLPP (Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna). The objective of the SLPP was from the very beginning the obstruction of whatever initiatives and steps taken by the unity government for implementing the measures undertaken by the government, after the war, to usher in the state of durable peace and reconciliation between the two main ethnic communities, the Sinhalese and the Tamils.
The Joint Opposition, the SLPP has engaged in a propaganda campaign portraying the reconciliation process as an anti-Sinhala campaign supported by some western countries for reviving the LTTE and establishing the Tamil Eelam. The constitutional amendment procedure adopted by the parliament is projected as an attempt to establish a federal government which means, according to them, a separate state for the North and East. They criticize the government for some steps taken for addressing the grievances of the Tamil community. For example, withdrawal of the armed units from some areas to enable the owners of the lands to reoccupy them is portrayed as a threat to the national security. Even steps taken by the law enforcement authorities to take into custody and prosecute some members of the armed forces for some criminal acts committed while they were in the military service, are portrayed as anti-national acts aimed at harassing war heroes. It appears that this propaganda campaign has been successful in generating a feeling among the Sinhalese that the reconciliation process of the incumbent government is a serious threat to the security of the country.
The traditional tendency for the opposition in Sri-Lankan politics has been to use ethnic nationalism as an instrument for mobilizing the people against the party or parties in power, whenever an attempt is made for resolving the conflict.
Erosion of political support base of coalition partners
The anti-government propaganda campaign of the SLPP led by the former President resulted in a serious erosion of the political support base of both the UNP and the SLFP as indicated by the results of the recently held local government elections. To make matters worse, investigations in to the Treasury bond scams have exposed the involvement of many politicians. The politicians involved in the bond scams appear to be members of the UNP. It is the responsibility of the UNP to reorganise and democratize the party machinery by removing all those who are involved in the Treasury bond scams and other corrupt dealings from responsible posts in the administration and responsibilities within the party.
Split in the SLFP
Another serious threat to the effective functioning of the government is the split that occurred in the SLFP after some MPs voted in support of the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister. The sixteen MPs are now acting in Parliament as another opposition group. It is unfortunate that this defection of sixteen MPs has posed a serious challenge to the stability of the government and its capability to deliver. Therefore, the need of the hour, is to reorganise and revitalize the SLFP under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena aimed at accelerating the speed with which the administration moves ahead for realizing the goals of reconciliation and good governance, which were clearly laid down in the policy statements issued for the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2015.
Dwindling of public support for the TNA
Another concurrent development taking place in the North is the dwindling of public support to the TNA, the main political party of the Tamil people, as indicated by the results of the local government elections. Perhaps, this may be the result of the effective propaganda campaign of the other small political parties which were extremist ethnic nationalist groups who opposed the approach adopted by the TNA in accordance with the moderate policy of supporting the post-war reconciliation process of the government under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the President.
There are even some voices emanating from some extremist sections of the Tamil community expressing the wish for the revival of the LTTE. It is very unfortunate that there are some sections of the Tamil community who are not aware of the fact that the LTTE was a terrorist movement with an extremist political ideology which was the reason for the failure of all attempts made for a political settlement through discussions even with the involvement of the international community. However, the peace-loving people in the North and East will not encourage or support any terrorist movement aiming at establishing a despotic government led by a dictator. They do not wish to be slaves under a dictator. They want to live with dignity and self-respect in a democratic system of governance.
