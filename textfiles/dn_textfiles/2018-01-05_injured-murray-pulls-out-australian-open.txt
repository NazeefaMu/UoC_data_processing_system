Injured Murray pulls out from Australian Open

SYDNEY Thursday: Former world number one Andy Murray withdrew from the Australian Open Thursday after failing to recover from a hip injury, joining injured Japanese star Kei Nishikori on the sidelines.
“Sadly I won't be playing in Melbourne this year, as I am not yet ready to compete,” Murray said in a statement.
“I'll be flying home shortly to assess all the options but I appreciate all the messages of support and I hope to be back playing soon. “
