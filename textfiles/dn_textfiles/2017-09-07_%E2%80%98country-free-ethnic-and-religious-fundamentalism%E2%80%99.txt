‘Country free of ethnic and religious fundamentalism’

I was critical of the previous regime because of the ethnic and religious fundamentalism that existed with the blessings of the former President and his family, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, today there is no ethnic and religious fundamentalism and people have been given the freedom to practice their religions.
Humanity has emerged defeating fundamentalism.
The minister was addressing the gathering at Nindavur recently with regard to the launch of development projects at Nindavur Hospital.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the Northern political parties have extended their support towards the government. Today, people live without fear of getting abducted by white vans. “If any type of fundamentalism raises its head in the future, I will fight against it,” he said.
“This Yahapalana Government will keep all its promises made to the people. I took a decision to provide drugs for cancer patients during their lifetime. Earlier, they received drugs worth Rs. 1.5 million. Now there is no such limit. This decision is worthier than the Rs. 10 million spent from the President's Fund for my heart surgery,” he added.
