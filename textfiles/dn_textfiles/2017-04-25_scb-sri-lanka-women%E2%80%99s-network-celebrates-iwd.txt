SCB Sri Lanka Women’s  Network celebrates IWD

The Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) Sri Lanka Women’s Network together with the Sri Lanka HR team organized a fun-filled inspirational day for female colleagues on the 4th of March, to celebrate International Women’s Day (IWD) in line with the 2017 UN slogan for IWD, Be Bold for Change.
SCB tied up with 361 Degrees (Pvt) Ltd (a local event management team), to provide their ladies with a day of experiential learning through “The Amazing Chase”, where 8 teams were pushed to their limits to complete challenging and unusual tasks by scouting around Colombo.
During the second half of the day, they were fortunate to have Sarala Fernando, an inspirational speaker and advocate for Women, to share her story of how she is living with cancer, which touched many lives. SCB CEO, Jim McCabe, also addressed the ladies of SCB about the value of diversity and the important role women play in the workplace.
