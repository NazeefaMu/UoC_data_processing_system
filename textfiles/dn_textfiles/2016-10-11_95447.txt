A wicked sense of humour

One would expect some liveliness from a film that is suppose to be aimed at children but ‘Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children’, adapted from the acclaimed debut novel by Ransom Riggs, is anything but sensational.
Though grim is generally a word that is usually connected with Tim Burton’s work, the director takes the term to a whole new dimension with ‘Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children’. The movie which focuses on children with super natural powers is not a superhero thriller but something straight out of nightmares. The story plays out like a variation on any and all teenage superhero storyline.
Wondrous inhabitants
Asa Butterfield as Jacob
After witnessing the strange circumstances of his grandfather’s death, Jacob encounters clues that inspire memories of the stories his grandfather, Abraham, told him as a child about a mysterious orphanage on a Welsh island and its peculiar, wondrous inhabitants. And at the urging of a therapist charged with helping him to distinguish the differences between fantasy and reality, Jacob eventually stumbles upon a kind of wonderland after he and his father, Franklin, travel to the island to determine the veracity of his grandfather’s remarkable tales.
Throughout the film, Burton fixates elegantly on the eponymous children’s unique gifts. Once Jacob arrives at Miss Alma LeFay Perigrine’s orphanage he is faced with characters which he had only heard from his grandfather’s stories and ones that many thought were conjured out of the old man’s imagination.
There are a few instances when the story is of interest. One particular instance is when we realise that Miss Peregrine has created a loop that allows her and the children to live a particular day over and over again. This wards off the horrors of the future. Jacob is soon absorbed into the ordinary and extraordinary lifestyles of the children at the orphanage.
Cartoonish horror
The creatures whom the main characters are hiding from are particularly scary and really do work with Burton’s visual style of making things creepy and beautiful at the same time. The production design surrounding the film is done well and Burton’s flair for fiendish and cartoonish horror is second to none. One gruesome scene involves the monstrous creatures dining on a plate of children’s eyeballs.
The powers of the children too are captivating. You get Enoch who has the power to give life to the inanimate with little animal hearts. Hugh has bees living within his stomach. Olive can levitate and must wear a pair of lead shoes so she doesn’t fly away and disappear into the clouds. With such resources within his grasp it is a pity that Burton has not made full use of their talents. Instead he lets Jacob, who has the special power to see monsters, lead the action.
Asa Butterfield who has won accolades for his role in ‘The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas’ does his role well and in fact he is the main person who makes the production watchable.
Eva Green who is able to command time and turn into a bird is Miss Perigrine. She makes a worthy headmistress. There are a few times that you are reminded of Albus Dumbledore due to some of her heroic characteristics but Green manages to carry off the role well though she is not given enough screen space.
‘Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children’ probably sets the tone for a franchise and Burton’s visual flairs and keen eye for design are used well. However this is not a movie for children bedcause it will scare them out of the halls ands give them many sleepless nights.
It is more suitable for young adults and all those who enjoy a horror flick because it embodies a wicked sense of humour.
