CA suspends metal quarry operations in Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve

The Court of Appeal yesterday, issued an Interim Order staying the operation of any Licenses issued by the Geological Survey and Mining Bureau in favour of any person to operate a metal quarry within the Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve, until May 4.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-Bench comprising Justice (President) Vijith Malalgoda and Justice S. Thurairajah, made this order pursuant to a writ petition filed by two residents of Dambuluhalmillewa in Kekirawa.
The petitioners had cited Geological Survey and Mining Bureau, Central Environmental Authority, the Conservator General, Department of Wildlife and seven persons who hold licenses to operate metal quarry were cited as respondents in the petition.
The respondants were noticed to appear in Court on next hearing date. The Petitioners through counsel Thishya Weragoda with counsel Iresh Seneviratne and Chinthaka Sugathapala under the instructions of Niluka Dissanayake stated that aggregate extraction activities are continuing in the said Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve and amidst the State Counsel specifically informed Court that no such permits have been issued.
The Petitioners further stated that the conduct of the persons in whose favour licenses have been issued clearly disentitles them from operating any aggregate mining operations, within the bounds of Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve and the Petitioners verily believe that over 7 quarries are in operation within the Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve.
The petitioners state that the illegal activities in the pretext of the purported licenses issued by the first, second and fourth respondents have resulted in causing catastrophic damage to the Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve and an urgent need for intervention from Court to stop such activities has arisen.
