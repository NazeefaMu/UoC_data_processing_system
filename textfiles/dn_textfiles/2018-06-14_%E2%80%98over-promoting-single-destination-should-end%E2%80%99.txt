‘Over-promoting single destination should end’

Jetwing Hotels and Travels Chairman Hiran Cooray emphasized the need to implement a high-value, sustainable, low-impact form of tourism model to promote tourist attractions across the country, rather than over-promoting a single destination.
He made these comments speaking at the 39th graduation ceremony of Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management, held at BMICH.
Cooray noted that people tend to travel more than before, putting a strain on historic sites. Adopting sustainable practices and models in the industry will keep the numbers low, while making sure the people and the environment can still benefit largely.
“We have to say no to over-visitation. Look at the current situation of tourist attractions like Yala and Sigiriya. That is over- visitation. That is the lack of management and responsibility on our part.” Cooray said.
The real threat is when large numbers of tourists flock a destination without any proper planning or without sensitivity to the local environment,” Cooray said. He said further that sustainable model is one of the best models, that can be implemented and sites can be protected if tourism is well managed.
