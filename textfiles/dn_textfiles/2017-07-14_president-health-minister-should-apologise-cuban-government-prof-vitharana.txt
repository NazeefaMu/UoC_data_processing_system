President, Health Minister should apologise to Cuban Government: Prof. Vitharana

President Maithripala Sirisena and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne should apologise to the Cuban Government for telling lies to the Sri Lankan people about Cuban anti-dengue drive, Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
Addressing the media at the LSSP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the Cuban Government did not use force to implement the anti-dengue drive in Cuba. Cuban people voluntarily took part in it with understanding, he said. Cuba does not have even a single confirmed dengue patient. There are only 270 unconfirmed dengue patients reported from Cuba during the past six months, Prof. Vitharana said.
Cuba had only 1,836 dengue patients in last year. Cuba used BTI bacteria only for unreachable places. People voluntarily cleaned up potential mosquito breeding places by organising themselves as groups in each street. They prevented water getting collected where the dengue mosquitoes can breed, he said.
"I witnessed the process myself as a member of the WHO Dengue Control task Force," he said.
"Cuba presented a report to the WHO on the dengue control programme. Two US experts, one Brazilian expert and myself went to Cuba and inspected the programme. No force was used on people," Prof. Vitharana said.
He said in Sri Lanka, the number of dengue deaths has reached to the level of 250. The number of dengue patients has reached 100,000. Out of this number, 10 to 20 percent are in a serious condition called Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), he said.
