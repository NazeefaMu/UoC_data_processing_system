Moves to reserve land for protests

Cabinet approval has been granted to reserve a land area to conduct protests without causing inconvenience to the people, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the media at the Government’s Information Department yesterday.
Dissanayake said the authority to choose lands to hold protest campaigns had been delegated to Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
He said no decision had been taken as to which area would be declared for the protests.
