Sri Lankans dominate Asia Cup records

Over the years, the Asia Cup has gained a lot of attention and excitement. One prime reason for that is the clash between India and Pakistan. Any cricket played between these two teams evokes the feeling of patriotism and excitement among the residents of both the countries.
Historically, the first Asia Cup was played in the year 1984 in Sharjah, Dubai where India were crowned the champions. Since then, India has been the most successful team with 6 titles ( 5 in ODI's and 1 in T20 Internationals).
The last Asia cup played in Bangladesh in 2016 was a T20 format; a deviation from the usual 50 overs format. However, this time, the Asia Cup will be played in 50 overs format in Dubai, a neutral venue for the teams.
So, having witnessed the Asia Cup for the last 34 years, let's find out who have been the top performers in this tournament.
BATTING RECORDS#1: Most runs
Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya has the most runs in the tournament's history. He has scored 1220 runs in 24 innings at an average of 53.04 and a strike rate of 102.52 with 6 centuries and 3 fifties.
Sachin Tendulkar is the lone Indian in this list with 971 runs in 21 innings at an average of 51.1 and a strike rate of 85.47 with 2 centuries and 7 fifties.
The other players in the list include Kumar Sangakkara, Arjuna Ranatunga, and Mahela Jayawardene.
Had Virat Kohli not been rested, he would have had a golden chance to enter this list.
#2: Highest individual scores
The thing which comes to our mind after seeing this list is the magnificent 183 by Virat Kohli against Pakistan in Asia Cup 2012. India chased down the target of 330 in 47.5 overs with the help of the extraordinary knock of Kohli, which had 22 fours and a six.
Younis Khan made 144 against Honk Kong in the year 2004. That was the highest individual score in the Asia Cup at that time.
The other special knocks include 143 by Shoaib Malik, 136 again by Virat Kohli and 135 by Sourav Ganguly against Bangladesh in the year 2000.
#3: Best batting strike rates
Well, no surprises here. Taking about strike rates, Shahid Afridi's name will the first on the list in limited overs cricket.
Overall, Shahid Afridi has the best strike rate in the Asia Cup at 140.74.
Suresh Raina with 113.95 is the second in the list. Virender Sehwag, Shakib Hasan, and Sanath Jayasuriya are at third, fourth and fifth respectively.
Will Shakib be able to maintain his position? We will find it out after the end of the tournament.
#4: Highest batting averages
Talking about batting averages is synonymous with talking about MS Dhoni. Doesn't matter which record you see, MS Dhoni would always be among the toppers in terms of batting averages.
Overall, he has scored 571 runs in 12 innings at a phenomenal batting average of 95.16 in Asia Cup.
Navjot Sidhu, a surprise entrant is a distant second at 66.25. Marvan Atapattu with 64.2, Shoaib Malik with 63.88 and Virat Kohli at 61.3 are at third, fourth and fifth position respectively.
Let us now look at the bowling records in Asia Cup.
BOWLING RECORDS #1: Most wickets
Another list which is dominated by the Sri Lankans with four players featuring in the list of top 5 prolific wicket-takers in Asia Cup.
Muttiah Muralitharan has taken the most number of wickets with 30 wickets to his name. Ajantha Mendis is at second position with 36 wickets.
It is interesting to see that Ajantha Mendis has taken only 8 innings for his 26 wickets. A wicket per inning ratio of 3.25. Quite outstanding!
Saeed Ajmal with 25 wickets, Lasith Malinga with 24 wickets and Chaminda Vass with 23 wickets are at third, fourth and fifth position respectively.
Lasith Malinga has a good chance to topple Muralitharan from his position as he has been recalled for the tournament.
#2: Best bowling performances
Ajantha Mendis' spell of 6 for 13 against India is the best spell in the history of the tournament. Chasing 274, India were cruising along with the help of Sehwag's blistering 50.
However, things went haywire for India when Mendis was introduced in the attack. He derailed the Indian batting order by taking 6 important wickets for just 13 runs.
In the same tournament, Ajantha Mendis produced yet another sensational spell of bowling against UAE. His spell of 5 for 22 is the fourth best spell in Asia Cup.
India's Arshad Ayub, whom people may not remember, produced a superb spell of 5 for 22 against Pakistan in the year 1988, giving India a famous victory.
Aaqib Javed and Muttiah Muralitharan are the other two entries in this list.
#3: Lowest bowling averages
Talking about bowling averages, Ajantha Mendis's name is no surprise. He has taken 26 wickets in 8 innings at a phenomenal bowling average of 10.42.
Kapil Dev too was really good in Asia Cup. He has taken 15 wickets in 7 innings at a superb average of 13 and an economy rate of just 3.56; second best in Asia cup.
Abdul Qadir at 14.76, Venkatesh Prasad at 17.76 and Wasim Akram at 18.56 hold third, fourth and fifth place respectively.
#4: Lowest economy rates
Talking about economy rates of the bowlers is a crime these days. You would not find such good economy rates in today's era; especially after the rise of T20 cricket, and change in rules favoring the batsmen.
Anyway, Wasim Akram has the lowest economy rate. Overall, he has taken 16 wickets in 12 innings at an average of 18.56; fifth on the list of best bowling averages.
He is closely followed by Kapil Dev at 3.56, Abdul Qadir at 3.62 and Muttiah Muralitharan at 3.75. These are sensational bowling averages; unheard in today's era.
Let us now look at fielding records in Asia Cup.
FIELDING RECORDS #1: Most no. of dismissals by wicket-keepers
Kumar Sangakkara holds the record for most dismissals behind the wickets. Overall, he has effected 36 dismissals with 27 catches and 9 stumpings.
MS Dhoni is second with 24 dismissals. He has taken 19 catches and has 5 stumpings to his name. What is interesting is that Dhoni's dismissal/per inning is the best at 1.69, among wicket-keepers who have effected at least 10 dismissals.
It would be interesting to see if Dhoni goes past Sangakkara in Asia Cup 2018.
Moin Khan at 17, Brendon Kuruppu at 14 and Romesh Kaluwitharna at 11 are at third, fourth and fifth position respectively.
#2: Most catches by a fielder
Mahela Jayawardene holds the record for most catches. He has 15 catches to his name. Younis Khan is marginally behind him with 14 catches.
Aravinda de Silva at 12, Muralitharan at 10 and Suresh Raina at 8 are at third, fourth and fifth position respectively.
Mahela Jayawardene and Younis Khan have both taken 3 catches in an innings; the most by a player in Asia Cup.
We hope you guys had fun seeing the top performers in Asia Cup.
