Why was Cabraal not summoned before the Bond Commission?: UNP backbenchers question

 
UNP backbenchers today questioned as to why former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal or his sister Shiromi Wickremasinghe were not yet summoned before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the bond issue.
UNP MP Professor Ashu Marasinghe speaking at the Parliamentary debate pointed out the PCoI would need the help of informed advisors as it has so far failed to summon the most relevant witnesses.
Cabraal’s sister Shiromi Wickremesinghe was a director at Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. The names of former CB Governor Cabraal and his sister have also been implicated in the treasury bonds allegations.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara bolstering Marasinghe’s position said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was the Finance Minister when the PTL was set up, should also be summoned before the PCoI if former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was summoned.
“Those in the AG Department have not been able to verify the signature of the former Defence Minister for two long years. How can we believe in their competency to handle these investigations? A large number of files have been sent to the AG Department after completing investigations. The AG Department should expedite investigations into them,”  Prof Marasinghe charged.
“We urge the Attorney General’s Department to do justice in their investigations. If not they will fail to deliver what people expect from them,” the MP added.
