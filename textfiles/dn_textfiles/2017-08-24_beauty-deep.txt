Beauty from the deep

The world judges you from your looks and how you dress yourself. Acne doesn’t just affect your looks – breakouts can damage self-esteem and impact on your quality of life. It can become a barrier for establishing relationships and developing social skills. Apart from social phobia, it can also lead to fear of being mocked by others and disabling shyness. The good news is that there are ways to tackle and combat this issue.
What is acne?
Acne is a disease that affects the skin’s oil glands. It is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that causes spots and results in whiteheads, blackheads, pimples, cysts, and nodules, especially on the face, shoulders, back, neck, chest, and upper arms. Acne leaves skin scars too.
Types of acne
Acne Vulgaris: This is the most common form of acne that we see on a regular basis.
Black heads: This type of acne is extremely common and is usually seen on the nose and nasal area. They look like tiny areas of black lumps on the skin, which are formed as a result of blocked follicles. The black lumps are usually formed when bacteria, dead skin and harmful substances clog the follicles and reach the surface. These react with the oxygen present in the air and result in the appearance of blackheads.
Whiteheads: These are white spots on the skin. Due to excessive oil production, the glands are clogged with oil and covered by skin. As a result, the oil cannot reach the surface and is trapped between the skin layers, resulting in the appearance of white spots.
Papules: These are a type of acne that are inflamed and appear as small red dots or bumps on the skin. These may or may not be sensitive to touch.
Pustules: Pustules are inflamed acne that are hard to touch and are usually filled with pus. These appear as white spots and the center is mostly pale yellow.
Nodules: This is one of the more severe types of acne which is much larger than papules or pustules. A nodule is a painful and inflamed bump. It doesn’t have pus and is hard to the touch. This can only be cured by proper medical treatment and usually requires the use of strong medicines.
Cysts: Acne that is deep, appears big, and is pus filled, is called a cyst. It is quite painful to touch and needs immediate attention from a doctor.
Severe types of acne
Acne Fulminans: This type of acne is seen in young men. It is accompanied by symptoms like fever and joint ache and leaves scars.
Acne Mechanica: This originates as a result of excessive heat and friction between the skin. It is usually seen in people involved in sports or those who wear helmets, caps or sports gear for prolonged periods of time on a regular basis.
Acne Rosacea: This is quite similar to acne vulgaris. It appears as a red colored rash on the cheek and chin.
Pyoderma Faciale: This is a severe type of acne and is a combination of nodules and pustules. It is generally seen among women between the ages of 20 to 40.
Acne Conglobata: This is the severest type of acne which is seen in both male and females. It appears as a large lesion on the skin which is interconnected and usually affects the chest, upper arms, face, thighs and buttocks. This is a rare type of acne and often leads to skin damage and permanent scars.
Food that causes breakouts
Certain foods can cause breakouts. Eating a diet rich in refined carbs, saturated fats, and other processed foods can develop acne. A diet with a high glycemic index – basically, processed foods like bread and refined grains that are quickly broken down into sugar can have a terrible effect on skin as it leads to increased sebum production and clogged pores.
From generation to generation
It is most likely that acne has a hereditary component but it is not completely a genetic disease. Our genetics are passed down to us from our parents. The human body’s immune system is responsible for how we deal with bacteria. This means that some people will struggle with dry skin and blackheads, while other people will struggle with overly oily skin and whiteheads
Genes also determine how well your body can clear up your pores. Some people inherit the ability to shed dead skin cells in a way that does not clog their pores; others shed dead skin cells in a way that causes a clogging of the pores. Unfortunately if a child’s parents both had acne, it is much more likely that the child will develop some sort of acne as well.
The gender factor
Women are more likely to be affected by acne because of hormonal fluctuations related to the menstrual cycle and menopause.
No more make up?
Makeup is said to clog your pores, prevent your skin from breathing. Makeup can definitely aggravate acne or make acne worse. Sometimes this is the result of makeup wearers not realizing that they are sensitive or allergic to certain ingredients. It may also be the result of them forgetting to take their makeup off after a day of wear, therefore clogging up or blocking pores. However, it’s not the makeup alone that causes acne. These issues associated with makeup have the potential to worsen, aggravate, or even trigger acne in some people. Even if your acne was aggravated or instigated by your makeup you don’t need to give up cosmetics. Use oil free water-based products since these are usually the best kind for those with acne.
Consult a dermatologist
Dermatologists are skincare experts trained in identifying and treating a variety of skin conditions, including acne. They should be consulted if:
l Over-the-counter products are not alleviating your acne. Often, over-the-counter products are not strong enough to help moderate to severe acne.
l Your acne is preventing you from normal social activity. Acne can greatly impact self-esteem and self-image and can cause social withdrawal.
l You begin to see scars after blemishes clear. Untreated scars can become permanent. A dermatologist can provide treatments that specifically alleviate scarring.
l Your acne isn’t improving or has gotten worse. If your acne has become more severe, a dermatologist will be able to prescribe you stronger medication.
