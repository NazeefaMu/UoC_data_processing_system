[Appreciations]-31.10.2015


N. J. Jayarajahm:
Gentleman par excellence
Nicholas Joseph Jayarajah, (Justice of Peace, Retired Assistant Director of Sri Lanka Customs was called to rest at 85 years on October 23 after a brief illness in Colombo.
The husband of late Regina Lilymalar was his inseparable companion and guardian.
Always one could find the couple together in the church at functions and parties seated next to each other. God found his inability to live separated and called him to join his beloved to praise and thank Him in the land inherited by them.
The demise of senior Patrician Jayarajah gives great pain of mind and sorrow to all Patricians. He was tall and handsome with a loveable personality, loved by all for his noble qualities, humility and simplicity. Jayarajah never missed SPC meetings or the get-together organized by Patricians in Colombo.
They were always the first couple to arrive at Christmas parties - a source of encouragement and inspiration for young Patricians.
At the Customs Department, he was a respected and recognized senor officer with vast knowledge of Custom’s regulations and formalities. Many were seeking his advice and guidance.
Retired Assistant Director of Customs, never looked for monetary benefits but always helped the genuine consignees.
He enjoyed a lucrative position in life and contributed lavishly for charity. When I fail to approach him in time he often calls me, reminds me of his annual contribution for Cancer Hospital charity and S.V.P Christmas party donations etc. He was energetic and moved freely with the young and old and won their hearts. He was a man of God with a sensitive heart to help the needy. He was very religious and virtuous. He was a Catholic and his faith in God sustained him in his triumphs and trials. A gentleman par excellence with adorable qualities helping his nephews and nieces and many others in their adversities. His services to the society were recognized and the government honoured him with the title of Justice of Peace.
Jayarajah having cherished his fruitful life, left for his glory to join his beloved without incurring much delay.
Times of grief come to us all. The hurt is too much to bear but always remember God's everlasting love and mercy which is always there to console and comfort us.
Prayers are assured for the repose of his soul and may his nephews and nieces feel God's love and be comforted at this saddest time of loss.
May God of love forgive all his remission of sins and grant him eternal bliss in heaven.
Sorrows tried him,
Faith sustained him,
Earth has lost him,
Heaven gained him,
Conquered victory over death.
S. B. David
