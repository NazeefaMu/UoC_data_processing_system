Fishermen floating at sea rescued

Five fishermen floating on the debris of a multi-day fishing boat in the sea were rescued by officers attached to the Navy yesterday.
According to the Navy, the multi-day fishing boat with the fishermen had collided with a large vessel at deep sea while they were fishing 40 nautical miles away from Kirinda Harbour.
The boat had left Kudawella shore on November 18.
The collision was reported to the Navy from another multi-day fishing boat known as Madusha. A Dora Gun Mounted Navy boat was sent to rescue the five fishermen.
