Lighting a spark

Spark ‘18 is a fantastic initiative of the Prefect body of Royal College who believe that the imagination and creativity of a student can be unleashed and their hidden potential can be unlocked if given the correct platform and opportunity. And this can be done before they are pruned by society. So by challenging themselves, they can develop these talents and harness what is within them. Spark ‘18 is such a platform where the students are encouraged to come up with new inventions and innovation that can be showcased at this exhibition. Along with the fullest support of the Principal, staff and parents, Spark 2018 will take place from September 25 – 28 at the Royal College Premises. Daily News visited Royal College to speak to all who are involved in this exciting endeavor.
Principal of Royal College, B.A. Abeyrathna, pointed out that one objective of the project is to inculcate correct attitudes in the students.
“We are providing students with the necessary platform to come up with their own inventions and innovations. This is also a learning process for them because this is a good opportunity for them to get out of the classroom mentality and come up with their own ideas. We have identified a number of students who can do miracles. Some of their ideas are remarkable covering a number of areas,” said Abeyrathna
The parents, old boy and teachers are also on board to help these students in their efforts. The student turnout is massive. The talent is really huge. The number of inventions and innovations are so many that it is impressive.
Thinking powers
“These students are coming with their original ideas and exhibits and are using their thinking powers. We are giving them the chance to think out of the box with the knowledge that they receive in the classroom. The inventions and innovations cover many areas. The Prefects are leading from the front. As a Principal I am delighted by this project. We have received fullest support from the students at Royal with the parents also giving their fullest support. So they have to be practical and think beyond what they have been taught. The response has been very positive. Our sponsors Dialog and Microsoft, they have come forward and given their fullest cooperation. The School Development Society and Royal College Union have come together to support us. The teachers also learn something new from the boys and their ideas. This benefits everyone involved. Through this exhibition the students can develop their own solutions for the problems in society by thinking differently. Some of it is a tangible way of the learning process. prizes and certificates will be given,” explained Abeyrathna.
He also pointed out that Royal College has invited almost 3000 schools, island wide to visit Royal College – Colombo District and Rural Areas.
Head Prefect Hashen Hettigoda pointed out that this is an ideal opportunity for the participants to access their powers of imagination because what happens is that they go to school and then after school they go for tuitions classes. Hettigoda stated that after a daily process like this they completely lose their powers of imagination.
 
Lmited space
“The Sri Lanka Inventors Commission, do an annual competition (took place around two weeks ago) and mainly rural schools take part in it. The participants are represented themselves and brought out their inventions. It is not well known but it is well known in their community. So 150 young student competitors/adult competitors have been selected from there (by the Inventors Commission) and those 150 will be sent to Spark ‘18. So they will be showcasing their exhibits. The adults will be in their early 20s maybe,” said Hettigoda.
50 schools are sending their inventions and innovations and that all 3000 schools may not be visiting but definitely many schools from the districts will be visiting.
“This is an exhibition done with the blessings of the Principal of Royal College. I must say we never expected this project to be so successful. The support has been overwhelming. We will have every invention showcased even with the limited space that we have. We also have support from Sri Lanka Army, Air Force and Navy. Dialog and Microsoft have come in. We have National Lottery Board and Development Lottery is on board with us as well. Ministry of Finance and Media are coming in a big way to give some support for these children with outstanding innovations so they come be successful in the future in their own fields and do something for the country. We also have with us our bank partner HNB. Food partners are John Keells with Elephant House,” said Chairman Spark Rizan Nazeer.
From Royal College alone there are 600 inventions and innovations, and then from outside there will be 200 – The 150 the Inventors Commission are sending and the 50 other schools who are sending their inventions and innovations.
Prefect Coordinator Sachindra Mendis said that the idea is to introduce innovation and the concept of innovation to Sri Lanka.
“We have been talking to our students which amount to almost 8500 royalists. What they came up soon after the sessions was truly amazing. They have really great ideas, and there is potential for someone to be great in the future. We contacted the forces and we found our main sponsors dialog who will be having their own pavilion inside the exhibition area. Microsoft has also come in, since this is partially related to their field as well, in ICT and electronic. They will have their own sessions going on. Plus the Tri-forces will be having their exhibition. We basically have a lot of parties who have come into show their innovations. Anyone can bring anything to the table,” said Mendis.
National Project
Mendis also pointed out that national institutes will also be making their appearance. There will be 600 royalists with their inventions and innovations and Royal clubs participating with their innovations.
“A simple idea or theory could be a new innovation. For example since the clubs such as drama and dancing cannot really present inventions, the drama society for example might present drama techniques and dancing might to do the same. The red -cross society are doing a project called ‘Orange Elephant’ addressing the wild elephant problem. So we have invited old school principals and everyone who has been involved with the school. We are hoping that the President and Prime Minister will also visit. It has now become a National Project,” pointed out Mendis.
Mendis stated that it is the ideas of the students that really provided this boost.
“We have had so much support from all sides. Children are so involved in tuition classes but they do not realize their hidden abilities. It could come in so many forms like sports, and there could be other creative avenues for them. So we gave them the idea and it just took off from there,” stated Mendis.
Prefect Coordinator Thanuka Pathirage, commented that this exhibition has been a lot of hard work.
“We have come a really long way. It has been a team effort and we are where we are now because of the effort of everyone involved. We never thought that there would be such a positive response. We anticipate a huge crowd turnout,” said Pathirage.

Prefect Coordinator Kisal Ekanayake, said that the event is all about creating that spark.
“It is about creating a spark within the students. It is wonderful seeing the enthusiasm of the students and we never thought it would go this far. We have found that our students are very interested. So this is a great stepping stone for bigger events. We just want to ignite things. So that is the change we want to create.
Prefect Coordinator Mindula Suriyabandara, pointed out that most successful entrepreneurs have done things differently. They do not follow the conventional path set before them.
“They thought outside of the path set before them. So we want to inspire the kids of Royal not to take the part that is considered maybe popular. They do not need to take the path that everyone else is taking. If you want to do something extraordinary and not normal, and be someone extraordinary you might need to take a different path. That is how great innovators and entrepreneurs come about. So we want to create that spark in people. It is all about aspirations,” said Suriyabandara.
There will be a musical performance starting on Saturday the 29th. It will be starting at 5pm to 12am featuring Natasha Rathnayake and others with DJ Ambrose. As bands they have Infinity and others. They are trying to make the musical performance new and different, because the whole point of the exhibition is to invent and innovate. There will be some innovative stuff at the musical show.
