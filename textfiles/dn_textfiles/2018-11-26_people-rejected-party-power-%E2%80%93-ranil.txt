People rejected party in power – Ranil

“A party rejected by the people has come to power through a conspiracy and buried democracy in the country. The people should line up against it,” Former Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing a protest rally near the Kandy clock tower on November 24. He said the people should end the Sirisena-Rajapaksa period and protect the Yahapalana government which upheld democracy.
The rally themed ‘Voice of Justice’ for democracy was jointly organized by the United National Front and the Collective of Civil Organisations.
Wickremesinghe said the Sirisena-Rajapaksa coalition had to accept that they did not command a majority in Parliament.
He said his government has 121 parliamentarians and was prepared to show a further increase on it in the future.
He said the Speaker had faced problems which no other Speaker in the world had faced so far and they highly valued the straight forward actions taken by the Speaker.
He said the group in conspiracy destructed the dignity of parliament through their activities on the first second and third days. They removed the Speaker’s chair and tried to rob the mace. Even a Christian MP was seen hurling the Bible against the opposition. At last, the Speaker was forced to summon police to the House to control the group which caused a conflict. He said that once the Buddha in a discourse to the Licchavi dynasty had said they should assemble in peace, discuss in peace and disperse in peace. The former Prime Minister said he would question whether people who claimed to be descendants of King Dutugamunu’s dynasty acted in accordance with that advice.
He said a general election had to be conducted under the tenure of a lawful government.
It should be held after all parties in Parliament agreed on it.
UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said the so called government had faced defeat at every turn. In the end, it will be wiped out by the people at the election.
UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Dr. Rajitha Senanayake, Lakshmn Kirella, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Mano Ganeshan, Rauff Hakeem, Ravi Karunanayake and Ven. Dambara Amila Thera spoke.
