Gulf Air, the national carrier of the Kingdom of Bahrain, hosted an event gathering key government officials, dignitaries, trade and corporate partners, Falconflyer members, the airline’s workforce and media outlets from across the Kingdom.
Zayed Bin Rashid Alzayani, Chairman of Gulf Air’s Board of Directors said, “Our national carrier is an integral part of the Kingdom of Bahrain's economy and a critical component of its aviation infrastructure. Gulf Air’s new corporate strategy includes expansion plans and is geared towards elevating the passenger experience, promoting Bahrain’s tourism economy and bolstering the Kingdom’s aviation, transport, tourism and business infrastructures and the aviation industry as a whole.”
Gulf Air Chief Executive Officer Krešimir Ku?ko said, “Our new state-of-the-art fleet and best in class products and service will pave the way for Gulf Air’s growth and expansion. This will have a positive impact on the entire Kingdom of Bahrain, cementing our role as the regional airline of choice with a global footprint and best in class.”
At the event, Kuko unveiled the airline’s new corporate strategy for 2018 and beyond, outlining its key pillars. They are: Safety, Network Growth, Innovation, Human Resources, Customer Focus, Revenue Vs Cost and most significantly the national carrier’s role as a contributor and key driver of the local economy as it promotes the Kingdom of Bahrain globally and operates as its ambassador worldwide.
In the coming months, Gulf Air’s highly anticipated incoming fleet of 39 new Boeing and Airbus aircraft will commence delivery. A total of seven new aircraft, five Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners and two Airbus A320neo aircraft, will enter the airline’s fleet before the end of the year.
The airline plans major network expansion coinciding with its new aircraft deliveries. Gulf Air will add eight new destinations to its network this year. In India, its current operations to Delhi, Chennai, Kochi, Mumbai, Trivandrum and Hyderabad, will be enhanced by flights to Bangalore and Calicut. Gulf Air will also commence flights to the Saudi Arabian cities of Abha and Tubuk.
This will expand its Saudi Arabia operations to complement its current service to Dammam, Riyadh, Madina Al Munawarah, Jeddah and Gassim.
Gulf Air’s Cairo operations will be supplemented by direct flights to Alexandria and flights to Sharm El Shaikh. The airline will also launch operations to Baku in Azerbaijan and to Casablanca in Morocco.
 “2018 represents the beginning of a new era for Gulf Air and for the Kingdom of Bahrain. In 2018 and beyond, Gulf Air will challenge the traditional definition of travel, broadening its scope and making it more convenient and appealing for every traveller,” Kucko concluded.
