Dakota pursues art, family time for Jamie

Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson got the level of fame they needed to survive in Hollywood by starring in Fifty Shades of Grey. Now, it looks like the priority for them is to pursue more artistically sound movie projects. Dakota Johnson has purged her Instagram account and has two artsy movies on her docket. Meanwhile, Jamie Dornan, after releasing a new movie this fall, is taking the time to reconnect with his wife Amelia Warner and his baby daughters.
Unfortunately for the actors, Fifty Shades of Grey failed to get good reviews, receiving 25 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and many wins and nominations for Razzie Awards, given to worst performances and films of the year. However, since the actors were contracted to do all three movies, they did their part by wrapping the filming for Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed over the course of three-and-a-half months this summer.
This also meant that the Irish actor had to fly out to Vancouver, Canada just days after his wife, Amelia Warner, gave birth to their second daughter.
But since then, Jamie has been dedicating more time towards his family. For one, he has appeared with Amelia at various red carpet events, turning work into a date night affair for the two of them.
“Jamie Dornan and his wife Amelia Warner made a date night out of the British Independent Film Awards in London on Sunday night,” reports Daily Mail. “The duo – who tied the knot in 2013 and have two daughters together – looked loved up as they attended the star student event at Old Billingsgate near the Tower of London. Keeping things casual, 34-year-old Jamie ditched the tuxedo in favour of a relaxed chino and t-shirt combo.”
He also has been putting some good and controversial work into his TV show, The Fall. Most recently, the show, which ended with Christian Grey actor committing suicide, gave rise for a TV regulator to investigate whether the show complied with graphic content guidelines.
“The grim finale portrayed serial killer Paul Spector, played by Jamie Dornan, kill himself by suffocation,” reports Belfast Live. “The TV regulator last month confirmed they had launched an investigation after receiving complaints from viewers.”
“We investigated whether a depiction of suicide in this programme complied with our rules,” a spokesperson for Ofcom stated. “While we recognise that this was a challenging scene that had the potential to upset viewers, we concluded that it was justified by the overall context and broadcast well after the watershed.”
While Jamie Dornan is throwing himself into challenging work, Dakota Johnson also is dipping her feet into indie movies. According to IMDb, the next projects lined up for her are Suspiria and The Sound of Metal.
Knowing that Dakota comes from a line of Hollywood actresses, there might be a lot of pressure for her to leave her mark in the industry.
Her mother, Melanie Griffith, made a comment about their Hollywood legacy in a recent interview with Vanity Fair.
“The three generations just made me think about Mom, born in 1930, and me, in the 50s, and Dakota, in the 80s,” she said. “The progression of life is really beautiful.”
With Fifty Shades Darker coming out this Valentine’s Day, Jamie and Dakota are probably hoping that they get better reviews for their performance. If they are to continue to do well in Hollywood, the next two installments of Fifty Shades are critical.
