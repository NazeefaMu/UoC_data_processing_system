Research-Backed Benefits of Gardening
Grow Good Health

A home food garden offers a virtually free supply of fresh produce. But beyond this more obvious benefit, gardening provides a number of profound perks for your brain, body, and soul. Dig into the following research-backed facts about why gardening is good for you.
You might have noticed that school gardens are rapidly taking root and as a result, students are scoring higher on tests. You could argue that their improved academic performance is a result of the unique hands-on learning experience that a garden provides. And that certainly may be true. But it’s not the whole story because there’s evidence that growing plants — whether in class or at home —actually enhances your brain. For example, one study found that the act of gardening may lower your risk of dementia by as much as 36 per cent.
Plus, there’s also the element of nutrition. As you probably already know, eating lots of whole foods (i.e., what you’d plant in a garden) supports good health — specifically good physiological health. But all the antioxidants, vitamins, and other nutrients present in fruits and vegetables improve brain function, too.
When you grow plants, you’re more likely to eat them. And studies show that a plant-based diet can reduce your risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, while also helping you achieve your ideal weight, healthy organs, and even a longer life.
The crops you grow and eat bolster your body from the inside out. But the actual act of gardening bestows benefits, too. For starters, maintaining a garden keeps you moving. Considering many of us sit for too much of the day, this is important. An active lifestyle lowers your likelihood of obesity, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, stroke, depression, and more.
In addition, if you garden outside, you’ll also passively reap the benefits of sun exposure. Sunshine, of course, is a key source of vitamin D — which fortifies your bones and immune system.
Have you ever heard the anonymous quote, “Gardening is cheaper than therapy and you get tomatoes”? It turns out, there’s a lot of truth in the pithy saying.
Working in your garden can lower your levels of cortisol (i.e., the “stress hormone”), restore your energy, and — as astronauts have learned — generally lift your spirits. As if that’s not enough, growing a community garden with others can also combat feelings of loneliness.
In other words, growing food puts you in a good mood!
