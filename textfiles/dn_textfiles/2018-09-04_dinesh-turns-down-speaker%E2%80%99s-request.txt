Dinesh turns down Speaker’s request

Joint Opposition Leader Dinesh Gunawardene has turned down a request made by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to join his delegation to the Indian Lok Sabha.
Gunawardene accuses the delegation of trying to mislead the Indian Parliament on the true situation that exists in the Sri Lankan Parliament. He added that showing a Opposition Leader who only has the support of 16 MP in Parliament is misleading when the Joint Oppositon commands 70 MPs in the Opposition. Gunawardene has apprised the Speaker of his decision in writing. The Sri Lankan Parliamentary delegation headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is expected to leave for India on September 9.
