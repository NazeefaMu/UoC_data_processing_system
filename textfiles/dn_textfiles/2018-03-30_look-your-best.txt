Look your best

VLCC introduced a new international range of facial treatments targeting those who suffer with problematic skin. The newly introduced Stem Cellogist (anti-ageing) Treatment is designed using Alps Botanical Stem Cells extracted from a type of apples grown only in the Swiss Alps and Telomeres, a Nobel Prize-winning discovery which helps achieve youthful skin. The treatment targets to achieve five anti-ageing functions such as regeneration, reconstruction, protection, nutrition and hydration and treats skin issues such as ageing skin, mature skin, and premature ageing skin. Reduction of fine lines, pigmentation, redefined pores, improved luminosity and increased hydration, firmness, smoothness, and suppleness are among a few of the results that one can achieve by undergoing these treatments.
With over 300 locations in India and around the world of which two are based in Sri Lanka, VLCC offers beauty treatment in scientifically advanced packages to meet the individual needs of the client.
