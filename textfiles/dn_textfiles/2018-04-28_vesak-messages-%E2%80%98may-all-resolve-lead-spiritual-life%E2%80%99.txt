Vesak Messages : ‘May all resolve to lead spiritual life’

The dawn of Vesak Pasalosvaka Poya Day in the Buddhist calendar, marking the Birth, Enlightenment and Passing Away of the Buddha, is an important occasion for Buddhists throughout the world, said Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter.
In a message marking Vesak, the Thera said: “The commemoration of Vesak Day began in India during the dynasty of King Dharmashoka after the Sambuddha Parinibbana. This festival began in Sri Lanka with the arrival of Arhant Mahinda to Sri Lanka during the rule of King Devanampiyathissa.
“Our chronicle says that this festival was celebrated on a grand scale in Sri Lanka during the rule of Kings Dutugemunu, Walagamba, Maha Parakramabahu and Maha Vijayabahu.
“Buddhist all over the world engaged in meritorious deeds that include offering alms to the members of the less privileged community and organizing meditation programs. They lead lives with a special focus on spiritual development.
“The incumbent government, following the footprints of our ancient Kings, has made arrangements to hold the State Vesak Festival at Bingiriya Rajamaha Viharaya on a grand scale. This festival is organized by the all-Island Shashanarakshaka Bala Mandalaya, together with the Buddhist Affairs Department and Buddhasasana Ministry.
“May all resolve to lead a spiritual life with the blessings of the Noble Triple Gem on this day.”
‘Greatest day of significance to Buddhists’
Vesak Pasalosvaka Poya Day, which marks the Birth, Enlightenment and Parinibbana of Siddharta Gauthama Buddha, is the greatest day of significance to Buddhists throughout the world, said Mahanayake of Asgiriya Chapter Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera.
The Mahanayake Thera issuing a message in view of Vesak stated, “the word Buddha means comprehension. The world ‘Thathagatha’ means the realization of the truth.”
The Most Venerable Mahanayaka Thera said, “Siddharta Gauthama Buddha, who worked with unmatched courage, self sacrifice and non-violence, completed ten-fold perfections from the time He made a determination to attain Buddhahood and rendered a great service to humankind and world peace for 45 years.
“There is no greater service than this in the history of the world.
“May one and all resolve to lead a prosperous life while making arrangements to propagate the dhamma throughout the world,” the Ven Thera said.
‘Let light of reconciliation shine’
It is a great privilege to extend my good wishes to all Buddhist devotees, commemorating the three most significant events in the life of the Buddha, stated Leader of the Opposition R. Sampanthan, in his message marking Vesak.
“The Buddha made a vast social change eliminating various disparities and divisions that prevailed among the communities, treating equally all human beings ensuring that no one gets superior or inferior status by birth.
“We should get together to free this land, which was made sacred by the Buddha’s visits, from war, conflict and suffering and establish permanent peace providing equal rights and justice to every community living in our country.
“Let us illuminate our land through the light of reconciliation enriched with peace and solidarity on this great Vesak Day.
“I wish you all a happy Vesak celebration!”
