Trump takes on multiple targets in trade war

President Donald Trump has launched a trade war, principally against China. But in doing so he has also aimed at some erstwhile US allies, including Canada, the European Union, Japan and Mexico. In intransigently following protectionist policies he is undermining the rule-based world trading system guided by the GATT and followed by the WTO subsequently.
In fact the present trading system is more the work of the United States as it emerged as the most powerful economic and political power at the end of World War II. It is an irony of history that the United States has also threatened to withdraw from the WTO if the latter sides with US opponents in a trade dispute sent for arbitration.
Apparently President is following a hard inflexible stand which could be termed both naïve and self-defeating. This is in stark contrast with the pragmatism he displayed on the Korean issue.
It all began on June 1 with the US imposing a 25 percent tariff on European Aluminum and Steel goods imports to the United States. Then on June 15 President Trump announced a US $ 50 billion tariffs on metal imports to the United States.
As a major trading partner these tariffs hurt China most. China has promised to retaliate in equal measure.
A spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said: “We want no trade war with anyone, but if our hand is forced, we will not quail nor recoil from it. Therefore, if the day did come when the US take measures to hurt our interests, we will definitely take firm counter-measures to safeguard our legitimate interests.”
In fact it has already imposed a US $ 50 billion tariff on US goods, mainly on agricultural and energy goods imported from the United States. On June 15 President Trump imposed another US $ 200 billion tariff on imports from China. Another $ 200 billion tariff is also on the way.
US tariff increases have affected Canada, its main trade partner and neighbour. Canada has also retaliated with £ 12.5 billion tariff on US imports.
The European Union is worried over the US action. It will also retaliate with tariff increases. It has announced £ 2.4 billion tariffs on US imports, especially on aluminum and steel goods. In addition, Mexico has also imposed US $ 3 billion tariff on US imports.
Obviously the consequences will be adverse for most economies including that of the United States, China, the European Union, Japan, Korea and Mexico.
In fact, no country will be immune from the shocks that will be generated by these developments. The possibility of a world depression cannot be ruled out. Opinions differ on who would be affected more – China or the United States. Stock markets have plummeted in both countries. Consumers in both countries will suffer due to higher prices of imports, in turn reducing the volume of trade. Investments would decline.
Since the sales of US firms are over 50 percent in foreign markets they will be seriously affected. For example, energy and industry product are respectively sold 59 and 57 percent in foreign markets.
The number of unemployed will reach 8 million in the US and the economy would grow slower with the prospect of a lower GDP.
It is expected that the United States will face an economic recession in 2019.
Israel grabs more Palestine territory
Israel has launched an operation to make more inroads into Palestine territory under its policy of colonial expansion. They not only violate the United Nations resolutions barring such practice but also openly boast about it. For example Education Minister Naftali Bennett has said that “The West Bank and all settlements around it will soon be a part of Israel”. The Military has given instructions to civilian authorities to demolish Palestine houses and other facilities and evict Palestinians to build Jewish settlements.
Israel has become so aggressive due to the political support and military assistance provided by the United States. In an expression of solidarity with Israel the United States transferred its Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem amidst widespread protests. Recently the United States withdrew from the membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) alleging “bias against Israel”. These actions by Israel threaten the two- State solution proposed by the international community as a peaceful resolution to the long drawn-out Palestine question.
Hence, international solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinians fighting for their right to live freely in their motherland is required more than ever before. Unfortunately the disunity of the Palestine liberation movements and the lukewarm attitude of some Arab regimes of the area and their subservience to the United States pose problems for the liberation movement.
However, the Palestinian struggle cannot be subdued and it is getting stronger even under most tragic conditions.
