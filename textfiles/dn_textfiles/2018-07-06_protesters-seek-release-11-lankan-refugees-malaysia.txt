Protesters seek release of 11 Lankan refugees in Malaysia

Activists have vowed to continue staging protests to seek the release of 11 Sri Lankan refugees awaiting deportation in Johor, Malaysia, Nan­ban reported.
They are part of a group of 131 people held on June 24 off the coast of Kota Tinggi while trying to reach New Zealand by boat from Sri Lanka.
After being brought to a court in Kota Tinggi, 120 of the refugees were freed but the other 11 were sent to a detention camp in Pekan Nanas and ordered to be deported.
