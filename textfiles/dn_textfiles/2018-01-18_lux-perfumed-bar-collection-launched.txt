Lux perfumed bar collection launched

Unilever’s iconic brand Lux, which has been a household name for generations and has a 75year old presence in Sri Lanka, with a range of beauty soap and the latest eight hour long lasting fragrance of Magical Spell body wash, has now introduced a premium, perfumed soap, ‘The Lux Perfumed Bar Collection’ to local users.
The whole range of Lux, was brought to life, at yet another spectacular House of Lux, on January 16, at the magnificent Shangri-La Ballroom.
For decades, Lux has won the hearts of every Sri Lankan woman and has become a favourite household brand that has understood and celebrated the intricate nuances of the modern woman. “Lux celebrates the everyday woman’s extraordinary power through perfume. She’s more today than she was yesterday - and we’d like to remind her of that tomorrow, and for every moment thereafter”, said Category Head Skin Cleansing and Baby of Unilever, Dinusha Ekanayake.
“Welcome to an immersive fragrance experience that brings perfume alive” said Sharmila Bandara, the Marketing Director-Personal Care at Unilever. “It is essential for the modern woman, to express her femininity unapologetically and consistently, and we encourage her to explore it every day.
That is why Lux, is perhaps the world’s most recognizable and iconic beauty brand.”
Since its humble beginnings in the early 1900s, Lux has been the favourite amongst iconic women. It is owing to the impeccable standards and meticulous care that goes into crafting every bar of soap to be the perfect Lux bar. Today, Lux champions every woman to be iconic – to be a star that is unapologetic in her femininity and her charm.
“The new Perfumed Bar Collection is premium to others in the marketplace, and above even the core Lux range.
This is simply because the perfumed collection involves much more attention in terms of the ingredients which go into making it, and the fragrances and technology used in the production of the perfumed bar collection come at a large cost to Unilever as well.
The product, whilst priced only just above the core range delivers the value of fragrance and overall shower experience manifolds over.
It is amazing that we have been able to make this product available to our Sri Lankan consumers” said Inura Jayasuriya- Brand Manager Lux for Unilever Sri Lanka.
“In their 75 year legacy in Sri Lanka, Lux has proved over and over that a bold, innovative spirit is what paves the way to a revolutionary future.
We remain in the hearts of our consumers as the best soap to indulge in and we hope to continue in our innovative pursuits so that our fans can continue to excite and ignite their everyday” said Channa Tennakoon Head of Media and Activations for Unilever Sri Lanka.
