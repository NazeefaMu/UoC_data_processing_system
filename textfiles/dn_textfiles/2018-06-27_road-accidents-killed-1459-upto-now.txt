Road indiscipline of Sri Lankans is the main cause for road traffic accidents, Traffic Police Division Deputy Director ASP W.D.A. Dhananjaya said.
By June 25 this year (2018) 1,459 persons had been killed due to road traffic accidents.Annually 900 pedestrians die while trying to cross the road, he said.
The ASP said that annually around 3,000 get killed due to road accidents and one third of the total number of accidents related deaths occur due to road accidents.
Twenty three people are killed daily due to accidents and nearly 9,000 deaths are reported annually due to accidents, Health Ministry’s Non Communicable Diseases Unit Director Dr. Thilak Siriwardana said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) in Colombo yesterday he said the majority of the persons who get killed due to accidents belong to the productive age.
Motor Traffic Department’s Assistant Commissioner (Technical) J.A.S. Jayaweera said that at the moment there are 7.1 million registered vehicles in Sri Lanka and 5.2 million of them ply on the roads.
“The number of drivers can be similar. But the issue is 80 percent of them are not safe.Three wheelers and motor bicycles are considered unsafe and people should be discouraged from buying them,” he said.
