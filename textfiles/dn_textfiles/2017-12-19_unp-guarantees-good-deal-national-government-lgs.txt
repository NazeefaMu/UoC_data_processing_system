UNP guarantees good deal from national government for LGs

“The United National Party in national government is fixing the mistakes of the past regime to build a stronger economy, because without a strong economy we cannot provide necessary funds to local governments,” United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said while welcoming the announcement that the date for the Local Government Elections is set for February 10, 2018.
“In the 2018 Budget, the UNP in national government committed over Rs. 25 billion for all activities at the local government level next year so they can develop roads, improve local health amenities, provide clean drinking water and keep garbage off our streets.
“Only by voting for the UNP locally can you guarantee a good deal from national government for your area. And only the UNP’s carefully selected, honest and educated local candidates have the knowledge and ability to deliver for you and your family.
“This election is close and every vote counts. Don’t risk the future of your local area by voting for any other candidate or by not voting, which is effectively the same as voting for another party.
“So, at the local government elections, make sure you cast your vote for the UNP to secure development in your local area and stick with the UNP’s plan to build a stronger economy,” the Prime Minister’s message said.
