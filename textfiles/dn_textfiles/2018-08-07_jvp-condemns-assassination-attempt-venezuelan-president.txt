JVP condemns assassination attempt on Venezuelan President

JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake, issuing a statement yesterday, condemned the assassination attempt on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
“It is with concern we came to know about the failed cowardly assassination attempt on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. According to the media, the assassination attempt was made using several drones loaded with explosives while President Maduro was delivering the closing speech on the 81st Anniversary of the National Guard,” the statement said.
“Assassination attempts on progressive leaders when they cannot be overthrown democratically, economically, politically, and militarily is the last attempt by imperialist conspirators who would not hesitate to deploy the extreme rightist opposition in the country to carry out their schemes,” Dissanayake stated.
“We, as the JVP, vehemently condemned the cowardly attack and are relieved that no harm has come to President Maduro, who we are sure, would be more determined to continue with added vigour the progressive process he is heading in Venezuela.
"The JVP always stands with progressive and left forces and their leaders and condemn all attempts by imperialists and their lackeys to deny the cause of progressive social transformation of its front-runners,” he added.
