UNP Politburo meets again today

The UNP Politburo which met to decide on 26 new positions under the party’s restructuring process failed to arrive at a decision yesterday.
“The Politburo is to meet again at 5 pm today to discuss the matter further,” sources within the UNP said.
The Politburo which was formed recently to allow second tier UNPers more access to the decision making centres of the party has 12 members.
Yesterday’s meeting follows a similar pattern to that of last week’s Politburo meeting which also concluded with no decision made on the posts.
The only major decision to come from the meeting was to allow party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe choose the General Secretary while the Deputy and Assistant Leaders, National Organiser, Treasurer and other positions would be elected.
Given the stalemate the Politburo is facing, sources stated that if they do not reach a decision on the posts today (25), they would call for a vote where members would be elected through a ‘secret ballot’ when the Working Committee meets on April 26.
UNP MPs Mangala Samaraweera, Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Eran Wickremaratne, Harin Fernando, Nalin Bandara, Navin Dissanayake, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, J.C.Alawathuwala, Ruwan Wijewardane, Ajith Perera, Ravi Karunanayake and Sajith Premadasa are part of the Politburo.
