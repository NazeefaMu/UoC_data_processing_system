Triposha turns to rusk with Japanese connection

Today most of the state-owned enterprises (SOE) are depended on government handouts for their survival and most of them also are huge white elephants. However Sri Lanka Thriposha is slowly and surely breaking off from this notorious tradition and is reversing it.
The institution produces the nutritional meal for kids known for several decades as Thiposha which is distributed free of charge through the Medical Officers of Health from their factory in Ja Ela. Due to its large production Thirosha is also distributed in a special goods train.

History...
The Thriposha programme was initiated in Sri Lanka in 1973 with the assistance of CARE institution in Canada and with the assistance of USA.
Production of Thriposha was initiated with the objective of providing a nutritious additional food to people in Sri Lanka with nutritious requirements. This additional food, which in the beginning, was imported from the U.S.A. was packed in Sri Lanka.
Ministry of Health gave its contribution to this project from 1976. The Management of Thriposha Project was transferred to the Ministry of Health by CARE institution in 1976. Consequently, on the tenders called for selection of a Company suitable for its management, the Ceylon Tobacco Company was selected for the purpose. Subsequently, a tri-partite agreement was signed among that Company, the Ministry of Health and CARE institution. From then on, the Ceylon Tobacco Company was responsible for its management up to 2010.
This entity was registered as a fully government owned Company belonging to the Ministry of Health by the name of Sri Lanka Thriposha Ltd., on 07.09.2010 under registration no. P.B.3873 under the Companies Act no. 07 of 2007.
After taken over by the government under the ambit of the Ministry of Health, the entity was subjected to many positive changes and various actions were taken to increase production by encouraging the staff. The entity claimed a progress as a result of action taken such as installation of new machinery and worker welfare activities.
The additional food of Thriposha claims a prominent place as a nutritional food very close to the hearts of Sri Lankans. They have identified its flavor and nutritional value for 40 years.
Thriposha is highly helpful to cater to the nutritional deficiencies that cannot be fulfilled by the main diet. A pregnant mother, or a breast feeding mother or an infant with nutritional deficiencies will receive two 750g packets of Thriposha each per month free of charge. It is proper to provide only the child suffering from nutrition deficiencies with an amount of 50g of Thriposha per a day. 

For the first time the company’s history it has provided over Rs. 1.75 million back to the State coffers from its profits. Since being a welfare nutritional meal making company, Thiposha is not authorized to sell their products.
Each year the government provides us a financial injection to make Thiposha and I saw that this has to be reversed, said Thriposha Chairman, M. D. Bandusena speaking to ‘Daily News Business’ new feature “MEET THE CHAIRMAN.”
“Then together with our Research and Development team we decided to look at manufacturing another product which we can sell to the masses and this is how Saposha was born”.
He said that Saposha which was introduced to the market last year is sweeter and has a different formula.
“Suposha product launch ceremony was held at Waters Edge Reception Hall Battaramulla. The new product is fast catching the market and it’s this profit that we gave back to the government.”
He said that the success of this product must also be attributed to the new machinery that was installed few years ago. “Thiposha was running with ageing machinery and there were regular machines breakdowns which slowed our production process. “Sometimes machines have to be shut down for several weeks till the spare parts arrived from USA.”
Many times we failed to meet our production targets due to this.”
He recalled that when this issue was brought to the notice of the then Minister of Health and now President Maithripala Sirisena in 2014 he immediately intervened and allocated finances to buy new machines which resulted in the increase of productivity and reducing production cost.
The former Health Minister, allocated Rs. 500 million from Budget 2016 to purchase and install new machine. In Budget 2015, the annual allocation for Thriposha was Rs 2.5 billion.
These machines were then imported from USA and after their installation we were able to not only meet the demand but there was also a surplus.
Then we decided to look for a byproduct and this is how ‘Suposha’ was born and this is turning out to be a very profitable venue.
Suposha supplement provides energy, protein and vitamins and minerals. It consists of locally grown maize, corn, soya, non-fat dried milk, minerals and vitamins.
The intention of the introduction of this product is to provide the cereal to everyone which was limited only to expectant mothers as well as infants under the freely distributed Thriposha’ programme.
“This along with several other prudent masseurs helped the company to also pose a net profit of Rs. 103 million last year.”
Enter the rusk industry
The Chairman said that they also made advances towards one of the leading Japanese rusk manufactures to tie up with Sri Lanka Thriposha and make rusks in Sri Lanka.
“We had several rounds of discussion and will install one more machine and the rusk which is yet to be branded would be available end of the year.”
Sri Lanka Thriposha is also looking at the possibility of providing the raw material to produce Thriposha to the Japanese company and for the first time in the history earn foreign exchange.
“We also hope to manufacture part of their ‘Rusks’ in Sri Lanka and re-export since its more economical for them to import it.
Bandusena said that they have also briefed Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne under whose purview Thriposha Company is and he too has endorsed this.
Current production of the Sri Lanka Thriposha Ltd. monthly has hit 2,700 metric tonnes. 1,800 metric tonnes is being distributed over 1.2 million beneficiaries islandwide under the Thriposha programme implemented with the support of the funds from the Department of Treasuries of the Government.
The excess 900 metric tonnes is now being sold as Suposha and this excess would also used to make ‘rusk’.
A bonus for employees
For the first time in the history of the company a a 10% bonus to all employees were paid.
The Chairman said that the company also opened a new sales outlet at Ja Ela to make their products available to the public. “In addition we also have 40 sales agents island-wide who sell the additional production of Thriposha.”
Before paying bonuses to the employees, Minister Senaratne who was the Chief Guest for this ceremony also opened the new machine worth Rs. 100 million installed with the aim of automating the entire production process.
Earlier, 75% of the Thriposha production was handled with machines while the rest of the 25% was handled with human labour. “This will further reduce our costs and increase production.”
Every year Thriposha programme distributes two packets per each recipient which adds up to over 2.4 million packets of Thriposha. Every recipient is being supported with 1.5 Kg of Thriposha monthly since the daily requirement is approximately 50 gram per person that totals to 1,800 metric tonnes.
He said that they will also pay more for local farmer products opening up a new avenue of opportunities in the agricultural sector and helping the rural economy. It would also create an additional SME industry.”
“We are also looking at regional exporters and launched our website to have better interaction with our local and would be foreign buyers.”
Thriposha also built a special raw material storage facility recently and are hoping to further invest Rs. 250 million for an additional one.
“This will help us to further reduce costs of production.” Bandusena said he is turning around Thriposha from a 100% government dependent SOE to a profit making entirety and I am sure we will be able to be a financially self-sufficient institution before 2020.”
