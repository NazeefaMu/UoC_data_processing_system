Falsely accused SL student returns from Australia

Sri Lankan student, Mohamed Kamer Nilan Nizamdeen, who was falsely accused of terror charges in Australia, returned to the island on Sunday night.
He was arrested by the Australian Police on allegations of planning to bomb key areas in the country. He was later released as charges proved to be baseless. He thanked the President and government for assisting him in his release.
Speaking at the Bandaranaike International Airport arrival lounge, he also thanked all ethnic communities in Sri Lanka for standing by him and for supporting him as a fellow Sri Lankan.
