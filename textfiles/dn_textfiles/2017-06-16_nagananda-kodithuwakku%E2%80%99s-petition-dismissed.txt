Nagananda Kodithuwakku’s petition dismissed

A writ petition filed by a public interests litigation activist seeking a Mandamus Order directing the Bribery Commission to initiate a credible and independent investigation into the abuse of the Tax-free permit scheme by 85 Government and Opposition Parliamentarians was yesterday dismissed by Supreme Court on the ground that there is no basis to proceed with the petition.
The petition had been filed by Attorney-at-law Nagananda Kodituwakku naming the Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery or Corruption Commission  which has failed to perform their statutory duty on the plausible complaint made on corruption against members of parliament and the Cabinet of Ministers who have patently abused the public office to defraud the government’s tax-revenue for unjust enrichment.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne with State Counsel Suren Gnanaraj appearing for the Bribery Commission informed court that the Bribery Commission has initiated an investigation into the incident. He said there is no necessity to proceed with the petition since the Bribery Commission has already indicated an investigation into the complaint.
The Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justices Upali Abeyratne and Anil Goonaratne. The Finance Minister’s deliberate action has paved the way for the loss of government revenue of over 7 billion rupees and as at December 9, 2016, 85 expensive vehicles have been imported evading the tax component of over 33 million rupees for eachvehicle.
Most of the vehicles imported by those who have purchased the permits have been registered with the Department of Motor Traffic first in the name of the permit holder MP and then immediately afterwards transferred in the name of the buyers of the permits.
