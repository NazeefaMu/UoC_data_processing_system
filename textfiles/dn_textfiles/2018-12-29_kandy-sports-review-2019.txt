KANDY SPORTS ROUND-UP:
Kandy sports review for 2019

In two days time, another year will come to an end and it is appropriate to take a look at sports development in Kandy. Over the years Kandy has established a proud record of having produced some of the top most sportsmen/sportswomen in all fields. Successful sportsmen and sportswomen from Kandy can be proud of their achievements for the year. This was possible due to the keenness and backing they got from their parents, schools, clubs and coaches. What Kandy requires now is the backing from the Sports Minister to uplift sports at club level. Although Kandy has several sports bodies they need to get actively involved at the highest levels. Kandy’s urgent need is a proper ground facility. During the time when the Bogambara Stadium was under the Municipal Council, sports flourished in Kandy. The respective sports bodies were able to pocket out the ground fee, but today the ground fee is 20 times more than what it was. The sporting fraternity of Kandy hopes that the new Sports Minister Harin Fernando will focus on sports in Kandy and shower his goodies.
RUGBY - Has become the king of local club sports, as the speed and intensity of the game increases and the number of phases of play multiplies. Players tend to become somewhat oblivious to their basic roles in retaining possession and maintaining continuity of the game. Kandy Sports Club has been dominating the rugby scene for nearly two and a half decades. They have won the League, Clifford Cup and the Sevens tournaments for many years, which no other club has done so far. Kandy SC have also fed the National team with the most number of players. At present at the end of the league first round they are heading the table. Most of the schools, play the game at the highest level Trinity, Kingswood, St. Anthony's, Vidyartha, Dharmarajah, St. Sylvester’s, Sri Rahula and Sri Sumangala. At rugby old boys give a big support and sponsors too come in. Tickets are priced high at matches, still fans go because for their love for the game.
CRICKET - The game of cricket takes pride of place at school level. All schools are doing well in all age groups. Sad to say, the standard of club cricket has dropped due to poor organization. Hence, the best products from schools join clubs outside Kandy. Kandy should be proud of their cricket. They have produced the best spinner in the game Muthiah Muralitharan and also a world class bat in Kumar Sangakkara. At one time cricket was one of the most popular games, and took pride of place. Today it is not so at club level.
FOOTBALL - It was at one time the most popular sport, known as the common man's game. It has sadly taken a back seat in the recent past. Kandy was once a powerhouses of Sri Lanka club football. But today it is in a forgotten state. The game is sadly neglected. For many years, tournaments and AGM’s have not been held. The FFSL is not showing any interest in Kandy football. It is time they woke from their deep slumber and started to move the game of football in Kandy towards the right direction. Schools continue their football thanks to the Kandy Education Department, tournaments are held. The controlling body is blind and they do nothing to promote the game.
HOCKEY - This game has become very popular among the schools. Girl schools dominate the game in Kandy, boys schools too are somewhat on the same level. Club hockey continues, and clubs are doing their best to come back to the game. But lack of proper support from the main body of the country and no proper grounds for the game is a severe drawback.
BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER - The cue game has taken a nosedive in Kandy. There are no tournaments as in the early days. In the past there were Inter-club matches, but now it has deteriorated. In the early days, Kings Cue Club earned a name in this sport, Catholic Club at one time gave their best but now the club is no more, Lawn Club too is no more, Public Services Club members use the cue on and off, Mahanuwara YMBA is the only place where the game is promoted. Kandy YMMA, the founder members of Sri Lanka Billiards and Snooker Association who dominated cue sports at one time has ignored the game in the last ten years. Same with Kandy Garden Club. At Kandy Club visiting members play the game for fun. Peradeniya Faculty Club at one time took the game very seriously and the tournaments were a great recreation to many.
SWIMMING - It has caught up from recent times, thanks to schools, especially Mahamaya, Hillwood and Trinity who dominate the support. They have produced several top champion teams, with individual rankings at the top. Now Dharmaraja and Kingswood too are in the swim, with many more schools willing to follow if they can be helped with a pool.
BOXING - This sport remains a popular among the schools. One time kings of the ring St. Sylvester's won the Stubbs, same with Trinity the first school who took to the sport in 1906 are doing well. This time they won the T.B. Jayah event. St. Sylvester’s one time boxing kings, has come back to the ring with a sterling performance and won the Stubbs Shield boxing meet after a lapse of 10 years. Other schools like Peradeniya MMV, Sarasavi Uyana, Dharmaraja, Vidyartha, Kingswood are all doing well. The first school which donned gloves, YMCA and gave a big hand at one time are also back.
NETBALL - Schools in Kandy are doing well in this sport and have taken part in most of the tournaments organized by the governing body. Girls High School, Hillwood, Mahamaya, St Anthony's Convent, Pushpadana, Swarnamali, Hemamali, Kandy Convent, and all the International schools are taking the game seriously, especially CIS, Gateway and Ecole,
ATHLETICS - All schools have athletics in the curriculum and are doing very well in this field. Every school promotes it in the correct way and have their annual inter-house athletics meet on a grand scale. They have produced some of the top athletes both at boys and girls level. They must bring back the marathon race, which was at one time was very popular.
TABLE TENNIS - In Kandy this game was very popular, but all of a sudden, it nosedived. There is some hope as there are many schools and clubs who are capable of bringing the game back to its former glory.
BADMINTON - There is somewhat a lack of interest in this sport. Something must be done to lift the game. There are not many coaches and should the schools take the cue, then the game can pick up.
VOLLEYBALL - It is the national sport of Sri Lanka but cricket has gone ahead and is the most popular sport. At a certain time volleyball was a popular game, and today the much needed support is not there for the game. If the proper backing is there, this game too, could be making the news.
IRON SPORT - Bodybuilding and Weightlifting is given the best possible support by the YMCA. It is a top sport in Kandy, hence its domination. Several national title holders have been produced.
BASKETBALL - Kandy continues to produce talented players. Most of the schools who play basketball have done well and have won many tournaments. It is the same in the club sector.
CYCLING - This sport was popular in Kandy and there had been races on many an occasion. For it to be competitive there has to be sponsorship and then the sport will spread. In the early days there was a cycle race from Kandy to Matale and back.
CHESS - Although chess has been popular in schools for quite a long period, most of the boys and girls schools are promoting it well including some International schools.
KARATE - The youngsters have done well in tournaments held in Sri Lanka and abroad. Now schools are giving a big backing for karate.
SOFTBALL CRICKET - It is very popular in Kandy. Every Sunday on or on a public holiday tournaments are organized by many individuals for various trophies. Today this is a good money making tournament.
CARROM: It is a popular sport in Kandy among schools and government departments too are taking a great interest as a recreation sport. At one time municipal community centers gave a big hand for carrom, now schools have taken over.
LAWN TENNIS - At one time it was a popular sport in Kandy. It is the Kandy Lawn Cub (now no more), Kandy Garden Club, and University of Peradeniya gave their best to the sport. Trinity and Hillwood are also involved in big way.
GOLF - Trinity College gives a big hand for golf, and they have produced some top golfers. The Victoria Golf Club located on the outskirts of Kandy is one club which has golfing tournaments and they showcase and test the golfing skills of all participants.
BASEBALL - This sport is sure to hit the top, most of the boys and girls are keen to take up the game and produce good results. The governing body should give a hand to promote the game.
MOTOR-RACING – At one time when top motor sport promoters were involved motor racing produced many events and also riders and drivers. Today the sport is there only for the name sake and they just paint the vehicles and go round the town without any competition. In the early days there were races round the lake. Even the hill climb at Wesspark, Hanthana, Digana, Kotmale are in the dark today. At one time Up-Country Motors Sports Club was the live wire for motor sports.-Country Motor Sports Clubp-Country Motor Sports Club
