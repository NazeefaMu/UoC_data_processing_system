Lawn Tennis is in the dark
Lawn tennis one-time was a very popular sport in Kandy. It was Kandy Lawn Cub, Kandy Garden Club, University of Peradeniya and Kandy Police who took to the sport during the late DIG Bodi Liyanage’s time and a tennis court came out at Asgiriya. Today that court is not in use. Schools like Trinity, Girls High School and Hillwood were involved in a big way at one time.
But sad to say today this sport has more or less lost its identity. Today at Garden Club only private coaching is taking place.
