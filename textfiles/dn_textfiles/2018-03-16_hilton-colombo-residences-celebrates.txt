Hilton Colombo Residences celebrates

Hilton Colombo Residences celebrates twenty years of presence in Sri Lanka. The momentous journey will be celebrated with guests, Team Members, and the community alike throughout 2018.
The 20th Anniversary celebrations will be kicked-off with the launch of a newly-designed logo and refreshed collateral both designed especially to mark the milestone celebration. Hilton Colombo Residences launched Hilton’s ‘Meet with Purpose’ program in April 2017 - to inspire meetings and events planners in the region to organize healthier, more mindful and more sustainable events in a seamless and cost-effective manner – and all collateral will reflect this sustainable approach.
The hotel also plans to celebrate its loyal patrons and guests during the year and has embarked on a series of projects that will give back to the local community, focusing on the themes of diversity, inclusion and training women for leadership roles.
“Sri Lanka has always presented great growth opportunities for Hilton. Last year alone, we signed seven new hotels, more than quadrupling our total footprint in the country to nine hotels,” said, Vice President Operations, South East Asia Paul Hutton.
“As one of the first global hospitality companies to enter the country, we continue to be committed to contributing to the country’s growing travel and tourism section with initiatives focused on nurturing talent within the local community, local sourcing and enhancing efficiency within our own operations. We are particularly excited about our on-going partnership with Room to Read which aims to deliver literary and skills training programs to the local youth in Sri Lanka,” he added.
“Throughout its 20 years of operation, Hilton Colombo Residences has been home to thousands of guests. Our team ensures that every guest feels welcomed and cared for in line with Hilton’s mission of being the most hospitable company in the world.
Over the years, we have had many reasons to celebrate – the launch of the newly built Union Ballroom in 2012, a new wing of rooms built of Level 28, and most recently, our newly-built dining outlets BASICO Bar Lounge and FLOW.
We’re constantly evolving to meet the changing needs of our guests and Team Members,” said Hilton Colombo Residences, General Manager, Karim Schadlou,. In addition to this, the hotel has renovated all its suites from Level 31 to 13 and will continue renovations in a cascaded manner.
The celebrations which commenced March 13 and will be featured on the hotel’s social media channels.
