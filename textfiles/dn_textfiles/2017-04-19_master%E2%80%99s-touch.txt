Master’s touch

“An Evening of Russian Masterpieces” will be held on May 2 at the Lionel Wendt Theater at 7.30pm.
Performed by Russian pianist Maxim Puryzhinskiy and Sri Lanka’s Ananda Dabare and Dushyanthi Perera, this evening promises a rare musical treat to discerning music lovers.
Maxim Puryzhinskiy thrilled audiences, last November, when he gave an exhilarating performance of Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2. Maxim’s technical skills were clearly evident with his powerful but emotive rendition of this beloved concerto. He will commence the evening’s program by playing one of Rachmaninoff’s most famous compositions - the Prelude in C sharp Minor. He will, thereafter, accompany Ananda Dabare (violin) and Dushyanthi Perera (Cello) in their performances of Tchaikovsky’s Meditation and Rachmaninoff’s Vocalise respectively.
Dushyanthi Perera
Rachmaninoff’s Prelude in C sharp minor begins with a forceful three note motif, sometimes called “The Bells of Moscow”. This piece is described as one of his “most masterfully crafted compositions” and is matched in popularity only by the Piano Concerto No. 2.
Tchaikovsky’s Meditation in D Minor was intended to be the slow movement of the Violin Concerto in D but he realized it was too slight for a concerto. Instead he used it as the first movement of a three part work for violin and piano. The Meditation is now performed as an independent work and remains in the repertoire as an impassioned miniature with a lyricism worthy of its distinguished composer.
One of the composer’s most popular creations, Rachmaninoff’s “The Vocalise” is often heard in a plethora of arrangements of vocal and instrument combinations. The melodic line is however, arguably, enriched and revealed when it is played on a stringed instrument with its original piano support.
The highlight of the evening will be when these three master musicians combine to perform Tchaikovsky’s Piano Trio in A minor, regarded as one of the greatest pieces for this combination of instruments. Written in tribute to Nikolai Rubinstein, the founder of the Moscow Conservatory and Tchaikovsky’s professional and personal mentor, this piece is meant to move the listeners and to move them deeply. Many Russians consider this Trio one of Tchaikovsky’s greatest “tragic” works. But it is also regarded as a “warm and passionate” piece “filled with Tchaikovsky’s broad and lovely melodies”. Completed in January 1882, Tchaikovsky dedicated the work ‘In Memory of a Great Artist’.
This will be the first time that this extremely challenging and complex work will be performed in Sri Lanka. This work is considered harder to play than any of Tchaikovsky’s concertos and demands virtuoso powers from the soloists, in terms of technique and stamina.
Along with Russia’s Maxim Puryzhinskiy, Sri Lanka’s foremost violinist, Ananda Dabare and Sri Lanka’s foremost Cellist, Dushyanthi Perera will showcase their virtuoso skills as they take on the challenge of performing this masterpiece in the repertoire.
Do not miss out on this unique opportunity to hear these master musicians in concert. Presented by the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka, “An Evening of Russian Music”, is part of the ongoing Earle de Fonseka Trust Chamber Music Concert series.
Tickets and box plan will be available at the Lionel Wendt Theatre from April 20.
