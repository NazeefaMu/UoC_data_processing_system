It is the latest in a series of product innovations and renovations by the Maggi brand to encourage the younger generation to indulge in more home cooking, and cook tasty meals as part of a balanced diet,” states a press release issued by Nestle.
“Maggi Pazzta is entering the market with a promise to convert even an amateur cook into a veritable gourmet chef” said Vice President - Food at Nestlé Priyadarshinie Karunaratne, in the same press release.. “It’s a great first dish for young men and women who want to attempt cooking and make a good first impression.

With a series of funny posts and videos of a young man looking to win over the love of his life, #BeCheesy unveils Maggie Pazzta as a cool, fun, creative and easy way to cook. Maggi Pazzta seeks to help the new generation of men and women ‘Taste the new language of Love’ and drive home the idea that men too can cook.”
Tthe Maggi range of products include Noodles, Coconut Milk Powder, Seasoning and Soup Cubes; all of which are must-haves in every kitchen across the country for their taste, convenience and goodness, and which are fortified where appropriate with vegetables, spices, grains and essential micronutrients. Leveraging on the strong brand recognition enjoyed by Maggi in Sri Lanka, all-new Maggi Pazzta joins the Maggi product range to help the brand cater to millennial consumers, and also offer a range of products to enjoy at every eating occasion.
