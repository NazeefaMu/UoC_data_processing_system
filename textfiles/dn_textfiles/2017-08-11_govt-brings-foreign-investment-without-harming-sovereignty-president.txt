Govt brings foreign investment without harming sovereignty: President

The government policy is to bring foreign investment in a way which will not harm the country’s sovereignty, President Maithripala Sirisena said on Wednesday.
The President was addressing an intellectual dialogue at the BMICH to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka.
President Sirisena said when entering into agreements with a foreign country or a company regarding investments, a special clause will be included stating that in any way, land ownership is not assigned to anyone and only the necessities of a particular investment will be fulfilled.
President Sirisena said that when developing the country, the assistance of the economically powerful nations is needed.
The government has been able to get the assistance of countries through a friendly and cordial foreign policy, he said.
The government was able to reduce many negative impacts on Sri Lanka internationally during the past two and a half years, the President said.
The people can see the fruitful consequences of the steps taken by the government to increase foreign exchange reserves and to reduce the foreign debt burden.
He said today, we can celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka in a happy status as a result of laying a solid foundation for the relations between the two countries during the past two and a half years.
The government is committed to further strengthening the relations.
