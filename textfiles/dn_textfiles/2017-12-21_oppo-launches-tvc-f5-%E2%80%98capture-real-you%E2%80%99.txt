OPPO launches TVC F5 to ‘capture the real you’

OPPO the global smartphone brand recently launched the OPPO F5 ‘capture the real you’ selfie camera phone. To reach out to its customers, OPPO had unveiled a beautifully conceptualized TVC with its New Brand Ambassador Sidharth Malhotra alongside Deepika Padukone.
The commercial depicts a romantic encounter of two strangers in a charming old city with cobble-stoned ally ways, castles, church towers and bridges, where people seem to enjoy the beautiful scenery and the romantic ambience.
OPPO’s focus has mostly been on beautiful selfies. Though everyone wants to capture good selfies, they also want the selfie to be beautiful as well as real without be seen too airbrushed. OPPO F5 is positioned as a phone that captures one’s real beauty, tagged as “capture the real you”. The old-world charm of beautiful Prague is captured by the new TVC and this serves as the first instance where OPPO features Europe in a television commercial. The TVC is aimed at the young audience who love to use their phones on the go.
‘Prague is a romantic old city, which has a lot of history. People there are kind and warm. It seems like that there are a lot of romantic stories taking place there. Since Prague was full of blue sky, we added more flowers in the background of the Historic Centre of the city where the commercial was shot in order to make the whole shot more vivid and youthful.’ a spokesperson for OPPO commented.
Initial response to the commercial indicate that the core target audience - the youth has been touched by the storyline and the mischief between Sidharth and Deepika.
The feedback for the TVC so far is highly impressive with 20 million views on YouTube and 14 million views on Facebook. ‘It seems like people like both the romantic skew in this story and also the music in the TVC. When the sculpture shot was being filmed, the sculpture started moving suddenly without following the actual script. He gave a rose to Deepika which really startled her and touched her at the same time. At that moment, the whole cast improvised. That shot was really good’ the spokesperson for OPPO added.
The agency behind the TVC is MT Media based in Shanghai with Noe, a young French director with great commercials for Dior and Vogue under his belt.
