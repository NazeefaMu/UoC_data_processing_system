Fists of fury

Sri Lanka is a nation that had mothered countless war heroes and valiant soldiers who had fought to safeguard their motherland from alien forces.
A pioneering Sinhalese martial arts method called Angam Pora gave might to patriots who indulged in combat against invaders centuries back.
Sri Siddha, the newest film by Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera tells the story of King Vijayabahu 1 and Angam Pora guru called Budanna who assisted the King in his battles against invading Cholas.
Sri Siddha will showcase native ancient fighting method of Angam Pora that was dreaded by Portuguese, Dutch and English intruders.
Golden inscription
Rear Admiral 
Sarath Weerasekera

At the Muhurath ceremony of the film the director cum screenplay writer of the film Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera said an ancient golden script aka Ran Sannasa found by a farmer lived in Matara in 1948 and read by Prof Senarath Paranavithana in 1949 was the source for the screenplay of Sri Siddha.
“This ancient script handwritten by the king Vijayabahu I himself had been a token of appreciation to his closest aid Budanna who had been an expert in Angam Pora. Budanna had bravely battled against enemies to save his king. Because of Budanna, the king survived to lead the rebellion against Cholas to reunite the country in 1070,” he said.
This particular Ran Sannasa of King Vijayabahu 1 now kept at the Colombo Museum adds immense credibility to the authenticity of the Sri Siddha story.
The film will showcase Angam Pora at its best fought in thick jungles and in the war front.
Famed Angam Pora guru, Ritigala Sumedha who brought breathtaking Angam Pora fights to Sarath Weerasekera’s maiden film Gamani stars in Sri Siddha as Budanna.
“The film that would start with the farmer finding the ancient script (Ran Sannasa) would flashback to the period in which the King Vijayabahu 1 lived.
Heights of power
The King was born as Prince Keerthi in 1039. At the time the southern part of our country had been ruled by Cholas and at the height of their power they took steps to eliminate all potential Sinhala kings”, said the director.
“The film will emphasize dedication of a King to save his country from invaders. To love the country, one should know the country’s history and Sri Siddha will stimulate within people eagerness to know our country’s history”, he added.
Co-producers of Sri Siddha are Thusitha Wijesena of Aloko Udapaadi fame, University Lecturer Gunapala Ratnasekera, Dr Malika Jayasuriya and Anuradha Yahampath. Executive producer is Praveen Jayaratne.
The Muhurath ceremony was attended by Venerable Bengamuwe Nalaka, Elle Gunawansa Theras, Udayakantha Warnasuriya, Bennet Ratnayake, Sudath Rohana, actor Ritigala Sumedha and scholars.
A demonstration of Angam Pora by Ritigala Sumedha’s students with actual swords kept the audience spellbound.
