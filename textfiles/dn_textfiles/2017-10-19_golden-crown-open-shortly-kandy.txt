The Golden Crown Hotel, a super luxury 5 star property located on two acres of beautifully landscaped gardens in Kandy and designed by renowned architect Dr. Upendra Rajapakse, will shortly open for the festive season.

Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Serene Holdings, who already operate Serene Grand Hotel in Kandy, Serene Grand Villa in Kandy, Serene Kings Villa in Nuwara Eliya, Serene Villa in Nuwara Eliya and the Tea Village in Nuwara Eliya, which is currently under construction, The Golden Crown indeed promises to be the ‘jewel in Kandy’s crown’.
Chairman, The Golden Crown Hotel Pvt. Ltd. Sriyananda Wijekoon said, “The Golden Crown Hotel differentiates from other hotels in Kandy as we offer an extensive range of deluxe accommodation as well as banqueting facilities that can cater to over 2,000 persons. We have a helipad facility as well, so it is evident that The Golden Crown effortlessly combines traditional comfort with modern facilities and our own hallmark attention to detail, while a striking feature on entering the Hotel is the spectacle of a fully automated, colour changing, dancing water fountain that greets you!”
The Golden Crown Hotel is set amidst verdant paddy fields, surrounded by lush greenery and is a sanctuary to those seeking peace and luxury. 90 Rooms including 72 Deluxe Rooms, 10 Junior Suites, 6 Premium Suites, a Crown Suite and a Presidential Suite complete with a private elevator for both the Presidential and Crown suites, comprise the Hotel’s accommodation.

Addressing a media briefing, The Golden Crown Managing Director, Chanuka Wijekoon explained the theme behind the name, “The Golden Crown is a marvel of a structure capturing the proud unique Kandyan history in a modern contemporary setting. Every feature of the Hotel has been well thought through and tastefully designed to provide the guest a memorable experience.” The Golden Crown Hotel is a special project to Chanuka as it is designed and constructed according to his wishes and under his watchful eye.
