Jailed drug dealers, criminals using satellite phones-Intelligence sources reveal

The Special Task Force Intelligence Unit has also found out that imprisoned drug dealers and underworld criminals who are billionaires are using satellite mobile phones.
According to these revelations, the drug dealers who are sentenced to death are communicating with other drug dealers and criminals in foreign countries using satellite phones.
Satellite mobile phone use is limited to the privileged class and not available for ordinary citizens.
The Intelligence Unit suspects that satellite phones are in operation not only at the Welikada Prison, but also at other prisons as well. They also believe that some of the prison guards are aware of this illegal action.
They also believe that some of the prison guards are providing this equipment to prison inmates in exchange for huge sums of money as bribes.
The Intelligence Units have also unraveled that close to 3000-4000 communications are done during a month from the Welikada Prison to outer locations.
According to them, these communications are done with regards to drug dealing, criminal activities and other rackets.
“The communications are yet untraceable,” the Intelligence Unit sources also said.
While the Intelligence Units are trying to infiltrate this communication network, the racketeers are using their billions in wealth to use high-tech communication devices to make their communications untraceable.
The Intelligence Units have also unveiled that persons who are wanted by the Police including Udayanga Weeratunga are allegedly communicating by using the same devices.
