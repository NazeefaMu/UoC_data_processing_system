Sadaharitha launches mobile office to promote forestry

Sadaharitha Plantations, has launched a novel promotional vehicle that doubles up as a mobile office for the convenience of customers. The concept of a two-in-one vehicle to promote forestry as an investment is a first time in Sri Lanka.
"Ours is much more than just a promotional vehicle" Sadaharitha Brand Manager Janaka Opallage said. "We use one side of the exterior surface of the vehicle to focus on the extent of land that we own, the valued customer base we have and the diverse crops we offer, which projects our corporate profile in a nutshell.
On the other side we highlight the newest, most popular and lucrative crop, Agarwood from which originate most of the high end perfumes and scents in the world. The display appears to attract potential customers to our innovative mobile office. The retractable roof expands the vehicle into a comfortable office space where customers can learn about the investment in comfort."
The vehicle has high definition TV with a movable bracket allowing a 180 degree rotation for customers to view the videos and understand the advantage of commercial forestry the company offers investors.
This provides value added support to the company's sales team who now has the advantage of ensuring that documentation can be completed on the spot wherever the mobile office happens to be and ensure a hassle-free investment for the customer.
"Once the mobile office wraps up for the evening, it becomes an entertainment centre offering music, fun and games as well as gifts with a propagandist on board to interactively communicate with the audience and extend the activation to a memorable customer experience. We plan to have the two-in-one vehicle visiting all our branches on its route and also visit the north and east to discover the unexploited market" Janaka Opallage said.
