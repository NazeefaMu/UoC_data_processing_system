People silent during Rapaksa regime, now engage in glib talk: Gayantha

It is strange to see people who kept silent during an era when 62 percent of government, spending was shared among members of the Rajapaksa family now engaging in glib talk abut the division of ministry subjects under the present government, Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke said.
He was addressing a press conference held at ‘Sirikotha’ UNP headquarters at Ethul Kotte yesterday.
Minister Karunatilleke said Central Bank reports testified that various sectors of the economy had achieved considerable progress and victories since the present government assumed office.
“A large number of job avenues had opened up in the public and private sectors last year amounting to almost 117,000. This is proved by the new EPF and ETF accounts opened last year. Similarly, several new foreign emloyment avenues had opened up last year
A total of nearly 150,000 to 160,000 employment avenues had been created last year, the minister said.
“Direct foreign investment had also increased last year. According to Central Bank reports, last year’s direct foreign investment had topped Rs. 2.8 billion,” he said.“The government had succeeded in regaining the GSP plus concession for Sri Lanka from the European Union. The country was able to gain the relief due to the good governance policies adopted by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe,” the minister said.
“The GSP plus facility would enable the country to increase its exports and investments,” he said.
He said the government had spent nearly 5 percent of GDP towards the development of infrastructure facilities last year. “Work was started on the Matara-Beliatte rail road, Kadawatha-Kerawalapitiya Expressway and the Colombo-Kandy Expressway,” he said.
“Road projects valued at nearly Rs. 17 billion were started last year. Apart from them, 170 km of dilapidated roadways were renovated. Export earnings had increased by almost 12 percent in 2016,” he said.
