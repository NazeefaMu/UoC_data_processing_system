Priority must be given to resolve rural people’s problems

Rural people are facing many unresolved problems. Resolving them is the major duty and responsibility of the government, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said.
He was addressing State officials at a meeting at the Badulla Town Hall following the opening of several development projects in the area launched by the Home Affairs Ministry.
Minister Abeywaradena said people in the North and East were going to Geneva to complain about alleged violation of their fundamental rights when people in the South are undergoing similar problems.
Abeywardena said many people considered the President or the legislature is omnipotent. “This was false. It was the ordinary citizens who are really omnipotent,” the Minister said.
He said that according to the scientific assignment of ministerial subjects, his ministry was entrusted with the district administration in addition to the rural and regional administration. “Kachcheris, Divisional Secretaries, Grama Niladaris, Development Officers and the Registrar General’s Offices are closely related to the people. They cater to people’s needs from their birth to death. They constitute a network of mechanisms to protect and safeguard people’s fundamental rights, the Minister said.
“People’s rights were enshrined in the Constitution. The Establishment Code had clearly laid down the procedure to be adopted by these institutions to serve the people,” he said.
“A big responsibility, therefore, has been put on public servants. They cannot shirk that responsibility at any time they want for any reason,” the Minister said.
