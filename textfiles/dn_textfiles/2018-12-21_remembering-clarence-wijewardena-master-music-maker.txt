The following lines are all about this versatile and much loved musician of our times. Almost 22 whole years have passed away since the death of Clarence, who was considered as the father of Sinhala pops and pioneer of Sinhala beat group.
A prolific lyricist, successful composer, talented guitarist and much loved singer Clarence Wijewardena, an all-rounder in the local music scene for more than three decades, hailed from the salubrious climes of Haputale.
On mentioning the name of Clarence, one instantly gets the pleasant memories of group song era of the 60’s and 70’s. Clarence was the brain wave, live wire and leader of some of the well-known aggregations of those good old days. The Moonstones, The Golden Chimes, The Super Golden Chimes were those bands and they were household names during that golden era.
Maestro Clarence was reputed for his scintillating, toe-tapping, haunting melodies and music arrangements. His soothing, inimitable way of singing has robbed the hearts of many.

He has created many major hits for various other artistes too. Usually he makes the melodies and arranges the music for his creations. Moreover, he himself has written the lyrics for a considerable number of his creations, which were sung by himself and various other vocalists.
Almost all the popular singers have sung under his music direction during the 70’s 80’s and 90’s. Annesley Malewana, Indrani Perera, Anil Bharathi, Milton Mallawarachchi, Priya Sooriyasena, H. R.

Clarence did the musical score for some Sinhala films, Sikuriliya, Apeksha, Chatu Madura, Chandi Shama, come under this category, Suseema, Nidikumba Mal are some popular teledramas where he did the needful music wise.
Furthermore Clarence is famous for his catchy jingles. He has done melodious jingles for many products. Even those are catchy like his songs. The jingles he did for Elasto, Bata, Astra Margarine, Bristol cigarettes. Arpico, Dot toffees, Atlas pens, Development lottery, Dasuna cartoon paper were some of them. What is more, the jingle he did for Dot toffee brought him an award too.
Incidentally, Clarence bagged three prestigious awards for the categories of best songs, best composer and best Sinhala pop group in an all island talent competition conducted by the Daily Mirror way back in 1975, If I am not mistaken the remix re-recordings of Sinhala songs became a reality during the heydays of maestro Clarence and his supremely talented Super Golden Chimes in the 70s.
A. M. U. Raj, Chitra and P. L. A. Somapala, Rukmani Devi, Priyantha Fernando, Desmond de Silva, Indrani Perera were some of the artistes who have recorded songs of yesteryear to the refreshing sounds of Clarence and his Super Golden Chimes. Clarence takes a prominent place for introducing electric guitars to the local music scene for the first time. He recorded songs on all the major recording labels namely Philips, Sooriya, Lotus, New Sound, Shans, Gemtone, Tharanga, Singlanka and Torana either with his band or as a solo artiste.
Clarence has written, composed and sang songs on diverse topics and catered to all age group of people. His songs were on love, parents, sons, daughters, sisters, cities, rivers, Christmas, butterflies, fishermen, patriotism, schooling days, upcountry dancer, village life, beauty queen pageant, teacher, India’s greatest poet Rabindranath Tagore, King Parakramabahu and so on. And the long list goes on and on. Those who relish his type of music know what he dished out during the past three decades. They are sort of evergreen types. One can further classify them as ‘Any time anywhere favourites from children to age old grandparents’, all of them would agree to this unanimously. His way of singing is something very special, elegantly harmonised. It is like pouring honey into your ears.
He has introduced many artistes to the local music scene over the years. Annesley Malewana, Indrani Perera, Anil Bharathi and Lilanthi Karunanayake are some of them. Many upcoming stars were inspired by his kind of scintillating music.
His sudden passing away 22 years ago has created a vacuum in the local music scene which is very hard to fill. May his fans, friends and relations find solace in his unforgettable, haunting and lovely creations he has left behind. May God grant him eternal peace.
