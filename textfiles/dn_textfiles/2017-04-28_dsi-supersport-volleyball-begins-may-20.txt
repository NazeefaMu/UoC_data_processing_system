DSI Supersport Volleyball begins on May 20

DSI Supersport Schools Volleyball Championship will be conducted for the 17th occasion on a grand scale from May 20 on a district and national level.
The tournament will be worked off by Sri Lanka Volleyball Federation in collaboration with the Schools Volleyball Association and it will be once again sponsored by DSI, Sri Lanka’s leading footwear manufacturer and distributor.
DSI Supersport Schools Volleyball Championship which was inaugurated in 1999 provides both rural and urban players an opportunity to develop and showcase their talents and end up by representing the national team in the international arena. The tournament has produced 40 national volleyball players. A special addition to this year’s tournament is the re-introduction of the under 13 boys and girls category with the objective of developing enthusiasm and passion for the country’s national sport among youngsters.
The organizers expect almost 4,000 teams including Northern and North Eastern province teams to take part in all four categories both girls and boys – under 13, under 15, under 17 and under 19.
The district level matches will be conducted from May 20 to June 12 and the national level matches will be worked off from June 24 to 28.
