National school primary teachers' transfers permitted

On a request made by the Education Ministry Secretary, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Desapriya has permitted to carry out necessary teacher transfers in primary sections of National Schools.
All the transfers of State sectors have been temporary suspended until the end of the Local Government Election, by the Election Commission Chairman. However, as a special provision, the Education Ministry has been granted permission to carry out necessary teacher transfers in primary sections since it has been scheduled to enroll new students for grade one for the year 2018, on January 15.
The Education Ministry Secretary had then sought the Election Commission's approval to make necessary teacher transfers in primary sections of National Schools.
