Dead insect cake feast

Loved-up customers wereoffered a rather unique Valentine’s Day menu - cocktails and cakes served up with added dead insects.
Diners were given the option of chowing down on bug carcasses or innards, that had been mixed into their alcoholic drinks or sweet desserts.
The imported giant water bugs from Thailand part of a special Valentine’s Day-themed event at the Duranbar bar in downtown Tokyo on Sunday.
The bar served up whipped cream, cakes and cocktails laden with insect bodies and innards for the event, which organisers said brought in around 90 people. Customers said the event helped them overcome their fear of bugs.
“My impression of bugs were that they are dirty and scary. But this cocktail is fruity and tasty...and this bug has a really nice smell so I think there is potential for it to be food,” said 20-year-old student Saki Osawa.
Among popular items served were a cranberry and water bug cocktail and caramelized worms with walnuts, which went for 800-1000 yen (£5-£7) each.
“They [insects] are crispy like the skin of walnuts and go pretty well with chocolate. I hope this will be made into a product,” said 20-year-old customer Sayumi Makino, who has never eaten bugs before.
While insects can be found in some regional cuisines in Japan, they’re not commonly eaten across the country.
Yuta Shinohara, the organiser of the event, is keen to promote insects as an alternative food culture in Japan.
“I love insects and I think it’s really fun to eat them. I’m quite confident of the potential of insects and of how attractive they are and eating insects are now in the spotlight from the point of view of food sustainability and also the environment. But first of all, we have to get people to think that [eating insects] is fun and interesting,” said Shinohara.
Shinohara, who has consumed insects from an early age, has held similar events making things such as “cricket ramen”.
The United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has recognised insect consumption as a more environmentally-friendly source of protein globally. Mirror
