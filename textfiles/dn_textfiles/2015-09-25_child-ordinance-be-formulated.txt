Child Ordinance to be formulated

A Child Ordinance would be formulated in Sri Lanka to provide guidelines on handling incidents involving children, said Women and Children's Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara.
She said that it would provide guidelines as to how the authorities would act on incidents such as the arrest of the school boy in connection with the Seya Sadewmi murder.
The minister also said the Police and the media had to act responsibly when publishing and reporting on stories on the arrest of the school boy.
She stated that although the boy's innocence was proved with the arrest of the suspect in connection with the Seya murder, the boy's image and self respect have been tarnished.
Minister Bandara said as persons below the age of 18 years are considered to be children, the Police and media are duty bound not to reveal the whereabouts of the youth who are arrested as crime suspects.
She said even their photographs should not be published or exposed to society by the media or Police.
"The Ministry will take steps to formulate the Child Ordinance, and two officials have been assigned to monitor the investigations being conducted into the Seya Sadewmi murder.
