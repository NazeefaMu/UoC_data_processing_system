Missing link in local elections

Most of you would have read in the primary classes the story of the peasant who climbed a Kitul tree in a neighbouring garden to steal a zip of toddy. When caught in the act the peasant pleaded with the owner of the tree that he climbed the tree to cut some grass to feed his hungry cattle. The angry neighbour retorted, “Where do you find grass on Kitul trees? “That is why I climbing down,” was the clever guy’s answer.
We were reminded of this story during the last Presidential elections when one candidate pleaded ignorance when his supporters distributed utility goods with his photo/calendar to voters in violation of election law. His meek explanation was that he cannot be responsible for what his supporters do in his name. Later, when he felt more confident of support from the hoi polloi he said it was no violation of election law and the distribution of goodies was a legitimate act.
Now that the local government elections are round the corner one would not be surprised to hear similar Yanne koheda, malle pol (Where are you going? Coconuts are in the bag!) type of stories in the ensuing period. (Incidentally, coconuts will be replaced by something else as they are too dear now)
It is the first time we have a full-fledged Elections Commission with enhanced powers to conduct the polls. Moreover, elections to almost all local government bodies are held in one day island-wide and results released at close of polls locally. This is a huge exercise demanding much skill and dexterity. The mandatory provision to include twenty-five percent women representation in the local bodies is also another complication. It has already placed the political parties which are almost 100 percent male-dominated conservative patriarchal entities despite their democratic pretensions in a quandary.
On the other hand such a mandatory provision became necessary in view of the utter backwardness of democracy in the country. Afro-Asian countries which were considered far away from universal franchise and democratic practices than Sri Lanka which boasts of being the first to obtain universal franchise have empowered women more. It must also be remembered that the degree of women’s empowerment is an index of a country’s development and democracy.
Women empowerment
In view of the strong global trend towards women empowerment there is no open opposition to the move. Yet there are grumblings heard from certain academic and clerical quarters as to whether such an exercise should be taken in a hurry. They are of the same ilk as the so-called anti-imperialist and anti-colonial crusaders who prefer the provisions of the colonial Constitution or Western style autocratic Constitution to a new democratic one.
The political parties and various civil society organisations, especially those espousing the cause of communal and ethno-religious fundamentalist views have already decided to consider the forthcoming local government polls as a referendum on the popularity of the Government or as a referendum on the proposed new Constitution.
It is the same old story of betrayal of the nation, division of the country, persecution of the war heroes and the Maha Sangha, the fate of the country’s Messiah who saved the nation, international conspiracies to make Sri Lanka a vassal state that would fill the air waves, newspaper columns and the social media during the election campaign.
If at all any subject is not discussed or superficially touched during the campaign, it would be issues of local governance and development. Parties would like to test their own popularity on national policies and few candidates would possess any tangible proposals for local development. Local governance and development would be the missing link in the whole campaign.
Political party sympathies
The candidates themselves would be chosen by the party high commands as usual despite the introduction of the Ward system and the independent groups will have an uphill task in view of high deposit fees and large numbers of candidates required for enlarged councils. Voting itself would tend to follow the political party sympathies instead of a shift of emphasis on the right candidate.
It would not be surprising to see attempts by money-bags to intimidate the voters by mass display of cut-outs, posters etc. at public places and distribute utility goods to bribe them. Signs are already visible in the streets.
The Elections Commission has decided to enforce the law strictly. How far it will succeed or whether it will have sufficient strength and resources necessary for success is still a moot point. Already a Minister has reportedly told his party supporters not to be afraid and assault back in case of a clash as the Government and the police are now with them.
Whatever the defects, whatever the hiccups the new election system is worth experimenting. Its greatest advantage is the abandonment of the notorious preferential (manape) system and the granting of bonus seats to the party with the highest number of votes. The latter practice reduced proportional representation to a farce. Glitches have to be eliminated through practice and revision. What is more important is the development of the mass consciousness of the voters, especially their understanding of their civic responsibilities as citizens.
