100 years of Richmond-Mahinda cricket 1905-2005

The latest addition for cricket fans readership is a book authored by Tiddy Wijeratne, Percy Samarawickrema close friends of former Mahinda cricketer G.M. Sumanathilake de Silva who also contributed in no small measure.
The book consisting of 565 pages delves deep into the history of Richmond-Mahinda cricket and explores the healthy cricketing rivalry that exists between these two great schools in the South.
As the pioneer editor of the volume states, there were many who dreamt of publishing a history of Richmond-Mahinda cricket encounters. They had collected massive amounts of information.
The pioneer authors friend Percy Samarawickrema and Tiddy Wijeratne met and discussed this project. Then it was Percy’s discussion with G.M. Sumanathilake de Silva that made the project get off the ground with G.M.S de Silva supporting the project financially.
The book is well chronicled and each chapter is devoted decade wise. These encounters are also known as “The Lovers’ Quarrel”.
Chapter 1:
The period spanning the latter part of the 19th century when the Richmond-Mahinda series began in the late 1920 was covered by late E.M. Karunaratne, an eminent lawyer former Richmondite and a well-known cricketer of his time.
Chapter 2:
This chapter deals with the encounters in the twenties. Major Simon Wijeratna, a well-respected teacher of Mahinda looks back, during this era Mahinda won more encounters than Richmond.
In the 1929 encounter Mahinda had a strong side .They had wins over strong sides including Colombo schools by large margins and had five centurions. Richmond had only one win. Mahinda were dismissed for a paltry 74 runs. M.D. Jayasinghe contributing 31 runs, Richmond replied with 137 and their captain contributed 52 runs. In their second essay Mahinda fared better and scored 152. Again M.D. Jayasinghe top scored with 58 not out. Richmond had to get only 89 runs and they did it with ease losing only one wicket. This was described as the most glorious victory in the whole series.
Chapter 3:
Shelton Wirasinha, later Principal of Richmond College recalls the encounters in the thirties. It is worthwhile mentioning about Douglas Jayasinghe during this era and W.M.K.de Silva mentions about him as follows, just three months after leaving school he was selected to play for Ceylon, and he was born into a family of cricketers. His father, A.D. Jayasinghe, one time Head Master of Mahinda, opened the bowling for Richmond College. His eldest brother Felix captained Mahinda and Marcus was the famous Mahindian who captained Galle Cricket Club for many seasons.
Douglas joined Mahinda in 1920; he played from 1931 to 1936 captaining in his last 3 years. He represented Ceylon on three occasions. He was also a national selector for ten years and ended up as the Chairman of Selectors.
Chapter 4:
Tiddy Wijeratna (Mahinda 1940-44) recalls The War-Torn Forties
R D Abeygunawardena studied at Richmond from kindergarten to the matriculation class until he left school in March 1942. Soon after he joined government service and in 1967 passed the Sri Lanka Administrative Examination. He also spent eight years in the Foreign Service during which period he served in Singapore, China and Japan. He retired from Public Service as Deputy Food Commissioner in 1981.
R.D. loved his cricket very much. He also represented the college at football and athletics and captained the College cricket team in 1941-1942. At cricket he was exceptionally good as a leg spinner and an opening bat.
Chapter 5:
Lankan’s unknown World Record a report by A.B. Francis
W. Bennet of Mahinda College was the second Sri Lankan cricketer to have his name in the”Guinness Book of World records” after Clive Inman.
Bennet achieved his amazing feat way back in 1953 - a full eleven years before Inman performed his feat in 1964 by hammering the fastest fifty in just 8 minutes playing for Leicestershire in a county match. But the importance of Bennet’s achievement dawned on the record books only 27 years later in 1980. He claimed all ten wickets in an innings playing for his college Mahinda as a wicket keeper, against Galle CC in 1953 at the Galle Esplanade.
Chapter 6:
The big match played in 1964
The author wishes to inform the readers, that two Richmond College, players played with him in The Ceylon Schools Team of 1964, they were L. Kaggodachchi and R B Jayasuriya, the former kept wickets and the latter opened bowling for Ceylon schools, we played against All India schools at St Peter’s grounds and their team included Eknath Solkar who later played for India with distinction.
Chapter 7
In the opinion of many Upul Sumathipala was the best Mahinda has produced during the seventies although D L S de Silva the pace bowler who played for Sri Lanka also played in this era. Upul had the distinction of captaining the under 25 Tamil Union team in the Sara trophy.
Chapter 8
Athula Samarasekera and Gajaba Pitigala were outstanding Mahinda cricketers in the eighties. Athula played 4 Tests and 39 ODI’S for Sri Lanka. Pitigala was a canny left arm spinner, who was chosen as the Outstation Schoolboy Cricketer in the eighties.
Chapter 9
Upul Chandana was outstanding for Mahinda in this era. He was a brilliant fielder for Sri Lanka and played 16 Tests and 147 ODIs. In 2011 Dhananjaya de Silva captained Richmond and he is a real talent for Sri Lanka and will be an asset in the future.
Editable gaps are there in the book and it is left to the future chroniclers to fill them if they intend. The publishers going for a second edition it will be opportune to have a contents page which will be useful for the readers. The stats records are commendable.
In this seminal work the authors have produced a well-researched book which posterity will find invaluable as both a book of reference, for its historical nature, as well as an inspiring read about Richmond-Mahinda cricket. The book deserves to be on the bookshelves of all Mahindians and Richmondites.
