Cager legends  they were –  Cosmas and Percy

Basketball admittedly is one of the fastest games on earth and enjoyed its best years in our country in the 1960s and ‘70s. Those were years when there was a hive of activity with several schools and clubs tipping it out for supremacy. It evoked tremendous interest and spectator participation.
Most schools and clubs played the game with zest. There were inter-school competitions followed by several club tournaments, foreign teams visiting here and the interest was at fever pitch with the schools and clubs churning out some top notch cagers who did proud to their schools and country and could have played in many Asian teams.
Two legends to emerge during that period were the " Perera Duo"--- COSMAS and PERCY. They were no relations, but dear friends who hunted together and helped their school St. Benedict’s College, Kotahena to win many school tournaments and the Old Bens many club tournaments and dominate the game when they reigned supreme. Personal achievements – sub head Before going on reel out their personal achievements in the game, the writer who covered the game when it was at its best for the ‘Times of Ceylon’, cannot but pay tribute to another Legend--their coach--who made the duo reach the pinnacle: RAM SUNTHERALINGAM who joined the green, white and green school as teacher, bringing his expertise after being a top sportsman for Jaffna Central when sport in Jaffna was tops. SUNTHERALINGAM who sported national colours was quick to spot the natural and tremendous talent in the two Pereras. What he then did was to lick them into shape, by speaking situations to them and showing them the finer points in shooting and defending which they were quick to grab and this enabled them to go places in the school, club and national scene. They made waves with their high standard of play and were the envy of basketball players of that golden era. The duo were like beavers on the court.
They were full of energy and intensity and there was no letting up as they piled on the agony on their opponents. COSMAS was an all court player and PERCY was a dazzler with his bulls eye shooting especially from the right flank. Made it to the big league – sub head COSMAS after being deputy to another player who could have made it to the big league Vijaya Silva, was awarded the captaincy of the school team and he adorned it with great respect and dedication. He led by example and from the front with his stubborn defence, dazzling dribbling and shooting from whatever angle or position served notice of making it to the national team and also sporting the crown the dream of any sportsman – to lead the country.
He also did his school proud by being the first Benedictine to captain the national team in 1962 and led the country to the Asian Game in Bangkok. He was felicitated by the school for this achievement. In that era there was a team of basket ballers from America the home of basketball who called themselves PEACE CORP. They had some stunning players and one name I remember was a guy called Fennel. He was astounded with COSMAS' all court play that he predicted that had CoOSMAS been in the US he could have played for any team in the NBA. Great compliment indeed.
In 1957 was formed the Old Bens Basketball Club by two loyal Old Bens, that man for all seasons Premnath Moraes a man of many parts and J.E.Benedict a left arm leg spinner who played for the college in late 1940s. Playing in the first ever club tournament COSMAS led the club to win the Exter Shield and thereafter many trophies and shields adorned the club shelves.
PERCY – Asia’s Best Shooter
Playing alongside COSMAS and helping the school, the club and the country was PERCY PERERA. Pencil slim but he was a bundle of energy. He was like the will ‘o the wisp here there and everywhere. But it was on the right flank that he excelled with his hook shots and sharp cutting in to plonk the baskets that had the opposing defenders helpless.
It was in the Asian Games in Bangkok in 1962 that PERCY reached his peak. Although Sri Lanka as a team did not make much of an impression, PERCY was a sensation. His shooting jolted not only the opposing players, but officials and spectators were held spellbound with his magical shooting and he brought pride and credit to the school, club and country when he was unanimously voted as the BEST SHOOTER IN ASIA.
That achievement was great considering that never before had a Sri Lankan ever got to basketballs’s Mount Everest. Pity that these two Benedictines, both record breakers COSMAS and PERCY have not been recognized or rewarded by the school that they performed for with great pride and distinction have gone unrecognized.After much urging by this writer, there was a tournament conducted in memory of PERCY by his old school. But considering his great feat one expected this tournament to be an annual affair.
But sadly it has not been so. PERCY passed away in Australia a few years back. When basketball was at its best – sub head Yes, it was in the 1960s and ‘70s that basketball was at its best. Men who made this possible were the first Minister of Sports V.A. Sugathadasa, James Sarangapany, the President of the national Federation. Both were Old Benedctines and soccerites of repute. Sugathadasa played for the school and one of his opponents was his Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake who sported Thomian colours. Sarangapany was of Saunders fame.
Also helping the game progress were Colonel Wilfred Saverimuttu and Cyril Ranatunge. Some of the Bens who played with COSMAS and PERCY were – Vijaya Silva, Milroy de Silva, Edward Sumanasekera, Shelton Pietersz, Herbert Senadhipathy, Winston Wijenaike to mention a few and other excellent exponents were C.Thurairaja, Jesudhasan, Rasalingam, Ponnambalam, Wilson, Royden de Silva, Maharoof, Daluwatte, Amaradasa, George, Randiligama and Wilson.
The PERERA Duo distinguished themselves in may ways on and off the court--they were superb players; exemplary in their behavior; they had winning genes and devout in their commitment to the game and to their old school--St. Benedict's College where they learnt how to play the game and be Gentlemen.
