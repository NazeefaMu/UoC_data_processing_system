ICC Women’s World Cup 2017 : Australia and India edge closer to securing semi-final spots

Defending champion Australia and India overpowered New Zealand and Pakistan respectively in the matches between the neighbours to register their third successive victories in the ICC Women’s World Cup 2017 on Sunday.
Australia spoiled Suzie Bates’s 100th ODI by reaching the 220-run target in the penultimate over for the loss of five wickets in Bristol, while India overcame a watchful and cautious batting display to successfully defend a modest score of 169 for nine by bowling Pakistan out for 74 to win by 95 runs in Derby.
Elsewhere, England coasted to a comfortable seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka when it chased down a 205-run target with more than 19 overs to spare in Taunton, while South Africa dismissed the West Indies for 48 - the 17thlowest score in the history of women’s ODIs – before overhauling the target inside seven overs with all 10 wickets intact in Leicester
After round three of seven, Australia and India are the only unbeaten sides in the tournament, while England and South Africa have won two matches apiece. New Zealand is sitting on one victory whereas Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the West Indies are still searching for their maiden wins.
Australia’s remaining matches are against Pakistan (5 July, Leicester), England (9 July, Bristol), India (12 July, Bristol) and South Africa (15 July, Taunton), while India has to play Sri Lanka (5 July, Derby), South Africa (8 July, Leicester), Australia (12 July, Bristol) and New Zealand (15 July, Derby). If both the sides can manage a couple of more wins each, then they will be guaranteed spots in the semi-finals, irrespective of how the other matches in the group stage pan out
As far as England is concerned, it too remains one of the favourites to progress to the last four stage as its remaining matches are against South Africa (5 July, Bristol), Australia (9 July, Bristol), New Zealand (12 July, Derby) and West Indies (15 July, Derby), while either New Zealand or South Africa is expected to complete the semi-final line-up.
Bowlers dominated day seven of the ICC Women’s World Cup 2017 with India’s Ekta Bisht turning out to be the pick with figures of 10-2-18-5. South Africa captain Dane van Niekerk recorded figures of 3.2-3-0-4, her team-mate Marizanne Kapp finished with analysis of 7-2-14-4, England’s Laura Marsh finished with 10-0-45-4 and Nashra Sandhu of Pakistan’s ended up with figures of 10-1-26-4.
Amongst the batters, Ellyse Perry of Australia, England’s duo of Heather Knight and Sarah Taylor, and New Zealand’s pair of Katie Perkins and Suzie Bates stroked impressive half-centuries.
