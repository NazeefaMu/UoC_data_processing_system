“We have decided to embark on a different approach in terms of purchasing our products where, the customer can initially place an order through our website without any payment involved.
The order placed would directly be handled by our experienced team and payment will be processed thereafter - said Marketing Director JitendraUduman. “Our research has shown that potential buyers are anxious about quality and after-sales-service when engaging in online payment gateways.
The significant feature of our business has always been - the delivery of orders on time and at the right price together with genuine after sales service and the Company has always been renowned for this”. saidJitendra.
