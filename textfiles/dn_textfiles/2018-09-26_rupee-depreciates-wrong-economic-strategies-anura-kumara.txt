Rupee depreciates with wrong economic strategies: Anura Kumara

The rupee depreciates because of the wrong economic strategies adapted by the government and the previous regimes, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said.
He was addressing the media at the JVP Headquarters.
The JVP leader said a long and short terms plan should be formulated to face the situation.“We must have a long-term economic plan to prevent rupee depreciation. Unfortunately, present government has no whatsoever plan in this regard,” he said.
He said the government and the previous government is directly responsible for the rupee depreciation.
“The country suffers because of the wrong economic policies followed by the government and the previous regimes lead by former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunga,” he said.
“The American dollar is the standard unit of currency in the international markets. Therefore, the value of the dollar directly affects the economy of a country. Since we are in a global market, following an economic policy that neglects the international market is futile,” he said.
Selling dollar-generating public institutions, disregarding production economy in the country, reducing exports mainly depreciated the rupee, he said.
The JVP Leader said the depreciation of rupee reflects the financial crisis in the country.
