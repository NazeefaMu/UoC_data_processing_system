‘Celebrate Colombo’ with CFW

HSBC Colombo Fashion Week concluded its summer season under the theme ‘Celebrate Colombo’ in association with Sri Lanka Tourism. Hosted at Hilton Colombo, CFW, in its 14th year since inception showcased the progress it has made with the fashion design industry of Sri Lanka.
“After 14 years it is hard to imagine a fashion design industry without CFW, by God’s grace this journey has steered and fathered the industry and continues to do so. I spend a lot of time with young and new designers, to get the next generation ready. Darshi was our first find in 2007, followed by others since then.
Every designer who has shown at CFW in last 10 or so years have been impacted by our programmes. As I have personally spent time with them at some point or the other, and every year a new lot comes and current lot becomes ‘not-so-new.’ Every season is carefully planned with the development of fashion design industry at its base. We know where we are going this year and next. Nothing is done adhoc, everything is part of a plan. Bigger goals ahead,” stated Founder and President of Colombo Fashion Week, Ajai Vir Singh at the event.
Under ART CONNECT, where five major Sri Lankan artists Mahen Perera, Kingsley Gunatillake, Pala Polupitiya, Sunjewwa Kumara and Sanjay Geekiyanage created pieces under the theme ‘Second Skin.’
