Book on Indo-Lanka accord

Oor Enappirachaniyum Oor Oppanthamum (An ethnic conflict and an accord), a book by T. Ramakrishnan, an Associate Editor with The Hindu, a leading English daily published in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, was published recently.
The author served in Colombo as The Hindu’s Sri Lanka and Maldives Correspondent for a little over a year during 2015-2016.
Published in 2017 to coincide with the 30th anniversary of signing of the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord, the book seeks to find out why the accord remains relevant in any discourse on finding a political settlement to the Sri Lankan Tamil question.
Analysing factors that led to the signing of the accord and the events thereafter, including the 13th Constitutional Amendment, the author has also attempted to find out if the agreement had been implemented in letter and spirit, the destruction that Sri Lanka witnessed during the last phase of the civil war in 2009 could have been avoided.
It has been brought out by a Chennai-based publishing group, Kalaignaan Pathipagam. Ramakrishnan was here promoting his book in Colombo, Kandy and Jaffna.
