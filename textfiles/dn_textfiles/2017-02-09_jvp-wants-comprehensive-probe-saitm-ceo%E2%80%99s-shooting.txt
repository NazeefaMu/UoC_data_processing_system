JVP wants comprehensive probe on SAITM CEO’s shooting

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday urged the government to conduct a comprehensive investigation on the SAITM CEO shooting without coming to preemptive conclusions.
JVP leader Anura Dissanayake told the media in Colombo that a broad and a transparent investigation in connection with the incident was necessary to expose those involved.
The JVP leader alleged that the government was trying to put the blame on the student unions and civil society groups over the SAITM shooting.
He stressed that it was imperative for the law enforcement authorities to conduct a transparent and a comprehensive probe as the SAITM issue has become an issue which has garnered unprecedented public attention.
