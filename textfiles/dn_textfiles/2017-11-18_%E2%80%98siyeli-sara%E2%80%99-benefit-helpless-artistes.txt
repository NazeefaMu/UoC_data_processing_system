‘Siyeli Sara’ to benefit helpless artistes

"Christmas is coming round the corner and it is time to think about who needs our assistance most. The day I took over this position, I held a meeting of prominent artistes and started assisting aged and sick artistes through Archbishop's Funds. A proper fund should be maintained to assist them, Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Bishop's House in Colombo yesterday,
The Archbishop said `Siyeli Sara', a musical show, organized by Archdiocesan Social Communications and Cultural Centre in Colombo to raise funds for prominent aged and sick artistes will be held on December 2 at 6.30 pm at the St. Joseph's College Indoor Stadium, Maradana.
"During Christmas, people donate funds and think of others' welfare. Apart from the main musical show, other events will be held to raise fund in this regard. Aged and sick artistes do not have money or anyone to take care of them," he said..
Veteran singers Keerthi Pasqual, Chandana liyanarachcchi, Amarasiri Peiris and other prominent artistes will take part in the show. Mahinda Bandara and the band will provide music.
The tickets are available through mytickets.lk; Parish Priest, Nugegoda; Sarasavi Bookshop, Borella Catholic Press Bookshop, Borella Archdiocesan Social Communication and Cultural Centre; Borella Archbishop House Bookshop, and Pettah Catholic bookshop at Rs. 500, Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 2,000.
