Kandy SC looking for another win

The defending Dialog League champions Kandy Sports Club could look for another win when they confront their arch rivals CR & FC in their second round match of the Dialog League Championship to be played at the Nittawela Rugby Stadium, Kandy this Sunday February 14th with the kick off at 4 pm.
When these two teams met in Colombo in their first round match, the Kandy team put up .......... performance and the Red Shirts were leading towards the end and an upset victory for CR and FC appeared to be on the cards. A try in the dying stages of the match saw Kandy Sports Club pull off a very close win.
But Kandy Sports Club is unlikely to repeat the some mistakes they made in that match and they will be also playing before their home crowd in familiar terrain of Nittawela and all these factors point out in favour of the Kandy team.
But the clash between Kandy Sports Club and CR and FC has always produced fiery rugby and ever since more than half of the Longden Place team crossed over to Kandy.
These playes included Priyantha Ekanayake, Lakshman Ekanayake, Shyam Siddeek, Imthison Marikkar, Leroy Fonseka, and many others in 1992. When these two teams met for the first time after the cross over. Kandy Sports Club posted a half a century of points. Apart from the national players in the side Kandy's win was powered by two Fijians in Kitioni Ratrudradra and Beti Pania who virtually carried a huffing and puffing flanker over the try line to touch down. This may the only occasion in the hills where one player had carried another over the line.
That year the return game played in Colombo produced red hot rugby and the red shirts made amends to draw the match.
Kandy Sports Club with an unbeaten record head the table of points and a win in this match should assure them of the league title come what may be the results of the remaining matches.
