Britney Spears: Tiësto is teaching me to master the decks

Britney Spears is being taught to DJ by Tiësto. The 33-year-old singer is more well known for her skills on the stage than the decks. But on Saturday (October 31), Britney revealed she is learning the craft of spinning records by none other than legendary Dutch DJ Tiësto.
The mother of two also teased fans that she could be collaborating with Tiësto on an upcoming track.
Britney posted of herself standing next to the DJ on her Instagram page, alongside the caption: "Asked @tiesto to teach me how to DJ. Maybe we'll get a song out of it?"
Britney has been kept busy in recent months thanks to her Britney: Piece of Me residency in Las Vegas.
However, the singer revealed in a previous interview that in between her shows, she has been working "very slowly" on music for a new album. The record would be Britney's ninth studio album but she said she wants to push the boundaries with her music with the record.
"I want to do something very artsy-fartsy, something I've never done before..." Britney told US TV show Extra in September (14).
But Britney will have the majority of her time taken up after recently announcing that her residency has been further extended for another two years.
Her Britney: Piece of Me gig at Planet Hollywood plays to packed-out crowds, with the blonde belting out her catchy pop anthems.
"I have some big news tonight," Britney told the audience at one of her shows in September (15) as she confirmed the exciting development. "Usually I get you guys to help me count to three, but tonight I want you to help me count to two... because I'm going to be in Vegas for two more years!" she screamed to the audience, with the crowd whopping in response.
Planet Hollywood also released a statement confirming the news. It's still exciting for fans that have already caught the show; Britney plans to give it a glitzy new makeover.
"[It] will soon undergo a substantial [re-imagining]," the statement read.
"[Which will allow the Britney to] take her spectacular show to new heights." Music - News
