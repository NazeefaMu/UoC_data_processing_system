SL lose to Pakistan in U19 Asia Cup

Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by three wickets in their final Group B match of the Under 19 Youth Asia Cup tournament in Malaysia on Monday.
Both teams finished their league matches equal on 4 points each with Pakistan on top on a superior run rate. However they must await the final league game between Afghanistan and UAE today to see which of the top two teams from the group will qualify for the semi-finals.
Afghanistan with a better run rate than Sri Lanka need only to beat UAE to go through to the last four with Pakistan.
Group A is still open with India and Nepal currently heading the table with 2 points each and Bangladesh having won the only match they played against India.
Sri Lanka were bundled out for a disappointing 141 in 49.4 overs with Ashen Bandara being the only batsmen to make a noteworthy contribution with 49 off 95 balls. Pakistan knocked the required runs off in 32.1 overs losing seven wickets with Praveen Jayawickrama again amongst the wickets with figures of 4 for 28.
Sri Lanka U19 - 141 in 49.4 overs (Ashen Bandara 49, Kevin Koththigoda 20, Nuwanidu Fernando 14; Muhammad Musa 3/25, Munir Riaz 3/30, SS Afridi 2/19)
Pakistan U19 – 142-7 in 32.1 overs (Rohail Nazir 48, Muhammad Taha 31, Saad Khan 22; Praveen Jayawickrama 4/28, Dananjaya Lakshan 1/17, Thilan Prashan 1/21, Kevin Koththigoda 1/32)
