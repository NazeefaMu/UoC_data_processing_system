Sonu Nigam sings at Vogue Jewellers

Sonu Nigam, one of the most internationally acclaimed Bollywood singers visited Vogue flagship showroom in Colpetty to sing Vogue jingle “Mangala mudu, mala, valalu…” in his own style.
It was indeed a Golden Evening amidst much glitterati exclusive for the media and social media personalities. Sonu Nigam moved around with the invitees, posed for formal and informal photographs with the invitees, making everyone feel totally overwhelmed.
This classic Vogue appears to be the oldest running jingle in Sri Lanka. Having first introduced during 1962, its inaugural year of operations, its highly memorable tune had remained unchanged throughout the three-stage remakes for broadcasting purposes.
“We are delighted to host Sonu Nigam, an internationally renowned Bollywood singer at our showroom tonight. He is here to add a new lease of life to Sri Lanka’s record-breaking jingle, ‘Mangala mudu, mala, valalu…’ produced for Vogue. It was my father, the late Chairman, Sarath Hemachandra who initiated the making of this iconic jingle. Nearly sixty years later, we can proudly continue to use the same timeless lyrics as it has been crafted with much foresight - just like our exquisite jewellery of timeless value and the unparalleled service we offer,” Vogue Jewellers’ Managing Director, Anura Hemachandra said.
It has been so tastefully scripted by Sri Lanka’s most sought after, legendary lyricist, the late Karunaratne Abeysekera, while its music direction has been by the late Maestro, T. F. Latiff. Veteran singer, Rupa Indumathi had sung its initial version, while in late 1980s, the Queen of Sinhala music, Kalasuri Latha Valpola has sung its second re-make, retaining the same tune. In early 2000s, Visaradha Neela Wickramasinghe voiced its latest version which is being aired over the Radio to-date. With the exception of the same jingle being sung by Kavindya Adhikari and Nademal Perera to a different tune for the purposes of reaching out to the young bridal market, this jingle has been running for nearly sixty years without changing its melody.
“We pride ourselves on having pioneered many a ground breaking moves throughout out our glittering history of operations. Re-locating the flagship showroom in Colpetty, which was essentially a residential area in nineteen sixties; introducing several innovative concepts; redefining standards in the jewellery industry of Sri Lanka pioneering to appoint high ranking fashion icons and celebrities for promotional purposes and taking Vogue to the international arena are a few among many,” Hemachandra added. - IT
