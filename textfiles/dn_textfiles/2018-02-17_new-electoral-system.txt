Speaker requests Deshapriya to report of shortcomings :
New electoral system

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who met Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday asked that the latter submit a report on the shortcomings of the new electoral system and ways in which it can be further improved to the Constitutional Council next week.
The Chairman had made special mention of the pragmatic issues which have cropped up when implementing the 25 percent quota for female candidates.
Deshapriya pointed out that there would need to be certain amendments made with regard to the quota in certain councils.
When the Speaker had inquired as to when the new councils would be established, Deshapriya informed him that they should be able to swear in all councils by the end of March. The Speaker further asked that the Elections Commission study methods to computerize the system in future to make the process easier.
