“There are shortcomings in everything. Our progress could be seen a slow march forward. But, it was steady. We moved forward while settling the debts. Our work was affected by the floods and drought. We had to face many natural disasters and the affected people had to be provided with relief while we had to continue the development drive. We continued to allocate funds on welfare measures such as education, free healthcare and housing,” he added.

Darkest hour in our democratic history - Sajith
Moving the Vote of Confidence in Parliament yesterday, Deputy UNP Leader Sajith Premadasa appealed to President Maithripala Sirisena to reappoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, as he commands a majority in Parliament.
“Your Excellency the President, please stop wasting time. The time is right to change your decision and put things in order by reappointing Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister as he commands the majority in Parliament. Look no further, wait no more, please reappoint him,” MP Premadasa said.
He said this is the darkest hour in our democratic history, adding that the Constitution has been violated a few times since October 26 brining the entire country to a grinding halt.
“The issue started with the unconstitutional removal of the Prime Minister and appointing a new Prime Minister and the Cabinet that does not command at least 80 seats in Parliament. Not only that the Parliament was also dissolved and also different attractions were offered to win the hearts of the lawmakers and to switch sides. We had to take democratic moves to bring in No-Confidence Motions, motions to cut funds to office of the Prime Minister and the Ministers,” he noted.
Having wilfully violated the rule of law and Constitution, they have betrayed the voters, Premadasa said,adding that even kindergarten children knew the UNF had the majority.
“People were shocked to see the chilli powder attack and the slapping tof Police officers inside the Chamber of Parliament. They claim to protect and behave according to Buddhist teachings. But have violated the basic teachings of The Buddha by behaving in such a bad manner,”the Deputy UNP Leader said.
He said now that they had shown over a 2/3 majority in Parliament, better safeguard what is left of their self-respect. “They should accept the fact that they don’t have a majority and allow us to take over the government. They are unable to chose good from bad lacking good political backgrounds,” Premadasa said.
He warned that in the absence of a legal government, the country is at a crisis where development has stopped, donations held up, foreign assistance cancelled, businesses stuck along with the state sector employees now clue less of the next move.
“The hospitals have run short of medicines along with many other projects that served the masses of Sri Lanka. Even the issue of school uniforms to children have come to a standstill,” he said, adding that now it’s the opportune moment to reappoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister and prevent the country from plunging into further chaos.
