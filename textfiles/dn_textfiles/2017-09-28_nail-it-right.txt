Nail it right!

Pamper your nails with a stylish makeover and you will never shy away from flaunting them. Every one desires healthy, well groomed nails. However, sometimes that can be a tricky thing if you don’t know how to take care of your nails. Here are some pointers to keep in mind which will make you feel that it is worth holding your hands out for.
Use a base coat
There are many benefits in using a base coat. It makes your manicure last longer. It prevents the polish from staining your nails. Certain brands of base coat strengthen your nails as well.
Lotions and cuticle oil
Lotions and cuticle oil are used to moisturise the cuticle, skin and nail area. It can protect the cuticle and nail against damage and improve the health and appearance of the cuticles and nails. Cuticle oil should not be used as a first-line of defense against dryness. It needs to be used to fix extremely dry and cracked nails.
Disadvantages of using gel nail polish
The advantages of gel nails outweigh the disadvantages. If applied poorly and too regularly, the gel polish has a tendency to weaken the nails since there is less oxygen allowing the nails to thrive. The removal process must also be done with care as the filing can damage the surface of the nails. We always recommend a period of one week to two weeks before each application.
Painting regular polish over gel
Painting regular nail polish over gel nail polish is possible but the nail polish has to be of a good brand. When removing the nail polish, be sure to use acetone free polish remover. An acetone remover will lift your gel polish.
Finger nail polish colour and toe nail polish colour
There are no rules about matching finger nail polish colour with toe nail polish colour. It depends on each individual’s preference. According to my opinion, if the colour on the toes is bright, a nude finger nail is nice. Then there will be no crazy colour clash happening between fingernails and toes, and vice versa.
Colours and skin tones
There are certain shades of colours that go with certain skin tones. Cool tones such as blues and greens suit a person with a fairer skin tone while warmer colours such as reds and browns look better on darker skin tones.
Combating thick nail polish
Nail polish gets thick because it dries out. When applying a nail polish the room conditions should be dry. Air should not directly enter the bottle. If youre applying nail polish at home, turn off the fans and air conditioners. There are a few products that can be put into a dry nail polish to bring it back to life. As a quick fix, we use nail polish remover. However the bottle of nail polish will be of no use after a few applications.
Proper application
Applying nail polish without getting polish on the sides and cuticles demands skill. There are also stickers and oils that can be used to prevent this.
If the nail varnish is separated in the bottle, simply shaking the bottle before use. If the gel polish on the brush dries because it has been accidentally left outside soaking the brush in acetone should clean it. A mail polish that lasts long and doesn’t stain the nails are signs of a good nail polish brand.
Drying gel nail polish sans a UVA lamp
Gel polish doesn’t dry, it cures. If you live in a place with strong, solid sunshine, it’s possible that the UVA light from the sun could cure the polish. However it would most likely take a long time. Some UV lamps take at least five minutes to cure with directed light, which is why it would most likely take longer to do this without using a UVA lamp.
Stop nail polish from bubbling and chipping
To stop nail polish from bubbling, the polish needs to be applied on to a clean surface. A good top coat will prevent your nail polish from chipping. Still it depends on what you do. If you are frequently washing your hands or moving things around, the colour will chip faster.
Taking off gel nail polish
To remove gel nail polish buff the surface of your nail with a nail file to remove the shine. Then soak a cotton ball in the acetone and place it directly on top of your nail. Follow this by wrapping each finger with a small piece of foil, and after 10 to 15 minutes, the gel manicure should slide right off with the cotton ball.
Remedy for nails/cuticleswhich are dry and/or weak
Eating the right foods for starters should be a priority to strengthen weak nails. Nails are made out of protein, so the first thing you can try is adding more protein to your diet. Eat lean poultry, fish, beef and pork, as well as spinach and other vegetables that contain protein.
Step two should be buying targeted products for your problems. Cuticle oils and base coats which strengthen your nails will help.
Remedy for yellow nails
Next time you get a manicure or pedicure done, don’t apply any polish. Leave the nails clean so they can breath and be healthy. A simply buff can reduce stains, but too much buffing can also make them thin. So it should be done with care.
In fashion now
Nail art is still quite popular. Geometric patterns are more on trend than florals at the moment. Also having one or two nails painted differently is how most fashionable girls wear their nails today.
A short, round nail is also the trend. Long, square French tips are quite outdated. Nude coloured nails are the range.

Amazing aloe Vera
Widely used in cosmetics, this wonderful plant has regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties.
Perhaps you’ve already been introduced to this marvel of the plant world, in which case it will come as no surprise to hear that aloe vera is one of the star ingredients of many cosmetic products, and, indeed, there are whole product ranges based around it.
The little natural wonder is no newcomer to the beauty stage, though: evidence suggests that it was already being used to care for and beautify the skin over 3,000 years ago. There are more than 300 species of the plant, but not all of them provide the gel we know as aloe vera – the wonder-working gel with a whole range of properties beneficial to both healthy and damaged skin.
Regeneration and anti-inflammation
Natural aloe vera extract is excellent to soothe irritated or burnt skin as it has great regenerative and anti-inflammatory qualities. The secret is that it reaches deep into the skin because of its vitamin content – A, B1, B2, B6, B12 – plant sugars, glucomannan, pentose, hexose and galactose.
After-sun benefits
Thanks to its calming effects, the plant is widely used in after-sun products and treatments for skin irritations. It also helps to destroy dead cells, regulates the pH of the skin and eliminates toxins. On top of all this, it also has moisturising properties, which makes it effective for dry skins.
An ally against stretch marks
A further area in which it aloe vera useful is in the battle against stretch marks, as it can help with prevention and concealment.
 A friend to your hair
Hair and skin are closely related, so maybe it’s not surprising that your locks can benefit from this wonder plant: many shampoos include it to revitalise and add shine, strength, and flexibility.
These are just some of aloe vera’s cosmetic properties, but there are also studies that suggest its medicinal properties make it effective against intestinal problems and inflammation of the eyes. One final suggestion, while there’s still a little summer left: why not keep some aloe vera gel in the fridge ready to apply after you’ve been in the sun: your skin will feel cool, refreshed and moisturised. -hellomagazine.com
