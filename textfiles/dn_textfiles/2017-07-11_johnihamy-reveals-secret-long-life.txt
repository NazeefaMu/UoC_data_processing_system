Johnihamy reveals secret of long life

Be in line with Mother Nature:
“Village life, clean air, household chores, and home-grown food helped me live so long” Dikmadugodage Johnihamy, who celebrated her 103rd birthday on July 9, said. She was born in Algiriya, Theliijawila in 1914.
“My mother was married when she was at 27 to my father, Dikmadugodage Dinoris, who was her neighbour and her childhood love,” her eldest son Jinadasa Dikmadugoda said.
“My father was a farmer and it was my mother who helped him in his farming. She did all the household chores as well while taking care of six children. She used to carry my father’s meals to the field and help reap the harvest and even carry it home.
“It was she who dried, threshed and winnowed the paddy as mills were not in the area at the time. My mother drew water from our well and carried it home in a pitcher. We used to help our parents in whichever way we could as we grew up. I think it is the simple village life that my mother led, the clean air and the home-grown food that kept my mother healthy for her to celebrate her 103rd birthday,” he said.
Even at 103 Johnihamy can get about unaided. Being a devout Buddhist, she used to walk to the village temple, about a half a mile away, to observe ‘sil’ every Poya day since her childhood until the Chief Incumbent of the temple requested her to observe ‘sil’ herself at her home. A large number of well-wishers including Johnihamy’s six children, 45 grandchildren and great grandchildren attended the religious ceremony held to celebrate her 103rd birthday.
