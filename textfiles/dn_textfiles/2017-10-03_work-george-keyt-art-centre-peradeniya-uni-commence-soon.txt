Work on George Keyt Art Centre at Peradeniya Uni to commence soon

Work on the proposed George Keyt Art Centre to be erected on the University of Peradeniya Campus grounds will commence very soon.
Kandy City Development Committee Chairman Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama chaired a meeting at the University of Peradeniya to discuss the work on the centre. Prof. Ranjini Obeyesekera, former Vice Chancellor S. Abeykoon, Vice Chancellor Prof. Upul Dissanayake, Prof. K. N. O. Dharmadasa and Retired Prof. Ranaweera of the Engineering Faculty participated. The architectural plan for the Centre was provided free of charge by architect Ashley de Vos at the request of Dr. Amunugama.
The Centre will display hundreds of paintings and sketches of George Keyt which were donated to the University by its former librarian the late Ian Goonatileke.
