PUCSL to pay interest on security deposits

Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said that they would comply with the guidelines recently issued by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to pay an interest on the security deposit of electricity consumers which CEB and LECO received when providing an electricity connection.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said that he had to first present the regulations issued by the PUCSL to Parliament for approval.
He said that it was for the first time after nearly six years that a government was bringing regulations on consumer security in Parliament. It reflects that the Power and Energy Ministry was concerned about the security and contentment of its consumers.
“We are still having discussions with the executive board on formulating regulations based on PUCSL. We would very soon initiate these payments,” Siyambalapitiya said.
The Minister also appealed to the public to use electricity scarcely, since the severe effects of the drought had not yet subdued despite heavy rain falls.
Even though there were heavy rain falls, water storage capacity of the reservoirs were below 35%, Minister Siyambalapitiya said. He said that it was a challenge to provide electricity with no power-cuts in a condition such as this.
Siyambalapitiya also said the ministry had introduced a special programme in line with power conservation request to win concessions on consumers’ electricity bills.
“Consumers who show a reduction of 10% in February, comparative to the January electricity bill, could send in a SMS to 1987 typed L (space) Your Account Number to register for a facility which would entitle consumers to receive a concession.” Siyambalapitiya explained.
He also requested electricity consumers to use LED bulbs instead of incandescent light bulbs, especially in households and factories. He also said the government was planning to give low cost LED bulbs on a monthly payment basis. He said that consumers could get more details from the Ministry of Power and Energy, Ceylon Electricity Board or LECO, by calling 1901, 1987 and 1910 respectively.
Minister Siyambalapitiya was speaking at a media briefing yesterday held at the Ministry premises. Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera and LECO Chairman Lal Gunasekara also spoke at the briefing.
