BBDO Lanka wins a ‘Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year’ award for third time

BBDO Lanka was recognised as one of the most creative agencies in the region once again when it was awarded the 'Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year - Gold' award by Campaign Asia-Pacific at its Agency of the Year 2017 awards. The South Asian region awards were announced and presented at a gala dinner held in Mumbai, India on December 5.
This is the third time that BBDO Lanka has entered the prestigious competition and been awarded a Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year award. It previously took home the Silver in 2012 and Bronze in 2015.
BBDO Pakistan took home the 'Pakistan Creative Agency of the Year - Bronze' award whilst BBDO India's Hermant Shringy was named 'South Asia Creative Person of the Year 2017'. Rajat Mendhi of BBDO India was named 'South Asia Strategic/Brand Planner of the Year 2017 Runner-up'.
Said BBDO Lanka Managing Director Santosh Menon upon picking up the award, "2017 has been a great year for us. We have been recognised with awards, here in Sri Lanka and abroad, for our work on Anchor, Janashakthi Life and Piramal Glass. Winning Campaign Asia-Pacific's 'Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year - Gold' for our work overall is the icing on the cake. I am proud of the team and looking forward to celebrating this win with them."
In 2015, BBDO Lanka was named Agency of the Year at its Effie Awards debut in Sri Lanka and this year took home a Gold and Finalist award for its two entries. It was also recognised with a Bronze at the Tangrams Effectiveness Awards at Spikes Asia in Singapore in September this year. Said BBDO Lanka Senior Account Director Chanithi Gunasekera, "We are thrilled to have been recognised with this coveted regional award for the third time. The award recognises inspired leadership, management excellence, outstanding business performance and overall brilliance in the year and is a reflection of our continuous commitment to delivering great work for our clients year after year. I thank each and every one of our clients including Fonterra Brands, Janashakthi Life, London Stock Exchange Group – Millennium IT, CEAT Kelani International Tyres, Kansai Paints, Hatton National Bank, Piramal Glass, Taj Samudra and Marico for the opportunity to work on their businesses.”
"In recent years, the Sri Lankan market landscape has changed tremendously. There are marketers still holding onto traditional mass marketing techniques whilst others are resorting to post digital specialising, trading creativity for greater efficiencies. It is in this setting that we embarked upon the strategy of working with our clients to go beyond the USP-differentiator approach and become a ‘mass mattering’ agency, i.e. connecting brands to people and what matters to them,” added Menon.
Now in its twenty-fourth year, Campaign Asia-Pacific Agency of the Year awards is the region's most esteemed Agency of the Year awards, identifying excellence in local markets through five separate regional competitions - Australia/New Zealand, Greater China, Japan/Korea, Southeast Asia and South Asia. The judging panel comprises of senior marketers from key business categories and Campaign editors who look for compelling and inspiring content with a wow-factor that shakes things up and produces excellent business results.
