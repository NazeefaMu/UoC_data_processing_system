‘Multi-purpose fisheries harbours will be set up island-wide’

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi said steps would be taken to set up multi-purpose fisheries harbours island-wide.
He was addressing a meeting of fisher folk at Tangalle.
The State Minister said a delegation from Korean Fisheries and Ocean Ministry met him and discussed at length the possibility of setting up the harbours.
The State Minister said the feasibility report on the project has already been submitted. He said the construction work of the harbours would commence in 2019.
The harbours would be funded by the Korean Government, he said.
“The foreign market has a great demand for prawns. Indian investors have expressed their willingness to invest in the venture. Investor D.Titus Fernando has expressed his willingness to invest five million US dollars in the same. Infrastructure facilities will be provided for investors in this regard,” the State Minister said.
