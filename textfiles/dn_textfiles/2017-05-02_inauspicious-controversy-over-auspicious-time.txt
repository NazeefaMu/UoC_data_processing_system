Inauspicious controversy over auspicious time

It was difficult for Anura Priyantha to choose between the two warring camps of astrologers this year. They had given two different auspicious timings to be followed for the New Year rites this year. One was the officially accepted government time and the other was a time declared by an astrologer who had fallen out with the State Astrologer’s Committee.
At 2.04 am on April 14, the New Year ‘officially’ dawned in Sri Lanka. At 7.05am, it was officially accepted as the best time to ‘commence work’. By evening of the same day, the controversial garbage dump at Meethotamulla collapsed, eventually killing over 30 people. The collapse which occurred on New Year, perhaps merely coincidental, gave way to the rebel astrologers declaring that the official auspicious time had spelled doom and gloom to the country and resulted in the Meethotamulla tragedy.
As various astrologers contested the authenticity of the New Year auspicious times this year, Anura Priyantha, an office assistance at a government institution said he did not want to offend either party and chose a time in-between the two different predictions to mark Avurudu rites this year,
“We looked at our own Litha (Summer Solstice) reading and followed that, we even let a minute pass by, just to make sure,” he said.
Priyantha, who wanted to follow the middle path in these affairs, observed that the problem even with the auspicious times was that they too were politicized. “If one astrologer closer to the government says one time, the other opposes, to curry favour from the opposition camp. I don’t think an auspicious time has anything to do with Meethotamulla. If that was true, what about the other natural disasters?” he questioned.
Bad timing
Controversy regarding auspicious times for New Year this year, erupted very publicly as members of the State Astrologers’ Committee who convened to discuss the times with Cultural Affairs Minister S.B. Navinna earlier this year had an open disagreement over the auspicious times.
Auspicious times for New Year play an important role in New Year rites and according to Ananda Senevirathna, a member of the State Astrologers’ Committee, it was only three years ago that serious disputes over times began to crop up.
The State Astrologers’ Committee was established in 1983 by former Minister V. J. M. Loku Bandara, on President J.R. Jayawardena’s instructions, to have uniformity in the auspicious times announced and followed by the people. Every year, 31 prominent senior astrologers and almanac compilers collectively decide on the auspicious times which need to be followed.
“The Committee was set up because people were giving various auspicious times and many started their Avurudu rites at different times. Thus to protect our culture, it was decided that all will follow standard auspicious times,” said Senevirathna.
The Committee, according to Senevirathna, has functioned without any major disputes until three years ago. “Last year especially, there was strong criticism over the time we gave and we responded to the criticism and the issue was resolved,” he said.
It was astrologer Piyasena Rathuwithana who disputed the times last year as well as this year. This was sprinkled with a strong political flavour as none other than former President Mahinda Rajapaksa chose to follow Rathuwithana’s times. Rajapaksa had even stated that the ‘official’ times were actually not auspicious at all.
“This year, one person in the Committee, brought in suggestions that the auspicious times need to be changed but the majority rejected his suggestion. His argument was that, the Moon was deposited in the 8th House and according to our time, this was bad. The counter suggestion we brought was that though the Moon was in the 8th house, it was debilitated, so it was not bad and in the Navamsa chart the Moon was in her own House, so that too was not bad,” explained Senevirathna.
“Then he said this auspicious times should be taken from the Pisces sign. But the best counter argument to that among many is that if we were to do that, in keeping with the time Sri Lanka became a Republic, this would make the auspicious time to be in the 8th House - this is the death position. The country became a Republic on May 22, 1972 at 12.43pm and the ascendancy was in Leo then. This would be the 8th House in Leo and that is bad. In addition, the present leader of country was born under the Libra sign and if we are to go with Pisces, this when counted from Libra, comes to the 6th house - this is that of disease and enemies. So we cannot take that.Either way, his arguments are neither good for the country nor the leader. So we rejected his proposition for the auspicious time,” he further explained.
Despite these arguments however, Rathuwithana and another astrologer G.M. Gunapala have given interviews and printed leaflets stating that it was due to the wrong auspicious time that Meethotamulla collapsed. In addition, they also say that the next eight months would be a ‘testing time’ for the country.
“The people in the area say that 12 hours prior to the collapse, glass on their cabinets cracked, pipes burst and animals ran away like in the Tsunami. That is 12 hours before our time to commence work. The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Commissioner had also said that he warned the people several months back about this and asked them to move. This was marked as a high risk zone. The geologists in the meantime, say that the mountain sunk due to the heavy rains. This was not ad-hoc,” said Seneviratne as he combined science with the reading of his astrology to point out the logic in the allegations.
“This person though an astrologer is not a gentleman,” he said.
Astrology in State Affairs
In the highly superstitious island nation, astrology has always been used as a political and cultural tool to shape the destinies of our leaders. During the rule of former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike astrology dominated state affairs. She decreed that Ceylon would become the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, precisely at the astrologically prescribed time of 12.43 p.m. on May 22, 1972, thus setting the time upon which Sri Lanka’s stars would be read thereafter. She also changed the lyrics of the national anthem from "Namo Namo Matha’ to ‘Sri Lanka Matha’ as she blamed the misfortunes of the country at the time on the ‘unlucky’ lyrics rather than poor political decisions. Bandaranaike, however, was not alone in choosing the astrologically mandated path in politics, every Head of State since then have followed suit.
Astrologers in the meantime, have both raked in profits as well as doom depending on which way they chose to play their luck. The infamous astrologer Sumanadasa Abeygunawardena did extremely well over the 10 years in which the former Rajapaksa regime reigned. His counsel was not only sought at every important government decision but he also held sway over the former President’s personal decisions. It was over Abeygunawardena’s advice that Rajapaksa called for elections two years early, resulting in his eventual defeat.
In 2009, astrologer Chandrasiri Bandara was arrested for predicting that Mahinda Rajapaksa would be soon unseated and that Ratnasiri Wickremenayake would be President with then Opposition Leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe being made Prime Minister.
In January of this year, Astrologer Vijitha Herath was arrested for predicting that President Maithripala Sirisena would soon be dead.
Attack on culture
To Asha Perera, an administrative assistant, who followed the ‘official auspicious time’, to get the timings right meant that all her affairs throughout the year would take place without any hindrance. She said that the more controversy surrounding it, the less people were going to believe in it.
Jayasiri Jayakody who has been following auspicious times since he was five years old, said it has been a strongly emphasized family tradition,
“I am 57 years old now, nothing spectacular happened as a result of these times but neither has anything bad happened as a result of it. I follow it as a Sinhalese but as a Buddhist I can only say, ‘What can the stars do?’ he said.
Whether he believes in astrology or not, for Jayakody it is tradition and he said that it was important to him that his children too followed these age old traditions and uphold the culture he grew up on.
Senevirathna too echoes similar sentiments. Though the latter has made it his profession to read the stars, he said the art itself was important for the continuity of the Sinhalese culture.
“In 1959, when SWRD Bandaranaike was killed, why did they choose a priest? Why Somarama? That bullet not only killed Bandaranaike but it also damaged generations of the Sangha,” said Senevirathna and added,
“It was an attack on our culture and beliefs. By doing this to our auspicious times, they are trying to destroy our traditional beliefs. It is certainly a conspiracy.”
Rathuwithana however said he would stand by his own prediction and stressed that the auspicious times released by the State Astrologer’s Committee would spell doom for the country for the next eight months.
“This is not about whether the majority agrees on a time or not. You have to be able to read the correct time. It is about having that knowledge,” said Rathuwithana.
Rathuwithana who has been having a continuous feud with the rest of the members insisted that the Committee needed to be dissolved and new members appointed. “I do not survive on this committee, I will no longer be attending sessions if they continue with the current committee,” he said.
Senevirathna who hit out strongly against Rathuwithana for choosing to publicly condemn the Committee’s rulings said disciplinary action needed to be taken against Rathuwithana.
“There were always criticism over the times, but they were well tolerated, these things must happen but no one has ever given alternative times. It is given that if a majority agree on a time, the rest should follow suit and not criticise it is public and throw disrepute on the whole committee,” he said.
“This is the furnishing of weapons for those who want to attack astrologers,” added Senevirathna.
Politics in Astrology
Minister of Cultural Affairs, S.B. Navinna however was nonchalant about the feud and to him the whole affair was about following due procedure.
“These auspicious times were decided on last July and by December everything was printed and published. In April, we simply hand over the times to the President as part of the ceremony, there was nothing new to contest. The times were already signed off by all 31 astrologers in the Committee, it was not clear why this one person contested the time after having signed off on it earlier,” said Minister Navinna.
“This Committee was not appointed by me and neither did we remove or add people. They have been there for years. After the one person protested, I convened the whole committee and invited the media for the discussion to sort things out. When they were arguing it out, the one who opposed could not support his arguments and he left. One person can say anything, he can make an auspicious time bad or good,” he said
The Minister further explained that earlier the times were sent by the former President Rajapaksa to Abeygunawardena to approve of but now the government simply went ahead with the Committee’s majority ruling.
“There is no politics for me here. What we give is an overall time, it might be good for some and bad for others. When the Meethotamulla dump collapsed, they may say it is due to the auspicious time, but that collapse only affected those who lived in its vicinity. That same auspicious time did not affect others who did not live there. So you cannot blame the time,” said the minister.
Following the New Year, President Sirisena made a political decision to remove key SLFP organizers from their posts, changing their immediate futures.
“Can you blame our auspicious time on the fate of those organizers? We did not ask anyone to be changed. The government gives people an overall ‘time’, it is up to them to make good with that,” said the minister setting the record straight.
