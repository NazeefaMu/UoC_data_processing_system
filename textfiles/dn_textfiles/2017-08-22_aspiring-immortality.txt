Aspiring for immortality

Talent, commitment and simplicity are the pillars of Judy de Silva’s career. A lady who has been singing since the age of seven she has been successful because she is down to earth and has never let fame get the better of her. Melodies speaks to Judy De Silva who is selectively passionate.
We have heard so many stories of child stars going wrong. The music industry is very competitive and demanding. Judy experienced fame at a very young age, becoming a child star, but has remained stable and she has her mother and her grandmother to thank for that. Like anyone in this world she has had her share of problems yet she has always had family.
“I was brought up by two iron ladies - my grandmother, Evelyn, and my mother, Kanthie.
I have had problems like everyone in life and that has sometimes affected my career, but I have always found my strength to pull through without losing my cool thanks to "my rock", my mother and of course the rest of my family. If you have a strong family no one can burn you, and also if you are not too ambitious the impact of losses is less painful,” said De Silva.
A lady who enjoys life in her own way she has done many cassettes and CD’s with Sohan & X-Periments, one album with her mother including English Originals, One Sinhala album with 16 originals, One Album with ‘Eternal Soul’ with Sinhala originals and about 10 singles in Sinhala and English.
Beautiful lyrics
De Silva has been singing from around the age of seven with her mother who is a singer by profession herself. She started singing professionally in 1985 with Debbie Arnolda who was the best one girl orchestra and had the best equipment at that time. Her father the late Bobby Arnolda (uncle Earl) was De Silva’s first manager, from who she learnt what it was to be a performer.
“Of course I enjoy music but I'm not passionate about music in whole, it all depends on my mood as to what type of music I'm passionate about. I enjoy life in my own way. I have always liked quiet surroundings. My life may seem boring to some but it's a lot of fun for me,” explained De Silva.
Like any brilliant artiste Judy’s creations come from within. She uses her imagination and writes beautiful lyrics. That is why she is so successful. That is why she is one of the most respected women in the music industry in Sri Lanka, but admits that when composing tunes it comes from within. Locally she admires the talent of "Umara & Umaria" and Nirosha Virajini. Internationally she loves many artistes, but Whitney Houston is on top of the list.
When it comes to goals, plans and ambitions, she takes life as it comes. This approach she has had from her school days. She is content with what she has and who she is. De Silva has had the backing of the very best in the industry - Bobby Arnolda and Sohan Weerasinghe. Much of who she is, she attributes to them. Sohan Weerasinghe had a lot to do with De Silva forming an identity of her own.
“I also won awards for the island’s outstanding female vocalist, then got the opportunity to become an actress and won the Sarasaviya Lux Award for the "best new actress" for my first attempt in acting,” said De Silva.
Various tunes
De Silva has had four mentors that have watched over her and have been a lamp to light the path before her. With their tutelage she has become a charismatic female musician capable of keeping an audience riveted.
“I owe my success to my mom, from who I got my talent and learnt so much including standard songs and Jazz styles and the guidance in many areas. Then Lylie Godridge, who trained my voice, which has helped me to enhance my ability to sing, while being aware and being in control of my voice. Then Uncle Earl and Sohan. These four have given me the concrete foundation for my 32 year old career as a singer,” said De Silva.
De Silva aspires to be immortal. Judging by the way she is going she may well be remembered, forever as long as music lives on, perhaps like all those great musicians before her. She has already made a mark in the industry. It is a distinct possibility.
“What I want in my future is to do my own music and make a mark in the industry as a composer/song writer for my fans to remember me by, long after I'm done with singing, and to make the people who have contributed so much to my career proud. Even after we're all gone our names will forever be linked in the industry,” said De Silva.
Some songs she does are ballads and dance and maybe even baila, rock’n roll or even Latino. She says that whatever that comes from within her is created in various tunes and beats.
“All songs I've written are heartbroken love songs except for "sweet daughter" which is a song for a wedding,” said De Silva.
Having achieved fame at a very young age she has sound advice to anyone who wants to enter the music industry. Firstly it is to stay grounded however popular they become and keep things simple.
“Work hard to make your fans happy. Do them justice, because they are very important. Listen to criticism more than praise. Don’t cheat on singing by using current technology, because you will be doomed if you are asked to sing live! Technology is unavoidable, but is there to enhance talent not to create talent,” she opined.
