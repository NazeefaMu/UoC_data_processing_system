Irrigation tank renovations soon in Anuradhapura

The island-wide Gamen Gamata, Wawen Wewata minor tank renovation project would soon begin in Anuradhapura. It was planned under President Maithripala Sirisena's Grama Shakthi village development project aimed at renovating and restoring dilapidated irrigation and drainage networks, to avert drinking water scarcity.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that President Sirisena would inaugurate the minor tank renovations at Nabadagasdigiliya in Mahawilachchiya, coming under the Dunumandalawa tank network. The network consists of eight tanks, namely the Nabadagasdigiliya, Helambawewa, Mahamillagollewa, Ihala Millagollewa, Ihala Helanlawewa, Galahitiyawa and Ihala Ethawewa tanks.
The army would carry out the construction under the supervision of Brigadier Chandana Wijesundara, while technical assistance would be provided by the Agrarian Development Department and the Provincial Irrigation Department, he added.
The Mahawilachchiya and the Nochchiyagama Divisional Secretariat divisions had been affected the most by the prevailing drought. Farmer organisations would provide additional manpower. Once the Dunumandalawa tank network renovation is complete, the Ambagahawewa tank network in Nochchiyagama would be next, Wanninayake said.
The second network consists of the Ihala Galkiriyagama, Diwulwewa and Pahala Galkiriyagama tanks, as well as the Ihala Kongasdigiliya Wewa, Lena Wewa, Kimbulpetiyawa Wewa, Nai Wewa and Elapathgama Wewa, Wanninayake added.
Project Coordinator and Assistant Anuradhapura Agriculture Director Sirisena Herath said that funding was provided by the Presidential Task Force for Food Production.
