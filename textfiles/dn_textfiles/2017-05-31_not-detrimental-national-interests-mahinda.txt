Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the country's national interests is of paramount importance. Therefore, nothing will be done to harm the country's national interests or security when entering into bipartite agreements with any country relating to the Hambantota Port development.
The Minister said that the country will not enter into agreements which can be detrimental to its national interests and national security.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.

“The government is engaged in trying to get the best agreement for the both parties aiming to obtain a win-win situation,” the Minister said.
“The Hambantota port will never be sold, but leased out as it is a financial burden to the Treasury. Many sections of the old agreement have already been amended by now. This will be a win-win situation for both parties,” he said.

“The Finance Ministry will launch a mechanism to utilise these foreign funds to the maximum benefirt of the affcted people. Unlike in the past, a National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) report is necessary when constructing new houses. Projects which received NBRO approval are given permission to carry out the construction,” Minister Smarasinghe said.
