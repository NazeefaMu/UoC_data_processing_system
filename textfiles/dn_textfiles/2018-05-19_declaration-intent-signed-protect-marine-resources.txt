Declaration of Intent signed to protect marine resources

Businesses, the Sri Lankan Government, French Government and representatives of the scientific community yesterday signed a Declaration of Intent between Sri Lanka and France to protect the marine resources of the country.
The organizations Biodiversity Sri Lanka, MIND led by Prof. Mohan Munasinghe, IUCN, the French Development Agency, together with companies like Aitken Spence Travels, Dialog Axiata, Dilmah Ceylon Tea, MAS intimates, Tess Pvt. Ltd., Tokyo Cement signed an expression of interest to start with the pilot project of working together to conserve the coastal belt from Vakarai to Batticaloa.
French Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Jean-Marin SCHUH speaking at the event held at the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies said France was very interested in helping Sri Lanka conserve its marine environment and that the two countries had much to share in terms of knowledge.
With France part of the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), he hoped that Sri Lanka too can through this project consider entering into the ICRI, to benefit from 60 other countries who are facing similar threats to its coral reefs.
Prof. Munasinghe offering his research expertise to the initiative said coastal belts offered immense potential for blue economic growth of nations, with over 60 percent of the world’s GNP being generated within a 100km of the ocean.
However, due to human actions which have polluted and over-exploited the marine resource, by 2010, almost 60 percent fish stocks were said to be exploited outside their safe biological limits.
Over 55 percent of Sri Lankan population depends on coastal resources. But marine resources contribute less than 2 percent to GDP, although our territorial resources are eight times the size of our land resource, he added.
The Blue Green initiative thus seeks to promote economic growth and livelihoods by protecting the marine environment.
The recent report on the Presidential Expert Committee on Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 in which Prof. Munasinghe is also part of highlighted the development of the marine sector, he explained.
“It focused on marine pollution, ocean acidification due to climate change, coastal degradation, a dwindling fish catch and the finally huge problems with sustainable utilization and governance”.
First we need to prioritise which of these ocean resources are more important, who uses them and then where do you put these resources in terms of monetary and environmental terms and then we can recommend practical policies to government, businesses and communities on how to manage these resources, he said further.
The most important endeavour in this project, he said, was to have sound research and that public, private and the government sector had to be part of this research.
The Declaration of Intent signed between the French Ambassador and the Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Anura Dissanayake will also have France help the Sri Lankan government implement projects related to the blue-green economy.
