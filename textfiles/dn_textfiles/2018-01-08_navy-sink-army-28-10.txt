Navy sink Army 28-10

Navy Sports Club beat Army Sports Club by 28 points (4 tries, 4 conversions) to 10 (1 try, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) in their Dialog 'A' Division inter-club league rugby second round match played at Havelock grounds in Havelock Park yesterday. At half time Navy led 14-10.
Both teams dished out a superb brand of running rugby in the entire game. Army played a better game in the first half giving a torrid time to the Navy but the sailors staged a spirited performance from the beginning of the second half to increase their lead further and won the game with a much needed bonus point.
The tries for Navy were scored by full back Thilina Weerasinghe (two), prop forwards Stefan Gregory (one) and Charith Silva (one) with full back Weerasinghe putting over all four conversions.
For Army, their speedy centre Bulathsinghala scored the only try with full back Gayan Salinda putting over the solitary conversion and the penalty.
