Bun eating gone wrong

A 42-year-old man participating in a bun-eating contest at a traditional Avurudu festival in Kosgoda had to be rushed to the hospital when a bun stuck in his throat.  It was later revealed that the man, an employee at a tourist hotel in Kosgoda, had tried to swallow the bun whole instead of chewing in his eagerness to win the bun-eating competition.
Hospital sources said the hotel employee was visibly embarrassed after undergoing treatment and overcoming his difficulty, he had fled the hospital later without informing authorities.
The Avurudu festival was organized by the hotel management where the man was employed. Both workers and tourists had participated in the festival.
