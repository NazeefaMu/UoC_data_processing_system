Alcohol, tobacco usage reduced in 2017 - ADIC

The Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) in its 2017 trend survey on tobacco smoking and alcohol has stated that there was a significant reduction in the use of alcohol and tobacco products in 2017.
Survey results showed that alcohol users reduced from 32.9 percent in 2016 to 25.3 percent in 2017, increasing the number of non-users to 74.6 percent that year.
There was. however, an increase in alcohol use between the age groups of 15-18 in 2017 when compared to 2016, whilst the age groups 25-39 and over 40 showed a decline.
Overall, there was no significant change in the type of alcohol used between 2016 and 2017. The 2017 Budget had proposed a pricing formula to encourage people to switch to soft liquor from hard liquor.
Further. in 2017 more people, specifically 56.7 percent, stated that they started drinking between the ages of 16-20 than in 2016 which was at 53.8 percent.
When it came to tobacco usage, there was a significant decline in the number of users, from 31.9 percent in 2016 to 22.5 percent in 2017.
The highest decrease was noted in the age categories between 25-39 years, where consumption of tobacco decreased from 38.4 percent to 23.9 percent.
In general, however, 2017 saw a significant decline in alcohol and tobacco use. The ADIC stated that this was a result of maintaining government policies favourable to the control of alcohol and tobacco use.
Policies such as making pictorial warnings taking up over 80 percent of the package and the increase in the price of cigarettes have successfully reduced the smokers. This year, Cabinet approval was granted to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes. The ADIC has been conducting the survey nationally since 1998.
