Trinity-Antonians at rugby today

The postponed inter-school rugby game between Trinity College and St. Anthony’s College which was to be played on Sunday will now take place at Nittawela grounds today. The under 16 game will kick off at 3 pm and the senior game at 4 pm.
This will be the 55th encounter between the two schools. In comparison both sides appear to have the same characteristics and will rely heavily on fitness.
Trinity are likely to find most of their problems coming from up front where Antonians have shown tremendous fire in the two practice games. They have a superb set of forwards who could control the vital area.
For the Antoninas back division, it’s going to be a hard evening’s work as the Trinitians scoring strength lies in their back division. The Antonians will undoubtedly try their best to hold them. As long as the ball is kept on the ground in straight forward rucks Trinity forwards can successfully initiate second phase attacks.
A good game of run and pass rugby is expected from these two enterprising teams, in the scrum down today. H.P. Veranga will referee.
