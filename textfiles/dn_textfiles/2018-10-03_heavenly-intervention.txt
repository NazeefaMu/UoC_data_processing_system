Heavenly intervention

Devol is a deity subjected to worship and belief in Sri Lanka. The deity, like his contemporaries, is believed to possess a heavenly intervention in curing the incurable. He is one of the twelve deities worshiped. The deity is believed to be intervening in the affairs of the worldlings. The practice of the worship of Devol deviyo or the cult of Devol is widespread in the Southwestern lowlands and coastal areas. The devotees who make offerings at the shrines and perform rituals usually seek vengeance, benevolence and prosperity from the deity to solve their day to day problems. Firm in that belief, such a procession was witnessed recently in Kolonnawa.
