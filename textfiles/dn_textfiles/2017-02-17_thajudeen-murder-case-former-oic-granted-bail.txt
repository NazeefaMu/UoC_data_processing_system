Thajudeen murder case: Former OIC granted bail

Former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera held in remand custody over a period of nine months for his alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder was yesterday granted bail by Colombo High Court.
High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke made this order taking into consideration a revision application filed by the former Crimes OIC challenging the Colombo Additional Magistrate’s order to refuse bail.
The suspect was ordered to be released on a Rs.100,000 bail with three sureties of one million rupees each by the Colombo High Court.
He was further ordered to appear before the CID on the last Sunday of every month. The High Court further ordered the suspect to surrender his passport to Court and severely warned not to interfere with the investigations.
“The bail can be canceled if the suspect interferes with the witnesses,” the High Court Judge observed.
Perera was arrested by the CID on April 20, 2016 for allegedly covering up evidence and misrepresenting information to court regarding Thajudeen’s murder which took place on May 17, 2012.
Through the revision application, the former Crimes OIC sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrate’s refusal to enlarge him on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
The suspect said the Colombo Additional Magistrate had refused to release him on bail on a number of occasions since he had been charged for conspiring to commit a murder.
The petitioner said there is evidence to prove that he was not involved in conspiring to commit a murder and thereby moved Court that he be released on bail.
The former Crimes OIC said he had acted in accordance with the instructions given by higher ranking police officers and did not commit anything wrong.
The prosecution maintained that there is suspicion that the suspect had involved along with the main suspects to commit this murder since circumstantial evidence suggested that the suspects had conducted investigations to record Thajudeen’s death as a fatal road accident.
Senior Counsel Ajith Pathirana with Harin Hettiarachchi appeared for the petitioner. Senior State Counsel Suharshi Herath appeared for the Attorney General.
