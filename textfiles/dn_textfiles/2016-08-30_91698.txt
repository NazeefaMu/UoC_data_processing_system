Drake Congratulates Rihanna’s MTV VMAs Honor With Giant Billboard

Drake sure knows how to make a statement.
Ahead of 2016 MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday (Aug. 28), where Rihanna was honored with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, the Toronto MC bought a large billboard in Los Angeles to congratulate the diva.
"Congratulations to Rihanna from Drake and Everyone at OVO," the billboard read.
The gesture didn’t go unnoticed by Rihanna. "When he extra," she captioned an Instagram photo of the large sign, along with a heart and trophy emojis.
Rumors have been swirling that the two music stars are secretly dating, which would explain why Drake would go to so much effort to congratulate the singer. Or perhaps it was meant to drive awareness of Drake's song "Too Good," which features Rihanna and has been climbing the Hot 100. - ET
