Decisive days ahead!

The apparent situation has become dramatic. Yes, Dharma Yuddaya has entered the very center of the Yahapalanaya. Today’s UNP is a party that hounds out Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, but will staunchly defend Rajitha Senaratne. UNP while disclaiming that it is the party of pro imperialist bourgeoisie prides itself on being the party of professionals and the educated. Today it is a party that replaces as Minister of Justice, a President’s Counsel and a former examiner in the Faculty of Law at Colombo University, who has also earned two PhDs, with a mature political lady who has no academic credentials; because Wijedasa proved to be Sinhala Buddhist racist who harassed minority communities and anti fascist leaders.
In spite of the fact that UNP is a party which scrapped the mandatory percentage of electoral candidates under age 35, in order to give a strong presence to females, today it is a strong liberal party that has won the faith of oppressed minorities. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and Minister Sajith Premadasa are working closely following Lichchawees tradition. All these changes stem from and reflect the perspective of the leadership. President has come into this liberal combine and emphasizes that Yahapalanaya will continue up to 2022. ‘Dhamma Yuddaya’ between fascistic Mahinda camp and the camp of unity and reconciliation have become dramatic. Also, we witness the successful action of the ‘Sixty two’ movement that sends a people’s message to both the government and the opposition. Militant democracy demanded the sooner implementation of promises while indicating that fascistic politics has no chance.
Apparently people overseas sincerely believe that the white van culture is back and that the government is behind it. Their SOLE argument for continuing to support this government, namely that it had restored a modicum of democracy, seems to be collapsing. However, this is completely wrong; there is an intense battle between the democracy that brought forward a positive draft for a new constitution and the fascistic opposition.
Karunanayake’s resignation
However, some say the resignation of Minister Ravi Karunanayake due to a suspicion created in the issue concerning the Central Bank Bond scam is a gallant step and it created an example to everybody. In particular, the entire episode shows against the political opponents of the Yahapalana government whom it accused of far worse wrongs. Latter includes the fascistic murder of media men and groups of minority people. Democratic masses that support the government are happy that the reforms it has instituted, in particular, to empower state institutions to act independently are being used more resolutely by those who wish to undermine it than by the government itself. Two examples would be the protests against the lease of the Hambantota port to China and the SAITM private medical school, the grounds for both of which were laid by the previous government. Making use of free media and the democratic establishment pro opposition political and social organisations created almost anarchy with misery. However, in the end, Yahapalanaya in a fair game won the battle.
When the electorate voted at the presidential and general elections for the change of government, they did so because they understood that Mahinda regime was the fascistic menace. Also, promises that the new government leaders and democratic activists made were ones they could identify with. The pledges to bring before the law, those accused of brutal fascistic killings such as Lasantha, horrible racist violence such as Beruwala, war crimes, vast corruption and abuse of power under the former government; and to institute good governance by reinstating the rule of law that took centre stage in the government’s election campaign. Today the disillusionment of the electorate is primarily due to these promises not being delivered on. Their disillusionment is increased by the failure of the government to deliver economic benefits to the masses who are struggling to keep afloat amidst the rising cost of living. However, people are willing to keep the faith and push the government forward as shown by the very successful Satyagraha recently launched by the ‘Sixty two movement’.
It is correct to say that despite the failures of the government, it has support. Its continuing strength comes in two ways. The first is that the brutal truth is there is no alternative; Mahinda clan is no alternative at all. Hence people continue to hope that Yahapalanaya will deliver on its promises, as they have no alternative to going, as good governance and the protection of human rights are their goals too.
The second is that the government has delivered on the most important aspect of governance, which is to give them a sense of security that their human rights will not be subjected to the arbitrary violation. In particular, women have come forward to be in charge of the rights won. On the other hand minority communities feel they are free and treated as equals. During the period of the last government, this latter fear was widely prevalent. Even people in business, and those at the grassroots equally felt uncertain; who were far from the centers of power, feared for their lives on this count. They felt that there was impunity in the system and those at lower levels too could take the law into their own hands.
President Sirisena quit the previous rule as he could not stand corruption, as explained by himself. Of course, there were other more criminal issues involving the Rajapaksas. Apparently, he protested in all that. PM Ranil helped him to come out and people rallied behind him.
They sought a government which is not burdened with corruption but offers democracy and good governance. Constitutional reforms, electoral reforms, and judicial independence are all linked with the change expected. However, removal of executive presidency and devolution of power put together was the main demand.
During the first term, the President was able to do away with some of his executive powers considered draconian. Besides, he managed to get the 19th Amendment enacted making way for independent commissions to be set up.
However, people are expecting fundamental changes. President has not spelled out his proposal for constitutional change.
Nevertheless, he was able to build up Sri Lanka’s image in the international arena. Today, it is public knowledge that those responsible for mass scale corruption are exposed. The President said in a recent meeting that he had no way forward with corrupt elements. He vowed to form a government without corrupt elements. No one has accused Ranil Wickremesinghe of corruption. So, this new Yahapalanaya could come out with the support of the UNP. President can consider the fact that Minister Tilak Marapana resigned from the Cabinet once because he was just accused of something. He was the lawyer retained in the Avant Garde case by the defence. This policy will be continued says the UNP general sectary. There are accusations against prominent UNP leaders. PM is accused of safeguarding these people. The UNP cannot remain mute in this regard. Such things are no more; relatively speaking everybody feel relieved. However, this is not enough, not at all; we have to mobilize and fight for more!
About the Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said that they would launch trade union actions in near future. Addressing the media, member of the Media Committee of the GMOA Dr. Prasad Colombage said that the Attorney-General's Department (AG's Dept.) had turned a blind eye to command the government to announce its stance on SAITM and adding the political elements had misled both the AG's department and the government to come out with reasonable solutions over the issue! Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge stressed the government was deliberately delaying to issue, the stance on SAITM, by virtue of the whims and fancies of some politicians and responsible officials.
New taxes
“We have almost come to the edge of this struggle to insist the government to abolish SAITM. But, we have not lost our grip and therefore, we are prepared to launch protest marches and vehicle parades followed by massive island-wide trade union actions in near future.” What nonsense! The Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill (IRB) which is to be tabled in Parliament next week weighted in favour of foreigners and a disadvantage to Sri Lankans, MP Bandula Gunawardena said recently. He told a Joint Opposition news briefing that according to the new Bill, Sri Lankans working abroad would be taxed when they bring in their wealth to the country. “However, foreigners working here will be exempted from taxes when they take away their income out of the country. This is not rational,” the MP said. Cleary these fascistic elements are irrational. New taxes are formulated to tax the rich while reducing the burden on the poor.
Truth and Justice Project
The MP said senior citizens and those engaged in crop cultivation would also be severely affected by the new amendments.
In the meantime the Truth and Justice Project (ITJP), in South America has filed war crimes lawsuits against former General Jagath Jayasuriya who is now Sri Lankan ambassador to Brazil, Al Jazeera reported recently. The lawsuits against Jayasuriya alleged that he oversaw military units that attacked hospitals and killed, disappeared and tortured thousands of people in the final phase of the war in 2009. Jayasuriya has diplomatic immunity in Brazil and five other countries where he is the ambassador - Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Suriname. But the groups pursuing the suits hope they will compel regional governments to open investigations of Jayasuriya, remove his immunity and expel him, the article said.
Carlos Fernandez, the lawyer who is coordinating the effort, has told a foreign news agency that suits have been filed on Monday in Brazil and Colombia. Hence this will be an occasion to test the validity of war crime accusation.
