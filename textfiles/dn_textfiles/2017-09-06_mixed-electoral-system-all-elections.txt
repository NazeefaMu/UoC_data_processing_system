Mixed electoral system for all elections

Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha will table a cabinet memorandum proposing to apply the new mixed electoral system introduced for the local government bodies, to Provincial Council and parliamentary elections. Mustapha says he will table the memorandum at the Cabinet meeting today.
The new mixed electoral system for the Local Government bodies follows a First-Past-the-Post (FPP) representation 60 percent and Proportional Representation (PR) 40 percent ratio.
“The Constitutional Steering Committee has already proposed to hold the parliamentary election under this 60:40 ratio electoral system.Introducing the same system to Provincial Councils will ensure that we have a consistent method applied to all elections,” Minister Mustapha said.
All political parties in parliament have consented to this proposal.
Mustapha said the new electoral system will pave the way for a better political culture and said he is willing to discuss the proposal with all political parties and other parties concerned.
The Local Government and Provincial Council Ministry will seek recommendations from an expert committee on the proposal as well.
