JO May Day rally sends strong message to govt: Dullas

The people who thronged to the Joint Opposition’s May Day rally at Galle Face on Monday have sent a strong message to the government that the majority of people are against its policies, Parliamentarian Dullas Allahapperuma said.
He was speaking at a press conference at the N.M. Perera Centre in Borella yesterday. “The Galle Face Rally has sent a strong message to the government that people are against its policies.
They are ready to take a right decision if the government continues to postpone elections," he said.
Allahapperuma said the Galle Face rally reflected the opposition of entrepreneurs at the grassroots level towards government policies. He said the entrepreneurs contributed to make the rally a success.
Former External Affairs Minister Prof. G L Peiris said democracy and Fundamental Rights are nurtured by the fountain of suffrage. “Democracy and Fundamental Rights will not prevail if the right to franchise of the people are denied by the government," he said.
