Lankan U19 cricketers break new ground

The Sri Lanka under 19 cricket team broke new ground when they left on a tour of South Africa for the first time yesterday. The team will play in a one-day triangular series which also involves Zimbabwe.
Sri Lanka will also play three one-dayers against South Africa after the triangular.
The team is led by Avishka Fernando of St. Sebastian College, Moratuwa with Kamindu Mendis of Richmond College, Galle as his deputy. The team includes a mixture of experienced and junior players.
“We are going to South Africa for the first time that is why we are taking 16 players,” said team coach Roy Dias.
“We know there are fast pitches in South Africa that’s why we have included five fast bowlers in our team. This is a good chance for our players to learn how to bat and bowl on fast pitches,” he said.
“We have another one year for the Youth World Cup. We have planned to include more players to our squad after this tour,” Dias said.
“We have well balanced team, we hope to play better and our aim is to win the matches. We have the best players who played in the Asian Championship. I represented the national team and I like to share my experiences with the team,” Sri Lanka under 19 team captain Avishka Fernando said.
