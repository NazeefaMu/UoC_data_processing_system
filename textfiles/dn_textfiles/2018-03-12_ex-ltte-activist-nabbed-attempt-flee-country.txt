Ex-LTTE activist nabbed in attempt to flee country

A former LTTE activist who was trying to flee to India, was arrested at the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) by Immigration and Emigration officers and handed over to Katunayake Police on March 9. The suspect was due to leave for India by a flight scheduled at 2.10 p.m. He was arrested around 12 noon, before he could board the flight.
Investigations revealed that the suspect had been arrested by security forces and detained for six years as an LTTE suspect and released on September 23, 2016 on condition that he reported to police once a month.
Furthermore, he had been forbidden from travelling aboard.
The reason for his visit to India was that he was due to attend a pooja at a kovil, the suspect had said.
He had been a former member of the Jaffna Municipal Council and an active member of the LTTE as well.
Katunayake police are investigating.
