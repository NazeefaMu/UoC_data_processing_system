‘Valampoori’ valued at nearly Rs. 100 m, Seven nabbed

Seven suspects who were trying to sell a ‘Valampoori’ valued at nearly Rs 100 million were nabbed by STF personnel attached to the Panama Camp near the Kalkuda Vishnu Kovil yesterday. The raid was conducted on the directions of DIG G M R Lathiff following a tip off received from a member of the public. The suspects hailing from Matale, Valachchenai and Polonnaruwa were handed over to the Wild Life Conservation Department Office in Batticaloa. They were due to be produced in Court.
