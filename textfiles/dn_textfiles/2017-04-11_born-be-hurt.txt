Born to be hurt

Despite its toughened shell, turtles have earned much repute as a juicy delicacy in Sri Lanka. Mother turtles are shy by nature, hence fear the worst. They are nevertheless left without any option other than coming ashore to lay their eggs and let nature take its course.
If you have ever wondered about the destiny of these minuscule creatures born in the soft sand, it mostly ends up as a sad tale. But now things are taking a different tide thanks to a number of good-hearted hatcheries set up down south. They hatch plans to rescue the creatures from being subject to poaching.
On your drive along the Galle-Colombo main road, you will not miss this locale with a large plate that reads Mahamodara Turtle Hatchery in not so sophisticated script. The arrow sign below the script leads you inside along a grassy patch of land. Walking a few metres, you will finally reach a backyard which hardly looks a hatchery at all – but not when you step in across the wooden plank after paying the entrance fee.
Next, it is your turn to get surprised when you hear of its owner: Nilanga, a tuk-tuk owner with a paltry income, yet affluent kindness for turtles, to run this business.
“The turtle season is usually between May and December. During this time, a large number of turtles come ashore to lay eggs between 9 pm and 5 am. We have to stay sleepless and watch out for them. Otherwise, people will come and grab their eggs for meat,” Nilanga explains his mission against poaching, a persistent problem in the very much touristy area down south.
Located in the backyard of their home, this small turtle hatchery narrates a passionate tale about Nilanga’s family’s devotion to rescuing the helpless sea creatures.
Nilanga allocates a lion’s share of his tuk-tuk income to the mission. They manage to secure occasional funds from benefactors. They have been channelled to build the tanks and roofs to shelter the turtles. The amount you pay as entrance fee will also be drawn to run the hatchery.
Inside the hatchery, you will be greeted by turtles of diverse age groups - one-day old ones included. The large turtles are kept from being released to sea, because of various health concerns. Most turtles get hit by fishing boats and injure their necks. Nilanga lifts a large turtle that had eaten a plastic bag mistaking it for a jellyfish. A separate tank is home to such turtles that will be released to sea following a complete recovery.
In the corner of the hatchery is a nesting area where the eggs are laid for babies to hatch on time. Despite its moderate roof cover, Nilanga and his family are still bothered by the threat of invading reptiles.
“That is a serious problem, though we keep on attending to it with various solutions. They are tough to keep away from. They easily smell the eggs and try to approach the area,” Nilanga noted.
When the baby turtles come of age, they can be released to the sea. The participants get an opportunity to release them too.
A TripAdvisor reviewer, however, cautions against hiring tuk-tuks to reach the place.
“The tuk-tuk drivers will demand commission from the owners, who are challenged financially in the first place. So please, if you need transport, call the number above [0755402553] and the owner will come get you in his own tuk-tuk,” notes Sarah J on TripAdvisor.
By the look of it, you will probably hasten to detect this as just another activity of exploitation to lure – or chisel, perhaps - tourists. You should be in the right, reasonably. However, their passionate project, despite restricted funds, has saved thousands of turtles from being victims of poaching and other injuries caused by the fishery industry.
Suffice to say, the hatchery is a much safer place for the turtles to settle down than sea, their original home. That, of course, is merely an idealistic notion given the fact that the place is not quite spacious to accommodate such an infinite amount of turtles. But the injured turtles have to stay here until they recover. The baby turtles have to stay here until they grow mature enough for sea. Your generous contribution, apart from the entrance fee, will be a crucial factor in keeping them within the comfortable confines.
The turtles here are not just items of exhibition. You can caress them, feel them and even feed them, as long as making sure that you do not hurt them. The notice boards in the surrounding will give you a precise idea about the turtle species in Sri Lanka as well as the world over. Nilanga and his wife, Nisha, will enlighten you whenever you need to know something.
If you reach there at the right time, you will even be able to release the ‘teenage’ turtles to the sea.
If not for passion, Nilanga would have given in altogether. Apart from a few benefactors, he hardly gets any support. Even the mainstream hatcheries located in Galle turn a blind eye to his concerns. That could be because they need a share of the credit too, Nilanga reasons. But he is not the one to give up that simply. Nor is his wife! They both take turns to turtle-sit with a heart coupled with passion as well as kindness. That is exactly why this couple deserves your visit and a small stipend of generous kindness.
