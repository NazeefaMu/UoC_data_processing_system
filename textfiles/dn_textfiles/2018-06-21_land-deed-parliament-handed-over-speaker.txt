Land deed to Parliament handed over to Speaker

The new land deed to Parliament was handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya by Land and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka yesterday evening.
The deed was handed over to Speaker Jayasuriya in the presence of Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella and other ministers, deputy ministers and Parliament officials.
It was revealed recently, that the Parliament and the 12-acre plot of land it is situated on, had no official deed for the past 36 years. The ownership of the land had been provided to Parliament by a ‘Thamba Sannaspathra,” a royal edict engraved on a copper plate by late President J. R. Jayewardene to the then Speaker M. Bakeer Marka in 1982.
The total area of the Parliament premises, which was 12 acres, one rood and 32 perches in 1982, had extended over the time and the new deed includes all surrounding areas. Survey activities pertaining to the land had been carried out during the past few months.
