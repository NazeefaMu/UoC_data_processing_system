Some oppose industrial zone while enjoying perks as MPs: Chief Minister

Industrial development is very essential to develop the country and provide employment to unemployed youth. When steps are taken to create an industrial zone in Hambantota for that purpose, some sections are opposing it and demonstrating, while enjoying all perks as Members of Parliament.
The public should not fall prey to the falsehoods spread by such protesters, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal de Silva said. He was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stones for a two storeyed building planned by the Chief Ministry and the Ambalangoda MPCS at Manampita to house the Manampita Primary Co-operative shop and Rural Bank.
The Chief Minister said large scale development projects damaged the environment. "But such projects could not be shelved either on grounds of environmental damage. What should be done is to minimise the environmental damage caused by such projects to the maximum possible extent."
He said the President would not allow any harm being caused to the people. The Hambantota development project would be undertaken without causing any loss of traditional land belonging to its people, the Chief Minister said.
He said people who kept mum when the previous regime launched harmful development projects were now being irked when the present government launched gigantic projects for the development of the country and also for the progress of the people.
He said certain people questioned him whether he had changed his loyalties, the Chief Minister said. De Silva said he would never change and would firmly stand behind the present leader of the SLFP. He said according to the people's mandate given to him, he will be Chief Minister of the Southern Province until April 2019.
