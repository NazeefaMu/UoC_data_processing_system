‘Students admitted to leading schools breaching rules’

Over 50 students are reported to have been admitted to popular leading provincial schools in the Kurunegala District recently violating the relevant circulars of the Education Ministry.
A senior official of the NWP-PC Education Ministry has instructed principals to admit those students and the principals said the order is totally against the rules and regulations of the circulars issued by the Education Ministry.
Those students are said to be children of certain councilors of the NWP-PC and of several prominent politicians and their close relatives.
Several parents have complained the matter to NWP Governor K.P. Logezwaran seeking a solution, a principal said.
