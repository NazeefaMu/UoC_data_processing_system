TIRED PEEPERS?

Dark eye circles happen to the best of us. Whether they are the cause of genetics, age, allergens, dehydration or any other factor, getting rid of dark eye circles is one of beauty’s most frustrating battles. While logging a full night’s sleep seems like a reasonable fix for the problem, those bluish rings fail to budge for some of us. Regardless of how rested or how well dressed you are, dark circles can dull your overall appearance in a matter of seconds. Though they are not a serious skin problem, they make you look tired, exhausted, unhealthy and older. So take the initiative to get rid of those unsightly shadows under your eyes by following these remedies.
Why dark eye circles appear
There are two types of dark circles. The first has a bluish tint and these are pools of blood under the skin that can be seen because of how thin and delicate the skin in that area is. It becomes more prominent due to your lifestyle and habits. Eg: lack of sleep or too much exposure to the sun.
The second has a brownish tint and this is hyper pigmentation which is partly hereditary.
Inadequate nutrition
Fluid retention from too much salt in the diet can cause the puffiness of the dark circles to act up. Drinking adequate amounts of water and eating leafy green vegetables can calm the puffiness. An iron deficiency has also been known to cause dark circles.
Connection between Vitamin K and dark eye circles

In clinical studies Vitamin K has been shown to assist in decreasing the appearance of dark eye circles. Retinoids (such as stabilized retinol) have also been proven to decrease the appearance of lines and wrinkles, stimulate collagen and assist in preventing the deposit of pigment in the epidermis. The combination of these two ingredients directly addresses the appearance of darkened colour as well as addressing fine lines, wrinkles, and other signs of aging around the eyes. Topical Vitamin C is also very popular as it is known for brightening skin tone and stimulating collagen.
Remedies for dark circles under eyes
The most important remedy is rest. However, after a certain point, gravity takes its course and as the under-eyelid skin starts to move downward, it initiates more stretching and thinning. In this case it is necessary to use day and night creams with targeted ingredients. There are great products for every budget from the drugstore brand ROC to the more pricey brand SkinCeuticals and the all natural brand Drunk Elephant.
Camouflaging dark eye circles with make up
Dark eye circles tend to be blue or gray in colour . To conceal them you need to apply a colour that’s opposite on the color wheel. Therefore concealers with pinky/peachy tones are best for camouflaging dark circles. If you have fair skin, choose a light to medium peach colour.
For medium to dark skin, pick a dark peach or orange colour. When choosing a concealer go for a shade that is 1-2 shades darker than your skin colour.
Seeking medical help
If the size of the dark circles very obviously fluctuates regularly, it is best to consult a dermatologist.
Surgical or medical correction to combat the issue
Topical bleaching cream, chemical peels, laser resurfacing treatment, Intense-pulsed light treatment and Professional Microdermabrasion are some topical and surgical options that you can go for if the problem is serious. However always get advice from a medical professional before proceeding.
Prevention is better than cure
Taking care of your skin from a young age is important. Use natural oils such as avocado or argan oil or creams and serums with Vitamins A, K and C. Rest well, drink lots of water, avoid refined sugar and eat healthy. Following this fitness regime prevents more than just dark circles!
