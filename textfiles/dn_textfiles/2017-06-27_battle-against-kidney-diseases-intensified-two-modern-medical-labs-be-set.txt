Battle against kidney diseases intensified: Two modern medical labs to be set up in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa

Nimal Wijesinghe, Anuradhapura Additional District Group Corr.
Two well-equipped medical laboratories will be set up in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa to diagnose people suffering from kidney diseases.
Provincial Health Services Director Dr. Palitha Bandara said those who are unaware that they are suffering from kidney ailments will be encouraged to have their blood tested via the two centers.
The two labs will be set up at the Anuradhapura Chest Hospital and at the Polonnaruwa District Health Services Director’s Office.
The construction of two labs will cost Rs. 25 million. Dr. Bandara said around 1,200 persons will be tested per day at the labs. Two laboratory technicians were recruited for the DPHS Office in this regard, he said.
‘’According to our latest surveys, the number of kidney patients in the NCP is around 15,800. Many of them were detected in Kebithigollewa, Mahawilachchiya, Rambewa, Medawachchiya, Padaviya, Dimbulagala, Welikanda, and Medirigiriya. We have launched a divisional level blood testing programme to identify kidney patients. It is being initiated from the Mahawilachchiya DS division to test 12,000 persons and we have finished 2,000 to date. The 29 MOH offices were entrusted with this programme, Dr. Bandara said.
