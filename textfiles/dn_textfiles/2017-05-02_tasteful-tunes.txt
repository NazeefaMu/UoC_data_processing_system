Tasteful  tunes

Tamara is a Sri Lankan singer/songwriter who currently resides in Melbourne with her family: husband Jacob and son Christopher. Tamara's parents also live in Australia having migrated in the mid 1960s to Melbourne. From then, their courtship began and later marriage followed.
Tamara's mother Indra St John, is of Malaysian Indian decent and father Leo St John was born in Galle and raised in Panadura.
Tamara was born in Melbourne, Australia, and grew up in a suburb called Strathmore where she attended St Vincent’s Primary School and St Columba’s Catholic College. Tamara began to further her studies at Victoria University to gain a Bachelor of Business Management Degree, majoring in Human Resources.
Tamara's connection with Sri Lanka is quite deep. She frequently travelled to Sri Lanka to visit her family and friends who reside in different parts of the island. Tamara is extremely fond of her roots and always loves to go back to embrace the local population, food and culture.
She had been writing songs since the age of 15. Her style of singing belongs to the ballad genre. Her lyrics come straight from her heart and with her own life experience. She says that she composes her music first and then pens her lyrics. Recently she did a music video called “Rain” with another co musician named Gershom Moses.
It is about a troubled relationship between two people who are madly in love with each other. Up to now this music video had more than one million views all over the globe on you tube. With her hard work and dedication Tamara had the opportunity to collaborate with many artistes in Australia.
She has successfully done three music video’s so far and all three songs had been played on the former Malaysian Austrohitz TV, Hitz FM and Lite FM. She won the best dance Category in the VIMA in 2016 for her single called “ When you turn on me”. 
How did you get into the field of music?
My passion, commitment and love for my music developed from the early age of four years. Equipped with a keyboard, I would play and sing and entertain the children in the street. I would sing everywhere I went. Every function and every event would pretty much be my platform to showcase my talent. I would make up songs and sing at the top of my lungs. The more I sang, the more I knew I wanted to become an entertainer.
My talent stems from my father, who is an exceptional singer. He encouraged me at a young age to listen to music, play an instrument and sing. I would sing songs that were playing on the radio with him.
They were such beautiful moments to share with someone who enjoyed music and who was as passionate about music as I am. In between writing songs from the age of 15 and over the years, I continued with school and university and worked tirelessly to perfect my craft while working full time in the capacity of a HR Consultant.
This day time job allowed me to fund my ambitions and to date I still work hard to attain my goals.
Your father used to be the lead singer of a local Sri Lankan band in 1960.
My father was 14 years old then and decided to enter a local talent quest sponsored by the Colombo Rotary Club. It was one of the most popular talent quests in those days and was hosted and judged by the famous band the Jet Liners.
My father was selected by the Jet Liners to perform in the preliminaries and was given an opportunity to start a band with other local talent. They named themselves ‘Adventurous’.
They went on to playing at local festivals and events in Panadura. My father was often invited to sing Bailas at Sri Lankan dinner dances and functions on many occasions.
Four years later, my father decided to migrate to Australia to further his studies and in between his studies he continued to sing at dinner dances in Australia and Malaysia.
2013 was a tragic year for you. You have experienced traumatic and tragic incident related to your life and your perspective on life changed in a moment of seconds.
2013 was a year that I do not want to reflect on as it has taken me countless of years to move forward in my life.
I will say however, that my entire mindset on life changed. I changed the way I lived my life, the way I treated people, and by that I mean exude even more love and care for family, friends and people in general.
I decided to do more charity work and help people with their problems and daily issues.
I changed the way I made decisions and the way I viewed life in general. Suddenly what I would have thought were big matters in my life weren't so big any more. I changed for the better.
Who is your favorite Sri Lankan vocalist?
Personally I do not like to say who is my favorite singer whether it be a Sri Lankan artiste or another artiste of a different nationality, genre and style because I believe each artiste is unique and talented in their own way. I would have to say that I like a few Sri Lankan artistes whether they reside or not in Sri Lanka and they are Iraj, Infaas, Bathiya and Santhush, Natasha Rathayake, Kamal, Derrick Junkeer, Andrew De Silva and Shean Dharmaratna.
I have a large amount of respect for all of these artistes. Their lyrics, compositions and style of singing speak volumes as they put in a lot of emotion to tell a story. I find that their artistry resonates with me and it would be my greatest honour to be able to some day work with them on a song.
What would be your reaction if you get a chance to act in a Classic Sri Lankan movie?
I would be so honored to work with such fine talented, creative and crafted local artistes and actors. It would be a very special and memorable achievement.
What are your future plans?
I wish to continue working my way up in the music industry and to give back to my fans wholeheartedly for their belief in me.
Their constant encouragement inspires me and allows me to continue to do what I do best and that is making music and writing songs.
What is your perspective of Sri Lanka?
I always love going back home to Sri Lanka, because no matter what state or situation the country is in, people still manage to have the biggest heart, so warm, loving and welcoming.
I cherish how humble and down to earth the locals really are.
Their smile seems always constant and I love to see that smile. It touches my heart tremendously.
