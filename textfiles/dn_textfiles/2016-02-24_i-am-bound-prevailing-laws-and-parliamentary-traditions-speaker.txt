I am bound by prevailing laws and Parliamentary traditions - Speaker

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in Parliament yesterday that he is unable to satisfy all the demands of the Joint Opposition as his hands are tied by the prevailing laws and traditions in Parliament.
He was replying to a Point of Order raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena urging that a solution be given to their demand to be recognized as an independent group in the Opposition.
The Speaker observing that there were several demands by the Joint Opposition group, said he could not grant most of them, except the one demanding the right to raise questions under Standing Order 23(2).
"The Joint Opposition MPs demanded the rights to move adjournment motions, appoint their own members to the Committee on Public Enterprises, Public Accounts Committee and the Public Petitions Committee, more time to speak at the debates, and to raise questions under the Standing Order 23 -2.
"Accordingly, I agreed to give them opportunity to present an Adjournment Motion once a week, to allocate more time for them in debates, and asked them to send their nominees for the above mentioned committees. I have allocated 51 minutes out of 91 minutes for the Joint Opposition MPs today.
"The only question is with regard to the demand to make special statements under Standing Order 23-2. I studied all traditions and regulations and similar situations in other parliaments. This is a matter beyond my purview. You should settle it with the Party leadership. Do not expect that from me. I granted 90 percent of your demands" he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said a final agreement on the matter would be reached after a special meeting at 6pm yesterday with the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena.
"You all belong to the UPFA. Let's solve this issue while preserving the Parliamentary traditions. We may have to increase the number of hours and days that parliament sits. We could discuss that matter," he said.
At this point, MP Bandula Gunawardena asked to withhold the Standing Orders and permit them to make special statements. Replying to this the Prime Minister said, "You could join the UNP.
Ask for applications from the UNP General Secretary". Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella observed only the Opposition Leader or party leaders could make special statements under the provisions of Standing Order 23-2. "This Parliament only accepts five party leaders. Who is the sixth? Who is the leader of the Joint Opposition? There is no leader," he stated.
