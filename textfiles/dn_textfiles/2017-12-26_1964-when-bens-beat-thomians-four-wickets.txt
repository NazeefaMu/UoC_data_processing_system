1964 when Bens beat Thomians by four wickets

“Cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties”. It was amply proved in an inter school cricket match in 1964 where St. Benedicts College, Kotahena took on S. Thomas' College Mount Lavinia at Kotahena in the 1963/64 cricket season. Thomians were captained by Premalal Gunasekera while the Bens were led by Sunil Fernando. The Thomian camp was strengthened with the presence of Anura Tennekoon, Sriyantha Rajapaske, the gloveman of the side Kumar Boralessa, Sarath Seneviratne, Ranjan Samarasinghe, Meven Peiris and Barney Red while Bens team had in their ranks Ranjith Fernando, Mervyn Fernando, Felix Dias, Harold Sirisena, Maxwell Anandappa and Anuruddha Vithanachchi .
Premalal won the toss and elected to bat first and declared at 261 for 7 with skipper Gunasekera scoring a breezy knock of 53 runs ably supported by Tennekoon (35) Lasantha (44 and valuable contributions came off the bats of Sriyantha (28 and Senevriatne 20) Vithanachchi, J.A.J. Perera and Selva Perumal claimed two wickets each. In reply homesters were all out for 182 runs with Felix Dias making the top score of 52 runs while Maxwell Anandappa (34) Sunil Fernando (33), M. Perera (20) and Harold Sirisena was unbeaten on 20. Barney Reid had a fine spell of 6 for 32 while S.L. Perera claimed 3 for 71. In their second essay Thomian skipper Gunasekera declared the innings at 75 for 3 with L.S. Perera scoring 30 runs and gave Bens the task of scoring 155 runs in 90 minutes. At 5.30 p.m Bens were 42 runs behind with 4 wickets intact but Anandappa and S. M. Perera brought the score near to the target and it was Reid's turn and he got ready to bowl the final over of the day with eight runs needed.
The Bens pair took four singles in the first four balls and they were unable to get a run in the fifth delivery and three runs were needed for a tie and four runs for a victory and S.M. Perera had to face the last ball of the day. Reid bowled the last ball and S.M. Perera went for a big hit and missed it but the wicket keeper could not collect it and at a fair speed the ball passed the fence for four byes and Maxwell Anandappa was unbeaten on 47 runs and Sunil Fernando made 36 runs. Barney Reid had a match bag of 10 for 80. The jubilant spectators stormed the ground to celebrate the last ball victory with four wickets in hand. In the following week end Bens crushed Royalists before tea on the second day and then went on to beat Joes after a lapse of 47 yeas in the next week end and they went from strength to strength and finally they became the best team of the island and carried away the prestigious Lifebuoy Trophy.
