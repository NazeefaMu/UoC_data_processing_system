Illicit liquor, drug eradication programme in Eastern Province

A programme to eradicate liquor and drug menace in the Eastern Province will be launched under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena this year, Eastern Province Chief Minister Hafeez Nazeer Ahmed said. He said the use of liquor and drugs had increased to alarming proportions in the province in recent times. This had led to a corresponding increase in crime and sexual offences. The Chief Minister said he would request the people to assist the anti-liquor and narcotics drugs drive by providing information to police.
