Introducing, carrot vodka!

In a bid to reduce wastage, two Australian women, Alice Gorman and Gen Windley, have come up with a vodka made using carrots. The duo behind the drink admit that the idea came to them after they realised that the carrots grown by their farmer husbands were going to waste if it didn’t meet supermarket standards.
The two then collaborated with a winemaker Jason Hannary to create vodka from carrots. The carrot is reduced to a stock, and then added to a Shiraz base. Each bottle boasts of 20 per cent carrots. Alice told a publication, “Every year we grow, pick and pack 350 million carrots and they’re the good-looking ones. But we have cracked, marked or wonky ones that won’t travel well to chain stores.”
The result is vodka with a subtle taste of carrot. “Not having done anything with vegetables before was a bit daunting, but after a few experiments we got a great result,” explains distiller Jason.
