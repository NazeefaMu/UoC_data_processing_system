Coca-Cola celebrates 132 years around the world and revels in its status as one of the world’s best loved brands. The history of Coca-Cola has become something of a legend as have the various anecdotes about the brand and its associated symbols.
Following the introduction of Trademark Coca-Cola, other global brands were added to the company portfolio including Coca-Cola Light, Coke Zero, Sprite, Sprite Zero, Fanta, Portello, Cream Soda, Lion Soda, Lion Ginger Beer and Kinley water which provide consumers across the island with a variety of delicious and hydrating beverage options.
In Sri Lanka, responding to consumer demand the company launched Sugar-Free options for all its sparkling and fruit flavored beverages. While Coke Zero and Sprite Zero were launched in 2017 Fanta, Portello, Cream Soda and Lion Ginger Beer, were introduced early this year providing consumers with more choice to enjoy the drinks’ natural flavors and a great, fruity taste without the calories.
Its 132nd anniversary is a great occasion to browse through some fun facts about The Coca-Cola Company:
The concept of sustainable development is at the heart of Coca-Cola in Sri Lanka. Coca-Cola implements initiatives to promote societal wellbeing through Sustainable Communities.
Through this the Coca-Cola system in Sri Lanka intends not only to make packaging 100% recyclable but also collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging in the country and work towards a cleaner and better environment.
Our immediate priority and focus through our waste management program entitled ‘Give Back Life’ is the recovery and recycling of plastic PET bottles.
Through this program, collection initiatives have been executed along with the government authorities and a roadmap is in place to ensure all the PET bottles Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. produces is collected and recycled.
