Vidura’s victorious cast

English Drama at Vidura is all about solidarity. They have grown together as a team and with the guidance of their teachers they have proved that they can meet any challenge. Dramatic Moves features the dramatists of Vidura who are getting into the habit of winning.
Teacher in Charge of Drama Achala Amarathunga, pointed out that it has been a process of growth when it comes to Drama at Vidura. She has seen these children gather knowledge over time and develop into competent dramatists.
“When it comes to the personality of the child, it needs to be improved so they can cope with the outside world. It helps them form good relationships and they are able to develop empathy. They learn to work as a team. And through that, their qualities can be improved. We have seen students blossom under us and have received recognition in the school by doing drama. So as a teacher I am very happy when I see such things,” said Amarathunga.
Amarathunga pointed out that doing drama allows the children to explore themselves very naturally.
“It allows them to find their path and free their minds. That is very beneficial to them. There have been absolutely no problems regarding their discipline. I would also like to thank our Principal Mr. D.G. Sumanasekara for his support. Here we have our girls and boys working together,” stated Amarathunga.
Memorable productions

Teacher of English Language and Literature, Sanjeewa Gunarathna is proud of these students. Together they have proved that Vidura College can compete against the best in the English Drama Circuit. These are memories that he will cherish because what they have achieved they have achieved as a team.
“We participated in the Inter School Shakespeare Drama Competition 2017 organized by YMCA and Colombo Rotary Club and won best novice award for our production of Two Gentlemen in Verona which is considered as one of Shakespeare's earliest plays.
I selected it because our students did not have much experience in doing Shakespearean dramas
We put together a memorable production at the 2017 Inter-School Shakespeare competition, and we did this within a short period of time. While some people say it is impossible to train a drama group within a few weeks, I was able to train them within six weeks.
While other schools have a number of script editors, directors and stage managers, like Jerome De Silva and Jehan Aloysius, I did everything alone. We did not get any advice or ideas from any theater genius. I alone edited the script, did the directing as well as the lighting too. I had a stage manager who was an A/L student with very good organization and managing skills.
The Students in Vidura College are really talented and can follow instructions very well. Although we were not selected to the final round, we proved to everyone that we are capable and talented,” said Teacher of English Language and Literature, Sanjeewa Gunarathna.
Gunarathna pointed out that doing drama makes you a well- balanced person. He says that, that is the main reason he has fallen in love with drama.
‘Drama helps me learn right and wrong’
Dramatist Pulasthi Udugamasooriya, rates Two Gentleman of Verona as one of his favorite plays. That was the first time he has participated in a drama.
“It was not easy since there were a lot of things we had to do such as cooperating with the others. It helped me develop my skills to a great extent. The fact that we won an award makes me very proud. There are a lot of things that make me happy when I think of that achievement,” said Udugamasooriya
In the Two Gentlemen of Verona, Udugamasooriya had to act two characters – The Duke and Antonio. Udugamasooriya had a certain affinity to the Duke’s character since it was close to his personality. The social status and the power the Duke had certainly appealed to Udugamasooriya.
“I think the Two Gentlemen of Verona has sudden plot twists and is not as lively as the other plays Shakespeare has written. It is a happy ending but the way that the ending happens with the twists and all of that, to me it is not a very good flow. There are other plays he has written like Hamlet and Othello, and I prefer them more. So Two Gentlemen of Verona could have been better if there was a better flow of incidents,” pointed out Udugamasooriya.
Drama has taught him how to address an audience properly and how to face an audience without feeling nervous.
“When I had problems in my mind I was able to free myself doing drama. It helped a lot to improve my personality. I think drama allows us the opportunity to look at life from someone else’s point of view. We are used to seeing things only from our own perspective and that is why lots of problems happen. So when you act, you see things from another perspective. You learn right and wrong,” added Udugamasooriya
‘A big impact on my life’
Dramatist Akalanka Welagedara, said his favorite play was Twist of Tales which he did in 2012. It was a comedy and Welagedara’s character involved a lot of humor.
“I love humor and in real life I am a very jovial person. That was the main reason I loved that play. My character was named Tweedledumb. Doing it was fun for me because he was very lively. It was a comedy with no moral at the end. It was all based on humor,” said Welagedara.
Welagedara commented that drama has had a big impact on his life. He has received a merit award for one of his roles.
“Doing drama has done wonders for my social life as well. I am highly regarded at school. I am happy with what I have achieved. I would like to thank my teachers for all the help. I would also like to thank my dear Principal. I would also like to thank my mom and dad. I have a dream and an ambition and I am working towards it. My school has given me the platform and I am doing my best,” said Welagedara.
‘I can do almost anything on stage’
Dramatist Jayathri Rathnayaka, said that her favorite play was the one she acted in called ‘We Are One’. It was about a multi-cultural country, where there were so many conflicts and in the end everyone gets together.
“That really made me very happy. Because it is not something that you see nowadays. Seeing that in a drama made me feel really pleased. I played the character of the principal. My mother is actually a teacher, so it suited my character a lot,” said Rathnayaka.
Rathnayaka who is naturally a bubbly, easygoing and outgoing young girl, likes to do comedies and calls herself a happy go lucky character.
“The stage is a place where I can express myself. I can do almost anything on stage. I can make people laugh or make people emotional. I feel happy and at ease on stage. I feel very pleased to be on stage performing with the others, I can skip my boundaries on stage. I was even able to talk to people I did not know,” said Rathnayaka
‘Father’s ‘role’ is memorable’
Dramatist Vinuk Thismalpola, feels very positively about the drama, ‘Little Angel’ because that play was based on the Tsunami that happened in 2004. It was based on a true incident.
“It was a drama based on a true story. To enact it on stage was a very powerful experience taking into account the emotions that it involves – how people reacted to the Tsunami. Because when the Tsunami hit Sri Lanka it was a new experience for us. I feel very fortunate to take part in that drama.
The character I played was the role of a father, and that character is memorable to me.
I feel drama is a field where I can explore myself and you can express anything. You can give any sort of message out to the people. It helped in my personality development and helped me address an audience. It has taught me how to express my creative abilities,” said Thismalpola.
Indeed teacher in charge Achala Amarathunga pointed out that Thismalpola has great organizational skills. He excels academically as well.
