Follow your heart

Consultant Cardiologist Dr Mervyn Fernando (MBBS, DCH, MD) attached to the Colombo North Teaching Hospital (Ragama) speaks about hypertension. It is one of the commonest Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in Sri Lanka.
What is Hypertension?
Hypertension or High Blood Pressure is one of the commonest lifestyle diseases today. Every third person suffers from it. High blood pressure could be identified when your blood pressure goes higher than it usually should be. If hypertension cannot be lowered, you might pay a heavy price for damage to eyes, brain, heart, blood vessels and kidneys.
Hypertension is defined as a repeatedly elevated blood pressure, exceeding 140 over 90 mmHg. This is a systolic pressure above 140 with a diastolic pressure above 90.
There are two types of hypertension. The primary or essential hypertension does not have identifiable causes. The secondary hypertension is caused by kidney malfunction, adrenal gland over-activity, tumours and several other medical conditions.
Three out of 10 people are suffering from hypertension worldwide. About 1.8 billion people are suffering from the disease globally. About 50 percent of them are totally unaware of their condition. Half of the people, though aware of the condition, do not take their medication properly.
How do people develop hypertension?
There is no known cause for the high blood pressure. The basic reason for high blood pressure is atherosclerosis. There are multiple factors responsible which lead to atherosclerosis resulting in hypertension. It includes stress, sedentary lifestyle, faulty food habits and lack of exercise. Several factors beyond your control increase the risk for high BP. These include your age, sex, race or ethnicity.
When is the right time for getting examined for hypertension?
Everyone is likely to develop hypertension with the advancement of age. After 50, everyone should have periodic checks whether others in the family had the disease or not. Diet is another factor that contributes to hypertension. Diabetics and cholesterol patients who also suffer from hypertension are at a greater risk.
What are the negative impacts of hypertension?
A. Heart attack or stroke. High blood pressure can cause hardening and thickening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), which can lead to a heart attack, stroke or other complications.
Then it is the aneurysm. Increased blood pressure can cause your blood vessels to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm. If an aneurysm ruptures, it can be life-threatening.
Heart failure is another negative impact. To pump blood against the higher pressure in your vessels, your heart muscle thickens. Eventually, the thickened muscle may have a hard time pumping enough blood to meet your body’s needs, which can lead to a heart failure.
Organ malfunction also matters. Weakened and narrowed blood vessels in your kidneys. This can prevent these organs from functioning normally.
Vision loss is another factor. Thickened, narrowed or torn blood vessels in the eyes can result in vision loss.
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of disorders of your body’s metabolism, including increased waist circumference, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or ‘good,’ cholesterol, high blood pressure and high insulin levels.
The trouble with memory or understanding, uncontrolled high blood pressure may affect your ability to think, remember and learn. The trouble with memory or understanding concepts is more common in people with high blood pressure.
How can we prevent hypertension?
Some of the lifestyle changes to thwart hypertension or high blood pressure are:
1. Sleep for seven hours.
People who sleep five hours or less a night may be at higher risk of developing high blood pressure. Over time, lack of sleep could hurt your body’s ability to regulate stress hormones, leading to high blood pressure.
2. Eat less salt.
Salt makes your body retain water. If you eat too much, the extra water stored in your body raises your blood pressure. This can be a particular problem if you have high BP already. If you are overweight, a high intake of salt increases your risk of cardiovascular disease.
3. Exercise at least 150 minutes a week.
For adults, at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity. You can also do a combination of the two. Exercise is your drug-free treatment for hypertension. Regular physical activity makes your heart stronger. A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort. But to maintain a healthy BP, you need to keep exercising regularly. It takes about one to three months for exercise to have an impact on your blood pressure.
4. Eat more fruits and veggies.
Research proves that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables combined with low-fat dairy foods significantly lowers blood pressure, especially in patients with hypertension. They also contain potassium which helps balance out the negative effects of salt. This directly lowers the blood pressure.
5. Lose weight.
If you’re overweight, losing even 2-3 kg can lower your blood pressure. To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you burn. But don’t go on a crash diet, do it slow and steady.
6. Work closely with your healthcare team.
Remember, the healthier the steps you take, the better it is for your blood pressure and your health. Add others until they are all a part of your life.
Lifestyle modification is indicated for all patients with hypertension, regardless of drug therapy. It may reduce or even abolish the need for anti-hypertensive drugs.
Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take and the time of the day you take them. It is important that you take your blood pressure medicines every day.
In today’s scenario, where everyone is working towards achieving a target to climb up the corporate ladder, strict lifestyle modifications, at the same time sticking to medication regimen can go a long way in reducing the menacing effects of hypertension.
