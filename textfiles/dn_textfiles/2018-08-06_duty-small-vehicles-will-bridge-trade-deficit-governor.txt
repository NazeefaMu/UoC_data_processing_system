Duty on small vehicles will bridge trade deficit - Governor

The increase in duty on motor vehicles less than 1000cc has been necessary in the short run to arrest the deteriorating trade deficit, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy said.
He was speaking to the media at the Central Bank auditorium yesterday.
The Governor said half of the deterioration in the trade account was attributed to vehicle imports.
“The deterioration in the trade deficit was about USD 716 million over the first five months of this year. Of the amount, USD 350 million can be attributed to the increase in vehicle imports. From January to May, vehicle imports as a percentage of total imports was 6.9 percent and as a percentage of non-oil imports it was 8.5 percent,” he said.
He said the decision on duty hike was made in the interest of everybody, particularly the poor and vulnerable, to make sure that the deterioration in the trade deficit will not add pressure on the exchange rates.
“In the short run, this deterioration in the trade deficit had to be addressed because it affects the balance of payments. Then we have to borrow more from abroad. As the balance of payments gets worse, pressure on the exchange rate will increase. That affects the poor and vulnerable more as the cost of living could rise,” Dr Coomaraswamy said.
“If you lose revenue, you can make up for it by increasing other forms of revenue streams or by cutting down the expenditure, but if you lose control of balance of payments, it is very difficult to handle,” he said.
The Governor said Sri Lanka needs to develop its public sector transport. He said various plans including the light rail and highway projects under the Megapolis plan will help to achieve that end.
The Central Bank officials showed the statistics of cumulative value of vehicles imported to the country in the first five months of 2017 and this year. The total value of imports of petrol cars less than 1000 cc had increased from USD 26million in the first half of 2017 to USD 195 million in the first half of this year. The import value of petrol cars less than 1500cc had increased from USD 20 million to USD 73.2 million in the given period where as the import value of petrol cars less than 3000cc had declined from USD 33.5 million to USD 21.1 million.
The value for petrol vehicles over 3000cc had shown an increase from USD 2.6 million to 8.8 million. When it comes to the diesel vehicles less than 2,500cc there had been an increase from USD 1.9 million to USD 5.4 million where as the total value of imports of diesel vehicles more than 3000 cc had declined from UD 6.1million to USD 2.8 million. Therefore, the CB officials recapped that the smaller car imports have much to do with the increase in the import value of motor vehicles, they said.
