ComBank Pbt up 23.73% to Rs 12.9 bn in Q2

Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC has continued its growth momentum into the second quarter of 2018, despite having to pay in excess of Rs 7 billion in taxes and being compelled to make significant provisions for impairment charges for the six months ending June 30, 2018.
The Bank has posted profit before VAT and NBT of Rs 15.65 billion for the period, reflecting growth of 23.33% over the corresponding six months of last year. Profit before tax grew 23.73% to Rs 12.898 billion although VAT and NBT rose to Rs 2.75 billion for the six months under review.
Gross income for the period was up 19.30% to Rs 65.99 billion, with interest income growing by a healthy 18.89% to Rs 58.21 billion on the back of robust loan book growth, the country’s benchmark private bank said in a filing with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
Notably, timely re-pricing enabled the Bank to restrict growth of interest expenses to Rs 34.66 billion, an increase of only 11.30% despite a shift towards high cost funds in the six months reviewed, to generate net interest income of Rs 23.55 billion. This is an improvement of Rs 5.71 billion or 32.14%. Incidentally, net interest income accounted for 77.35% of the total operating income of the Bank.
Income tax grew by a hefty 47.38% to Rs 4.25 billion for the six months, primarily due to the removal of most income tax exemptions enjoyed by the banking industry with the introduction of the new Inland Revenue Act.Consequently, profit after tax grew by 14.67% to Rs 8.65 billion for the first half of the year, an increase of Rs 1.11 billion.
Commenting on these results, Commercial Bank Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe said the Bank’s performance reflected its ability to withstand challenges, such as an industry-wide increase in impairment charges, necessitated by the trend of an escalation in non-performing loans (NPLs).
“The Bank has been able to maintain its NPL ratios well below industry averages, but we expect the pressure on impairment charges to continue in the year ahead due to slower business growth,” Dheerasinghe said.
The Bank’s Managing Director, CEO S. Renganathan said, “The Bank has focused a lot of attention on digitisation and centralisation, enabling it to consistently control operating costs and improve the Cost Income ratio, to remain one of the most financially sound business entities in the country.”
Renganathan also pointed out that the Bank had achieved a CASA ratio of 39.31%, one of the best in the industry. “We are also contributing substantially to the state,” he said, disclosing that the Bank had contributed Rs 7.001 billion or 44.74% of its profit in taxes in respect of the six months reviewed.
Total assets of the Bank grew by Rs 56.341 billion or 4.93% over the six months to reach Rs 1.2 trillion as at 30th June 2018. Asset growth over the preceding 12 months totalled Rs 115 billion, reflecting YoY growth of 10.60%.
