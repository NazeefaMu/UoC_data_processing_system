Reparations Act: Not compensation for LTTE cadres:
Redress to all communities who have suffered

A few days ago, Sri Lanka took yet another significant step on its path to reconciliation and healing. The Cabinet endorsed the Office for Reparations Act, which establishes an independent authority tasked with formulating, designing and implementing reparations policies, aiming to redress victims who had suffered violations in the course of the past conflicts in Sri Lanka. This Office will receive applications from the aggrieved persons and recommend to the Cabinet of Ministers most effective forms of individual and collective reparations, including specialized policies on public education, memorialization and on children, youth, women and victims of sexual violence and persons with disabilities.
As is usually the case in our country, those prone to political opportunism which prioritises their personal wellbeing over the country’s unity and prosperity, immediately attempted to confuse the public with various misinterpretations of the Act’s provisions. Unfortunately, this confusion was not helped by a separate initiative by the Minister of Resettlement, Northern Development and Hindu Religious Affairs D.M. Swaminathan, which supposedly referred to some form of compensation for ex-LTTE cadres. Although his proposals were rejected by the Cabinet, it was in the interest of the victims and the public at large, to put to bed any confusion about the Office for Reparations Act and its aims.
Sri Lanka's Constitution clearly recognizes that every single Sri Lankan has the right to enjoy equal protection before the law. The state therefore, recognizes the dignity of all victims of past conflicts. It also recognizes, as the Act stipulates, that the respect for their right to an effective remedy would contribute to the promotion of reconciliation for the well being and security of all Sri Lankans, including the future generations. We all know that the end of the war does not mean an end to the pains and sufferings endured by the victims. Many Sri Lankans of different backgrounds, still suffer the impact of violations, including physical disability, psychological trauma, loss of property, poverty, marginalization and other forms of harm. Reparations are a method of alleviating the enduring suffering, but also could empower the entire communities and restore them as rights holders and equal citizens. Literally all written and oral submissions received by the Consultation Task Force (CTF), spoke of at least one aspect of reparations. This is precisely why the Office for Reparations was established.
The law is clear: Reparations are not given on the basis of the victims’ ethnic or religious background, or belonging to any particular political group. To imply that this law is somehow designed to favour one group over the others, is simply not true. All Sri Lankans are equal under the law and this Act clearly stipulates that reparations could be awarded to the “aggrieved persons” who are victims of:
- Violation of human rights or humanitarian law (as contained in the First, Second, Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions of 1949), or
- Families of persons killed or missing as a result of such violations crucially, in order to be eligible for reparations under this law, the aggrieved persons had to suffer such violations in the course of, or in relation to:- The conflict which took place in the Northern and Eastern Provinces or its aftermath;
- In connection with political unrest or civil disturbances; or
- In the course of systematic gross violations of the rights of individuals, groups or communities of people of Sri Lanka; or
- Due to an enforced disappearance as defined in the International Convention for the Protection of all persons from the Enforced Disappearance Act, No. 5 of 2018.
There is absolutely no way that any particular group would have preference over another in this process. The Office for Reparations would be an independent authority, which would receive applications from all Sri Lankans who fall under the above described criteria, without any discrimination due to ethnic, linguistic, religious, gender or other background. The Office will determine the best and most comprehensive form of reparation, taking into account the gravity of the violations, the type of needs and the capacities of the state and will not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity or religious affiliation.
Reparations are not new for Sri Lanka. The Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority (REPPIA) played an important role in trying to repair the victims of conflict and natural disasters, but it also faced significant challenges. There has been disappointment and dissatisfaction among victims surrounding their past experiences of reparations. According to the Consultation Task Force report, the promise of reparations has faced barriers and/or biases due to the inadequacy of administrative processes.
It is time to change that. It is time to strengthen the capacity of the state to reach out to victims of violations, to consult with them and to establish appropriate individual and collective forms of reparation.The Office for Reparations Act marks the beginning of this process, which would ensure that no Sri Lankan is left to languish as a result of harms they had suffered as a result of the conflict. This is what our Constitution, our conscience and the future of our children demand.
