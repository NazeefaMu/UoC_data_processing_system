KOPIA provides rain shelters to onion seed farmers

The Korea Programme on International Agriculture (KOPIA) Sri Lanka Centre donated rain shelters to 80 Sri Lankan farmers in Bulnewa and Galenbindunuwewa villages, Anuradhapura recently.
The shelters, which can cover a total area of 20,000 square meters, will be used to protect onion seeds from rain during the flowering season.
The KOPIA Sri Lanka Centre is planning to hand over small-scale farming equipment and machines such as Farm Masters, Rotaries and Vinyl-Mulching Machine, to the farmers. The donation was made as part of the project, “Seed Multiplication and Cropping Technology Development for Onion Production of Sri Lanka”.
The Centre had provided 2 hectares of rain shelters to farmers in Galenbindunuwewa, Mannar and Hambantota under the programme during the past two years. The Centre also dispatched Korean onion experts to Sri Lanka, aimed to transfer new technology to Sri Lankan farmers and officials in the agricultural sector. They organized workshops and training programmes in this regard.The KOPIA Sri Lanka was established in December 2011 to support agricultural development in Sri Lanka by the Korea’s Rural Development Administration (RDA) under the Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Ministry with the Agriculture Ministry.
