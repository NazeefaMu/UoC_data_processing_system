Shalila Moonasinghe’s dual citizenship issue : Elections Commission to meet on Oct. 19

The Elections Commission is to hold a meeting on October 19 to discuss the legal implications of the leader of the New Democratic Front (NDF), Shalila Moonasinghe not being a Sri Lankan citizen.
Moonasinghe who was the former Litro Gas Chairman, is facing legal charges over hacking into a Taiwanese bank and has been remanded until October 25. Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya speaking to the Daily News said they would have to review the existing laws, but the current premise is that if a voter has to be a Sri Lankan citizen to vote, it is only natural that the candidate too should hold citizenship in the country.
The Chairman of the Election Commission however was quick to add that at this stage they could not disqualify a party over this issue.
President Maithripala Sirisena contested under the NDF ticket and Swan symbol at the last Presidential election.
