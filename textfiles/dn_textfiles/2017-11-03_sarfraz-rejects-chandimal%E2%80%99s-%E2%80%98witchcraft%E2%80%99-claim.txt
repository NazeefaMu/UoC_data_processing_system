Sarfraz rejects Chandimal’s ‘witchcraft’ claim

Pakistan skipper Sarfraz Ahmed has dismissed Sri Lankan Test captain Dinesh Chandimal's claim that the Lankans won the Test series because of "witchcraft" and receiving blessings from a sorcerer, the Hindustan Times reported.
"We lost the two Tests because of our poor batting and that is all," Sarfraz said. "If they could win Test matches because of witchcraft or magic, then they should have also won the ODI and T20 series."
Earlier this week, Chandimal told reporters he had received a special blessing from a meyni, or sorcerer, ahead of the two-match series in the United Arab Emirates.
"I am always ready to accept the blessings of anyone — whether it is a meyni or any clergy," Chandimal told reporters after returning to Colombo.
"You can have talent, but without this blessing, you can't move forward," he had said a week after Sri Lanka's sports minister denied ordering the struggling national team to use witchcraft ahead of the Test series.
Responding to the claim, Sarfraz said today: "I believe in the Quran and also that there is magic in the world; but we just batted badly and lost our chances to win."
While luck plays a role in cricket, matches are won and lost on the field, he said.
Pakistan came back strongly after losing the Test series 2-0 to Sri Lanka, going on to whitewash the Lankan tigers in the five-match ODI and two-match T20 series. Pakistan's T20 series win has also helped the side clinch the top T20 spot in ICC rankings. - Dawn
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Cricket media unit in a release states with regard to the press conference held by Dinesh Chandimal on October 31:
Q: “There were various reports on social media stating that you had received blessings from a “maniyo” prior to the Test series. Did this help you to win, and if so how?”
A: “It's like this - any religion blesses, furthermore no religion enables wrongdoing. Therefore not only this particular person but even if any member of the clergy blesses me I will gladly accept that blessing. One’s belief in the effectiveness of this blessing is a personal matter that differs from person to person. I personally believe in obtaining blessings before any endeavour. There may be some who have different views, this is my view. That is the answer I can give to this question.”
Q: “So did you'll lose the ODI series because you were not blessed?
A: “There is no such thing. Everyone needs blessings, but talent too. Just because you have blessings, you won't succeed without talent, likewise even if we have talent, we can't move forward without the blessings of all. That's the reality. No one sent me (sorcerer) to her. She is the mother of one of my friends, and the picture is one taken at a function we attended. There is press freedom in this country, so anything may be construed.”
