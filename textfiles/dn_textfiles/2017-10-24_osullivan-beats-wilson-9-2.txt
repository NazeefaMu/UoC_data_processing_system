O'Sullivan beats Wilson 9-2

Ronnie O'Sullivan produced a world-class performance to beat fellow Englishman Kyren Wilson 9-2 and win the English Open in Barnsley. Five-time world champion O'Sullivan led 6-2 after the first session and was relentless after the break, wrapping up a clinical victory with a break of 131. The 41-year-old made four 100-plus breaks in the final to clinch his 29th ranking title. "You don't play that well unless you feel you have to," he told Eurosport. "That was as good as I could play amongst the balls. I made some really good breaks, the most important one was at 6-2.
O'Sullivan was awarded the Steve Davis trophy and also surpassed the six-time world champion's tally of 28 ranking titles. The Rocket enjoyed an eventful week in Barnsley after he was given special permission to play in trainers due to an ankle injury. His third-round match against Mark Davis was then interrupted by a spectator who evaded security and took his final shot. But he put all that behind him to produce his best snooker against 25-year-old Wilson, who was competing in his second final of the season following defeat by Ding Junhui at the World Open. BBC
