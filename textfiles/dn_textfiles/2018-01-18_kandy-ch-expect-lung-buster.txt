Kandy-CH expect a lung-buster

As the pendulum swings mightily this weekend there are bound to be a few tired bodies and concerned management calculating furiously?
As mentioned before, injuries and rehab, probably as important as breathing for recovery ...and a half decent plan to survive the last legs of the league and some bubbling ambition about the Dialog knockouts ...looming large in the psyche and quite the topic of animated discussion..in the city by the sea.
Round two....is all about the business end of this Dialog league in sunny Sri ,and essentially a stark statement..about the survival of the fittest island wide.
All club warriors nursing niggles, impact injuries and known ailments, still hungry and a ton of opportunities to showcase their skills, a good deal indeed..!
It is attitude more than anything else that will assure them a good shot of stepping up to the next level.
Kandy have hit cruise control and run out with pride each week 'game ender'.
Looking sharp in the boiler house with Udangamuwa, having a crack response season in the middle.
Heartening to see the likes of these breakaways and Kandy’s blessing at no.8 ..an absolute curse to all other boiler house units in the league.
His workrate in both attack and defence, quite the charm you want leading your pack.
Irrespective of all the Sri Lanka rep players in the start up and warming that Kandy bench ...this Saturday's CH bruiser ...is going to be just that. A total lung buster from kickoff to full time.
Skipper Gayan Weerey..certainly packs a ton of experience and skill vs the enthusiasm, courage and drive that captain Rohita Chi Chi Rajapaksa packs ....what Gayan has in experience, Rohita makes up in work rate and pushing this Maitland Crescent club beyond their skins.
CH have nothing to lose ..bar their pride and individual status ..so Saturday will give fans plenty to talk about and impact tackles that will echo louder than the Kandy market support.
I am a worshiper and absorb disciple of self belief ...and if CH can sort their injuries and run their full digits for 65mins ...it's going to be a bloody and bruising battle up at the Nittawela cauldron of pain.
What an adrenaline crackerjack it promises to be.
Keys on the day for the lions ..Weeray jnr at 9, Udangamu 8, Wiliweera 11, skipper Gayan 12, Ranjan 13 will cast the biggest shadows on the Maitland marauders...
For CH, expect courage, guts and heaps of skill from Sasanka, Saranga, Satya, and the unstoppable Yoshita..whose work rate impacts the whole team.
Samuel will be calm to boot anything he is presented with and Keegle will run his petrol around all defenders, despite reputation and national colours!
CH need to get decent ball and pressure the lions in their own half ...expect craft and big hearts for coach Lagga to appreciate and coach Taylor back in Sri for Kandy, might get a little nervous, when he realizes that CH will not give up anytime soon.
As the game ticks by the refs shrill to manage the30 warriors will be critical ..but most significantly, it will be the deafening silence as CH run the ball and threaten that Kandy line ...that will be so satisfying to absorb...CH tries will be absolute quiet from the Nittawela faithful. ..face paint and all!
Havelocks and Navy the other two sides with incentives on offer ...finish as close to Kandy as possible and ....few chances left in the final round.
Saturday games are all 4pm starts ...CH in Kandy, Air Force in Ratmalana, Police at Police Park, and Navy run out in Welisara...
