Emirates Skywards introduces taxi app ‘Emirates Skywards Cabforce’

Emirates Skywards has launched an on-demand ground transportation booking app called Emirates Skywards Cabforce in partnership with CarTrawler – the first of its kind in the world.
The app is a mobile travel companion that will offer its loyalty members an affordable and efficient transportation service in 27 countries and 117 cities across the world with more countries in the pipeline.
Members can earn Skywards Miles on every ride booked through the Emirates Skywards Cabforce app. The app allows members to book safe and reliable private taxis, executive cars and minibuses at their convenience.
The app offers fixed price quotes, secure online credit card payment and electronic receipts for every journey. The Emirates Skywards Cabforce app is free to download on iOS or Android devices.
Members of the loyalty programme can use the Emirates Skywards Cabforce app by linking their Emirates Skywards membership account to their Cabforce profile. They will be able to book rides selecting their preferred supplier, check the estimated arrival time of their ride, and view the estimated fare and Skywards Miles they will earn at the end of their trip. The app also enables users to share their live location with friends and family during their ride.
Members will earn 1 Skywards Mile for every USD 2 or equivalent spent on each journey. Skywards Miles will be credited within 48 hours of completing their journey.
The Emirates Skywards Cabforce app complements the Emirates app where members can check their Skywards Miles balance, tier status and other member offers in the revamped Emirates Skywards section.
Emirates Skywards, the award-winning loyalty programme of Emirates and flydubai, offers four tiers of membership - Blue, Silver, Gold and Platinum - with each membership tier providing exclusive privileges. Emirates Skywards members earn Skywards Miles when they fly on Emirates, flydubai or partner airlines, or when they use the program’s designated hotels, car rentals, financial, leisure and lifestyle partners. Skywards Miles can be redeemed for an extensive range of rewards, including tickets on Emirates and other Emirates Skywards partner airlines, flight upgrades, hotel accommodation, excursions and exclusive shopping.
