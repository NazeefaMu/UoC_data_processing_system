River turbines turn Austria’s Danube from blue to green

AUSTRALIA: The Wachau, a picture-postcard river valley in Austria, makes a lot of wine. Soon it could be producing its own electricity too, and in a way that will not spoil the stunning views.
“Wind turbines are out of the question and solar panels are strictly regulated,” says Andreas Nunzer, mayor of picturesque Spitz on the left bank of the Danube river.
“But we have found a way to contribute to the fight against global warming without harming our quality of life.” It is called river current power.
The idea is to place in the river what looks on the surface like the top of a submarine but is in fact a six-tonne buoy producing enough electricity for 250 people.
Below the waves is a turbine turned by the fast-flowing waters -- more brown than the blue of Strauss's famous waltz -- of the Danube, one of Europe's main waterways.
So far, three prototype river turbines producing between 40 and 80 gigawatts of electricity have been tested in the Wachau, but Nunzer has ambitious plans.
“We have obtained all the necessary permits to have nine of them, and we don't plan to stop there. We're just waiting for mass production,” he told AFP.
