Cathay Pacific to launch non-stop services to Brussels, Dublin and Copenhagen in Summer 2018

Cathay Pacific continues to grow Hong Kong’s connections to the world. From summer 2018, the airline will launch pioneering non-stop routes linking Hong Kong with Brussels, Dublin and Copenhagen, further strengthening the airline’s network and providing new trade and tourism opportunities between Asia and Europe.
Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Officer Rupert Hogg said that the announced services will meet customer demand for non-stop travel to these vibrant cities, while at the same time providing Europe-based passengers with more convenient access to key destinations in Asia and Southwest Pacific through the airline’s home in Hong Kong.
“We’re excited to offer the only direct flights between Hong Kong and Brussels, Dublin and Copenhagen. These are all fantastic destinations and attract business and leisure travellers from the world over. We listened to our customers’ demands for more options and greater flexibility and have responded by building direct air links with these great cities,” said Hogg.
“Growing our reach to new destinations that aren’t served from Hong Kong boosts the city’s status as Asia’s largest international hub and enables us to capture new and important sources of revenue.” Following the recent launch of services to Gatwick, Madrid and Barcelona, Cathay Pacific’s European expansion continues. With the commencement of the new routes, the airline’s network will cover 15 European destinations served direct from Hong Kong.
Cathay Pacific’s long-haul fleet of aircraft averages just five years of age, making it one of the youngest in the industry.The three new routes will be operated by Cathay Pacific’s state-of-the-art Airbus A350-900 aircraft, which feature the latest seats and cabin design and which have been especially well-received by the airline’s customers. All flights to Brussels, Dublin and Copenhagen are equipped with the aircraft’s enhanced inflight entertainment system and Wi-Fi onboard.
Cathay Pacific has in operation 18 of the 22 A350-900s it has on order, with the remaining four aircraft due for delivery before the end of 2017. Additionally, the airline has 26 of the larger A350-1000 type scheduled to join its fleet from 2018. These environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient aircraft allow Cathay Pacific to open up new markets not otherwise served from Hong Kong.
