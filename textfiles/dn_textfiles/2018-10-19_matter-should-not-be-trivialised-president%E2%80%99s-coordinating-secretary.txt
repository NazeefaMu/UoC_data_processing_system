Alleged assassination plot against President :
Matter should not be trivialised - President’s Coordinating secretary

President Maithripala Sirisena’s Advisor and Coordinating Secretary Shiral Lakthilaka convening a special media briefing in the wake of claims that there was a hidden hand in the assassination plot against the President, requested that the matter not be trivialised and that the government was confident that the Police and other law enforcement agencies would conduct a thorough probe.
“The matter deserves a thorough investigation and any attempt to sweep the matter under the carpet or call it a superficial story implicates that there is a political tone in this saga,” he said. “We ask that this issue not be trivialised and affirm the government’s stance that we are confident the police and judiciary would do justice to a claim as grave as this.”
He added that he too had seen reports in the media of political factions referring to the story as ‘bogus’ or ‘cooked up’. “It may be true but it is not up to us to decide. It is the role of the police and the CID who are investigating the matter to get to the bottom of it,” he said. He cited that the matter was serious, otherwise it would not warrant the Minister of Law and Order to call for the interdiction of the Director of the Terrorist Investigation Division DIG Nalaka Silva.
“There is also a non-Sri Lankan national who remains in custody over the matter, lets not undermine the process,” he said. “If someone is trying to undermine it, we believe that it indicates a political tone.”
He added that the government was satisfied that investigation although ‘slow was proceeding steadily,” adding that the seriousness of the matter is unravelling itself as the days goes on.
Meanwhile, Sarath Kongahage, senior advisor to the President who was also present said that there was a concentrated effort on the part of politicians and officials to trivialize the issue.
“There were allegations of a plan to involve underworld kingpin Makandare Madush who is overseas in this ploy,” he said. “The other individual an MP from the Eastern Province had sought approval to travel overseas. If this ploy is a bluff then why leave the country.”
Both officials referred to the many assissination attempts on the country’s leaders in the past saying that it had been instigated by the LTTE. But that in this instance was different and deserved a full fledged investigation. Both officials who were there on their personal capacity said that they were confident that under the perpetrators would be dealt with justly.
