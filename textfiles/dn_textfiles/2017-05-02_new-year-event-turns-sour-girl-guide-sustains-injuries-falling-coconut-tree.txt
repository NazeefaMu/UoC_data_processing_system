New Year event turns sour: Girl guide sustains injuries falling from coconut tree

A girl guide was injured when she fell from a coconut tree, while she was taking part in an event of a New Year function called “All Island Grand Mother’s Trophy”, organised by the Girl Guide Association of Sri Lanka on April 29.
The function was held at Walawwa, Polhena, Rathabale in the Aththanagalla area.
The girl guide of Jaffna fell while she was on a half way to reach the top of the tree. Critically injured, she was hospitalised.
Residents of the area said the organisation, which consider “safety and preparation’’ their foremost concern, did not consider them when they included tree climbing event in their day’s agenda.
