Kithmini’s styles!

Lakna Kithmini has a set of skills that have enabled her to bring to life on canvas, art forms that show a certain maturity, a maturity that has been developed throughout the years. She is able to bring to life the Sigiriya Frescoes on canvas that accurately portray its sensuality almost as if King Kashyapa’s architects were being channeled through her. The Contours of the women depicted in the frescoes, she has captured vividly.

At a very early age, Artist Lakna Kithmini displayed a certain versatility and keenness. In addition to being a talented sportswoman, she showed much aptitude at painting. She was successful at Athletics notching up many a milestone. When it came to Art she was extremely passionate and applied herself to it diligently.
A product of Yashodara Maha Vidyalaya she did Commerce for her A/Ls. Right throughout, she continued her Sports, becoming the Deputy Captain of Sports. However she did not neglect her calling in life which was Art, and won many art competitions.
After leaving School, Kithmini, decided to take up Photography, that too being a passion of hers. She then learnt Photography, and then her life moved in another direction when she experimented with hyper realistic drawings and oil paintings, which was after she took part in a photography exhibition.
“I started making hyper realistic drawings, so I drew many popular characters in hyper realistic method. After that I tried my hand at oil paintings which was something I experienced for the first time in my life. This was an extremely meaningful discovery. I personally felt that I mastered this art medium successfully. So I decided to have my first oil painting exhibition titled ‘Sparking Spirit’ which I feel was well received. After that I did a group exhibition with two other painters called ‘94.21’,” said Kithmini.
