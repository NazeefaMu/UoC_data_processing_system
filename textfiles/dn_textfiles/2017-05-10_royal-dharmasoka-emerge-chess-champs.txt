Royal, Dharmasoka emerge chess champs

The Battle of the Kings, the longest uninterrupted chess tournament organised by a student body in Sri Lanka was held for the 21st time on April 21, 22, and 23.
Organised by the Chess Club of Royal College, it was attended by 21 schools from across the country, including three from the Northern and Eastern Provinces: Chenkalady Central College, Hartley College, and Kokuvil Hindu College.
The tournament ended with the Senior Chess team of Royal College winning 25 out of 30 possible games, defeating runners-up Dharmasoka College Ambalangoda 4-2 and second runners-up Ananda College 4.5-1.5. As in the last two years, Dharmasoka clinched victory in the Girls category, with Anula Vidyalaya and St Joseph’s coming second and third respectively.
The top scorer from the entire contest, moreover, was Lakindu Withanage, a top seed player from the host school.
