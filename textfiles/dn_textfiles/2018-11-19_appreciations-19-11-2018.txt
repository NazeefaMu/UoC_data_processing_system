Sarath Malalasekera
He was an iconic journalist
By the time today’s edition of the Daily News hits the news stand, senior journalist Sarath Malalasekera has bade adieu to the nation. His remains were cremated at the Borella General Cemetery last afternoon.
Sarath's death sent shock waves through not only Colombo-based media, but also the highest echelons of the judiciary, defence, and academia. He was one of the most senior journalists who reported the courts, predominantly the Supreme Court, and also the police.
Sarath was an icon in his chosen beats of the judiciary and the police, largely influenced by his Court Mudaliyar father Chandradasa in his stint with the Daily News for over 50 of those 80 years, predominantly in the Daily News, with a brief stint juxtaposed with the now defunct Nation on Sundays.
However, albeit his stint at Lake House in the Daily News, he also filed the time-bound legal stories and police stories to the Sunday Observer as well, which had the approval of the Editors and the News Editors as there was a lacuna in that aspect in the Sunday Observer at that time. Sarath was a journalist par excellence. He was particular of the 'A' in journalism, which was accuracy. He earned the highest respect of the judiciary and defence establishments for his reporting. His stories found their way to the repositories of the judiciary, the law, and academia.
His associations with personnel of that level typified at a media cocktail reception hosted by the police in 1995, at which I was also standing next to him where he addressed the sitting Inspector General Police by the Sinhalese endearment Machan. My heart skipped a few beats, my legs caved in! This was not only an embodiment of the warmth they had for each other, but also underscored their respect and affection for each other. Another anecdote relevant to Sarath was his intense distaste for journalists who bore no moral code.
Among his heavyweight peers at Lake House were former Daily News Deputy Editor William de Alwis, Defence Journalist Richard de Silva, Shipping Editor Ivor Milheissen, Business Section pioneer and former Daily News Editor Manik de Silva, Business and Political Journalist and Business Desk Head Winston de Valliere, along with Senior Associate Editor Sugeeswara Senadheera, Senior Deputy Editor Nemsiri Muthukumarana, Madras University Science and Economics Double Graduate Thurairatnam Sabaratnam, Senior Deputy Editor Pararajasingham Balasingham, and veteran Parliament Reporter Premil Ratnayake, Parliament Lobby Correspondent A.B. Mendis, News Editor A.S. Fernando, Senior Associate Editor Dudley Jansz, Senior Business Writer and Film Critique Mohan Samarasinghe, Consultant Editor Pramod de Silva, Senior Associate Editor Rodney Martinesz, Veteran Sports Editor Elmo Rodrigopulle, and Senior Journalist Rohan Perera.Sarath used to keep company with some of the most influential Cabinet Ministers. He had once reported a story on the Ministry of Justice and had been seen in a friendly discussion at Parliament with then Justice Minister Nissanka Parakrama Wijeyeratne. Such was the camaraderie he enjoyed with the highest in the land.
Sarath was admired by all; he never had an enemy. He never spoke a hurtful word and no one spoke ill of him either. Sarath was not devoid of lighter moments. He was very close to Senior Associate Editor (Cultural Affairs) Nemsiri Muthumarana as he filed a lot of Buddhist stories.
Sarath was a cut above the rest even when it came to his personality and immaculate attire. He was most conspicuous among the hardworking yet bedraggled journalists of this newspaper who were running helter-skelter in the discharge of their duties, with his spotlessly-white long sleeved shirts and trousers, as well as his hair creamed and combed at any time of the day.
Apart from the widely-acknowledged zeal and the conscientious concern he had for his work, Sarath was also a devoted husband to his wife Premawathi who predeceased him in 2013 and a great father to his three children, elder daughter Priyanka, son Saman (Senior Graphics Editor at Lake House), and younger daughter Priyani.
Also coming to mind were the countless occasions he visited me in the Colombo National Hospital and the Nawaloka Hospital, where I was hospitalised for over 10 months after enduring a near-fatal accident on May 25, 1999, where I was debilitated with 28 surgical sutures on my head, an amputated left ear lobe, an eight-inch gash below the sternum, and four stress fractures below the right knee. That was when I was handpicked to report on former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga for both the Sunday Observer and the Daily News.
Interestingly, former President Kumaratunga was one of the five of six Executive Presidents of Sri Lanka barring President Premadasa as I was not in the media at that time. I reported along with former Prime Ministers Ranil Wickremesinghe and the late Ratnasiri Wickremanayake and the latter, with whom was also buttressed with a millennium interview for this newspaper at Temple Trees on January 1, 2000, at 10 am.
Sarath was a uniquely moral human being. A product of St. Joseph’s College, Colombo 10, he was a devout Buddhist. He was a lifelong vegetarian and often visited Buddhist temples. He also engaged in deep meditation. His sense of altruism was most amazing, giving Rs.50 to and Rs.100 to beggars. The minor staff employees of Lake House were no exception. A former colleague reminisced how he quietly slipped a Rs.500 note into his shirt pocket, assuming that he would have needed it at some stage.
In retrospect, Sarath’s voice was not one which was heard loudly but felt profoundly.
Sarath epitomised Rabindranath Tagore's following poem:
I will be true
For there are those who trust me
I will love,
For there are those who care;
I will be swinging,
For there is so much to suffer
I will be brave
For there is so much to dare;
I will be friend of all the poor, the friendless;
I will be giving and
Forget the gift;
I will be humble
For I know my weakness,
I will look up and laugh
And love and lift

Sathiyamalar Sinnappoo
Exemplary role model
I had known Sathiyamalar Sinnappoo, affectionately called ‘Sathi akka’, for over half a century. She was my lecturer at the Palaly Specialised Teachers' College in 1965. She was also one of my wife's relations. She was later transferred to the Kopay Training College as its principal, a post she held until retirement.
My thoughts are crowded with memories of special moments. Words cannot do justice to her all-round capabilities and achievements. I can visualise her beautifully dressed, walking at terrific speed (that was her usual pace; no one can beat her in a walking race) and being at the lecture hall on time. Such was her punctuality.
It was mainly her high degree of discipline, dedication, devotion and commitment to duty that made her an exemplary role model as a lecturer at the Palaly G.T.C. and later as principal of the Kopay Teachers' Training College. She always meticulously planned and executed whatever activity she desired to do.
She enjoyed the blessings of all trainees, co-lecturers and supporting staff. Her loving, kind, innocent genuine smile will never be forgotten by her loved ones. She never grumbled or inconvenienced anyone, patience, perseverance and pleasing manners were her humble way of life. Generation of teacher trainees will treasure her in their heart.
Among the qualities she possessed, her loyalty to her family, friends and students were bountiful.
The hospitality she showed to any visitor whether at home or at college remained par-excellent. The affection she had for people was limitless. She spoke courteously and her gentle words pierced anybody's heart.
She was the Manager of the Anglican School in Jaffna called Chundikuli Girl's College during the war, held almost all the key offices at the Anglican Church called St. James Church in Nallur, Jaffna and remained in readiness to help the poor at all times. Her motto was "help ever, hurt never, love all and serve all," and she lived true to those words.
Sad to say, she lived through her life as a worthy spinster. Nevertheless, she lived a content life. She had more than a dozen nephews and nieces; they were the centre of her universe, especially Ravi and Jeyendran who were the apples of her eye.
She was a second mother to them. In fact, she breathed her last at the entrance of the hospital in Ravi's hands while being rushed for emergency treatment. Beside these nephews and nieces, she also possessed the teacher-trainees who passed through her hands as her own children and they, in turn, returned her the same love. That was the richness of her heart.
Life is like a flower that blooms in the morning and withers in the evening. Sathi akka will be remembered for leading a harmless and inoffensive life, as well as winning the friendship and respect of all those who she came in contact with.
May her noble soul rest in peace.

Rev. Sr. Mary Perera
She was selfless
The three-month death anniversary of Rev. Sister Mary Irene Perera falls on November 20. Rev. Sr. Mary Irene (Emmo), after her father’s loss at a very early stage in life, realised that her call was to serve the Lord.
She was passionate in serving humanity and practiced humility, simplicity and availability, which were the outstanding virtues of St. Francis of Assisi. Rev. Sr. Mary was born on May 10, 1921, to Joseph and Nellie Perera and was the eldest of five siblings.
On June 13, 1942, she entered the religious life to join the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary Novitiate at Mattakuliya and proceeded to make her first and final vows in 1945 and 1948, respectively. She served in different parts of the Island: Moratuwa, Kalaoya, Minneriya, Mahiyagana and Mattakuliya.
At a time when leprosy was highly infectious without proper medicine to treat the disease, Rev. Sr. Emmo volunteered to look after leprosy patients and went through the jungles of Minneriya and other areas in the North Central Province in search of them who were marginalised by society.
She would attend to their needs, dress their wounds and provide them with medicine. Her commitment to them was unwavering and she nursed them with dedication and commitment. Even in her late 80's she visited patients regularly and organised Christmas parties every year.
She was selfless, giving whatever she could to the underprivileged and was at all times, compassionate towards the poor, sick and the neglected. Her compassion for the poor had no limits. Wherever she was free, she would visit them and try to satisfy their needs.
She did all this with a smile; I never saw her complain. Her love and compassion made everyone around her feel the radiating joy emanating from her. Being a very lighthearted person, she always blended her conversation with humour. Rev. Sr. Emmo was never known to hurt anyone with words or actions; in fact, her smile always won our hearts.
There aren’t enough words to express the love and gratitude I feel towards Rev. Sister Emmo. She showed kindness and compassion, and always brought a much-needed sense of humour at all times. Blessed with an outgoing personality, she reached out to everyone: young, old, rich and poor, and built strong relationships with all and sundry.
She was called to rest on August 20 after 75 years in religious service, and I believe she is already with St. Francis of Assisi in heaven today.
A 'thank you' seems hardly adequate to Rev. Sr. Emmo, who gave this world so much love without counting the cost. She is an unsung hero of our times and the most courageous example of faith I have ever known. We are proud of you, Rev. Sr. Emmo; we miss you!
