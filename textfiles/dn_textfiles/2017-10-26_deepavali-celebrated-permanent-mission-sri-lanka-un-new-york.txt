Deepavali celebrated at  Permanent Mission of  Sri Lanka to UN in New York

 The Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in New York hosted a Deepavali celebration on Saturday, October 21, at its premises. The event brought together members of Sri Lanka’s Hindu community and those of different faiths in the Tri-State area as well as representatives from other Permanent Missions including the Permanent Representative of Mauritius and the Deputy Permanent Representatives of India and Nepal.
The event commenced with the traditional lighting of the oil lamp and included reading of Deepavali messages of President Maithripala Sirisena, and Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe, Hindu religious and cultural programmes and a speech by the Permanent Representative.
M. R. Ravi Vaidyanant Sivachariar, from the Hindu temple in Queens, outlined the significance of Deepavali, and conducted a Hindu religious observance. He said that Deepavali, which means “row of lights” honours light in order to celebrate wisdom, goodness, and enlightenment.
He also explained the significance of Deepavali in the context of worshiping the Hindu Goddess Lakshmi and recited Hindu Shlokas about the Goddess and peace, in Sanskrit with an English translation. Ambassador and Permanent Representative Dr. Rohan Perera said that with the significant Hindu community in Sri Lanka, the festival is given a special place in the country, and that it is celebrated as an important national festivity.
Acknowledging the festival’s significance as a celebration of light, he said that in Hindu culture, as in other cultures of Sri Lanka, light is a powerful metaphor for knowledge and consciousness.
He also said that lighting lamps reminds one to dispel darkness from their lives, and to embrace knowledge and goodness, including respecting and valuing others. Dr. Perera said that the path towards lasting peace lies only in consistently celebrating the beauty of the diversity of all communities.
He called for the fostering of a culture of genuine respect for and appreciation of the plurality of Sri Lanka and the world, which allows for the celebration of different religious, ethnic and cultural commonalities. A traditional Bharatha Nattyam, was performed by a leading Sri Lankan expatriate dance and yoga guru, ‘Natya Ratna’ Calai Chandrasekaram, The evening concluded with the partaking of a traditional vegetarian dinner by all guests.
