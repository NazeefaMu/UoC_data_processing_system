Mobitel pioneers 4.5G (4G Plus) network to revolutionize SL mobile telecom industry

Sri Lanka’s National Mobile Service Provider, Mobitel, is the first to initiate the roll out of the 4.5G network to revolutionize the industry and to significantly enhance user experience for its valued customers.
This strategic initiative by Mobitel positions the company to be the pioneer in the industry to upgrade its technology to offer the best possible service to customers.
Mobitel customers can now avail of more bandwidth and high data speeds for a superior online experience and to enjoy downloading music, videos and games at stable speeds.
It also provides a seamless user experience for Mobitel Enterprise Solutions and enables the company to cater to the growing demand in the corporate sector for customized solutions.
Upholding its reputation as the most progressive telco in Sri Lanka, Mobitel continues to invest in infrastructure developments to support its latest technological needs.
This move positions Mobitel to further solidify its leadership in the marketplace.
This 4.5G rollout deploys Carrier Aggregation technology (900Mhz + 1800Mhz + 2100Mhz), which enables Mobitel to add more frequencies to result in more bandwidth, which enhances data speeds.
Further, by upgrading to 4x4 MIMO (Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output) which uses greater signal strength than before through the use of more antennae, the signal is more powerful and stable for every user depending on geography.
Finally, in this rollout, Mobitel has accelerated its QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) from 64 to 256, thereby greatly increasing data speeds.
4.5G will act as a bridge for the eventual adoption of the 5G standard, while bringing significant improvements to Mobitel’s existing 4G networks by allowing them to handle more data-intensive applications.
Since Mobitel demonstrated 4.5G speeds at the 2017 Techno Exhibition, its loyal customer base has been eagerly awaiting the launch of its 4.5G network to enjoy a one-of-a-kind user experience.
