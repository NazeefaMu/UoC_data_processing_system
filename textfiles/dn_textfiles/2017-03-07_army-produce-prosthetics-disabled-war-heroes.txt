Army to produce prosthetics for disabled war heroes

Army Commander Lieutenant General Crishanthe de Silva, laid the foundation stone for the state-of-the-art orthopaedic unit and factory for the production of prosthetics at the Ranaviru Sevana Rehabilitation Centre in Ragama. Disabled war heroes of the Army and other sister services who need to change or adjust their prosthetics regularly during respective growth phases would benefit through the locally-produced legs and limbs.
The project, expected to provide benefits to over 300 differently abled personnel every month, cost around Rs 81 million, and technical equipment and machinery are valued at Rs 126 million.
Its construction is to be completed in three months. The production process is to be manned by around 50 differently abled soldiers after completion of training in prosthetics with the support of foreign experts.
The new construction is to be completed with the technical expertise of 10 (V) Corps of Engineer Services (CES), backed by segments of troops, drawn from all other Regiments in the Army.
Ranaviru Sevana in Ragama houses 125 disabled war heroes who are recuperating and under rehabilitation, due to battlefield injuries.
The Commander at the invitation of Brigadier Hemantha Kulathunga, Commandant, Ranaviru Sevana, also opened the renovated and refurbished Mental Health Unit in the premises.
