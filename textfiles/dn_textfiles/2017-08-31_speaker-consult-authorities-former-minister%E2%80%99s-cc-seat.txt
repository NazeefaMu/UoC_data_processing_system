Speaker to consult authorities on former minister’s CC seat

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he would inquire from the relevant authorities as to whether former Minister Dr Wijayadasa Rajapakshe would continue in the Constitutional Council (CC).
Dr Rajapakshe was appointed to the 10 member CC as the Prime Minister’s representative in 2015. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya (Chairman), Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan are ex officio members in it while Dr. A.T. Ariyaratne, Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy and Shibly Aziz are serving as civil society representatives. Minister John Seneviratne, JVP MP Vijitha Herath (minor party representative), Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka (President’s representative) and former Minister Rajapakshe (PM’s representative) are other members in it.
The CC is entrusted on recommending members and chairmen of independent commissions and suitable persons to high ranks such as the IGP, Attorney General, Auditor General, Chief Justice and judges of superior courts.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Speaker Jayasuriya said former Minister Rajapakshe still functions as a member of the CC. However, he said, with the latest developments, he will have to inquire from the relevant authorities as to whether Rajapakshe can continue to be a member in the CC.
President Maithripala Sirisena last week sacked Rajapakshe from the Justice and Buddasasana ministerial portfolio.
