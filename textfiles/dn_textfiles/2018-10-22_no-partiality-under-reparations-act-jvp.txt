No partiality under Reparations Act - JVP

The Reparations Act would ensure compensation payments to all aggrieved parties irrespective of differences, JVP Media Secretary MP Vijitha Herath said.
Some racist politicians with vested interests and narrow political expectations are defining this Act in various ways for their benefit, some saying that this Act facilitates only former LTTE cadres, he said at a media conference in Colombo yesterday. “If any person or a community has been affected or has been a victim of civil war or political misconduct, they would be compensated irrespective of their race or identity. It is the responsibility of an elected government,” he said.
MP Herath also emphasised that all political parties are responsible for bringing justice to all aggrieved persons and for property damage and thereby preventing any possibility of a recurrence of war.
The Office for Reparations Bill which was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, was passed with a simple majority in Parliament last week.
