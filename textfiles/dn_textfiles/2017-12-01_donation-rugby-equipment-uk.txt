Donation of rugby equipment from UK

Sri Lanka rugby have received a donation of Rugby equipment and clothing from a NGO Group in United Kingdom.
This project was initiated by Nazoomi Azhar who is the “SOS Kit” Aid Ambassador to Sri Lanka. He has been instrumental in organizing this and with his initiative SLR will be able to distribute sports goods to less privileged rugby playing schools and also children living in the rural areas, who are interested in playing the game. Sri Lanka Rugby has a very aggressive program to take Rugby to all 25 districts before the end of 2018.
They have identified one educational zone from each district and have started doing awareness programs in these zones.
Also they have already launched two programs with the participation of over 500 students and the next one will be held in Mahiyangana. SLR will be taking the opportunity to distribute some of these rugby equipment and clothing to less fortunate children and schools in these zones.
Priyantha Ekanayake - CEO Sri Lanka rugby said “ I would like to take this opportunity to thank Nazoomi for initiating this program and also like to express our gratitude to SOS Kit Aid - CEO John Broadfoot, Vdoc - Founder and Chairman Suresh Sivagnanam, Paradise Travels - Dash Goonawardena, Mass Global Shipping- Chintaka De Silva. We also wish to express our gratitude to the Sports Ministry for helping us to clear the goods.
I take this opportunity to thank Sports Minister, Sports Director General for their help and support. This charity organization is planning on sending goods to us on a quarterly basis. We were able to donate some of the clothing to our U17 girls.
Most of them come from remote areas. We also donated some of the clothing to our U19 – 15-a-side national team. We were also able to support one of the top rugby playing schools in Sri Lanka; Science College with boots and again with clothing,” concluded Ekanayake.
