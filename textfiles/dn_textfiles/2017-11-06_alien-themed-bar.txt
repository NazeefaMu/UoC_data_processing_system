Alien themed bar

The iconic horror-scifi “Alien” still haunts many of us to this day. From the ominous environment to the design of the alien itself, a huge part of the terror comes from the design of the film’s world. And the artist that we have to thank for the scaly, bony look of the title creature is Swiss designer H.R. Giger, who, since 1998, has showcased some of his greatest works in his own museum located in Switzerland.
One room of the museum, known as the H.R. Giger Bar, has been designed with many similarities to his work on the Ridley Scott film. And while many have not had the opportunity to experience it, photographer Matthias Belz has posted a 360 photograph of the bar, transporting us into the space as if we were there.
The room, as described by Giger’s website, is “a cavernous, skeletal structure covered by double arches of vertebrae that crisscross the vaulted ceiling of an ancient castle.” Complemented by equally as intimidating, sleek and dark furniture, the design is so evocative of “Alien” that it feels like it should exist in that world.
