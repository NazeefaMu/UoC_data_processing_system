Short Story: AU PAIR

I had an American au pair. It was the result of my constant search for an au pair with the consent of my family members. Bandulakumara Gurugamage, my worthwhile friend, made my dream come true through a friend living in The United States.
My children Amalka, Navoda, son in law Thisara and my beloved wife Somalatha were on cloud nine with the happy information of her arrival. Our little Hima, the only grandson, Amalka and Thisara’s first baby, a toddler of four was always looking at the western sky unendingly waiting for Cassidy Grace, our au pair. Her arrangements appeared on my e-mail and it was followed by the documents delivered at my doorstep through snail mail.
Happiness knew no bounds; we were at the Bandaranayke International Airport to collect her on 23rd May, happily on my 67th birthday. The coincidence went into our family history, on our way home on the expressway to Galle, we had to answer a barrage of questions from our au pair, she was quite curious to know about our culinary arts, language, our reciprocal arrangements on her behalf, and about her child minding part we had requested. Hima gave all the living answers, ‘Well begun is half done.’
Our simple dwelling nestles among the verdant tea plantations, with a huge tea factory in the backdrop of greenish vegetation with an enticing topography. The naturally blue vault of the sky and the ambience seemed to have mesmerized our au pair even for a longer stay. Her three month stay added to our history’s face. Even our grandmother next door came to life from her eroded shore like old age.
Our American visitor slept like a log on the first night because of jet leg and wearisome travel and in her sleep we attended to her room and lodging facilities as a norm of keeping an au pair and upholding our own culture to her sense and sensibility. My wife hung a huge tapestry of the Kandy pageant on the opposite wall of her bed. She was made able to breathe our culture just fresh from the bed. The morning sun beams reached her bed through the window making every morning a sunny dream. Our grandson woke her up every morning, saying, ‘Cassidy aunt, sky is blue, wake up wake up!’ ‘Thank you Hima, my good boy, good morning.’ Our child prodigy always uttered in his singing voice, ‘Every morning is a good morning in Lanka’ I gave ‘GOOD AFTER NOONS’ by LUDOWYKE from my library to read and feel GALLE.
‘Good morning Somalatha nenda. Good morning Dasa mama. Can I help you?’
It was the voice of Cassy, our au pair.’ We lovingly called her Cassy which she liked very much. We lately learnt that it had been her pet name at home in her teenage. Cassy was twenty when she became our au pair. She was slim and about six feet in height corresponding to her age. Her white skin was the main attraction for our Hima, but her complexion dimmed in our sun in which she basked a lot. She drank sunlight and learnt ‘hari awwa’ Navoda became her language teacher. She gave nice tongue twisters to her within her first week of her sojourn.
‘Api ada polsambal hadanava. Polkiri hodith hadanava. Cassy doo kemathida?’ My wife told her in our general Sinhala parlance. It was very interesting to hear how she put our words into American accent. She was treated to an authentic Sri Lankan meal for the first time. It seemed that her taste buds had saturated beyond expression as she told us that she had no words to express. ‘Nenda I have no words to express your culinary excellence. East can give a lot to the west.’ My wife raised her collar for her genuine appreciation, what is poignantly lacking in me. My wife is a culinary ambassador in the presence of foreigners. She doesn’t have any sense of xenophobia.
Around nine at night Cassy tiptoed to my writing table fully aghast. The few hairs on my bald head raised. ‘Ei Cassidy doo? Duwa bayaunada? ‘Ne mama, kauda kandayak kegahanawa maha haiyen. Mama hithana eyala loku partiyak danava wennethi.’ She said in good Sinhala. She had improved spoken Sinhala a lot by that time. She has picked up a lot from our family in language acquisition.
I felt very shy. I felt like a failed ambassador in his duty. The old nanny of the adjoining house next door had died. People in the vicinity had gathered there for their nocturnal merrymaking of playing carom, eating for transferring merits for the dead and also for giving a helping hand. This owl type behavior of the mourners of our country was a big shame for me when she said,’ Lankawe maranayak samaja uthsawayak da?’ I was flabbergasted.
I lost courage. My patriotic emotions died. Her words were an inadvertent slap on my ambassadorial dignity for three months. Later I happened to read that she had written her authentic experience on the social media how Sri Lankan people could convert any serious happening of sorrow to merrymaking overnight.
Next day, I took her to our famous village temple DUTUGEMUNU RAJAMA VIHARAYA. My wife led her all the way climbing up hundreds of stony steps to the shrine room. ‘Aunt, who are these big cemented people in array with different weapons in their hands. They look very energetic, determined and brave.’ Cassidy asked from my wife. My daughter Amalka not only explained about the ten great generals of King Dutugemunu, but also the much chronicled Sandarawala legend to her in her lucid mother tongue. I explained the gist in American accent for her utmost happiness.
Cassidy was very thoughtful. One day, she asked me an unexpected question. As it was quite palpable to her she wanted to know the expenses that we, as the host family, had done on her, so far. I simply said to her not to worry over it as we were duty bound to pay some little money for her numerous engagements in our household chores and child minding. ‘A big thank you mama.’ I can still remember how she uttered those words very understandingly and lovingly.
To my utter surprise ,she was dancing in our parlor one night. ‘You look very happy today, Cassy duwa.’ I told her. ‘Mama, some people are singing some aboriginal type of songs and I think they are dancing. Dear mama, could you take me there?’ It was a house of devil dancing. I took her there with our little Hima. It was a good treat to her eyes.
‘Mama, mama hari asai nettuwange endun walata. Mama australiawe aadivasinge netum dekala thiyenawa. Mama bayauna naya enavita. E unata mama balagena hitiya kenek hangila indagena nayek kesel pathura dege evanawa. Nayage dala keduwama bayanehe.’ The secret of devil dancing as a mental therapy to cure mental disorders is known to most of the people now. Cassidy was a careful observer. Later she said that she had worked in a serpent farm as an apprentice so she had known the properties of venom.
There remained only a few days of her sojourn with us. Our Hima was crying left and right. Our culinary expert was full of tears. Her wetted eyes were swiped by Cassidy several times a day. Her language teacher Navoda left no stone unturned to hide her tears. Amalka lamented a lot. I kept my spirits as I had to take her to the airport.
We arranged a sumptuous dinner for her the previous night. ‘Mama, mata puluvanda pelyak indaana mamage lassana watte oyalata mava matakwenna?’ Her spoken Sinhala was perfect. Her feelings were great. Her child minding was extraordinary because of her dedication and gentle hands. I could bear no more. I burst into tears.
‘Mama, nenda, mage Nan Gila denna ha mama masa thunak balagaththa Hima podi putha, ada mata Hari dukai, mata hari satutui, mama kohamada oyal dala yanne? Mata ugannapu devalta, mate kanna dipu devalta, oyale lassana ratata mama godak istuthi karanawa.’ She burst into tears. Tears were pouring down her white cheeks. My wife was uncontrollable and she tightly wrapped her in her hands and started weeping on the eve of Cassy’s leaving. In no time all of us wrapped together making a huge heap of humanity.
On the way to the airport, we were in great feelings, yet in less talk. All of us breathed her warmth again and we were seeing her departure through the glass walls till she became a tiny dot among the teeming crowds. We stopped our car in the vicinity of the airport and watched her plane in flight carrying away our American au pair.
