Sri Lankan housemaid shot dead in Saudi Arabia

A Sri Lankan housemaid employed in Saudi Arabia reportedly was shot dead by a mentally retarded person in the house where the woman was working.
The woman was Priiynaka Jayasekara, 38 of Abeysundara Watte, Kataburawa in Wanduramba, Galle. On Wednesday, her family was notified of the death of Priyanka over the phone from overseas. The message had stated that the alleged shooter had also committed suicide by shooting
On visit to the victim’s house in Wanduramba, we came to understand that she was a mother of three daughters. The eldest, Chamila Aspire, (21) is married. The other two are Avishka Hemali, (12) and Nethmi Navodya (8). The eight-year daughter is suffering from a chronic heart ailment.
About 20 years before, she had got married to L.G.Upul (44), who is a labourer at a stone quarry. He is at present incapable to work due to a hand impairment caused while working at the worksite.
A relative daughter of the victim's mother, M.G.Nadeeka Lakmali, who was there at her house when we visited the place said that her (deceased mother’s) youngest daughter had a prolonged heart disease and her family had numerous economic hardships which forced Priynaka nenda (aunt) to go overseas to work as a housemaid.
She had gone to Middle East on several occasions earlier. This time she went nine months before. She had not communicated with the family members since her departure. Subsequently, her husband complained to the Foreign Employment Bureau over the situation after failing to contact her through the respective employment agency. Thereafter, she was allowed to talk to the family members once a month with the intervention of the bureau. We urged the authorities to hold a proper inquiry into the incident and facilitate us to bring the body to Sri Lanka, relative daughter said.
Priyanka’s husband, Upul, who also confirmed that his wife went to Middle East on several instances for employment, said that for the last time she left the country nine months ago.
"Unlike on previous occasions this time my wife did not talk to me for long after she left us. She did not at least send us a letter. So I made a complaint to the Foreign Employment Bureau over the problem as there was no positive response to my similar complaint to the employment agency," Upul said.
"Meanwhile, I got a foreign call demanding me to withdraw my complaint to the bureau.
However, with the kind mediation of the bureau, I got an opportunity to talk to my wife once a month.
During our conversations she never told us about a mentally handicapped person at the house where she worked.
She last talked to me on March 10 and then on March 14, a relative brother informed me about my wife’s sudden demise. We did not know what happened.
I earnestly beg the authorities to arrange for the dispatch of her body to the country and make a proper investigation into her death and do the justice for our destitute family.
Deputy Minister of Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara said that immediately after the news of the death of the Priyanka was brought to their notice, the ministry swiftly intervened into the incident.
"We have already detailed a special group of officials to look into the matter and take necessary action to firstly bring her body to the country as soon as possible.
We are also working on a special initiative to probe into the alleged shooting," the Deputy Minister said.
