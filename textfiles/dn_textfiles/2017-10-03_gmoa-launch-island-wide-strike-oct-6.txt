GMOA to launch island-wide strike on Oct 6

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will launch a countrywide strike on Friday (6) if the Health Ministry does not rectify the existing inaccurate post intern appointment list, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA requested the Health Ministry Secretary to withdraw the existing list and make a proper list after calling an immediate meeting of the Transfer Board.
The GMOA would make a formal request from the Public Service Commission to conduct a formal and proper investigation on the conduct of Dr. Priyantha Athapaththu and would make an appointment with the Commission to discuss the existing problematic situation, he said.
A lot of issues were there since 2016 with the post intern appointment list because it is made and declared by the Health Ministry without the consultation of the Transfer Board due to political interference.
In the past, there was no such issue because the list was finalised and declared with the consultation of all relevant parties, especially the Transfer Board. No political influences were in the past, he said.
