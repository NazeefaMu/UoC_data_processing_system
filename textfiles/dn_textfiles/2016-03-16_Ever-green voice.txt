Ever-green voice

Indeed, he won the hearts of all musical lovers. Annesley Malawane hails from the gem-studded city, Ratnapura. The very eyes, opened a few decades back, felt and heard, above the lullaby of his mom, the scenic beauty and twittering of birds, which cuddled Ratnapura.
Nobody in Ratnapura ever thought that this child will glitter more than a valuable gem and would embrace hearts of the nation.
Q: Where were you educated?
A: I studied at St. Joseph's, Colombo
Q: Who inspired you to sing and did you ever imagine that this would be your career?
A: At school, I was awarded many times. During free times even teachers wanted me to sing. My father was a Chorister at the Peter and Paul Church, Ratnapura. He knew this will take me somewhere someday. I hit his jackpot.
I am proud of it.
My box guitar accompanied me to maintain the beat. With the Beacons in 1960s I first sang to the music of electric guitars. Now I have my own Troup 'Annesley and Super Chimes.
Q: Who introduced you to music troupes?
A: First, I was introduced to late Sri Sangabo Corea . Later I joined the 'Moonstones' which cleared the way to me.
As a shadow, Clarance Wijewardhana was there with me. Both of us were the vocalists for 'Moonstones'.
Q: What was your first song?
A: 'Dilhani'. I sang it with my heart repression. But since it is a lullaby my male voice did not creep into the hearts of anyone.
Then, through Indrani Perera's voice, it touched the hearts of all. I am happy about it. During 1960s, many requested this song on SLBC.
Q: What happened to Moonstones? The younger generation is hardly aware of such a troupe.
A: Not only Moonstones, but many other famous troupes fell off the track. In 1974 I formed Super Golden Chimes with Clarance, Dickson, Conrad and Sri Kantha.
Q: Then there was a period of silence. Probably ten years?
A: Naturally I got married in 1977. I was busy with my family life. During this period, I had to see my good friend Clarence dying. That was a huge shock.
Q: What is it that you would never forget in your lifetime?
A: When I sang 'Rosa Male Natuwe Katu' in Ratnapura with Moonstones, the audience hooted at us. Probably they thought we are singing a nursery rhyme. When we sang the same song in Moratuwa, there was a thundering applause. I felt the difference. Hats off to the Moratuwites. They love music and rhythm. They must have tolerated the lyrics.
Q: Most of your songs have a soft spot for nature. Any comments?
A: 'Mango', 'Kalumame', 'Ruwanpura', 'Udarata Niliya', 'Kageda Gon Vassa', 'Dunihinda Manamali' and there are many more which I feel would be ever green. I love nature, vegetation and rural folks. Though I live in Colombo, I am from that beautiful wilderness of the mountain ranges. My songs also portray Sinhala culture and traditions apart from nature.
Q: What do you think of the future of music?
A: Of course, the modern techniques have evolved. We never thought music will be like this today. Our times at the SLBC, whatever the costume we wear, we had to stay long hours in studios at the SLBC to tape a song. Now, the present singers are born with a silver spoon. They just follow the techniques and attend the rest. But I do not say that all are blessed to be good vocalists. Only few will be ever green. Now the computers and television are supportive factors.
Q: Anything to disclose to your fans?
A: I celebrated my 40 years of singing at BMICH in 2006. I will be celebrating my 50 years of singing at BMICH on August 6. My troupe 'Annesley and Super Chimes' will be on stage on March 19 evening at Sri Lanka Export Development Board Auditorium (Nawam Mawatha, Colombo 2).
