Supreme Court prohibits CMC from dumping garbage in Muthurajawela

 
The Supreme Court issued an order, prohibiting Colombo Municipal Council from dumping garbage in Muthurajawela a short while ago.
Thirty five residents living in close proximity to the Muthurajawela Sanctuary filed a petition at the Supreme Court on June 15, seeking an Interim Order directing authorities not to store or dump garbage in the area.
The petitioners cited Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), CMC Municipal Commissioner, Urban Development Authority (UDA), Central Environment Authority (CEA), Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha and six other parties as respondents.
