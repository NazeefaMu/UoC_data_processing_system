Dazzling spectrum of a medic

 What is unique between these two, is not the brush that is used but a simple ball point pen. The painter in this situation is a soul-searching doctor who is able to evaluate his artistic inherence as well as his healing powers.
Dr. Kamal Perera's technique is characterized by flat areas of colour with his chosen subjects in simple but defiant outlines. The paintings are highly complexed and combine various artistic styles to create reality and artifice. This remains his central signature that is recognized by the experts or critics. In such art, one cannot identity any school of cubism, contemporary, modern as found in the last century on emerging artists who are struggling to achieve their own identity and many like Dr. Perera, venture into new form of lines and colour, leaving behind the brush and palette which is a difficult technique they put on paper with amazing results.
Dr. Kamal A. Perera 
At the Lionel Wendt Gallery last week was the fourth Solo Exhibition called SPECTRUM of Dr. Kamal Perera where more than 30 exhibits of ball point art among them in acrylic, pencil work, and another in oils were on view.
This inspirational doctor chose to modernize traditional themes with direct reference to devices found in constructed still life for example, the portrait of Abe. Lincoln. One of the outstanding features I found was that he under-scored the background in order to project man, woman or animal thereby push the background into oblivion without any clashes of one underscoring the other or overlapping each other.
His aesthetic leanings can be traced in most of the paintings as they stretch across many faces of joy, solitude, exuberance, pathos etc. probably arising from the doctor's mood at the time his ballpoint scribble the surface. Generally, artists are sensitive people and passionate about their art that makes them incorporate music and poetry into visions, some of which I found in his paintings, He may have subverted precision of his earlier work which I had not seen but can find a certain amount of clarity in a couple of paintings, He is a figurative painter and there is plenty for testimony though the paintings are far and in between. He must spread out his dreams more spaciously and not cram up; there by find more volume that will add distinction and gravity. I found a great amount of subtle colour streaming out of his pen and they were splendid merging one to another in spirited scope.
To obtain this effect, Dr. Perera has to be a very clever artist and an astute one. He is ardent about his subject matter and pay homage to women not baring their assets as our culture deem so. Freedom of the wild was limited for want of fauna and flora was. (many be I am a nature person) and found the lapse. The brilliant and bold colours used on the SRI LANKAN JUNGLE FOWL (2) was a miracle produced from the simple pen where many an artist with a palette and brush have failed. So was THE ELEPHANT (14).
Throughout his paintings different forms and sources of light suggests the presence of his object to produce linear mode that has become increasingly his signature form. For a medic unlike a normal artist, can hassle because he has been trained to look at human form differently and objectively . Fortunately, there were not very many human forms and never prevented depth or sculptural interpretation. The design and saturated field of colour are a response to his surroundings, apparently. Lastly, I found his continuing fascination and individualism can reveal his innermost love for art.
