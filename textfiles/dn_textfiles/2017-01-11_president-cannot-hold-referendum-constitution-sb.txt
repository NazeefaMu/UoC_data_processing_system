President cannot hold referendum on Constitution - SB

The SLFP or President Maithripala Sirisena does not have the mandate to hold a referendum on a Constitution, Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake was speaking at a media briefing at Sethsiripaya, Battaramulla yesterday.
The SLFP did not seek a mandate for such an amendment that requires a referendum, Minister Dissanayake said.
The UNP sought a popular vote for a constitution, which they did not get, he said.
"If we want to change the Constitution, we will have to exercise a choice that does not insist on a referendum," he said.
Minister Dissanayake said that the SLFP is not against constitutional amendments that would encourage the reconciliation process and fulfill the needs of ethnic minorities.
"We will support if there are amendments regarding Presidential powers as well, he said.
Speaking on the report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms, he said that it is timely that such a study took place.
"No Constitution was created with the participation of all communities in Sri Lanka. Former President Chandrika Bandaranayake attempted to graft a Constitution, but it did not turn to a reality," Dissanayake said.
Speaking on the provincial council election, Minister Dissanayake said delimitation reports will be gazetted soon. The election will be held by April 15.
The UNP and the SLFP have agreed to hold the election following the first past the post system instead of the preferential voting system, he said.
Minister Dissanayake said while the SLFP is proposing President Maithripala Sirisena to run for the presidency in 2020, the UNP will go ahead with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as their Presidential candidate.
President Sirisena is still not voicing his idea on this proposal for the 2020 presidential election, but as the leader of SLFP, he is bound to go with the popular vote, Minister Dissanayake said.
