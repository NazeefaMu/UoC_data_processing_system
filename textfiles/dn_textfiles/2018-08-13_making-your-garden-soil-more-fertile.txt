Making your garden soil more fertile

Soil Testing
The first step to creating the perfect growing environment is to have a good understanding of what you have to work with.
Specifically, we should be looking for nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous levels. We also need to pay attention to the pH level and some soil tests even detect the amount of organic matter as well.
Understanding the exact nutrient levels in the soil allows us to amend soil properly for the best crop production possible. Most agriculture extension offices offer free or low-cost soil testing and there are a variety of commercial testing services as well.
Adjusting Soil
Most of us are not blessed with perfectly aerated soil automatically. Your soil might be too sandy or contain too much clay (which drastically affects aeration and water drainage). Although it takes some time to properly adjust soil, it is possible.
The best way is to mix chopped organic matter (leaves for example) into the soil and mix well. Some people even our liquid nitrogen into the mixture to speed up the decomposition process.
Unfortunately, this technique is best exercised in the fall as it takes time for the decomposition process to occur.
If you didn’t think that far ahead, there is another solution. Adding high-quality organic potting soil promotes strong root development and robust plant growth. Potting soil should be mixed at least 8” – 12” deep into existing soil. It does take some work, but it is well worth the effort when your crops begin to take off in these improved soil conditions.
Consider pH Level
Most soil tests include a pH reading of the sample, but if not, most garden centers sell inexpensive pH testing kits you can use at home to get a pretty good estimate of your soil’s pH level.
Most vegetables prefer soil that is slightly acidic (a pH level below 7.0). As a general rule, soil on the East Coast tends to be more acidic and soil on the West Coast is more alkaline (pH level above 7.0) due to the arid summers.
Properly amending your soil for proper pH levels starts with knowing what you want to grow. A quick Google search should provide tons of results about proper pH level for any crop. Blueberries, for instance, thrive in extremely acidic soil that would kill many other fruit and vegetable species.
If your soil is alkaline, consider adding gypsum or elemental sulfur to lower the pH level. Sawdust, composted leaves and peat moss are also good alternatives.
Soil that is too acidic can be amended using limestone (calcium carbonate), bone meal and crushed oyster shells. Hardwood ash, sometimes known as potash, also works well. I save all the ash from my wood stove expressly for this purpose as my soil tends to be slightly too acidic by spring.
Adding Compost
Compost is the single best thing you can do to improve soil quality right now. Whether you maintain your own compost pile or purchase bags of organic material from the local gardening store, compost possesses all the qualities our gardens need to thrive year after year.
Not only is compost full of organic nutrients, but the composition of properly matured compost provides better water drainage and aeration in just about every type of soil imaginable.
While it may be too late to start a compost pile in time for this planting season, by this time next year you will have all the organic fertilizer/soil amendment you could possibly need to support a healthy crop.
By spending a little time with your soil before planting crops this year, you can drastically increase the production of your garden and the overall quality of the food on your table year after year.
