Beehives  in your living room

As you probably know already, the bee population is in a consistent decline and has been for some time, with modern industrial farming methods and loss of habitat being identified causes.
This is bad news for all of us, as bees do the crucial job of pollinating so many of the plants that we rely on for food.
In order to counter this, we have to come up with innovative solutions, as we all know how difficult it is to make huge, moneymaking corporations change their damaging practices. BEEcosystem has created a system of wall-mounted observation hives, that can be easily expanded in a hexagonal, honeycomb style, and even lets you invite the bees into your living room.
This concept, bringing bees closer to humans in an urban environment, is not only good for the bee population as a whole, but it increases the understanding of the importance of bees and their role, as we learn to live side-by-side.
The system has been designed with safety in mind, so that even novice bee-keepers can use it with a peace of mind that few other systems offer. Because yeah, we can understand the trepidation that many people, brought up to fear bees and their sting, might have when sitting next to a few thousand of them on the couch.
You can watch the bees in action as they do their amazing work and build up their colony, see how they create honeycomb and beeswax, and even harvest honey if you are feeling hungry.
