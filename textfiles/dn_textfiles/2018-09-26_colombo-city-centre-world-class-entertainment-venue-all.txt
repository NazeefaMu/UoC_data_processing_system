Colombo City Centre, world-class  entertainment venue for all

Sri Lankan masses always wanted a large and quality but affordable entertainment venue and Colombo City Centre (CCC) was built to fulfill this void, said Chairperson, Abans Group, Aban Pestonjee.
“Sri Lanka’s first international mall, is set to transform not only the lifestyles of contemporary Sri Lankans, but also the urban fabric of Colombo as it develops into one of the greatest capitals on par with the best in the world.”
“Our initial vision behind the development of the mall was to provide a place where Sri Lankan families can enjoy quality time together.
I am glad to say that, with the mix of high-end local and international brands, food court, and 6-screen Cineplex, we will be achieving that goal and offering Sri Lanka its first international mall.”
The mall will soon add NEXT Hotel with 164 keys, and 192 luxurious residential units designed to offer unmatched views of the city, Beira Lake, and Indian Ocean.
“This is a historic moment for Sri Lanka,”said Anand Sundaram, CEO of Colombo City Centre. “The denizens of Colombo have long deserved a world of cosmopolitan experiences befitting of the city’s urban renaissance. And we are proud to celebrate these experiences with them as they come to life in the country’s first international mall.
Anand Nadathur, Group CEO, Next Story Group, the Singapore based joint venture partner added: “Urban spaces ought to be reimagined to match how consumers live, work, play and stay in the new digital age. Integrating these functions into a coherent, compelling series of well-designed spaces and experiences allows us to create and foster unique, thriving communities. We hope that this will set the benchmark for future developments in the country. Congratulations to the team for bringing the concept to fruition.”
Designed as the first integrated lifestyle complex of its kind in Sri Lanka, the Mall at Colombo City Centre will offer a world-class combination of culinary, entertainment, and retail experiences from 10 am to 10 pm every day.
A highly anticipated addition to the capital’s fast-developing skyline, Colombo City Centre is Sri Lanka’s first BOI- approved mixed development project, slated for completion in early 2019.
The USD 180 million joint venture between local retail giant, Abans, and Singapore-based Next Story Group is one of Sri Lanka’s largest foreign direct investments in recent times, and raises 47-storeys above the heart of the city.
