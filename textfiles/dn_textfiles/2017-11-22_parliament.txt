A private higher education institute for medical education:Minister Kiriella
SAITM would gradually be abolished and a parallel not-for-profit private higher education institute would be newly established for medical education, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The Minister who was speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday when Finance Heads of his Ministry were taken up, said SAITM students and other students seeking private sector medical education could enrol to this new non-governmental institution.
Observing that private sector investment for education is important to broaden higher education opportunities for students who do not get a chance to enter State universities, Kiriella said free education in the country would not be affected by private sector involvement.
“Many accused our Government of trying to hamper free education, but anybody who goes through the budgetary proposals for the next year, would be convinced of our commitment to protect and strengthen the state sector education.
We have proposed to set up three new medical faculties and seven new technological faculties.
A health insurance cover would be granted to University students. We have increased the number of students who are entitled to the Mahapola by another 3,500,” he noted.
Replying to the concerns raised by JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa, the Minister also refuted claims that there was a severe shortage of academic staff at State universities.
“The total number of approved academic staff is 10,875, while currently there are 6,097 permanent lecturers. There are 4,768 vacancies, but we have recruited 5,236 lecturers on probationary, contract and assignment basis and as visiting lecturers,” he explained.
Speaking on the subject of Highways, the minister said that the contracts for all three stages of the Central Expressway were awarded after adhering to proper tender procedure. “This was not the practice during the previous regime. No tenders were called for the Southern or Katunayake Expressway and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa selected the contractor,” he said.
He said under the Road project, 6,886km of roads would be constructed by the end of 2019.

'Supporters of white Van culture have no ethical rights to talk of Treasury bond issue'
State Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said that those who hid themselves when they were called to the Bribery Commission and supported the white van culture, have no ethical right to talk about the Treasury bond scam.
He said so in Parliament yesterday, in response to the joint opposition objecting to the Speaker appointing a committee to look into whether parliamentary privileges were being violated by exposing telephone records of MPs.
Kabir Hashim further said, “Today Udaya Gammanpila is talking about transparency, but earlier, when they were summoned by the Bribery Commission, the MPs went into hiding. They sent letters claiming that there was parliamentary sittings. When information was sought, they sent white vans. Where were you then? When your side was doing all this, you did nothing. Now you are trying to talk about transparency?”
In response, Gammanpila said, “We are against appointing a privilege committee over telephone records. Why is the government that brought in the Right to Information, now trying to hide this information?”
Pitching in on this heated argument, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said, “I said this earlier as well. We are not against investigations. However, we are against Bond Commission evidence being put out without being found guilty.”
Meanwhile, Chaminda Wijesiri said, “It is a decisive moment for the whole country. Our Prime Minister set an example to the country and to the whole world, that we will not safeguard rogues and fraudsters. The Prime Minister did all he had to do. But the previous government was not like him. When they were summoned before the Bribery Commission, they claimed to have been bitten by a snake and hid.” MPs Bandula Gunawardena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Ranjith Soysa also joined in the heated argument.
