Landslide warning as heavy thunder showers continue

Heavy rains have forced the Disaster Management authorities to issue early landslide warnings to Kalutara, Ratnapura and Nuwara Eliya districts.
Disaster Management Centre (DMC) Assistant Director Pradeep Kodippili said that the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) had alerted the respective districts.
Most areas had over 75 mm of rain and gusty winds.
Sluice gates of the Kukule Ganga had been opened due to the heavy rains in Kalutara. The Irrigation Engineer had informed the Centre that water was discharging through the sluice gate at the rate of 40 cubic feet per second.
Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department has predicted further spells of heavy rains, especially in the Western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces.
Thunder showers would continue in the South Westerly regions. Gusts of strong winds would be experienced throughout the country, the Meteorology Department said.
DMC's Kodippili said those living in the Central hilly regions need to pay close attention to areas prone to landslides. He asked the public to use telephone number 117 in case of an emergency.
