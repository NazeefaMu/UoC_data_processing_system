‘Certain teachers treating students unfairly’

President Maithripala Sirisena said there had been reports of unfair treatment of pupils by some teachers. These are evident in the facts revealed in letters and phone calls received by him and during certain discussions held. The letters, while highlighting details about the quality and excellence of teacher - student relations, also point out unfair treatment to students by some teachers.
President Sirisena said relevant authorities should pay immediate attention to these wrong-doings.
He was participating in a ceremony held at Wayamba National College of Education in Bingiriya on Wednesday. The newly built water purification system at Wayamba National College of Education was opened for pupils’ use.
The President also spoke about the era when teaching was considered a service rather than a mere profession and the present era when teaching is considered just a profession.
He added that teaching is considered to be the greatest of all professions which takes on the responsibility of building a nation and a future and that it is not second to any other profession.
President Sirisena said according to surveys carried out, it was revealed that there are eight to nine percent of teachers who are not eligible for the profession. This is out of the total of 250,000 teachers in service, he said. This ineligibility is not with regard to the qualifications but in terms of respect, dedication, skill and ability in their service.
The weaknesses evident in the teaching profession, government service and political arena should be removed for the nation’s march towards success, said the President. He said the reputation and dignity of any field is evident through the character and good image of professionals.
Fulfilling a promise given to students when he participated in the State Vesak festival held at Bingiriya Devagiri Rajamaha Viharaya on April 28, when his chopper landed at the stadium of the Wayamba National College of Education, he earlier made financial allocations to provide a water purification system to the school. Constructions were completed with the assistance of the Navy, thus providing solutions to the severe water problem in the Wayama National College of Education. The water issues had been solved after 20 years.
Later, he presented certificates to students with outstanding performances. A special token of appreciation was presented to the President.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, North Western Province Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake, SLFP Chairman Youth Front MP Nalin Bandara, former Deputy Minister Shantha Bandara, Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy Vice Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe, North Western Provincial Education Officers, teachers and others were present.
