Battle of the gentlemen

The title refers in general to what are cricket matches played by rival schools who have traditional fixtures elevated to the level of a Big Match. Most are played in March every year by the senior team. The fixtures are seen across many parts of the country.
Cricket as we all know is popular across the country. It’s expensive. A ground to practice and play is a luxury for many. A matting wicket is a basic need. A turf even more. Knowledgeable coaches, physiotherapists, physical trainers are not easy to find and come with a price attached. A school excelling has to build up teams from the junior years to enable a sustainable cricketing regime.
A successful cricket programme attracts interest from parents and boys. Principals and staff of public schools have to manage within budgets allocated by the Ministry whilst being subject to service based transfers.
Old boys become involved if they were successful themselves in school and after. Once a cricket programme is established top up funding is required through sponsorship. Sponsors invest if it gives visibility for their identity and products or services. Each child requires cricketing gear which does not come cheap. Last but not least there is an element of nutrition for sports which entails some expenses.
Ombudspersons for sports
If sufficient numbers attend practices, parents and children alike clamour for their child to play competitive games. The human element enters with variable notions of equal opportunity and fair play. These are all daunting challenges for any school and cricketer.

Organising Big Matches
A venue costs. Tents as they are euphemistically termed need to be rigged, tickets sold, sponsors found, service providers contracted, media sponsors found, security arranged and umpires allocated. The Big Match with a higher profile sees old boys working for a minimum of seven months to organise a match every year. School perfects, house prefects and stewards are deployed. Souvenirs are produced by some schools. The match days entail exhausting work for those deployed. Most are volunteers spending time and energy to set up events which provide much entertainment.
The cricket
A focus on results masks skills and performances. It’s no different at Big Matches. Cricket requires eleven to perform for a team performance. A tail ender who scores two whilst his partner contributes the winning runs in an hours play contributes equally to the win. Leadership and leaders within teams are another prerequisite. Laws and regulations around cricket have become more exacting. It’s not a game played by white flannelled fools! We not only have on - field umpires, we have a third umpire and match referee. Standards of conduct and playing styles are regulated. The Big Match is ultimately a cricket match. There is a notion the hype around Big Matches is bigger than the cricket. It is not and must not be.
