Postal Dept loses Rs. 150 m daily with ongoing strike: PMG

Post Master General (PMG) Rohana Abeyrathne yesterday said the Postal Department has a Rs. 150 million daily revenue and it has been affected with the ongoing trade union action by some postal employees.
Abeyrathne said the department is denied of the revenue but that it is not a loss.
“The average collection of our service worth around Rs. 150 MN.
Since the post offices are closed down, we do not have that daily collection,” Abeyrathna said.
