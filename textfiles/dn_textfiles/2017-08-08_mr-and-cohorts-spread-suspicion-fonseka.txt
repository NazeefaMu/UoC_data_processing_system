MR and cohorts spread suspicion: Fonseka

Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his cohorts are spreading ill-feelings and suspicion among communities. They are encouraging division and violence between the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities, said Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
He said so speaking at the opening ceremony of the UNP political office at Kallady, Batticaloa, on Sunday (6).
He further said, “Because the previous government was not serving the people in the correct manner, I found a new party and tried to serve the people. We were successful in bringing the Mahinda Rajapaksa government to an end in 2015.”
“It is difficult for a new party to contest with well-established old parties; therefore, we got together in 2015 and established a new unity government. Previously, the people of the North and East suffered untold hardship and were marginalised. Today, all communities are living peacefully,” he added.
He said, it is the policy of the Government that all privileges and rights of the majority should be shared by the minority as well.
The Government will ensure that in the future, racial conflicts will not take place.
All Sri Lankans will live in unity.
