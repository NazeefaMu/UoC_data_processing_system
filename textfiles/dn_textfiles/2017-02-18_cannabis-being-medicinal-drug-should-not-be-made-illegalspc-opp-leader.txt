Cannabis being a medicinal drug should not be made illegal:SPC Opp. leader

The consumption of cannabis should not be made illegal, since it was considered a medical drug, Southern Provincial Council Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame said.
Speaking at the Southern Provincial Council meeting on Tuesday (14), he said, “Cannabis is known as Thailoka Pathram in Sanskrit. It is a medicine. This is used in Indian states. Cannabis is also used as a means to develop tourism in India.”
Tennakoon Nilame also said the Police and Excise Department who do not conduct raids to nab drugs and heroin, only conduct raids to nab cannabis to satisfy their interests. Therefore, they engage in raids in the Southern Province where the tourism sector is highly developed, he added.
He also requested that Excise licenses be issued to small scale hotels in order to develop tourism in the Southern Province.
