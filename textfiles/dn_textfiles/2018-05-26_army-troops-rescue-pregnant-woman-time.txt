Army troops rescue pregnant woman on time

A pregnant woman, stranded due to ravaging floods in the general area of Thoduwawa, Marawila, received the timely intervention of Army troops of 16 Gajaba Regiment (GR) of the 143 Brigade under the 14 Division on Tuesday (22) evening, while the troops were conducting emergency rescue and relief operations elsewhere in close proximity to that area.
Troops were informed by another flood victim that a lonely house, situated away from theirs has had a pregnant woman before the floods inundated the area, but villagers are unaware as to what has happened to her after the floods.
Alert to the information, troops using a truck waded across the water and approached the house in question and searched for the pregnant woman whom they referred. With difficulty, troops found the house where the pregnant woman was living and requested her to join them to be taken to a safer place.
Accordingly, troops evacuated her from her flood-affected house and took her to the nearby Marawila hospital in an Army truck. On the advice of medical authorities, she was asked to get admitted to the hospital before delivery.
