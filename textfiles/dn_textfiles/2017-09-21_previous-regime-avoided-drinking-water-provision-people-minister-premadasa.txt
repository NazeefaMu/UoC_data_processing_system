Previous regime avoided drinking water provision to people: Minister Premadasa

The previous regime avoided the provision of drinking water to the people, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said at Hathporuwa in Suriyawewa recently.
The minister donated funds for the provision of water to the Randiyadahara community centre for distribution among people.
Minister Premadasa said the water supply scheme will benefit 400 families in the village. He said villagers have undergone hardships in obtaining water for drinking.
“It is our bounden duty to provide water to the people,” he said.
The minister said the duration of the previous regime was known as a period of miracles, but people did not get even drinking water for reasons not known.
“If the rulers provided drinking water to villagers, there would not be kidney patients in those areas, he said.
The minister said the estimated cost for the construction of the Suriyawewa international play ground was Rs.1,200,000,000. He said a huge amount of money has gone to the pockets of the then rulers and their henchmen.
Minister Premadasa said the distribution of Sil redi is not bad, but they distributed not a sil redi, but a Manapa reddak during the presidential election.
