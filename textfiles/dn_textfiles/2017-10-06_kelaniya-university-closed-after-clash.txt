Kelaniya University closed after clash

All faculties of the Kelaniya University except the medical faculty were temporarily closed yesterday until further notice following a clash which erupted between two undergraduate groups by the university administration.
Eight undergraduates were hospitalised and a few others sustained minor injuries as a result of a clash which took place between two student groups yesterday.
University sources said that several outstanding issues between the rival groups resulted in the clash.The failure of severlal rounds of discussions held between the two groups aiming to solve the dispute are reported to have failed.
This situation compelled the University administration to temporarily close the university in to avoid further classes, which could cause harm to life and damage to property.
With the decision to temporarily university operations, all undergraduates, including students in hostels were informed to leave the university premises before noon yesterday.
