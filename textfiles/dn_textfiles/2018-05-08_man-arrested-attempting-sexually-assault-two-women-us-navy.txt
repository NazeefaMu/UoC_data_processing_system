Man arrested for attempting to sexually assault two women of US Navy

 
A hotel employee who attempted to sexually assault two female US Navy personnel of the US Navy Hospital Ship, USNS Mercy was arrested by Uppuveli Police yesterday.
 “The two ladies ordered a soft drink from the hotel in which they were staying. An employee had brought the drink to the room and had attempted to sexually molest the two ladies aged 23 and 25,” stated an official from the Police Media Unit.
The employee was identified as a resident of Pudakudairippu and he will be produced before the Trincomalee Magistrate today.
US Navy Hospital Ship, USNS Mercy arrived to Sri Lanka on April 25 to facilitate the Pacific Partnership-2018. It is currently berthed at the Trincomalee Port and will leave the Sri Lankan waters on May 9.
Similar incidents where foreigners were assaulted were reported during the past weeks when a group of Dutch tourists were physically and sexually assaulted by employees at a surf bar in Mirissa.
