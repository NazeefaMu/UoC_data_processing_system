New laws to curb underworld activities

Steps will be taken to curb underworld activities and various other rackets within the prison system even by bringing in new laws, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said.
“Both Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale have already discussed this matter and decided to take necessary measures towards this end,” said the Deputy Minister.
He stressed the importance of taking necessary measures to conduct raids by the police and the army at prisons. Deputy Minister Bandara made these observations at a media conference held at Sirikotha yesterday.
He further said that underworld activists and other racketeers become more powerful while they are at the prisons since they can easily build relationships with other racketeers.
“Sometimes, we have to stop certain money transferring facilities in the future to avoid rackets within prisons since most of the racketeers easily use this facility,” he added.
Responding to a statement by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa claiming that the rule of law in the country has collapsed, the Deputy Minister said that former Defence Secretary has completely forgotten history and how journalists were treated and also those who protested against the government by demanding their rights.
Refuting the allegation leveled against the government by the former Defence Secretary, Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said that a large number of raids have been conducted by the police and drug smugglers arrested and firearms seized.
Around 798 firearms and 2882 ammunitions had been taken into custody during raids conducted from January 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018. Around 335 firearms and 7375 ammunitions had been taken into custody during the period from January 1, 2018 to July 2, 2018.
Around 278 kgs of Heroin had been taken into custody during 29282 raids conducted in 2017.
