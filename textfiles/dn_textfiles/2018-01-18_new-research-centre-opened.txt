New research centre opened

Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said on January 16, the newly opened “Sandharani” research centre in the premises of Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration will undertake the research as its first assignment to probe into the
reasons behind various allegations made against public servants including inefficiency and delay in the work.
The Minister addressing the gathering said that public servants have to face both allegations and praises when they perform their duties.
The main allegation against them is the delay in the work. "We have to find reasons and solutions for this issue urgently and that is why we have established this research center to look into the matter", he said.
The Minister said that many public servants do a very good job, but there are others who do not perform their duties up to the level expected by the public. "These officers always try to show the
financial regulations and establishment codes as the reasons for the delay. When there is a delay in work, it can be led to frauds and corruption. Therefore, we must take immediate steps to resolve the problem,” he added.
"Public servants should do their utmost contribution for the development of the country. They must learn to work with new technology in order to achieve this target. We will expand technology programmers for the betterment of Grama Niladhari officers. Many public institutions have good conduct, but there are some institutions where bribery and corruption are rampant. Our main aim is to introduce anti-corruption strategy to all government institutions,” he said.
The “Sandharani” research center consists of “Sanshravani” lecture theater and e-library.
