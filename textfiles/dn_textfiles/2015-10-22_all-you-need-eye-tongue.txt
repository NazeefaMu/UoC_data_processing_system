All you need is the Eye & Tongue

Chef Kithsiri de Silva is a man who has been so around the world learning all that needs to be known in the culinary world. Nothing is more exciting that to sit down and listen to someone who has travelled so much like that and being in the culinary industry for 30+ years. And one of the best things you can experience when you are a foodie is actually see the chef in action and showing how quick and easy it is to turn one simple prawn with very few ingredients to something that could go on the cover of a gourmet magazine. And of course explores with a fusion of flavours in one bite (if you watched Ratouille - you will know what I mean). Read on and get to know this chef better.
Bit about yourself: I am from Panadura. Now I live in Nugegoda. I've been out of Sri Lanka for 27 years and came back two years ago for the opening of Kingsbury Hotel as Executive Chef. I have been in the culinary industry for 32 good years since 1985. My first job was at the Claremont Hotel School for 6 months doing my basic cookery. Then I had an opportunity to go to Bahrain Inter-Continental where I worked for 3 and half years. I came back and worked at Colombo Hilton Gables in 1989 for 1 and half years. Then it was from Dubai Hilton to Al Ain Intercontinental to Bahrain Diplomat to Bahrain Intercontinental to Kuwait Intercontinental back to Bahrain Gulf Hotel to Kuwait Safir International. I flew to UK from and went off to Paris where I worked for two years before coming back again to Bahrain. After that I went to Turkey and finally came back to Sri Lanka two years ago.
Q: Of all the places you worked at, what are your greatest memories of them?
The most memorable would be working at Kuwait International. That place has 24 outlets and I was managing all of them and this is what actually led me to open restaurants and it was my fourth 5 Star opening as a chef. I opened almost 24 outlets and was there for 10 years. That is where I really became someone.
Q: Why are you a chef?
Actually in the beginning, I never wanted to be a chef. I wanted to be a Room Boy. But then I don't know for what reason I started to love cooking. It was never easy for me to become a chef and it took me a good 25 years to become a chef. It was really hard and such things are never easy. Advantage of it was I got to travel around the world which actually helped me to climb up.
Q: What do you feel when you cooking, creating and working in the kitchen?
Well like I say always where the cooking is concerned, I won't follow recipes. You use your Eye and Tongue - this is what I believe in. Recipes are just a base. Cooking is not the bible so I really follow that and this is why I say I don't plan things. When I see the guests coming I know what they want and I cook accordingly. I have succeeded in it and so far I really do know what people want when it comes to food.
Q: Who is your biggest critic?
As a chef I hate complaining (breaks into laughter). You can comment but you can't complain. There's a big a difference between commenting and complaining.
Q: How do you handle dishes that are rejected and sent back to the kitchen?
In my experience it's very rare. But if it does happen I take it positively. Recently we had a food tasting here and a dessert which came from the kitchen was not liked by a guest. So I went to the pastry section and I saw whatever was there and in 10 minutes had something ready and it was loved by the guest.
Q: When at home do you cook or do you let your partner take control?
Well my wife is a better cook than me. I am actually not that good in making Sri Lankan cuisine but I have my own way of making it too which is loved by my family. I do a lot of fusion in my Sri Lankan cuisine. I strongly believe that people in this industry don't want to see the same thing every single day. We need to keep on changing and we don't run short of ideas when you do things right.
Q: When you are not cooking...what do you do?
I shout...(just kidding). I actually paint and it's my hobby. I love to paint figures and portraits. It's something I've been doing since the time I was small.
I have around 70 pieces...I believe. Being an artist I much enjoy giving away one of my pieces for free to a person who really does enjoy the beauty of art than sell it. Because those paintings are like my children and if I am selling them it will be like selling a child. And surprisingly, since I came to Sri Lanka I have not got a chance to paint. Sri Lanka is a busy country and I only get two days off. And I like to take my own time to paint.
