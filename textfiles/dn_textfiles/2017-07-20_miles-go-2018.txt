Miles to go before 2018

Political circles were abuzz last week with speculation that a rift between the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and United National Party (UNP) factions of the National Unity government had widened and a parting of ways was imminent.
This followed months of dissatisfaction in both UNP and SLFP camps with President Maithripala Sirisena complaining that corruption probes against the Rajapaksa regime were stalled and reportedly a group of some eighteen SLFP ministers and Members of Parliament wanting to quit government ranks.
There has been intermittent sniping among SLFP and UNP ministers for some time now but it appears that the prospect of upcoming elections - both local government and provincial council - are pushing parliamentarians to take up positions that are popular with the electorates they represent.
At the last SLFP parliamentary group meeting, President Maithripala Sirisena - who was about to embark on an official visit to Bangladesh - gave his SLFP MPs a patient hearing. In the end, he left with some cautionary words of advice: that the SLFP would need to work with the UNP at least until the end of this year.
National Unity government
However, it was evident at the meeting that even within the SLFP, MPs were not speaking in one voice. Even though it was well known by then that President Sirisena was unhappy at the pace of investigations against the Rajapaksa regime, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera was to argue that it was ‘not fair’ to harass the Rajapaksa family with numerous investigations. This drew angry responses from some of his colleagues.
That the status quo within the National Unity government will remain- at least for the foreseeable future- is clear. In fact, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was to acknowledge that it was ‘difficult’ but declare that it was necessary.
Addressing a public function at Pannipitiya on Monday, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe noted that the National Unity government was formed so it could initiate development programmes. “We could have refrained from doing so but the main parties decided to work together instead,” he pointed out and exhorted, “let us continue to work together and try to solve the problems faced by the country”.
The misgivings about the unity government have arisen because parliamentarians in both parties have no clear idea about the political path the country will take on a variety of issues: the fate of the executive presidency, the prospects for a presidential election and the alliances that would be forged at the next general election.
Executive presidency
The big question amongst all this is the fate of the Executive Presidency. President Maithripala Sirisena is on record, both before and after being elected President, that the 2015 Presidential election was the first and last election he would contest. He also pledged to prune the powers of the Presidency and make the office responsible to Parliament.
To be fair by the President, he has done some of that already, through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which he personally took great pains to see through Parliament, amidst stiff resistance from the Rajapaksa-led Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the SLFP. He has also never publicly opined that he would run again for President.
Nevertheless, some of his loyalists have repeatedly made public announcements that President Sirisena would be the SLFP’s candidate for the 2020 Presidential election, the latest coming in the form of a newspaper interview by Minister Duminda Dissanayake. Dissanayake is also the General Secretary of the SLFP and is considered a close confidante of the President.
Thus far, President Sirisena has maintained a dignified silence regarding these statements but that has, in turn, fuelled speculation that he is not averse to the prospect. Others point out that the President is not in the habit of rushing and making statements to the media and his silence should not be construed as tacit acceptance.
In any event, for a presidential election not to be held in 2020, the Constitution will need to be amended or replaced by that time. This is a work in progress but its pace has been quite slow. The mainstream SLFP (or President Sirisena’s faction) and the UNP would need to agree on any such changes for it to have a realistic chance of passing through Parliament because only then would a two-thirds majority become viable.
In the current political atmosphere, when the relationship between the UNP and the SLFP is far from ideal, this cannot be taken for granted. It would only be natural for both parties and their parliamentarians to look at their own interests before committing themselves to any changes. Compounding the issue is the Rajapaksa-led Joint Opposition (JO). They are acutely aware that, as long as the current Constitution, with its Executive Presidency, is in force, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot run for the highest office in the land. However, if this is replaced with an Executive Prime Minister, there is no bar to Rajapaksa aspiring for that post.
For the Rajapaksa camp, it is, therefore, a tempting prospect to support the abolition of the Executive Presidency. However, the JO has historically opposed the dilution of executive powers arguing that it weakens the state and if it were to now do an about turn on that policy, it would raise many questions in the minds of the voting public.
As the SLFP struggles to come to terms with its own divisions, the UNP has a different problem. Arguably it is more united than it ever was in its recent history. It is certainly in a position of strength relative to the factional infighting in the SLFP. It also has fewer coalition partners to contend with, compared to the multitude of allies that constitute the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
Even so, it still has reason to be concerned. That is because its performance as a government has been below par, hamstrung as it is because it has to deal with the ideological demands of its left of the centre partner in the National Unity government, the SLFP.
With President Sirisena as the Executive President and some key ministries being retained with the SLFP, the UNP has not had a free rein in government. Some of its policies have run into heavy weather from their SLFP colleagues in Cabinet and at times, the chain of command in government has become blurred to such an extent that it has created the impression that no one is in charge.
Legacy from Rajapaksa era
The UNP has reason to be worried because, although the government is not entirely theirs, its lapses and mishaps are being debited to its account. A case in point is the controversy over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and the resultant ongoing tussle with the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA).
This issue is a legacy from the Rajapaksa era, UNP ministers argue but the UNP has its hands tied in dealing with it decisively because of several SLFP Ministers - Dayasiri Jayasekara and Susil Premajayantha among them - oppose SAITM. Yet, when there is negative fall-out, the public perception is that UNP Ministers dealing with the issue, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella have mishandled the crisis.
Thus, the UNP too would find it easier to run the government on its own but Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is alive to the political realities of the day. Moreover, he has his sights set on the more important question of constitutional reform which would come to a grinding halt if the UNP and the SLFP were to go their separate ways now.
What is clearer for the UNP is that it has to fight its own electoral battles, come election time. It will contest the Local Government and Provincial polls as one entity and the same holds true for the 2020 general elections and indeed even a presidential election if that ensues. In that sense, its task is much clearer than that of the SLFP which may well have split into two parties by then.
Still, for now, an uneasy calm prevails between the two major parties in the wake of President Maithripala Sirisena’s call for peace until the end of the year and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s prompt endorsement of this. Still, they say a week is a long time in politics- and there are many more weeks to come until the end of the year.
