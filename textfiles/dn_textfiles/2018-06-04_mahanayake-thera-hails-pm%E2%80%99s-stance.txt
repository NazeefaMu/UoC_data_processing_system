Mahanayake thera hails PM’s stance

Mahanayake of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Chapter Most Ven.Kotugoda Dhammavasa Thera highly appreciated the stance of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe not to comment on several internal and external issues, which are widely spoken of these days.
The Prime Minister’s behaviour in this regard is similar to the preachings of the Buddha’s Karaniya Metta Sutta. The Sutta paves the way for a person to be patient, intelligent and acting in accordance with the occasion.
The Thera said he hailed the Prime Minister’s stance in being patient and intelligent where necessary in future to take the country on its forward path.
