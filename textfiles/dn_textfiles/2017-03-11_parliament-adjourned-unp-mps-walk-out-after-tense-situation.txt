Parliament adjourned; UNP Mps walk out after tense situation

 Speaker Karu Jayasuriya adjourned Parliament yesterday at around 11.50 a.m. as the UNP members walked out of the House amidst a tense situation. This situation was created over the delay of the commencement of Public Business due to an opportunity given to Joint Opposition members to speak over making the National Freedom Front (NFF) an independent party in the House as well as assigning a member to represent the Joint Opposition in place of Dinesh Gunawardena who was suspended from attending Parliament sittings for a week.
Amidst the tense situation that prevailed in Parliament, the House was adjourned until 1 p.m.on March 21.
The tense situation was created when Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella objected to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for providing an opportunity for Joint Opposition members to speak in Parliament over making the NFF an independent party in the House and assigning a member of the Joint Opposition to represent its views in place of Joint Opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardena, who was suspended from attending sittings for a week.
When JO member Keheliya Rambukwella was speaking following JO members Chamal Rajapaksa, Wimal Weerawansa and Dullas Alahapperuma, Minister Lakshman Kiriella objected to allowing them to speak in Parliament stating that the Speaker had already given a ruling. He added that it was not fair to waste the time of the House as there were a lot of matters that the government had to take up.
“This is a matter that the Speaker had already given the ruling,” Minister Kiriella said. “When around two hours was allowed to be wasted every day for these members how could the government work?”
At this moment, the Joint Opposition members rose to their feet and began shouting to express their objection against Minister Kiriella. Several government members too join in creating a tense situation.
The Speaker said that the Joint Opposition members were not given opportunity to speak on these matters during the last three days. “I promised to allocate time during this week. Let them speak,” the Speaker said.
“But, the decision has been given already. We have to attend to the public business,” Minister Kiriella said. “There are Private Members Bills of our members to be moved”.
“I promised them to give time to express their grievances,” the Speaker said. “Lets give them five minutes. MP Rambukwella may continue his speech”.
Thereafter,MP Rambukwella continued amidst a chaootic situation with members of both sides shouting. However, when MP Rambukwella wound up his speech the Speaker announced the Public Business is commenced. By this time, the Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella, Chief Government Whip Minister Gayantha Karunathilake and MP Hector Appuhami were seen walking out of the House. Minister Karunathilake was seen gesturing to the UNP back
benches sitting on the other side of Parliament and around 10 UNP MPs including Heshan Vithanage, Kavinda Jayawardena, Arshu Marasinghe etc were seen walking out of the House.
UPFA government side members and TNA members were not seen in the House. JVP MP Anura Dissanayake remained in the House.
Amidst the din and chaos,sittings were suspended for 10 minutes. Thereafter, the Speaker announced the adjournment of Parliament until 1 p.m. on March 21.
The Joint Opposition members were seen standing and shouting slogans hailing the Speaker.
However, according to the Order Paper,sittings were scheduled from 10.30 am to 1 p.m. and from 1.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. An Adjournment Motion was scheduled to be moved at 1.30 p.m.
