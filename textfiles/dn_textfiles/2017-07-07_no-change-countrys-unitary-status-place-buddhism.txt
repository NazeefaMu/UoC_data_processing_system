No change to country's unitary status, place for Buddhism

President Maithripalala Srisena yesterday assured the Maha Nayaka Theras of the Three Chapters that the government will not bring any constitutional reforms that will disrupt the country’s unitary state or the place for Buddhism.
The President also informed the Maha Nayaka theras that there has been no new constitution drafted yet. Should there be a new draft Constitution it will be presented to the Mahahanayaka Theras and the leaders of the clergy of other religions for review before it will go to Parliament, he said. 
President Maithripala Sirisena said so during nearly two-hour long discussion held between him and the Mahanayaka Theras. A company of 22 bhikkhus were present with the Mahanayaka Theras, Most Ven Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala of the Malwatte Chapter, Most Ven Warakagoda Gnanarathana of the Asgiriya Chapter and Most Ven Napana Pemasiri of the Ramanna Chapter.
Also present at the discussion were Justice and Buddha Shasana Minister Wijedasa Rajapaksa, Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayaka and Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayaka.
President said the government is not going to ratify a new Constitution in a hurry.
The members of the Mahasangha handed over several letters to the President at the meeting . According to Asgiri Chapter Deputy Lekhadhikari Ven Naranpanawa, they included a letter informing the President that there is no need for a new Constitution at this point of time and that as per the need of the country they may amend electoral reforms.
