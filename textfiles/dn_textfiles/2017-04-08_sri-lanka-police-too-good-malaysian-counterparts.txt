Sri Lanka Police too good for Malaysian counterparts

For the first time in Kandy two Police teams were seen in action at rugby between Sri Lanka Police and Royal Malaysian Police. Playing a good game of run and pass rugby Sri Lanka Police did well to defeat Royal Malaysian Police by 51 points (5 goals, 2 tries and 2 penalties) to 3 (1 penalty) at Nittawela grounds yesterday. Sri Lanka Police dominated play in the first half and led 25-3.
Sri Lanka Police played a better game, their forwards combined well and they made every effort to see that their threes moved the ball. The halves combination worked well and gave the ball plenty of air. Both packs shared the scrums and the line outs and Sri Lanka police were good in their loose play. The Malaysian halves did not combine and the threes could not get going as they fumbled or delayed the passes. The local fullbacks impressed with his long kicks to touch.
For the winners Kasun Rajakaruna scored two tries and there was one each from Hashan Gomez, Iroshan Silva, Upala Edirisinghe, Danushka Edirisooriya and Udaya Sanjula. Sandesh Jayawickrema goaled three tries and two penalites and Priyankara Jayaratne goaled two tries. For the losers it was Faizal Zulfiki who put over the penalty.
The Malaysian Police team and the officials were seen at the Meeramacam Jumma Mosque at Friday prayers yesterday.
Before the game the two teams were introduced to Royal Malaysian Police IGP Tan Sri Dato Sri Khalid Bin Abu Bakar and the guest of honor was DIG Kandy Division Lalith Jayasinghe.
The second leg is on Sunday at Police Park. The winners will be presented the IPG trophy on the aggregate of points of the two games.
