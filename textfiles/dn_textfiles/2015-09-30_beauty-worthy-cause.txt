Beauty for a worthy cause!

The Winners of 'Miss and Mr Sri Lanka-Australia - 2014' beauty pageant, Shana Schokman and Malith Perera, and other participants organized a fundraiser at Clayton Hall, Melbourne, Australia, recently to support HelpAge Sri Lanka's (HASL) free Cataract Surgery Programme. The programme is currently held at the HASL Eye Hospital, Wellawatta, to restore the vision of the needy elders.

HelpAge Sri Lanka Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge, a special invitee at the fundraising campaign, thanked Miss Sri Lanka-Australia Ltd for donating the proceeds of the campaign for the worthy cause of restoring vision of the destitute elders in Sri Lanka.
HelpAge Eye care Hospital in Wellawatta, Colombo performs around 20 free cataract surgeries each day for needy senior citizens and also provide free spectacles and medicines through their mobile medical units across the island.
