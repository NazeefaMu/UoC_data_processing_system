Twitter launches  special emoji for  ‘Gold’

Twitter launched a special emoji for Bollywood star Akshay Kumar’s upcoming film ‘Gold’, which is scheduled to release on Independence Day. People will be able to tweet about the film with GoldMovie or #Gold2018 to use the specially designed emoji curated by Twitter.
The emoji appears next to the hashtag in the Tweet and is inspired by India’s first Olympic gold medal. It will be active until August 16.
Akshay plays the lead in the film, which also stars Mouni Mouni Roy, Kunal Kapoor, Amit Sadh, Vineet Kumar Singh and Sunny Kaushal in pivotal roles.
