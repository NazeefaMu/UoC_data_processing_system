The Sound of Music  cast at MLH

The cast of the famed theatrical Broadway “The Sound of Music” produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian were hosted for brunch at the Mount Lavinia Hotel. During their visit to the hotel, the cast members enjoyed a historical expedition of sorts. Members of the cast were enthralled by the rich history behind the hotel and were awed by the colonial splendor that the British Governor’s residence still possesses. Sea, sun and sand proved the perfect setting as they enjoyed a relaxing and refreshing dip in the mighty blue which was followed by a brunch spread especially crafted for the Sound of Music cast.
