Widows emerge from the shadows of shame

International Widows’ Day was observed on Friday June 23, this year. The United Nations ratified the day of action to address the “poverty and injustice faced by millions of widows and their dependents in many countries.”
For millions of women across the globe, becoming a widow marks the beginning of a life of unspeakable suffering and tragedy. For these women and their children, widowhood is not simply a change in marital status, but the end to economic, social, political, physical and emotional security.
Absent in statistics, unnoticed by researchers, neglected by national and local authorities and mostly overlooked by civil society organisations – the situation of widows is, in effect, invisible.
Yet abuse of widows and their children constitutes one of the most serious violations of human rights and obstacles to development today. Millions of the world’s widows endure extreme poverty, ostracism, violence, homelessness, ill health and discrimination in law and custom.
The first trauma
To give special recognition to the situation of widows of all ages and across regions and cultures, the UN General Assembly declared 23 June 2011 as the first-ever International Widows’ Day, to be celebrated annually. The theme for the 2017 observances is: ‘Never Alone’ - a reassuring mark of solidarity for this hapless segment of society and to share the spirit of hope and healing with as many widows as possible. It is a comforting thought that there are hosts of dedicated persons ready to assist this overlooked portion of the population by providing support, education, healing, caring, sharing and strength.
Once widowed, women in many countries often confront a denial of inheritance and land rights, degrading and life-threatening mourning and burial rites and other forms of widow abuse. Widows are often evicted from their homes and physically abused – some even killed – even by members of their own family. In many countries, a woman’s social status is inextricably linked to her husband’s, so that when her husband dies, a woman no longer has a place in society. To regain social status, widows are expected to marry one of their husband’s male relatives, sometimes unwillingly. For many, the loss of a husband is only the first trauma in a long-term ordeal.
In many countries, widowhood is stigmatized and seen as a source of shame. Widows are thought to be cursed in some cultures and are even associated with witchcraft. Such misconceptions can lead to widows being ostracized, abused and worse. Research by HelpAge International, for instance, has found that in Tanzania hundreds of older women – mostly widows – have been killed because of accusations of being witches.
The children of widows are often affected, both emotionally and economically. Widowed mothers, now supporting their families alone, are forced to withdraw children from school and to rely on their labour. Moreover, the daughters of widows may suffer multiple deprivations, increasing their vulnerability to abuse. Such cruelties are often seen as justified in terms of cultural or religious practice. Impunity for abuses of the rights of widows is rife, with few perpetrators ever successfully brought to justice. Even in countries where legal protection is more inclusive, widows can suffer social marginalization.
A severe impact
Across a wide spectrum of countries, religions and ethnic groups, a woman is left destitute when her husband dies. Poverty is often made worse by little or no access to credit or other economic resources, and by illiteracy or lack of education. Without education and training, widows cannot support themselves or their families.
Poor nutrition, inadequate shelter and vulnerability to violence, combined with a lack of access to health care, can have a severe impact on the physical and mental well-being of widows. The sexual and reproductive health needs of widows may go unaddressed, including the fact that widows are often the victims of rape.
They are particularly vulnerable in the context of HIV and AIDS. Women may be kept unaware of the cause of their husband’s AIDS-related death and made to undergo ritual cleansing through sex with male relatives regardless of HIV status. The economic insecurity stemming from widowhood also drives some women and girls to sex work.
They struggle to care for themselves and their children in their own countries, refugee camps or countries of asylum. In several post-conflict situations, high numbers of children depend on widowed mothers – often young women, sometimes children themselves – as their sole support. Widowed grandmothers are also left caring for orphaned and sick grandchildren. In countries coming out of conflict, such as Sri Lanka, they are vulnerable to ongoing exploitation and often experience further violence and discrimination in the post-conflict period. Mistreatment of widows can have a negative impact on investments in peace and security, feeding the cycle of poverty, breeding unrest and insecurity, and ultimately challenging democracy and sustainable security.
A self-employment programme
With reconciliation being high on its agenda, the Sri Lankan government launched an empowerment scheme for widows in the country and has extended the implementation of a self-employment programme to former members of militant groups. Of roughly about 900,000 widows in Sri Lanka, approximately more than 600,000 belong to the age group of 40 years and above. Even though exact details are not immediately available with regard to those who became widows in the wake of the 26-year-long armed conflict (1983-2009), a considerable number of widows is said to be belonging to this category.
The scheme now covers the widows in the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Vavuniya and Mullativu and Ampara, Trincomalee and Batticaloa , Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.
According to the 2012 Census, women are heading 23 per cent of 5.2 million households in the country. Their share in the overall population of about 20 million is around 51 per cent. A senior official in the Ministry of Women’s Affairs says that field officials of her department have identified the beneficiaries including those who are heading households.
The scheme has been inaugurated simultaneously in all the districts. Economically weaker sections will be targeted under the scheme. The focus will be more on awareness generation, improvement of skills and provision of technical assistance. Another decision taken by the government is to extend the self-employment programme, which has been in vogue since 2012.
The programme also covers those who were once involved in terrorist activities and who subsequently underwent rehabilitation. Soft loans are being provided to beneficiaries so that they can lead their lives in a dignified manner. Approximately, 2,500 persons have benefitted. The number of applications received is around 7,000 says an official source.
Healthcare, decent work, full participation in decision-making and public life, and lives free of violence and abuse, would give them a chance to build a secure life after bereavement.
Importantly, creating opportunities for widows can also help to protect their children and avoid the cycle of inter-generational poverty and deprivation.
International Widows Day is an opportunity for action towards achieving full rights and recognition for widows – too long invisible, uncounted and ignored.
