OMP to be ‘victim-centred’-- Saliya Pieris

Office of Missing Persons (OMP) Chairman President’s Counsel Saliya Pieris, in a fresh communiqué, stated that the OMP, unlike previous state mechanisms tasked to deal with disappearances, would be a permanent institution whose mandate would also include investigating and tracing.
“Given the magnitude of the problem and the complexity with respect to the multiple tasks required to search for the missing and ‘disappeared’, the OMP will function as a permanent office,” Pieris said. “Unlike previous state mechanisms, which were temporary in duration and served largely to document, the OMP would be a permanent institution tasked with investigating and tracing.”
He added that ‘victim-centredness’ would be the guiding principle for the operationalisation of the OMP. Referring to the OMP’s processes and structures, he said that the organisation would employ a consultative approach, speaking to victims and other stakeholders, whilst carefully considering key recommendations made to the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF). “It is important to recognise that the OMP is just one of the four institutions and one of multiple measures envisaged by the government to ensure reconciliation and lasting peace within our nation,” he said.
Reiterating the composition of the OMP, Pieris added that with seven members, the OMP represents a cross-section of society comprising individuals who are activists, public servants, professionals, a retired legal advisor to the Sri Lankan Army and a family member of a ‘disappeared’ individual.
Pieris said that with these new members, the OMP will be deeply committed to the welfare of all the victims of Sri Lanka’s conflicts and is conscious of the duties entrusted to it by Parliament.
The OMP will address the many cases of missing and ‘disappeared’ persons irrespective of ethnicity, religion and region. “The OMP will examine both civilians and combatants, including several thousand members of the Armed Forces, police and civil defence force, who have been identified as missing in action.”
