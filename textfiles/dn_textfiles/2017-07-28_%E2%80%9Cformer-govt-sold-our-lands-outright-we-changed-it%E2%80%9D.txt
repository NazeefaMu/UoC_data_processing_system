“Former Govt. sold our lands outright: We changed it”

President Maithripala Sirisena in a speech encompassing all issues that have been in public discourse said that a majority of the people should not be victimised due to the conspiracies of a few.
“It was the previous regime that sold our land outright, unlike any previous regime. 200 acres were sold outright for the port city project to a Chinese company.
It was after we assumed duties that we changed it to a lease agreement” he said. He further said that under his leadership “not an inch of the soil would be given to a foreign entity.
He pointed out that during that time, there were no protests or strikes against such action.
“Today everyone has the freedom and it is this freedom that is being misused by a few. We can’t let this few cause hardship to the majority” he said.
Speaking at an event in Ibbagamuwa, where the President declared open a centre for education resources at the Hameedia Muslim school, the President pointing out to the Petroleum Corporation said that the strikers have been completely misled.
“I was listening to some of the speeches made by the Trade Union leaders who led the strike. I was very disappointed to see how incompetent they are in understanding the issue.
The lack of information, lack of knowledge which resulted in the strike was alarming” he said. He further said that he made the order proclaiming Fuel Distribution an essential service,due to the severe hardship faced by the public.
He further said that he was willing to have an open discussion with any person, and reiterated that any issue could be resolved through dialogue.
“Today the doctors have made striking a game putting the lives of people in peril.
They seem to have no value for human life,” he said.
