Engine driver continues without compartments

The compartments of the Senkadagala Menike train from Kandy to Colombo got uncoupled from the engine near Pilimatalawa station and the driver of the train had driven the engine unaware for several kilometres before realizing the mishap.
Since the original engine of the train had malfunctioned due to a mechanical defeat, a new engine fixed had been pulling the train when the mishap occurred. The original engine was being taken to Colombo for repairs. The engine driver thereafter brought back the engine to Pilimatalawa for re-coupling and the train thereafter took off for Colombo without a hitch about half hour late.
The faulty engine which was being taken to Colombo had been de coupled and left at the Kadugannawa station.
A high ranking Railway official when contacted said they received information of the incident and the Superintendent of the main line has been assigned to investigate it.
