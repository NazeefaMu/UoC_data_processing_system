Handing over varsities to private sector: 'Proposal not even discussed'
The Government has not decided to hand over Colombo and Peradeniya Universities to the private sector by removing them from the University Grants Commission (UGC), Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament yesterday.
The minister made this clarification when JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayathissa queried the veracity of the news reports that the Government has proposed to make the Colombo and Peradeniya Universities “independent and profit making institutions,” by taking them off the UGC.
MP Jayathissa pointed out that the proposal had come out at a meeting of the Oversight Committee dealing with Higher Education and headed by UNP MP Prof Ashu Marasinghe.
“The oversight committee may discuss various proposals, but those do not reflect the Government policy. The Higher Education Ministry has not even discussed such a proposal,” the Minster explained.
Speaker, Leader of the House at loggerheads over question raised by MP Dinesh Gunawardena
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday, had a dispute with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that the question under the Standing Order 23 (2), which the latter permitted MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena to raise in Parliament, did not carry any national importance. The Leader of the House pointed out that Standing Order 23 (2) is clear enough that only matters of national importance could be raised under it. MP Gunawardena’s question was related to relocation of families whose lands were taken over for the construction of the Ampara Urban bus stop. MP Gunawardena said the people who were evicted to construct the bus stop, were residing in those lands since the commencement of the Gal Oya Development Board. He added that those families had faced severe inconveniences as alternative lands provided by the Government were far away.
Objecting at this point, Kiriella said, “The matter regarding the Ampara bus stop is not of national importance. Allowing the MP to raise it is a violation of Standing Orders. If this continues, one might also raise a question on the Ampara toilet under the same provision.”
MP Gunawardena replied that the Speaker had given permission to raise the question. Speaker Jayasuriya, while stating that he would take extra care hereafter before approving the statements, however allowed the MP to continue as it has already been listed in the agenda. Intervening at this point, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said, “The Speaker has been challenged by Kiriella. Standing Orders are interpreted by the Speaker and not by the Leader of the House.”
MP Gunawardena said he had to bring the attention of the House to the matter as the Urban Council does not function due to the delay in holding LG elections.
At this point, Kiriella was seen quipping at MP Gunawardena over the question.Joint Opposition MP Shriyani Wijewickrema could be heard shouting at Kiriella (without microphone) asking him not to make a mockery of people’s problems. UNP backbencher MP Heshan Withanage was heard retorting (without microphone), “then let’s cry from today,” to which MP Wijewickrama was quick to reply, “Yes, people have now been compelled to cry.”
Kiriella said the question would be referred to the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister for a reply at a future date.
