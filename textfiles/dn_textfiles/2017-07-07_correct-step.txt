A correct step

The move to amend parliament Standing Orders to change the criteria for the removal of a Chief Justice, Judges of the Supreme Court or the President or Judges of the Court of Appeal would be welcomed by both the legal fraternity and the public in general. The whole country was witness to the charade that passed off as an impeachment of former Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake by a so called Parliamentary Select Committee, specially handpicked to humiliate and heap calumny on the country's first, lady Chief Justice. The “honourable” members which comprised the Kangaroo Court, read Parliament Select Committee, treated Dr. Bandaranayake in the most undignified and crass manner when she was summoned before it to make her defence, even going so far as to cast aspersions on her personal integrity.
Not stopping at that, goons of government politicians even went to the extent of laying siege near the official residence of the CJ and blared the worst kind indignities that could be hurled at a lady, leave alone the country's first female Chief Justice, over loudspeakers. For the first time in the country's legal history a Supreme Court Judge was hooted at by hooligans hired by the government and blocked by armed police from entering the Court premises when Dr. Bandaranayake arrived at the ‘Temple of Justice’ to bid her farewells.
All because a judgement she delivered blocked a powerful minister of the ruling family from dipping his hands into the state coffers outside the laid down procedure. The judgement, naturally, evoked the wrath of the very top who did not lose time in ensuring that the country's Chief Justice was removed, post haste, through a manipulated process. Not just that. The ire of the powers that be extended even to the then President of the Court of Appeal who ruled that the removal of the CJ was flawed and calling into the question the whole process. The Judge who was next in line to be appointed to the Supreme Court, needless to say, was overlooked, forcing him into a premature retirement. He died, a sad and disillusioned man, shortly thereafter.
This is why the change in the parliamentary procedure governing the removal of Judges is to be welcomed. According to the amended Standing Orders (SO), a Parliament Select Committee will no longer sit in judgement of the judges. Instead, this task will now be entrusted to a panel of retired Judges, which, no doubt, will go through the whole gamut of the business and ensure that the procedure centred on natural justice, a feature which was observed in the breach in the case of Dr. Bandaranayake. Being one time Judges they could also be relied upon to base their judgement devoid of politics unlike in the case of a Parliament Select Committee comprised of politicians, with government MPs in the majority, that will render the outcome a foregone conclusion.
Under the new SO if a Judge is the subject of an investigation by a panel of inquiry, he or she shall have the right to appear before it and to be heard by such panel of inquiry in person or by representatives and to adduce oral or documentary evidence. In the case of Dr. Bandaranayake, all her representations were summarily thrown aside and instead she was virtually subjected to an inquisition by a group of uneducated and ill bred MPs who descended to the gutter. On the other hand the retired Judges who will form the inquiry panel will have the wherewithal to view things dispassionately and deliver a verdict that would be acceptable to all, if and when sitting Judges ever come before such a panel. The new procedure will also be a safeguard against future Heads of State manipulating the parliamentary process to get rid of a Judge not to his/ her liking. Judges too would take this as a salutary feature and preserve their independence to the hilt, since they can be assured that there will be no blow back as a result of judgements delivered by them offending any panjandrum of the state.
Not that the existing Standing Orders were not carefully thought out by their framers in the past. The fact remains that they came into existence in a different day and age when parliamentarians were a more cultured and educated lot who deserved the prefix “honourable”. These men and women, no doubt, would have been well capable of deciding the pros and cons of a case before them on their merits alone and could not have been swayed by parochial politics. What is more, their judgement on the matter would never have been called into question.
But times have changed and parliament today is not what it was several decades ago, with many of our MPs lacking in grey matter to make independent judgements, what with a whole crop of them not even passing their O/Ls and naturally given to uncouth behaviour. This was what we saw during the “trial” of former Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake where the Select Committee acted as judge, jury and executioner.
