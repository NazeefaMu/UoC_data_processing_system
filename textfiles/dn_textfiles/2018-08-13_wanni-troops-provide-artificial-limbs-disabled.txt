Wanni troops to provide artificial limbs for disabled

Security Force Headquarters – Wanni, extending its hand of friendship to physically-handicapped people in Madhu, Echchankulam and Nandankandal in the Vavuniya district recently began a project to supply 22 artificial limbs to the needy, on the recommendations of grama sevakas in these areas.
The project is to be launched with the sponsorship of the Centre for Handicapped in Kundasale, which has been supplying artificial limbs for a considerable period, at the request of the Army, under the direction of Security Forces - Wanni (SF-W) Commander Major General Kumudu Perera.
61 Division General Officer Commanding (GOC) Brigadier Jayampathi Thilakarathne organised the gathering of beneficiaries for the measurements for limbs, at the 613 Brigade Headquarters. A medical officer as well as a team from the Centre for Handicapped, including S.S. Attanayake, a specialist in prosthetics and orthotics, assisted. The first phase of the project was closely supervised by 613 Brigade Commander Colonel R.K.N.C. Jayawardene.
