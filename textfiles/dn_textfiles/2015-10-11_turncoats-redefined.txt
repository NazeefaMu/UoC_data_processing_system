Turncoats redefined

Lanka is going through a revolutionary change. One could say that it is a political revolution without any social change. Yes, that is correct; it is a political revolution within the capitalist mode of production. Such changes have occurred in the history and some times they have become earth shaking events.
When Hitler took over Germany, many expected a mild political change with Hitler playing a role similar to Bismarck. But things became more serious than that. Overthrow of Hitler became a world-wide problem. Here in Lanka we had to make a serious struggle to overthrow Mahinda’s fascistic regime. Now, after the political change country is facing the problem of ‘turncoats’.
Yes, even in Lanka, in a modern historical context “turncoat” is synonymous to, some extent at least, with the term “renegade”, a term of Christian origins having connection to deny God. In this democratic revolution too historical currents of great magnitude have caught masses of people, along with their leaders, in an impulse. In such a dire situation, new perspectives on past actions are laid bare and the question of personal loyalty becomes muddled. Almost unconsciously, one changes sides to play a new role cheating every body around. To the revolutionary who has passed the explosion very consciously, such people appear as clowns at first and then as harmful cheats. But a renegade is one who changes his principles or party; an apostate. We have to be careful; he may be very serious and sincere.
Political upheaval
We have to consider different situations; a defeat and subjugation or counter revolution were ruling ideology changes. A mass-shift in allegiance by a population may take place during military occupation, after a nation has been defeated in war or after a major political upheaval, such as military conspiracy.
Following the initial traumatic times many of the citizens of the domain in question, will quickly embrace the cause of the victors to benefit from the new system. This shift of allegiance is often done without much knowledge about the new order that is replacing the former one. In the face of fear and insecurity, the prime motive for a turncoat to draw away from former allegiances may be mere survival or to avoid harassment and ill-treatment. Often the leaders are the first to change loyalties, for they have had access to privileged information and are more aware of the hopelessness of the situation for their former cause. This is especially apparent in dictatorships and authoritarian states when most of the population has been fed propaganda and triumphalism and has been kept in the dark about important turns of events.
Historical events
In any case turncoat is a person who shifts allegiance from one loyalty or ideal to another, betraying or deserting an original cause by switching to the opposing side or party. In political and social history, this is distinct from being a traitor, as the switch mostly takes place under benefits and promotions from the new political order.
 
Lanka is going through such a situation. A mass-shift in allegiance by the population took place during the last period, after the national democratic upheaval; it was such a revolution. Following the initial traumatic times many of the citizens of the country embraced the programme of the victors to benefit from the new system. As time goes by, along with the embracing of life under the new circumstances comes a need of burying and rewriting the past by concealing evidence. The fear of the past coming to upset the newly found stability is always present in the mind of the turncoat. The past is rewritten and whitewashed to cover former deeds. When successful, this activity results in the distortion and falsification of historical events.
Unfortunately we could see such sad events around us. In particular new elements, turncoats join the entourage of main leaders displacing and pushing out those who assisted the leaders in the difficult times. Those new comers had to resort to revision, in order to cover their negative history.
Historical negationism is a form of historical revisionism that distorts the historical record for political, ideological, and cultural purposes. The English term negationism derives from the French phrase Le negationism, which identifies Holocaust denial as claims that the Holocaust did not occur, as understood by the public mind; hence, the term “negationism” identifies the distortion of history meant to deny the factual, documented reality. When Namal Rajapaksa told me what he experienced I had to think deeply about what could happen. We have to struggle to defend the revolution from frauds and opportunists.
