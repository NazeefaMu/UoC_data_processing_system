Lak FM raises awareness on sound pollution

Celebrating its 10th anniversary, the Lak FM radio channel launched an awareness programme on sound pollution caused by vehicle horns. It was launched on October 1 at Kiribathgoda and continued through Town Hall, Colpetty, Thunmulla and Battaramulla.
Lak FM staff conducted the programme for drivers while participating in a demonstration with placards, posters and handouts. Lak FM Chief Executive Officer Nalaka Sanath Kumara said that their Corporate Social Responsibility Eco-centric Programme promoted sustainability and people’s well-being.
“Lak FM has always been a media establishment that stood for the right cause, despite whatever obstacles it faced. We have always worked for the betterment of our society, ” he said.
“This endeavour is more worthwhile than distributing presents to celebrate our anniversary. This is aimed at lowering sound pollution as well as lessening the stress people undergo everyday while travelling,” Kumara said.
“But this program does not stop there. We are urging for an attitude change. I should pay special tribute to Lak FM Founder Attorney-at-law Wasantha Perera and Lak FM President Ashika Edirisinghe for the guidance they provide us with for this task,” he said, “Our staff, despite their busy schedules, as well as the inclement weather, has been dedicated to this cause.”
