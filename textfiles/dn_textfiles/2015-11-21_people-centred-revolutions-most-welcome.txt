People-centred revolutions, most welcome

Ranil explains in his speech on development: "Yet another challenge faced by us is the catastrophe facing the rural economy. The opportunities that existed for rural families and communities to make a successful living have been destroyed. Large and medium scale ventures that enriched the rural economy have been deactivated. We must urgently address this issue and take meaningful steps to develop the rural economy and attend to the problems faced by farmers by uplifting the rural economy within a short-term development framework. We plan to establish 2500 state rural development centres.
"This will be achieved through the grouping of many villages under one development centre. The centres will have access to fully equipped rural economic market units.
Agrarian revolution
"We will also strengthen and build the rural infrastructural facilities from the village roads, village tanks and the village fair, incorporating greater progress for rural economies through a Village Level Development Programme.
There will be funds set aside for this purpose from the budget. Large-scale agricultural enterprises in which farmers can be members will be established under the plan to develop the rural economy."
This shows the importance given to the agrarian revolution in the country. However we have to emphasize that rural economy include in addition to paddy production, other agricultural and rural activities. Large part of our fishing industry is in the rural areas with small fishers playing a substantial role. Potato growers and vegetable framers dominate certain areas of the upcountry. There are small industries and handicrafts that need the attention of those proposing the agrarian revolution.
In 1970 Sama Samajists gave serious attention to this problem. Some of them wanted powerful transformation of the rural society. They proposed strong rural authority in all localities to implement the programme. Such authority will help petty producer to continue production while opening links with the market. Also it will protect the property rights of producers.
However the United Front Government, which came to power in 1970, concentrated on selective administration, decentralization and the establishment of numerous local level institutions for bringing decision-making authority down to lower levels.
Decentralized planning and rural employment opportunities
The main feature of the new approach was much increased emphasis on decentralized planning and greater opportunities of rural employment. On this basis the first important step was the establishment of: a) District Development Councils (DDCs) at the district level comprised of Members of Parliament from the same district and the most senior level departmental officers of the district, with the Government Agent as the principal implementation officer. b) Divisional Development Councils (Div. DCs) at the divisional level (later at the electorate level) comprised of the Member of Parliament as the council chairperson, divisional level government officials and representatives of institutions such as village councils, cooperative societies, cultivation committees and people's committees. The functions assigned to these councils were formulation of development plans, identification of and coordination and monitoring of plan implementation.
Development process
The development thrust for which this organization structure was established came to be known mainly by the name of Divisional Development Council Programme, indicating that it was the divisional bodies which were considered as central to the operation. The councils were closely linked to the system of cooperative societies at the village level and to Agricultural Productivity Committees (APCs) at the divisional level under the Agricultural Productivity Law of 1972, comprising of farmer representatives and operated from the newly established Agrarian Service Centres; also to Cultivation Committees at the village level. In addition there were People's Committees at village level to sensitize and apply a check on government bureaucracy with a view to making the administration more responsive to the needs of the country and to the wishes of the people with the task of formulating and implementing national economic plans.
Theoretically, the above institutional framework thus established covering the three sub national levels, i.e. the district, division and the village, provided ample opportunities and a broad base for participation of all segments of the public in decision-making at all levels in the development process.
In reality, the enlistment of the Member of Parliament as the Chairman of the Divisional Development Council was but a formalization of already existing realities of the dominance of party politics in the councils. The Member of Parliament had all along played the key role in decision-making and the councils and committees had in addition become partly political instruments. Finally this became one of the main issues that intensified the clash between the Sama Samajists and SLFP populist bourgeoisie leaders.
We hope Ranil's agrarian matrix proposed will be truly democratic and will create thousands of democratic rural authorities where proletariat and petty bourgeoisie will discuss the development problem democratically! After all it was Lenin who proposed in his thesis on New Economic Policies in 1922 that they are proposing a state capitalist programme. World proletarian revolution is not off the corner; in the meantime we must continue the democratic revolution.
