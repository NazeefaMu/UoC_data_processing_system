Fight at Bogambara, a disgrace to rugby

A fight broke out between the players of Dharmaraja College, Kandy and St. Joseph’s College, Colombo during their Singer League Plate Trophy rugby match on Saturday at the Bogambara Stadium after a player received a yellow card.
The brawl which began on the field soon spilled over to the spectator stands. Ten people including rugby players were injured and were admitted to the Kandy Hospital. Dharmaraja players showed their dissent at the referee’s decisions several times during the match. An argument between players of two sides resulted in a fight.
Few Police personnel were also injured during the clash. Police took one person into custody and a coach of the Dharmaraja College is to be arrested. Investigations are continuing.
