Standard Chartered launches first Priority Tee Pass

A Global Golf Pass allowing you to play golf cash free and hassle free around the world
Standard Chartered together with GolfLan launched Sri Lanka’s first Priority Tee Pass for all its Priority Clients at the Royal Colombo Golf Club with a participation of its members. This membership pass enables the bank’s Priority Clients to access over 4000 golf courses across 40 plus countries around the world.
The Tee Pass Membership comes in three tiers; Bogey, Par and Birdie. Each tier requires a minimum deposit relationship with the bank, and this in turn results into the number of complimentary rounds of golf each member is entitled to within their respective membership. A member can easily make their reservation online and thereafter track the number of rounds they have utilised.
Standard Chartered understands that success comes with its complexities, as such the Priority Banking Relationship helps by bringing its clients easy, convenient digital banking solutions, along with a comprehensive range of wealth and insurance solutions, and global banking services coupled with exceptional service and rewards.
The key focus areas of Priority Banking with Standard Chartered include, protecting your family against the unexpected through privileged life and health insurance and retirement plans, priority banking rewards, growing your wealth via investment products, home equity loans and home loans for apartment funding and finally, making global banking simple via multi-country accounts and a globally linked international relationship team.
Commenting on the launch, Bingumal Thewarathanthri, Country Head of Retail Banking said, “We are pleased to be the first in Sri Lanka to offer this benefit to our Priority Clients as part of our priority proposition which also includes a host of unsurpassed privileges tailored to their unique taste and lifestyle. We are confident that our Priority customers will enjoy this.”
