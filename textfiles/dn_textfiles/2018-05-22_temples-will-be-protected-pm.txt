“It is necessary to protect the rural and urban temples. The government is committed to ensure the safety and security of the temples and other Buddhist sites in the country and to protect places of religious significance from any harm,” the Prime Minister said.
“Our lives become more complicated, but activities improving the spiritual development are gradually increasing under the temples.
Therefore, we must facilitate religious sites to develop our spiritual aspect,” the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said that when the country develops, followers of temples (Dayaka Sabhas) too flourish.
“Then Dayaka Sabhas donate more and more to meet the needs of the temples. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the government to uplift the religious sites,” he said.
