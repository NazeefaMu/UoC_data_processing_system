AIA Insurance’s premier customer initiative, AIA First Class, was launched recently at the Hilton Colombo. This is the first of many events organized for AIA First Class members and their families in recognition of the trust they have placed in AIA as their Life Insurance partner.
Reserved for AIA’s most exclusive customers, AIA First Class offers a host of benefits and superior service.  AIA Director Operations, Kelum Sennanayake said in this regard, “With a dedicated Relationship Officer providing personalised service, AIA First Class gives you priority service all the way. We understand that your life protection cover is very important to you and safeguards yourself and your loved ones against life’s unforeseen eventualities. This is why we provide every AIA First Class Customer with a dedicated Relationship Officer who will assist with all your life insurance policy related needs and will give you the care and attention you deserve in planning for your future. “
He added further, “Our Premier customers will get personalised attention to claim requests as well as prioritised contact centre assistance, in addition to a dedicated e-mail service for your policy /claim requirements that require an immediate response. There is also a dedicated customer portal where you can make enquiries and follow up on your policy information and you will also receive instant notifications via SMS.”
