How far have we come in fielding since 2015?

Three years ago Sri Lanka’s interim head coach Jerome Jayaratne labelled the national cricket team’s fielding standards as “the worst in Asia”.
To quote Jayaratne: “We are now the worst fielding side in Asia, we were never behind Pakistan but now we have gone behind them. India proved that they were better than us and even Bangladesh are fielding better than us.”
“Other than the bowling which is holding the team together, the batting, fielding and fitness has let us down,” Jayaratne said. “It's a lot to do with the fitness levels. The way our guys are fielding they are carrying excess weight and we are in shambles.”
The big question that needs to be asked now is how far have we improved in our fielding and catching since then. To be frank it’s not much.
The catching display that Sri Lanka put up in the one-off T20 international against England at the R Premadasa Stadium was one of their worst in recent times.
No team that spills three catches within the space of two overs in a T20 match can afford to finish on the winning side. The worst part is that all three catches were dropped off one batsman Jason Roy who went onto score a blazing half century – 69 off 36 balls to lay the foundation for England’s challenging total of 187-8. Had the first catch offered by Roy at 34 been taken England would have been four down at that stage for 65 runs in the ninth over and Sri Lanka who ended up with a total of 157 would not have been chasing 188, but something less than that and may have even won the contest. Roy was to receive further reprieves at 41 and 53 due to some butter-fingered catching.
One of the most talked about fielding lapses even today is the one that cost Sri Lanka a place in the ICC Champions Trophy semi-final in 2017 at Cardiff against Pakistan where they threw away a brilliant opportunity to defend a below par total of 236. Thisara Perera put down what could only be described as the simplest of chances given by Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed at mid-on off the luckless Lasith Malinga off whose bowling three chances were missed. Sarfraz then on 38 went onto score an unbeaten 61 and steer Pakistan to win the Champions trophy final against India after defeating hosts England in the semi-final.
“Looking at today’s performance, well, I thought we were pathetic once again. If we had held those catches, it would have been a different story, especially at very crucial times. First over, and towards the end, and where we let go of Sarfraz was very crucial. Being an international team well, I thought we’ve improved a little bit, but today was not really our day,” Mathews said at the post-match press conference when asked if Sri Lanka was the world’s worst fielding unit.
Sri Lanka’s fielding standards today are a far cry from a country whose fielding was rated one of the best in the world in the nineties and early 2000s. There is no doubt that fielding improves with confidence and confidence is built on victories which has been few and far between for the current team in the past two years where performances have sunk to a level that they have been unable to improve from their position of eighth rank in the ODI standings for more than a year.
Sri Lanka were lucky that they were not asked to qualify for the 2019 World Cup through a qualifying round for had that happened the chances of them coming through ahead of nations like West Indies Afghanistan and Zimbabwe would have been highly questionable.
That doubt has arisen not only from the fielding point of view but also from the batting aspect where legendary cricketers like Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan have been hard to replace. This has led to tinkering with the batting order from match to match which has made matters worse where the top order batters come for a match without knowing which position they are going to bat next. So much for building of confidence.
An emphasis was laid ahead of the recently concluded ODI series against England which Sri Lanka lost 3-1 that batting positions would remain untouched but injuries to players and bad weather forced changes to take place when overs were curtailed.
Consistency has not been part of the team’s genre for quite some time and unless they can achieve that they will always struggle to perform against top level sides. It is what the present side which is quite a young one, lacks. They were brilliant in their ground fielding but the catching left much to be desired. The good old saying that ‘Catches win matches’ still holds true to this day. Unless Sri Lanka can achieve a level of consistency in that area they will only be performing well in patches.
