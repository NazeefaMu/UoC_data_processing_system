Wales remains bottom of UK

Wales is once again least productive of the UK nations and regions, according to the latest figures on the economy. Regional gross value added (GVA) tables show that on average workers in Wales generated £19,899 per head.
GVA calculates the value of what we produce in terms of services we give and the things we make at work. The GVA in Wales grew by 2.7% in 2017 - slower than in Scotland, Northern Ireland and England. Average growth across the UK was 3%. BBC
