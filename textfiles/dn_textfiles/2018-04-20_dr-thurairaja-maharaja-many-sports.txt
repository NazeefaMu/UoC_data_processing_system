Dr. THURAIRAJA the maharaja of many sports

It goes like the saying finding a needle in a haystack. This axiom refers to none other than that sportsman of many parts to come out of the school at Reid Avenue ROYAL COLLEGE that produced not only illustrious academics, but all round sportsmen who don’t come that easy these days.
The 1960s, 1970s and ‘80s were the decade that popped a sportsman who had no equal in that era. It is a belief of some that sports and studies rarely click. But in the tall and likeable and unassuming stood out CHELLIAH THURAIRAJA an over 6 feet sporting genius who excelled not only in studies, but sports too. And add to all that he was a Gentleman par excellence.
To school mates at ROYAL and later UNIVERSITY he was a wonder, because while indulging in almost all the sports activities at school he also found the time to show his rare mettle and pass out from school to university from where he finally passed out as a doctor of medicine.
Grew in stature
To mention the spots he figured in school was rugby, cricket, badminton, tennis, basketball, football, athletics and boxing and later as his sporting stature grew he took to golf and becoming a champion came naturally to him.
In school his fellow sportsmen were surprised and unable believe the energy and the stamina he carried. To him success came naturally because he believed to be the best he must play and produce his best, then that success comes and that came naturally to the amazement of all.
THURAIRAJA today is the proud sportsman who has represented the country in four sports –rugby, basketball, badminton and golf.
He added the cream to his sporting career by being the only Sri Lankan and South East Asia to sport the country’s colours in two sports basketball and golf.
It is a feat that his school, University and the Sri Lanka Army that he joined and represented later could be proud about and admired as a sporting gift from god.
Getting to know Thurai
I got to know THURAIRAJA when I joined the ‘Times of Ceylon’ in 1961 as a sports reporter with basketball being one of the sports that I was designated to cover for the paper. At that time he was in the University and in that era when basketball was a craze.
As the years rolled by and with schools and clubs sprouting out and with the game played consistently at the various school courts, Police, Army courts and basketball of a high order was the rule.
Names of schools and clubs that come to mind and who contested the many tournaments were Old Bens, Old Petes, Old Joes and clubs Orients BC, Shamrocks and YMCA and the teams from the services Army and Police were outstanding.
Classy performers
In the University his team mates were classy performers in addition to THURAIRAJ were Rasalingam, Sriskandaja, Jesudhasan, Wilson and Ponnabalam.
At that time the Old Bens had some of the finest players the game seen and will never see again especially in Cosmas and Percy Perera.
Percy was such an excellent shooter that he was unanimously voted the ‘Best Shooter in Asia’ at the Asian Games in Bangkok in 1966 which was great honour to his school and country.
Then there were wonderful players in Matthew George, Rohan de Daluwatte, N. Amaradasa, Sam Lovell, Vijaya Silva, Milroy bde Silva, Edward Sumanasekera, Royden de Silva and Hilary White and may others whose names do not come to mind who took the basketball scene by storm.
University’s Sportsman of the Year’
In the university in the early 1960s he won the University 'Sportsman of the Year' award which was something he still treasures. In addition to his prowess in sport he was a talented 400 metre runner and did the triple jump. THURAIRAJA captained the national basketball team. In school rugby his captain was C.V. Gooneratne who later turned politician. He played in the 1961 Havelocks team that won the Clifford Cup which team was led by Hubert Aloysius. He also played international rugby against the Barbarians when playing for the Defence Services.
THURAIRAJA was very keen on Sports Medicine and during that stay at the wicket he put right sportsmen and women, some of whom suffered career threatening injuries and to the then Sports Minister and sportsman V. A. Sugathadasa that remains the Sports Medicine Unit.
Author of four manuals
Believe it or not THURAIRAJA authored four manuals in sports medicine. One was A text for all doctors who intend qualifying in sports medicine. He was a highly qualified Consultant Radiologist. He enlisted in the Sri Lanka Army Medical Corp in 1961 and rose to be the head of the Medical Corp and Director and then moved to become the Medical Advisor of the Army. He quit as a Major General in 1998.
THURAIRAJA also was Vice President of the Asian Federation of Sport Medicine and an ex.o member of the International Federation of Sports Medicine. While THURAI preferred to go to Royal his brother Chellaraja chose S.Thomas College where he shone with the bat and later he joined the Nondescrpt Cricket Club and scored heavily for them.
Getting wickets for Chellaraj
I had the distinction of playing for a Mercantile team against an Indian club team under Chellaraja's captaincy. I remember when the other bowlers were struggling to get the Indians out, he tossed the ball to me and 'win this game for me' I obliged with wickets. He graciously said to me “ Elmo your leg spin/googlies got even the Indians ‘Oogling! “
One other sportsman I remember who excelled in many sports while at St.Benedict’s College and was my captain in the 1957 cricket team was LOVELLYN RAYEN who played cricket, hockey, football, athletics, basketball and table tennis. He was a wonder in College.
Sportsmen and academics of the calibre of the soft speaking and like able THURAIRAJA are not born like batsmen making runs, they are god given gifts to the sport. Last year he received a President's award for his excellence and contribution to sport.
