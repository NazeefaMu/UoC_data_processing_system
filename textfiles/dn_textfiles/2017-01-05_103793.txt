Finding Space

Paradise Road Galleries will be holding an exhibition by Kingsley Gunatillake titled ‘Finding Space’ on January 5 from 6pm to 8pm at the Paradise Road Galleries.
Gunatillake states that everything seems to inspire him. “Even bitter, depressive experiences have given me strength and shown me direction. You can take ‘bitter-ness’ also as a ‘taste’, and then you will understand that taste is a very complex thing. So, I try to understand the complexity of small, mundane things through abstraction and in the abstract,” he said.
“Love, affection, sweet music, nature and wilderness, even window-shopping in the city, have inspired me. I think I have been affected and my art is shaped by associating and getting exposed to all kinds of other art forms,” he added.
