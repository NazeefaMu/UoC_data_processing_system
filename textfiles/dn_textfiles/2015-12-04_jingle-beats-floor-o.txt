Jingle Beats at Floor by O

Head over to Floor by O on Saturday December 5 and ring in the festive cheer! They've got together some of the hottest DJ's in the island for 'Jingle Beats', a night that's sure to be one of the biggest bashes of the year! With this awesome line up of DJ's they'll have guests rocking through the night as they spin the best tracks from the 80's right through to the chart toppers of today. What better way than this to start the first weekend of the festive season!
For those of you who were at their last couple of events featuring multiple DJ's, they need to thank you for the raving reviews after - the party people are the ones who've inspired them to have yet another event this time with four great DJ's to give party goers the best of variety.
Their line-up of DJ's includes some awesome talent with DJ Shiran Dias, Jasper D Jay, DJ Cool and DJ KC (resident DJ at Floor by O). As each DJ hits the console, one can be sure to have a roll out of some the best hits of the 90's, their favourite commercial hits with their catchy beat, pumped up EDM and more. From RNB to retro or funk to house music, one will be dancing it off all night long.
There's all that stuff one already loves about Floor by O too - great beverages and a fantastic food menu for when one gets the midnight munchies. Also, where else does one get the chance to revel in the party and stick around by the bar indoors or even take a break chilling out by the poolside. There's nowhere else in the city quite like Floor by O for a good night out!
See you on Saturday December 5 at Jingle Beats! Guys have to buy tickets and Rs.1000 from it is redeemable against their bill and Ladies (as always) walk in free. For more information call 0112674299 or 0779544422.
