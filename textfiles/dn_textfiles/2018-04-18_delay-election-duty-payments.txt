Delay in election duty payments

Provincial Council school teachers of Kurunegala and Puttalam districts had not received their payments for performing election duties during the recent Local Government polls, according to a school principal of a leading government school in Kurunegala, A. M. Ranaweera.
They had appealed to educational authorities to take immediate measures to make their payments at least at the outset of the second school term that would commence on April 23. However, K. M. Sugathadasa, a senior official attached to the Elections Department in Kurunegala told the Daily News on Monday that funds for payments were directed to the provincial departments a few weeks ago.
