Poems

 The lost village
Only in my dreams I see my village nowThe one I saw six decades agoWhere is the lane from the main roadTo the winding river at the village’s end?It’s been replaced by a carpeted roadWhich looks very busy during the day.Small houses with big gardens aroundIs a rare sight in my village now.Instead, we see clusters of cottagesSurrounded only by small lands.They are covered with potted plantsNot with the bushes and trees of the village.More than anything that I missIs the lovely breeze that blew through my villageRich with the scent of the village floraCooling and refreshing, how I loved it then!Hot winds which sweep through concrete floorsAre the ones that kiss the villagers now.

Long live our dear old school
Dear mother Princess after many decadesWhen I look back while passing your wayThe building is the same appearance not changedTears drop from cheeks will the building tooWhite uniform, tie, white socks and shoesSmartly we walked in with books in handSunshine or rain we never feltBoth were equal our bodies never fadeThe stairway is the same though now cannot climbWe used to hop, skip with two to three jumpsThe classroom is the same, same old windows and doorsChildren have changed the school is the sameThe yellow and red huge trees still bear flowersThe floor below is covered red and yellow petalsOn same petals, they walk on once we didThe drains and the roadway doth run the sameWe have grown old, but not you dear motherYou will live centuries without an end of lifeWe bid farewell at our journey to heavenYou weep for us, there standing – Princess

Fountains of the Moon
White creamy glowShimmer on earthHear all gurglesAs water runs slowOver barren rockOn soft moon earthAs Moon fairiesSing to the fountainsClear crystle sparklesWhite water flowThe small gleamy poolsWhere fairies sit aroundThe singing nymphs voiceMelodies of the MoonRivulets of water moveCold to the touchCascade over MountainsThe moon stays still

Hunger games
There I was sitting in my car - looking at the blue ocean.The Rising sun was bright - bringing with it the day's warmth.Here I wait - until my phone rang.To be of service - to my mum and dad.No breakfast - only the morning tea.Hungry I was - as hungry could be.Five-star hotels at my back - with all their glamour.Yes, I can afford - in this manner.My hand went to the car key - ready to ignite the engine.When a skinny little girl - knocked on my windshield.She wore an old shalwar - torn and soiled.Her hand was pointing at me - asking for kindness.Then she took her hand - towards her mouth.Indicating she's hungry - and whether I could help.Her lips were dry - and hair untidy.I rolled my shutter - and gave her a fifty.She thanked me - with a slender smile.And went off - and joined a group nearby.Five cars away from mine - was an ice cream truck.My eye's turned teary - with my heart pounding a touch.She held two ice creams - giving one to a smaller girlwho was holding on to her dress.There I was still - sitting in my car.The five-star hotels - still where they are.But my hunger left me - remarkable it was.Guilt and happiness were filling - and unstoppable it was.Look at our country's disparity - I thought to myself.I know it's normal - I know we all think the same.
