Works noteworthy

The 12th edition of Buddhist Literary Awards Festival came to pass under the patronage of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe at the BMICH recently.
Most Venerable Warakagoda Dhammasiddhi Sri Pagngnananda Gnanarathana Mahanayaka Thera chaired the event at the invitation of All Ceylon Buddhist Congress President Jagath Sumathipala. The festival was held in order to recognise the noteworthy Buddhist works published in 2017.
As Dr Praneeth Abhayasundara noted, the Buddhist writers have been much neglected over the recent history. Many literary festivals were introduced to recognise artistes of many disciplines, save for creative artistes of Buddhist works. The Buddhist Literary Awards Festival was initiated in 2007 to redress this predicament. A felicitation volume on Professor W S Karunathilaka was also launched to coincide with the event. The work is edited by Senior Professor R M W Rajapaksha, Professor G J S Wijesekara, Senior Lecturer Sudath Senarath, Senior Lecturer Kumudu Nayani Gamage and Lecturer Vindhya Weerawardena.
