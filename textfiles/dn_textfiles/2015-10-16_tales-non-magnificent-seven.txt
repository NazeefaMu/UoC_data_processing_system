Tales of (Non) Magnificent Seven

The Seven Samurai have entered the politics of Lanka. It is more likely that Opposition MPs Dinesh, Wimal, Udaya, Vasudeva, Dew, Tissa, and Gamini play the role of non-Magnificent Seven in the coming period. Of course they have made a heroic demand and urged the government to hold a referendum, to implement the UNHRC recommendations. They insist that the recommendations include a Hybrid Court to investigate war crimes allegations in Lanka. Apparently this strange Hybrid is hidden in the resolution without actually using the word hybrid. These people talk like pavement hawkers of Panchikawatta who insist what they are selling is the original; they will insist so, even before the company head that produces the item!

United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Wimal Weerawansa has said if the UNHRC approves the resolution, Sri Lankans should have the liberty to decide if they want any foreign involvement in solving internal issues. Of course Lankans have a choice and that could be a majority decision in Parliament. If the people feel they are fine with the UNHRC recommendations and if necessary a court with foreign judges and investigators can be included to probe alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka, then the government can go ahead with the proposals. However there is a warning that the "Magnificent Seven" may request the people to urge their MPs to vote against the Act to be tabled in parliament asking for the approval for the UN recommendations. They hope to win. If such sabotage is possible, then the state may go into crisis. We must thank them for revealing their sabotage strategy in time, for the progressive masses to take precautions!
US backed resolution on Lanka
Meanwhile, MP Udaya Gammanpila has said they were considering seeking legal advice on challenging the UN report in the Supreme Court. That is fantastic, because HR Commissioner has overlooked the fact that a democratic revolution had taken place in Lanka in the last period. Good to teach a lesson. MP Dinesh Gunawardena has urged the government to pull back from co-sponsoring the US backed resolution on Lanka and said if not the sovereignty and integrity of the country would be severely damaged. "Co-sponsoring a resolution is similar to writing one's own death certificate and is a bad precedent to other countries. This move has also put our allies in a difficult situation," he has said.
We have a funny combination in this cow boy group. Two ex Sama Samajists, one ex-Communist, other four are chauvinist of various kinds. So, the ideological pot of this group of cow boys is filled with a concoction that could be typical fascistic poison. Vasudeva Nanayakkara says the government decision to back the US-led resolution was a betrayal similar to the 1815 agreement signed with the British. "We all know the nature of the US. They just want to get closer to their prey," he has said. Yes, there is a similarity between 1815 and 2015. In 1815, people suffered under a violent Wadiga Raja and Kandyan people signed an agreement to get rid of royal violence. To day the Lankan people want to get rid of barbarism created by Mahinda raja. Hence Lankans signed an agreement with the UN. However there is a difference. Then the Kandyan lords trusted the vicious agents of British imperialism. Today, the UN represents the world community including the trusted friends of the cow boy group, China, Russia etc.
Finding war criminals
Still, UPFA Member of Parliament Dinesh Gunawardena slammed the proposed accountability of UN stating it will be a "witch-hunt against war heroes." We all know how the "war heroes" were treated by the Mahinda regime. General Fonseka could explain in great detail that treachery of the worst kind. However we are interested in finding the war criminals who acted with a fascistic vision of genocide and inhuman mentality. Mr. Gunawardena has said that the UN resolution on Lanka was a "clear violation of our constitution." Which Constitution may I ask? Dinesh still believes that the Mahinda Constitution is proper and valid. "Those who have been agitating for a separate state and supporting terrorism, are again at work," he warned. If people follow the direction given by this Magnificent Seven, then of course we may have to face a Tiger movement equipped with mini nuclear weapons in the future. Fortunately for Lanka, this Magnificent Seven is a non-starter.
