Consortium to invest Rs.130 million in Golden Care Residence for elderly

An Australian consortium with two Sri Lankan directors has invested Rs.130 million to build Golden Care Residence, to provide elderly care facilities and accommodation for Sri Lankans.
“Currently there’s a large population of Sri Lankans living and working overseas and not able to take care of their parents who live in Sri Lanka. Also the locals who are working full time are unable to provide care for their parents due to their hectic lifestyle and we are looking at targeting this segment,” Golden Care Residence Director Chaminda Sunnadeniya said.
“Our areas of expertise include aged care accommodation, aged care planning, general aged care services, dementia housing and respite care support.”
The investment is being made by three directors (one Sri Lankan and two dual citizens in Australia and Sri Lanka.”We have purchased an 85 acre land in Kaduwela to build a 25 room retirement village with parks and recreation centers and more, Company Director Bentley Barsenbach said. He said they will first open the Kaduwela Golden Care Residences in June and plan to open ten more centers elsewhere and will invest over Rs one billion for it.
“Due to smaller groups in each homes our residents will be able to get personalised care and a 24/7 CCTV monitoring system will be available.” “Each resident will be provided with a device to communicate with their loved ones via Skype, Facebook and Viber.””Doctors will be visiting the residence monthly for health checkups and clients will be registered with the Hemas hospital for ambulance and other services.” (SS)
