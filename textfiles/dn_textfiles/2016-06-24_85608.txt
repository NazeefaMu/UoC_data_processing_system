Ranjan undeterred

Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday said he is committed to bare the corrupt and fraudsters despite legal action being taken against him. He was responding to a statement made by former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage at a press conference that the latter would claim a compensation of Rs. 500 million from Ranjan Ramanayake as damages for making false charges against former Minister Aluthgamage. Ramanayake said that he has already received a number of letters of demands from various parties.
“I can appear in court with the details given by the wife of former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage”, he said.
