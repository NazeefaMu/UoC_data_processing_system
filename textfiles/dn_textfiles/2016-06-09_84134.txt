People will decide political future of SLFP minister: GL

The people will decide the political future of SLFP ministers in the government, if they oppose the no confidence motion moved against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, former External Affairs Minister Professor G. L. Peiris said.
He said that people will decide the political fate of SLFP ministers, if they do not support the no-confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
He said that the government has allocated Rs. 1,600 million to purchase luxury vehicles for the use of Ministers, Deputy and State Ministers, when funds are yet to be set apart for the people affected by floods and the explosion that took place at Salawa Army camp.
Speaking at a press conference at Dr. N. M. Perera Centre in Colombo, the former External Affairs Minister Professor Peiris said that the SLFP Ministers in the government have become a cat’s paw of the United National Party.
