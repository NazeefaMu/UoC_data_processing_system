Navy goes out favourites against Police

The game between Police Sports Club and Navy Sports Club will be a closely fought out battle for supremacy at Racecourse grounds, Reid Avenue today in their Dialog ‘A’ division inter-club Clifford Cup knock-out rugby opening quarter final game commencing 4:15pm.
The Navy outfit who have faced an unexpected plight losing some of their key players including winger Saliya Handapangoda yet recovering from injuries are bound to field a couple of sidelined players for today’s game.
However adding to the woes would be the absence of their two key players in captain cum flanker Danushka “Gertha” Perera and winger Supun Dilshan.
On the other hand the unpredictable Police lads, who nearly turned tables on the Army side, where they played a superb game in their last league outing at Police Park losing the game after a close fight by 43-36.
Hence they will have to come up with a similar performance if they hope to overcome the Navy side with victory to get into the semis.
Meanwhile Police skipper and prop forward Jayanga Silva faces another acid test while the Navy SC skipper Dulanjana Wijesinghe has fared admirably well with the resurgent force.
