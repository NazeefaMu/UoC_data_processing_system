CSSL commences  awareness program  for IT students

Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) has started an awareness program to educate IT Students which are studying at government and private high educational institutions for build up their professional path through joining the professional IT body and network in Sri Lanka.
CSSL is the body that represents all Information Technology (IT) professionals in Sri Lanka. Under the this awareness program CSSL recently conducted seminar and workshop for IT students of University of Colombo-School of Computing, SLIIT, ESOFT, University of Moratuwa, University of Kelaniya, University of Sri Jayawardenapura, NIBM and KDU.
As someone starts to study IT, they create an interest as well as a need to be part of the IT community, therefore CSSL’s belief is that one of the most important segments of its membership are the student members. In early part of 2017, the CSSL Executive Council took a strong decision considering this background that all IT students in Sri Lanka should be student members of CSSL.
This way, all future IT professionals will come under CSSL umbrella early on, and grow with CSSL and one day become associate members and then professional members, getting the value of being part of the IT professional network in Sri Lanka.
Students are studying at government and private educational institutions, and that is the source for student members. As the implementation strategy for the above strategic direction, CSSL started to work directly with universities to register student members in bulk. This usually involves CSSL council members and staff visiting universities directly, conducting workshops to educate them about the value of being part of the national professional network and also insights about the IT industry, its opportunities and trends.
At certain institutions, the CSSL has also registered all staff as associate/professional members during the same program.
As a result, in 2017, CSSL on boarded 1287 student members, and in 2018 over 1100 students. Most of these students are 3rd year or 4th year students, who are getting ready to come to the industry and this process also facilitates their natural progression to CSSL Associate membership in a couple of years.
CSSL President Yasas V. Abeywickrama wishes to thank the academia for their support in successfully executing this strategy. In particular he thanks University of Colombo - School of Computing, SLIIT, ESOFT, University of Moratuwa, University of Kelaniya, University of Sri Jayawardenapura, NIBM and KDU.
