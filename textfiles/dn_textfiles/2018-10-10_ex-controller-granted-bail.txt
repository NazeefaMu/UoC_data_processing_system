Ex-Controller granted bail

Former Import and Export Controller Mahagamage Gamini who was arrested for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs. 200,000 from a businessman, was yesterday released on bail by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday.
The Magistrate released him on Rs. 25,000 cash bail and two sureties of Rs. 1 million each. Mahagamage Gamini had allegedly solicited a bribe of Rs. 200,000 from a businessman in Weligama to provide a report containing recommendations necessary to import two vehicles from Japan, which are around 10 years old, through legal channels.
The bail was granted by the Magistrate after considering the mental condition of the accused’s daughter.
Earlier, the attorney-at-law appearing on behalf of the accused asked that his client be granted bail due to the serious health condition of his daughter. The Magistrate fixed the next hearing for January 18.
