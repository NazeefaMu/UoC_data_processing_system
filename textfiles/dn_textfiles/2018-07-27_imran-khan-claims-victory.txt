Imran Khan claims victory

Pakistan cricket legend turned opposition stalwart Imran Khan claimed victory yesterday in the country’s tense elections, following accusations of poll rigging by rival parties.
“We were successful and we were given a mandate,” Khan said during a live broadcast, adding there was “no politician victimisation” in the contest.
Results were still being tallied Thursday, hours after Khan’s supporters took to the streets to celebrate winning an election that opponents have said the powerful military rigged in his favour. A majority of 137 seats is needed to form a government. - AFP
