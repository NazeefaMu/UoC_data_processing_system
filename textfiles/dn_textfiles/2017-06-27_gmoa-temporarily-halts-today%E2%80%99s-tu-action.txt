GMOA temporarily halts today’s TU action

Following talks with Presidential Secretariat officials
 The Government Medical Officers’Association (GMOA) said they have decided to temporarily halt the trade union action planned for today following talks with officials of the Presidential Secretariat last evening, on a statement the latter issued regarding the SAITM issue on Sunday.
The GMOA which held a press conference around noon yesterday said the organisation was against certain clauses in the statement  issued by the Presidential Secretariat on Sunday which outlined the terms and conditions that the government will impose on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and private medical colleges in general.
GMOA Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge while describing last evening’s talks with officials at the Presidential Secretariat as positive said his organization was hopeful that the government will make the necessary amendments to the Sunday’s statement.
“The officials we spoke to at the Presidential Secretariat asked us to make a request from the President regarding necessary amendments to the statement.
Accordingly, we have made such a request from the President. We are hopeful of a positive outcome” he added.
However, Aluthge did not totally rule out trade union action again today and said the GMOA will make a decision depending on the response by the government.
