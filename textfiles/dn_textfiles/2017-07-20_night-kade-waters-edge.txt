Night Kade by Waters Edge

“Night Kade” by Waters Edge is the latest addition to the waterfront hotel’s truly international food offering. This one is purely for the satisfaction of those who crave Sri Lankan street food at the wee hours of the morning. The Night Kade will be open from July 21.
Open from 12 midnight to 5am Friday and Saturday and till 4am on all other days, the “Night Kade” will serve up traditional favourites such as mouth-watering kottu with a Waters Edge twist. The freshly-prepared endemic Sri Lankan dish is packed with home-made rotti, fresh seasonal vegetables, chunks of meat of your choice and of course the all-important gooey-cheese that keeps it all together.
And then there are the staples like kiribath, roast paan and string hoppers, egg rotti and parata served piping hot with chicken, fish, dhal or potatoes. All these meals come with complimentary and must-have pol sambol, kata sambol or seeni sambol.
Wash it all down with the good ol’ lime soda or an ice-cream cone if you dare. Every day at the stroke of midnight the BoardWalk and Bavarian Garden will be transformed to the Night Kade with seating under the stars. If you do choose to stay on till closing time then a glimpse of the rising sun just might be the perfect ending for an eventful night.
