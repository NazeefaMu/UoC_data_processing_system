Livelihood empowerment for Mahaweli farmers

The Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority (SLMA), on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena, has embarked on a three-year livelihood development plan in 10 Mahaweli zones.
Nearly 300,000 farmer families or a population of 1,203,000 will benefit from this programme. The 10 Mahaweli zones – Mahaweli B, C, D, G, and H, Udawalawe, Victoria, Kotmale, Huruluwewa and Rambukanoya consists of 47 divisions and 233 units.
According to the planning and regulatory section of the SLMA, in 2016, paddy was cultivated in 101,000 hectares in the country, out of which 15 percent was cultivated in Mahaweli zones.
The paddy production in Mahaweli areas has been 20 percent of the national paddy production.
Mahaweli farmers have contributed to the local rice requirement by providing 554,568 metric tons last year. It is learnt that the rice production in 2016 in Mahaweli zones has been adequate to meet the rice requirement of 23.8 percent of the country’s population, which was worth Rs. 32,000 million.
Under the three-year (2018–2020) development programme, the focus is on expansion of export crops, such as pepper, betel, cinnamon, arecanut, and cloves. The production of cow’s milk will be increased from 29 million litres to 32 million litres. Egg production is being enhanced to 150 million eggs. The freshwater fish production stands at 14,650 metric tons, to be increased to 17,000 mt.
Also, 10,000 low-income group families will be empowered to start small enterprises. In addition, 1,000 small and medium scale rising entrepreneurs would be encouraged to promote their business with incentives such as low-interest bank loan facilities.
According to the economists in the SLMA, the total capital investment under Mahaweli development programmes up to 2016 was Rs. 115 billion.
