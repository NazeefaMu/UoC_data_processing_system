Sri Lanka Tourism in positive territory despite unexpected challenges

There was a time when Sri Lanka had to employ many strategies to attract tourists to the island due to unsafe security situations. There were many cancellations every year due to sudden explosions on a regular basis. From 1983 upto 2009 the situation remained almost the same with tourism authorities not receiving the full value for their promotional efforts and money spent on promotion.
Since mid 2009 the picture turned rosy for the country with a basket of tourism products made available to the foreign travel agents and the Free Independent Travellers. All of a sudden Sri Lanka was positioned as a value added tourist destination in leisure circles. Since 2009, Sri Lanka embarked on a streamlined structure for tourism promotion and the country has reaped the benefits of the promotional drives, over a near decade. Many new international hotel chains initiated hotel projects in Sri Lanka with chains like Shangrila, Sheraton, Hyatt Regency and ITC to name a few. Sri Lanka became a much talked about tourist destination since we have a wide range of leisure products and travel packages for the genuine travelers.
Talking about the earnings from tourism we have now reached a level of a near US$ 4 billion from a mere US$ 500,000 platform before 2009. The arrivals have now passed the 2.1 million mark from around 350,000 in times of unsafe security situations. Hotel staff worked in fear expecting explosions anytime either inside the hotel or on the streets of major towns and this fear psychosis has gone away from the minds of hotel staff and also from the visiting hotel guests. Metal detectors and other sensitive security equipment greeted the guests on arrival at hotels. Tourism Authorities have worked tirelessly to make Sri Lanka Tourism a success story. Words of appreciation should go out to all parties connected to tourism from the hotel management staff, travel agents, diplomatic missions abroad, suppliers of food and beverage items, electronic and print media both here and abroad, airport staff, travel companies, guides and other support staff. All these parties joined hands with Sri Lanka Tourism to achieve the following objectives and goals for Sri Lanka.
* Becoming a major forex earner for the country from the industry
* Provision of a large number of direct and indirect employment to youth and others
* Remmittances from a large number of Sri Lankan hotel staff working abroad fortifying our foreign reserves
* Empowerment of rural folk especially in the fields of Agriculture, Horticulture, Fisheries, Livestock and other industries like rubber, coir and handloom industries
* Functioning as the Goodwill Ambassadors for Sri Lanka while holding travel promotions abroad or while participating in international travel exhibitions & other events
* Rural and urban poverty alleviation and raising of standards of living
* Engaging in social welfare measures through the CSR(corporate social responsibility) activities by the hotels, travel companies and the Tourism Authorities
* Improvement in literacy standards in rural areas especially to converse and communicate with the tourists visiting their respective areas,especially in English and other foreign languages.
* Promotion of SME sector to service the needs of the tourist industry
* Promotion of other forex earning avenues for SrI Lanka such as Exports, Foreign Direct Investments and Permanent Residency through the guests visiting Sri Lanka
* Selection of Sri Lanka by visiting guests for international events
* Attraction of International Non Governmental Organisations for setting up office in Sri Lanka
* Assistance to the national carrier throughout the year from bookings for travel
* Stock market promotion
* Income to restaurants, pubs and entertainment centers situated outside the hotels
* Higher taxes to the state
* Improvement of cash circulation in the country and rapid economic growth.
There are other tangible and intangible benefits to the country and the public at large directly resulting from the promotion of tourism. Over the years, the average monthly income of the hotel staff and management has increased substantially and this has increased their savings level and created demand for consumer & capital goods. A major drawback for the industry is the brain drain of senior staff who pursue higher studies, foreign employment and also settling down abroad with the educational requirements of their children. Therefore, a continuous stream of educated, trained and experienced staff cadres be ensured by the State/Private hotel schools in the country. Ready assistance be provided by the state for this purpose. The forex earnings from Tourism has in a big way assisted with the cause of meeting the trade deficit of the country.
The development of new and attractive tourism products is a major challenge for the industry. The success of the industry depends very much on value addition by creating new and contemporary tourism products taking advantage of the great many opportunities the country possesses and its geographical location. There are many hitherto untapped areas to take Sri Lanka to its next level in the field of international tourism.
Now let us look at the provisional figures for top ten countries in terms of tourist arrivals for calendar year 2017.
COUNTRY ARRIVALS
INDIA 384,628
P.R. CHINA 268,952
U.K. 201,879
GERMANY 130,227
FRANCE 97,282
AUSTRALIA 81,281
MALDIVES 67,452
RUSSIA 59,191
U.S.A. 57,479
NETHERLANDS 51,148
The total number of arrivals for 2017 was 2,116,407. In comparison with 2016, the highest percentage increase came from Netherlands with an increase of 23.6% in arrivals for 2017.
The year 2018 started on a promising note with an overall increase of 12.6% for January 2018 in comparison to 2017 January. With India leading the way with a 40% increase, followed by Australia (22.6%) and Germany (20.2%). However, Chinese market needs new strategies for arrival augmentation.
Arrival improvements
Improvements could be designed on following lines with different strategies for different markets.
* Health Tourism
* Adventure Tourism
* Sports Tourism
* MICE Tourism
* Shopping festivals
* Trade and Export Fairs
* Special winter and Pre-winter tours
* Off season special promotions
* Discounted fares by National carrier
* Regional Promotions SAARC, BIMSTEC, ASEAN, EUROPEAN and MIDDLE EASTERN, PACIFIC RIM.
11. Religious and Cultural tours
Starting afresh for 2018, the market survey reports from our diplomatic missions will go a long way towards designing both off season and seasonal strategies for different markets in different countries. The visitors always seek “Value For Money Spent” for any type of holiday and utmost safety.
We can embark on special promotions based on superior products of Sri Lanka such as Apparels, Gems and Jewellery. It was reported in print media recently that Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth showing one of her necklaces made of gem stones of Sri Lankan origin. Our Apparels also draw the attention of customers worldwide. Further, we have large blocks of land in the outstations with scenic surroundings ideally suited for Golfing and other sports. Most Golf resorts over the world have Guests with extended stays. The Tourism Authorities should engage in joint promotions with Export Development Board, Board Of Investment and even with Colombo Stock Exchange also for joint marketing strategies.
The ingredients and tourist destinations we have are much attractive than some of the countries in Asia. The visitors can move from one climatic condition in Sri Lanka to another within a few hours by road. Even former US Ambassador to Sri Lanka James Spain selected Sri Lanka as his second home after retirement. Famous science fiction Author Arthur C Clarke was permanently residing in SrI Lanka for a very long time. Sri Lanka is not short of premium destinations for extended holidays. This type of extended holidays are the need of high net worth foreign nationals. Another area would be to attract the “legendary tourism” netting in higher earnings. In the past ex Beatle Sir Paul McCartney had an extended stay in the south at an exotic location. Indian cricketer and former captain Rahul Dravid had his honeymoon in an exclusive plantation resort by the name of Hunas Falls Hotel with panoramic surroundings and exclusive facilities. Very recently Bollywood film idols Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh had an exclusive visit to the island. The high net worth/ledgendary tourists are quite willing to come to Sri Lanka provided they have the utmost privacy, top security and facilities in the top bracket. Our travel agents should create many such locations in almost all parts of the country for this type of visitors to have a wider choice. Such tourists need very personalized attention from their arrival at the airport until their departure.
The travel companies and the regional hotel associations should initiate travel clubs in different countries through social media networks and by organizing fruitful events abroad so that they can enjoy continued business throughout the year from the members of these travel clubs. The members would feel very much at home by coming to Sri Lanka for holidays at discounted room tariff rates and possibly with lower air fares from our national carrier. These travel clubs will form long term alliances with Sri Lanka and will visit Sri Lanka in times of emergency and natural calamities in their own country. Specialisation of their food/beverage by the hotels will add to the scheme as a plus point. However, there are a few matters of utmost importance which should be addressed by the state as improvement/remedial measures for any type of visitor. Some of them are:
* Improvement of the Colombo Airport
* Improvement of facilities at places like Sigiriya, especially the toilets and issuing of tickets
* Exploitation of FIT visitors by persons posing as tour guides
* Improvement of road safety measures when visiting outstation resorts and places of interest
* Improvement of facilities at the Colombo zoo with value additions
* Assistance and proper guidance in visiting the places of religious worship
* Identification of religious places of worship belonging to all four major religions practiced in Sri Lanka and development of same for visits by tourists from many more countries.
* More infrastructure developments such as highways, railway lines (especially the up country railway) and provision of electricity, sanitary facilities and clean water at every tourist destination
* Control of fast spreading epidemics which can cause sudden tour cancellations
* Appointment of beach cleaning staff for every beach resort, working from 6 am to 8 a.m. daily to ensure safe and clean beaches for every tourist
* Commencement of a news programme telecast in a number of major world languages especially in French, German, Chinese, Hindi and Russian in addition to English for 5 to 10 minutes weekly highlighting the special events in Sri Lanka in the late evening hours followed by a repeat telecast in the early morning so that the visitors will take interest in visiting many places in Sri Lanka as they will get first hand information on such places & events and will develop an interest to visit such places possibly by extension of their stay.
* Tackling of traffic problems should be looked into by the Tourism Authorities in close coordination with traffic police at least during the tourist season as tourists will not like delays in their travel time and will create a big impression on the tourism in the country.
* A Traffic police unit should also be created in major tourist locations who can converse in different languages. This will create a sense of belongingness on the part of tourists visiting such prime places of tourist interest.
* A centre to learn the playing of traditional local musical instruments especially originated from up country. I have seen many visiting tourists practice and play the Lankan traditional music as a group and they love to carry photographs and video footages of such performances.
* A Re-commencement of the “Foster Parents Scheme” which existed in the late eighties and early nineties could be relaunched with the participation of the foreign tourists. I am sure this scheme will be a major success with the likelihood of participating tourists becoming repeat guests to this paradise isle of Sri Lanka.
A tourism promotional matrix be compiled based on current and past experiences taking into consideration the sensitiveness and behavioural patterns of different overseas markets. A Benchmark Analysis will also prove useful with a sensitivity Analysis for changes in positive and favourable factors affecting tourism.
