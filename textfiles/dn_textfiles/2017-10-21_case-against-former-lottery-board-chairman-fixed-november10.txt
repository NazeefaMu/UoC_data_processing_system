Case against former Lottery Board chairman fixed for November10

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday fixed for November 10 to deliver its order regarding objections raised by former Development Lottery Board (DLB) Chairman Dr. Chandrawansa Pathiraja over the charge sheet filed against him for allegedly causing loss of Rs.23 million.
This is when awarding promotional activities pertaining to several lottery tickets to three private companies contrary to the accepted tender procedure.
When the cases came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, parties had filed their written submissions regarding the objections raised by defence over prosecution’s attempt to amend the charge sheets during the trial.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against the former DLB chairman under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Commission further alleged that the former Chairman had awarded promotional activities to the private companies between November 2014 and December 2014 in violation of the law.
Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.
