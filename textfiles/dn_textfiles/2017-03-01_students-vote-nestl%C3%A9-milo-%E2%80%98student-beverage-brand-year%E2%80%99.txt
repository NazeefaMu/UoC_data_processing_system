Students vote Nestlé Milo ‘Student Beverage Brand of the Year’

Popular beverage brand Milo, endorsed by Sri Lankan Cricket Captain Angelo Mathews, was voted once again by Sri Lankan students as the ‘Student Beverage Brand of the Year’ for 2016.
This is the third consecutive year Milo has won the award, signifying the strong trust Sri Lankan consumers have in the quality of the product.
The win was awarded on the results of a survey conducted amongst 9,000 schoolchildren in the Western Province, inspired by D.S. Senanayake College for the Annual D.S. Student Brand Awards.
“Milo believes in encouraging kids to optimize their potential with the brand’s core promise of providing nutrition and energy. Milo has also been actively participating in sponsorships of school sports and events where the brand has helped kids to showcase their talents both locally and internationally,” said Norman Kannangara, Vice President Beverages for Nestlé Lanka.
“To be voted by a large number of students as the ‘Student Beverage Brand of the Year’ for the third consecutive time is an indication of the brand’s continuous efforts to provide children with the nourishment, energy and encouragement they need to be at their best. This recognition demonstrates the trust and confidence our consumers have in Milo, a brand that has leveraged global technical expertise from the world’s largest R&D network of any food company.”
Food safety and quality has always been Nestlé’s number one priority. MiloRTD (Ready-To-Drink) goes through an UHT (Ultra-high temperature) process, making sure its consumers receive a product that retains the nutritional benefits of milk.
The final product goes through product hygiene, food safety and quality checks at each stage of its manufacturing and storage processes, including testing in its own and external laboratories, before reaching its consumers.
Made from the freshest and high quality milk, collected from 21,000 Sri Lankan dairy farmers, Milo RTD offers the golden goodness of malt and cocoa from the finest cocoa beans, to give thatgreat chocolate malt taste. It is manufactured at Nestlé’s state-of-the-art factory in Kurunegala, upholding the high quality standards Nestlé is renowned for across the world.
