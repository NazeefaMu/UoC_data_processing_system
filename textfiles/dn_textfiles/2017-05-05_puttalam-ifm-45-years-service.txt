Puttalam IFM:  45 years in service

The Puttalam IFM Pre-school should be honoured for providing preliminary education continuously in the past 45 years and creating many volunteers engaged in social services in Puttalam, North Western Provincial Councillor N.T.M. Thahir said.
He was addressing a ceremony to provide sets of furniture to the Puttalam IFM Pre-school as the chief guest of the occasion on April 27 at the school.
While the Provincial Councillor was providing sets of furniture to the school, Puttalam Urban Council Former Member and Puttalam IFM pre-school past pupil S.R.M.Muhsi provided gift packs to its kids.
The ceremony was held under the patronage of the school In-charge M.S.F. Roosi. The Provincial Councillor said pre-schools lay the foundation for students' high achievements in higher studies. Therefore, adequate salaries will be provided to pre-school teachers by the Provincial Councils to appreciate their service.
"Those who are providing motivational payments to rural pre-schools of Pradhesiya Sabhas, should come forward to provide similar service to the urban pre-schools.
"Operating a pre-school for 45 years is not easy. We are ready to provide resources to this pre-school. Initially, I have allocated Rs. 25,000," he said.
He said the IFM Pre-school was started on January 4, 1972 when Puttalam lacked even a single pre-school. This year, it has stepped into its 45th anniversary.
Puttalam Urban Council Former Member S.R.M.Muhsi, Puttalam Grand Masjid Administrative Head P.M.Abdul Janaf, pre-school past student and Puttalam E-soft Institute CEO A.K.M.Afras, businessmen S.H.M.Riswan, M.S.M.Nasmeer and many others participated.
