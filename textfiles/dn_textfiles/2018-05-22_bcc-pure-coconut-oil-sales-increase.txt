BCC pure coconut oil sales increase

Pure coconut oil produced by the BCC Ltd has recorded a sharp increase in sales since 2016.
The income from sales in 2017 had recorded almost a 60 percent increase, BCC Ltd Chairman Sarath Abeysinghe said.
This is a result of the countrywide extension of the company sales network and widening the dealer network through Lak Sathosa, Keells, Arpico and Laugfs sales outlets, said BCC Ltd Acting Marketing Manager P.A. Jayatilleke.
He said that on the direction of State Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella, the company had planned to set up another modern oil mill to satisfy the increased demand for the company’s oil products.
