Businessman held in five-year-old murder case

Kalutara Division Law Enforcement Unit, on the instructions of Kalutara District DIG Ranmal Kodituwakku, arrested a businessman and his employee on Friday (21) in connection with a murder committed in September 2013 in the Molkava Bogahena area in the Bulathsinhala Police area.
Kurudukarage Sirisena (52) was murdered with a club while he was fishing at the Kukuleganga bank.
Sirisena had fallen into the river after the assault. A fisherman had seen the incident. The assailant had then aimed a gun at the fisherman and threatened him with death if he told anyone of the murder.
Later, police conducted investigations and recovered the body, which was taken to the Nagoda Hospital for autopsy, which confirmed that the death was due to shock and hemorrhage following an assault.
A verdict of homicide was returned by the Mathugama Magistrate who held the magisterial inquiry into the death.
Bulathsinhala Police who conducted the investigations into the murder of Sirisena were unable to arrest the suspect responsible for the crime. The investigations were then handed over to the Kalutara Division Law Enforcement Unit. Officials conducted investigations over the last two years and arrested the fisherman who had witnessed the murder.
Police arrested the businessman and his employee based on the statement of the fisherman. They were produced before the Mathugama Magistrate and remanded pending a full investigation.
