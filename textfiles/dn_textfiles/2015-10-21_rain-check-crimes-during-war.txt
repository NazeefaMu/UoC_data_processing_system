Rain check on crimes during war

“This report is a call to Sri Lankans of all communities to examine their history and take control of their present; to acknowledge the degeneration of the country and its democratic institutions, to demand justice for the crimes that have been committed in the name of fighting terrorism or securing Eelam, and to declare “never again.” - UTHR(J) Special Report No: 34 , December 13, 2009.
Wars are crimes. No less, no more. Holy wars and just wars included. We have had huge debates and much beating of chests over this topic since 2012.
If an eye witness who walks through vehicles lying and or stopped bumper to bumper on both sides of a road characterized as a high way to hell with dead people within the vehicles, a man now aged fifty nine carrying shards of shrapnel even now, loses his wife and four children, with the eldest being nineteen in one incident in a bunker, a young woman with two infants loses consciousness whilst breast feeding her child because she is hit by shrapnel and is hospitalised for seven months in Anuradhapura Hospital with the child she breast fed dying on the spot unknown to her, if a woman of twenty nine whose husband and brother were members of the LTTE do not come back home, if a man survives with two children whilst losing one leg and the wife dying, a young boy stops schooling before his O’L’s since the parents die to take care of two younger girl siblings, we seem to have examples of a human toll due to war. Crimes or otherwise.
Domestic process for reconciliation
A passage from UTHR(J) from the publication cited earlier says, “On 8th February the Army had entered Iruddumadu and was on the doorstep of Suthanthirapuram. Satheeshkumar was a 35 prisoner on a non-political charge. Intelligence chiefs Pottu Amman and Kapil Amman came to Tango Ten. The prisoners pleaded with them to be freed. After discussing among themselves, Pottu Amman decided to free all those arrested on non-political charges not dealing with security. The remaining 140 were to be executed. This group included members of rival Tamil parties, especially the EPDP, and Sinhalese and Muslims detained over allegations of security connections. Satheeshkumar said that they were killed and burnt in the nearby jungle (Source: UTHR(J) Special Report No: 34 - December 13, 2009).
When this piece is published Parliament would have debated the contents of the Reports commonly known as those by Justices Udalagama and Paranagama respectively. We could likely see an all - party conversation on what would be best seen as a domestic mechanism.
Irrespective of the outcomes this piece presents some thoughts.
The domestic process for reconciliation and accountability looks at truth and compassion, the missing, reparation and prosecution. In the name of freedom, Tamil youth bearing arms killed and maimed those they considered their foes. The state armed with emergency and legislative powers emanating from the Prevention of Terrorism Act acted to suppress violent dissent equally if not more ferociously violently with all resources in their armoury. Preceding this era, flawed policies and select practices of the State drove youth to bear arms. We are now counting and accounting for the toll.
Our inability to find consensus widened the mistrust amongst key segments of society resulting in an internationalized issue. While Law may assist to come to conclusions, the political spectrum has equal responsibility as UTHR(J ) has stated to “to examine their history and take control of their present”. It requires painful introspection. Uncovering the truth in term of political responsibility would imply all parties acknowledging their share of the responsibility for what happened, learning from the lessons of the past and moving forward to a durable process of peace and reconciliation.
Sepala Ekanayake case
We are currently faced with a situation where a credible domestic process has to be instituted. It must though take into account the work of preceding commissions of inquiry.
Our Constitution has an interesting passage in Chapter III focused on Fundamental Rights. It states in section (6) “No person shall be held guilty of an offence on account of any act or omission which did not, at the time of such act or omission, constitute such an offence, and no penalty shall be imposed for any offence more severe than the penalty in force at the time such offence was committed.”
It goes onto state - “Nothing in this Article shall prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by the community of nations.”
This section of our Constitution has been tested and interpreted. It was in the Sepala Ekanayake case of hijacking an aircraft belonging to Alitalia. His action forced the government of Sri Lanka to pass retrospective legislation to take legal action against him. He was the first person to be tried under Act No. 24 of 1982 certified on July 26,1982. Ekanayake committed this offence between June 29 and July 1, 1982. At that time there was no legislation to prosecute Ekanayake for the crime he committed. Every nation is expected to have passed domestic law based on the Hague and the Montreal Conventions ratified in 1987 by 131 nations. The main purpose of the Hague and Montreal Conventions is to curb the alarming menace of hijacking of airplanes. Sri Lanka was compelled to give effect to these conventions after Ekanayake hijacked the Alitalian aircraft. The Sri Lanka Parliament passed the Offences Against Aircraft Act and created room for Ekanayake to be tried in court. The international community was anxious that Parliament passed the Act with retrospective effect from 1978. It was an assurance that Ekanayake’s criminal activates would not go unpunished. The Offences Against Aircraft Act of 1982 was decreed to be law from 1978 and incorporated the relevant provisions of the Hague Convention.
This was the first case in Sri Lanka where legal proceedings were, for the lack of local laws, resorted to on the basis of international law. A pronouncement was made that skyjacking an aircraft was an international crime and was an offence under international customary law. In preference to extraditing a local hero for trial in Italy, Parliament on July 26, 1982 passed a law making skyjacking an offence with retroactive effect. This was made possible by an ambiguity in Fundamental Rights legislation. The article concerned on FR was qualified by: “Nothing in this article shall prejudice the trial or punishment of a person for any act or omission which at the time it was committed was criminal according to the general principles of law recommended by the community of nations”. A passage quoted earlier. Hence it seems we are bound by international customary law so interpreted by our Courts even in the absence of crimes codified in domestic law in this instance against hijacking an aircraft or now those pertaining to crimes of the order referred in UN resolutions since 2012.
It would thus seem we have judicial interpretation and precedence linking international customary law, our Constitution and the meaning of the reference to general principles of law recommended by the community of nations.
Special courts
As we move forward whilst benches can be constituted to sit in special courts including potentially to sit on site in scores of locations within geographically demarcated areas in the theatre of past conflict, the crimes to be investigated need to be framed. In pursuing the gathering of facts the special courts could seek the assistance of, if not commission experts both local and foreign to gather facts and present to Court. Likewise where matters of the missing, or presentation of the truth is required leading to compassion or restitution there is nothing to prevent hybrid fact finding groups to work in unison.
The focus must always be on victims of the war. As Desmond Tutu in The Book of Forgiving: The Fourfold Path for Healing Ourselves and Our World says, “The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen.” We need such people to lead us in all the elements constituting our domestic process.
