NRC project to provide safe drinking water for dry zone, NCP

Peradeniya University Professor Rohana Chandrajith said that over 3 million people in dry zone particularly in the North Central Province and it is bordering regions are at an acute water stress.
The proposed National Research Council of Sri Lanka (NRC) project hopes to provide a total solution of safe water in the dry zone selecting a model village as per the UN sustainable development goals of provision of safe water by 2030.
All project deliverables will build on firm scientific foundations as applied towards solving this problem, Prof. Chandrajith said addressing a media briefing held at the NRC premises yesterday .
"More than 300 paddy and garden soils were analysed for their chemical constitutes.The results showed the involvement of heavy metal for the onset of disease is very minimal as contents are extremely low in drinking water and soil. The effect of possible toxicological parameters on kidney cells is being tested under the laboratory conditions using cell lines,he said.
Prof. Chandrajith said the model water treatment plant is now operational at the Rajarata University.Presently the treated water is being used by the university community.The aim of this activity is to provide a robust water treatment facility to a village. After optimizing the conditions, a model treatment facility will be provided to a village this year. Our researchers will not conduct any research in the villages.They will be done at the university or national laboratories. At the same time, the villagers are not involved in plant operation. It will be carried out by university professionals in the field. However, villagers are responsible for safe guarding the water source against contamination.
In Sri Lanka, 90%of the urban population has access to safe pipe water and 60% of the rural population has access to protected well water. The rest depend on unclean water with no monitoring and protection and about 75% of the rural domestic water supply needs are met from groundwater by means of dug wells and tube wells.
As a result, some elements that are geogenic in origin has markedly affected the health of the rural population. Among the chemicals that are geogenic in origin, fluoride takes the center stage as it is the main suspected offender for the Chronic Kidney Disease of known etiology (CKDu). Additionally, existence of higher levels of calcium and magnesium found in these areas are also recognized as geogenic in origin. It has been estimated that during the past two decades there are deaths of 22,000 people from CKD in the North Central province and at least 5 to 6 out of 100 people are currently affected. And about 5% of the annual health budget is spent on the management of CKD patients as they need more dialysis machines and other equipment and services.
The high levels of nitrates in the wet zone of Sri Lanka has been attributed to several reasons of which geochemical origin being the main emphasis. According to published data, amount of metal contaminants of the Kelani river water is higher that the levels recommended by the World Health Organisation. In addition, most of the surface water urban areas is polluted due to dumping of domestic waste, sewage and industrial effluents. It has also been recorded that many parts of the Jaffna district and Gampola area,domestic water is heavily polluted with E-coli and other bacterial species. Out of 25 districts, 15 districts are clearly affected due to contaminants in drinking water.
From these data it is apparent that the amount of water population in the country is significant and the ultimate result of this predicament is deteriorating health condition of the populace which is also going to affect the country's economy.Therefore, it is important to develop a simple and easy to use water purification system particularly for rural areas. As far as the water treatment methods in Sri Lanka are concerned, disinfection, partial treatment, full treatment to advanced treatment is already in place. Of these methods, the point of use water treatment can be identified as the best technique that can be adopted in rural areas as it is simple and easy to operative.Therefore, in this project we have focused on developing water purification systems to remove both chemical and biological contaminants, based on advanced materials to provide the rural community with a low cost and effective point of use water filters which request no electricity.
