During the visit, the First Secretary declared open a Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society Sales Outlet. It will provide resettled communities’ with dry rations and grocery items at a nominal price.
The village secretariat in Palaly North was opened and it will provide government services under one roof. The dredging work of the Boat Access Way and the landing site for the fishermen at Palaly North were also commenced. Knut Nyfløt stated, “Norway has a long-standing development co-operation with Sri Lanka. A major part of this support has been extended through UNDP to enhance the livelihood opportunities of the affected communities.
It is very important for people to return to their original places and re-established their lives and therefore, the Norwegian Government remains committed to support livelihood activities whilst promoting the resettlement process.
So far we have supported between 1,100 and 1,400 households in the newly released areas in Tellipalai, Vallalai, Palaly Sampur, and Trincomalee”.
Mohamed Muzain said, “the UNDP would like to see that the returned families are making best use sustaining the livelihood assistance provided through the Government of Norway. As a key development partner working for five decades in Sri Lanka and beyond, UNDP remains committed to assist the people of Sri Lanka to achieve sustainable human development”. The UNDP Sri Lanka works with resettled communities in Jaffna with funding assistance from the Royal Norwegian Embassy to uplift their livelihoods and revive the local economy in the area. The project also enhances access to government services whilst strengthening community organisations and networks.
