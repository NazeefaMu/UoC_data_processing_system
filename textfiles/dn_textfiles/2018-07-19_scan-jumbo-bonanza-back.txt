Scan Jumbo Bonanza is back

Scan Jumbo Peanuts is to relaunch ‘Scan Jumbo Bonanza’ consumer promotion. Hundred winners will receive the all new folding bicycles following the completion of this year’s promotion.
This is the 5th consecutive year of the ‘Scan Jumbo Bonanza’, the promotion which commenced in June will go on until August. The hip and trendy folding bicycles are much sought after due to the ease of transport and storage capacity they offer. The bikes can easily be carried into buildings and public transportation mediums, and stored away easily in compact areas. The Scan Jumbo Bonanza is active throughout 64 days and covers 120 towns across the island.
“We have seen the success of the “Scan Jumbo Bonanza” over the past 4 years. It has encouraged us to continue the campaign as a valuable reward to our consumers, who have been loyal to the brand through the years. In the past, we have awarded valuable gifts such as home theatre systems, which have been much appreciated by the customers.
We hope to continue with similar campaigns that help us take the brand closer to them,” stated Aruna Senanayake, the Manager of Marketing at Scan products.
