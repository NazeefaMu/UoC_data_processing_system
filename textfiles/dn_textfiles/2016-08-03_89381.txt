Maize to be imported to produce animal fodder

The Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living has decided to permit import of maize to manufacture animal food as a remedial measure to prevent soaring production cost of chicken.
The decision was taken after discussions the Committee held under the patronage of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Finance Ministry yesterday. Stocks of maize hoarded by middlemen will be bought at Rs.52.50 per kilogram through Lak Sathosa.
They will be sold to fodder manufacturers at a concessionary price of Rs.45 per kilogram. The Finance Ministry will incur the loss of Rs.7.50 per kilogram caused due to providing maize at a lower rate.
The Agricultural Ministry was instructed to provide permits to animal food producers who have obtained recommendations from the Animal Food Production and Health Department to enable the fodder manufacturers to import 75,000 metric tons of maize.
The Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living instructed the authorities to import the permitted stocks of maize before the next season of maize harvesting.
Sri Lanka annually needs 400,000 metric tons of fodder. About 250,000 metric tons out of this is locally manufactured while the balance 150,000 metric tons should be imported. The first stock for this year’s requirement will be imported following the decision by the Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living.
The Sub Committee on Cost of Living discussed the market situation after the maximum prices of essential consumer items were imposed recently. It was revealed that raids have been carried out to apprehend traders who violate government ruling and sell goods at higher prices. About 1,019 unscrupulous traders have been brought to book by the authorities.
