Priyanka or Katrina for 'Krrish' ?

Rakesh Roshan has already announced his plans to release his Indian superhero film ‘Krrish 4’ in December 2020. Sr Roshan and Hrithik Roshan have also selected a script for the same. Now, according to latest reports, the makers are considering Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif to play the female lead of the film. A source reveals that Priyanka’s character is already there in the film and there is no need to make any changes. However, if the makers bring any other actress on board, the script might need some modifications. Also, the makers can accommodate two actresses in the film, like in the last film of the franchise where both Priyanka and Kangana Ranaut were seen in pivotal roles.
Priyanka has worked with Jr Roshan in the superhero franchise while Katrina was paired opposite him in ‘Zindagi Milegi Naa Dobara’. Last year, Katrina had refuted the reports of being approached for ‘Krrish 4’ while suggesting that the franchise should also have a superheroine part in it. TNN
