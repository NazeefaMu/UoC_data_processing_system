Touch of transcendent beauty

Landscaping can be divided into soft landscaping features and hard landscaping features. In the previous two articles we discussed soft landscaping. This article explores hard landscaping features which are important in bringing out the beauty in a garden. Green Thumbs features Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor K. N. K. Jayathilake who touched on water gardens and statues.
“To create hard landscaping features, we have to use building materials where the skill, creativity and ingenuity of the creator matter. For this stone, gravel, bricks, sand, concrete, timber and metal are used. To create sculptures stone, metal, glass, pottery and wood carvings are used. Right throughout history people have used sculptures in their gardens as an expression of their innermost selves and desires,” said Jayathilake.
Ancient Sculptures
Sources tell us the Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece. The Greeks were famous for their sculptures of gods and goddesses. The statue of Nike ((c.190 BC), the Greek goddess of victory, is one of the few remaining Hellenistic sculptures that is a Greek original.
The Terracotta Army (210–209 BC) discovered in 1974 (out of which one of them is the most famous statues in history) is an enormous legion of clay statues of soldiers buried in three massive pits near the tomb of Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China, who died in 210 BC. They were meant to protect him in the afterlife. These statues are an expression of the human psyche expressed in building materials similar to statues in gardens.
In Sri Lanka a good example is Geoffrey Bawa’s garden which was filled with statues that expressed his inner-self. Meanwhile, artists such as Isamu Noguchi, David Smith, Alexander Calder, Jean Tinguely, Richard Lippold, George Rickey, Louise Bourgeois, and Louise Nevelson defined the look of modern sculptor.
“These structures need to be appropriate for the place and perfect for the garden, because soft landscaping and hard landscaping must be used together in such a way that brings beauty to the garden and enhances the natural look. If the positioning is wrong and soft landscaping features and hard landscaping features combine in a way that does not make the garden look beautiful then there might come a situation where the entire garden will need to be altered costing you time, money and giving you a sense of frustration,” said Jayathilake.
Water Gardens
This is especially true when it comes to creating water gardens. Water has been intrinsic to human life. It is the life giver and the Greeks even designated a god – Poseidon to show the importance of water. Indeed it has been revered through history.
“We are naturally attracted to water. It gives us pleasure and is soothing to the mind. The rhythm of the flowing water is so relaxing and soothing giving you supreme mental satisfaction. The plants and fish swimming in the pond bring out the power of mother nature,” stated Jayathilake.
There are four types of water gardens – waterfalls, water streams, ponds and fountains. All these must be positioned in place that is suitable to the garden because some ponds and fountains cannot be easily removed and shifted. Some waterfalls can be used indoors and can be created using stone, concrete and fiber glass. Some are built to be a permanent feature in the garden. That is why the Hard Landscaping features need to be positioned correctly. However if you take fiber glass waterfalls, you can move them wherever you want. They can be purchased from the market.
A collection of sculpture in a garden setting can be called a sculpture garden. Research findings reveal the oldest known collection of human constructions is a Neanderthal “sculpture garden” unearthed in Bruniquel Cave in France in 1990. An ice hotel is a temporary hotel made up of snow and sculpted blocks of ice. These hotels can be found in Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Romania, Sweden and Switzerland. It is logical to assume that the ice sculptures will be located in these hotels.
Garden designer, Rev David Coles stated – “A good garden design, while being on the one hand a “serious discipline” should embody a “playful creative mindfulness”. He postulated that successful garden designs enable transcendence from a physical sensory experience to a mindful awareness of being interconnected with nature.

TIPS FOR CREATING PONDS AND STATUES
* Remember to keep the statues in places where the sunlight is able to interact with it creating lighting effects – light and shade.
* Must take into account the size and width of the water fall and the pond beneath it. Pond must be in proportion to the waterfall. There is a submersible pump to recycle the water. If the pond is too small and the water flow from the waterfall is too strong that would create problems for the pump and also for the area near the pond.
* The shape of the pond also needs to be taken into consideration. It has to be very similar to a pond you get in a forest area or village. If it is round or square then it make the pond look artificial.
* The sound of the water also needs to be pleasing. On the waterfall you need to position stones so the water will run around it creating that gushing, soothing and sweet noise. This all gives someone the effect of naturalness.
* There should be trees in the background.
* In the water ponds having plants really adds to the value. The beauty they bring is truly pleasing. Eg - Blue Water Lily, Water Lily, Lotus and Pistia.
* In the waterfall itself you can include water loving ornamental plants. Eg- ferns. Around the water pond as well you can include ornamental plants.
* Hanging plants can be fitted into the waterfall.
* Garden Lights can be used in the night creating that ethereal effect when the light dances atop water. A shimmering and beautiful way nature is expressed.
* Ornamental fish can be used.
