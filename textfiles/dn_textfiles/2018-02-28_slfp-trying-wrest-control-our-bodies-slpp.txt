SLFP trying to wrest control of our bodies - SLPP

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party is attempting to wrest control of some local government bodies won by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) by forging an alliance with the UNP, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said yesterday.
Addressing a press conference of the Joint Opposition group at the N.M.Perera memorial center at Borella, Allahapperuma said the SLFP General Secretary was behind an attempt to form an administration in 76 LG bodies jointly with the UNP.
He said although the SLPP has won all these LG bodies the party has narrowly failed to obtain an absolute working majority.
Alahapperuma also blamed the new calculating system at the LG polls to nominate candidates which he described was the reason for SLPP not obtaining a workable majority at some councils which it has won with a clear majority of votes.
He said that the Joint Opposition will seek legal redress for this anomaly and will soon file a case in court.However, Alahapperuma said out of the 76 LG bodies in question the SLPP was confident of obtaining a working majority in 36 bodies with the help of other parties and independent groups supporting it.
