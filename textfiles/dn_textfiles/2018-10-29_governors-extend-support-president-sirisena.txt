Governors extend support to President Sirisena

The Governors of all the nine provinces, after a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena, have unanimously decided to extend their fullest support to the new government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The Governors, addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, said as President Sirisena’s representatives to the respective provinces, they would be with the President on any decision taken by him for the betterment of the country.
Addressing the media, Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara said the political instability that prevailed in the country, continuous depreciation of the rupee, recently revealed assassination plot on the President, and the scope of private and public sector investments that prevented foreign investment into the country were the causes for this new change in the country’s political arena.
Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama said he agreed on the decision taken by President Sirisena as the head of the country, government, and the Cabinet of Ministers and would extend his fullest support on behalf of the people of the Eastern Province.
He said this decision, which is constitutional, was taken by the President at a time when the country was becoming unstable.
Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray in his remarks said the National Unity Government had led the country towards an unstable and anarchical era. It also failed to protect their slogan of ‘anti-corruption’ while they were in power. Therefore, he said that he believed this new initiative would be the beginning of a stable era in the country.
North Western Province Governor K.C. Logeswaran said the decision by the President was based on a number of issues that came up during the previous regime. He said he recently found that the powers given to local government bodies in his Province had been completely derogated and that situation would not arise in the future.
Sabaragamuwa Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake said she expected that the newly appointed Prime Minister would work for the betterment of the country, people, race and the religion during his tenure.
The North Central, Central, Uva, and Southern Province Governors also expressed their views at this press conference.
Answering the questions raised by the journalists, Governor Nanayakkara said that the appointment of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister is a very clear process and is constitutional. But, some lawyers can express ideas according to their political or personal opinion.
He said adjourning Parliament till November 16 was due to two reasons. One is the new government has to get ready for a Vote on Account in the Parliament. The other is to appoint the Secretaries to the new Ministries, and to appoint the heads and board of directors to public sector institutions and the banks. “Therefore, anyone can show the House that they have the majority in the Parliament even on November 16,” the Governor said.
