Former Deputy Minister gets four years RI

Former Anuradhapura District MP and Deputy Minister Shantha Bandara was yesterday sentenced to four years rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.
This is for soliciting and accepting a bribe of Rs. 50,000 as a gratuity to provide employment to a woman in the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) in 2007.
Delivering his judgment, High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe observed that the prosecution has proved the accused’s guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on two counts.
The accused was arrested by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption between November and December 2007 while soliciting and accepting a gratuity of Rs 50,000 from a woman, a resident of Ampara.
The former Deputy Minister was further ordered to pay a fine of Rs.10,000 on two counts.
