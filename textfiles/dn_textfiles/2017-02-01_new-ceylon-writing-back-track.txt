New Ceylon Writing back in track

New Ceylon Writing (volume 6) is now available online for everyone seriously inclined towards the literary arts of contemporary Sri Lanka. First published in 1970, the journal enjoyed a 15-year run during which five volumes were produced by its founding editors Drs Yasmine Gooneratne and Merlin Pieris, who were then teaching English Literature and Western Classics at the University of Peradeniya, Kandy.
Returning in December 2016, the journal’s editors hope that it will contribute towards reviving the literary culture of Sri Lanka, which suffered severe damage during the 30-year war that followed the events of 1983.
New Ceylon Writing is now repackaged vibrantly with a new ‘hansa’ logo. Readers may download the full journal for free by visiting its new website: www.newceylonwriting.com. To keep up with its journey and to engage with its editors, ‘like’ New Ceylon Writing’s Facebook page: www.facebook.com/newceylonwriting.
The editors are also accessible via email: [email protected].
