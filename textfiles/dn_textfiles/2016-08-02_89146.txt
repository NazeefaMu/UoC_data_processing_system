‘Beauty and the Beast’ is just the ticket after ‘Colony’

Here in a suite in the Corinthia Hotel in central London is Emma Watson. She is here to discuss her latest project, a thriller set in a cult in Chile during the Pinochet dictatorship. It shouts “serious cinema”, another step in the carefully curated career of the girl known to the world as Hermione Granger in the ‘Harry Potter’ films. There are absolutely no owls in this cast.
Watson is now a woman of many parts: a UN goodwill ambassador, a founder of the equality campaign HeForShe and a feminist book club, and a model for Burberry and Lancome. She recently has been inducted into the Oscar voting academy, and also has been rock-solid in her support for the black actress playing the grown-up Hermione on the West End stage in ‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child’.
She has been on the big screen for 15 years, yet she is only 25. I realise that I have interviewed her three times, watching her grow up in public from a fuzzy-edged teenager into a sleek, sophisticated cog in the movie-making machine.
In ‘The Colony’, set in 1973, Watson plays Lena, an air stewardess who goes undercover to join the cult and find her German boyfriend Daniel (Daniel Bruhl, star of Rush and Inglourious Basterds), who has been kidnapped.
Watson’s previous post-‘Potter’ films, such as ‘My Week With Marilyn’, ‘The Perks of Being a Wallflower’ and ‘The Bling Ring’, were decidedly lighter in tone — or sillier if we include ‘Noah’ and the comedy-disaster ‘This is the End’.
“We’re definitely not in rom-com territory with ‘The Colony’ — not that there’s anything wrong with rom-coms,” she says of the film, which made just $81 in its opening weekend in Britain earlier this month. “But it’s pretty dark material. It was a really interesting paradigm switch — the fact that I got to play a girl who rescues a boy.
