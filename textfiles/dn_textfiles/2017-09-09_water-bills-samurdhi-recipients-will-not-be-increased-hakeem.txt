Water bills of Samurdhi recipients will not be increased: Hakeem

"Water bills of Samudhi recipients will not be increased. The revision of tariff for the first 15 units will be minimum," Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday. He said the present tariff of water has a issue and the Government should take a decision on that.
He said a date was not given to add revisions to water bills.
Minister Hakeem pointed out that the customer pays only one fourth of the total expenditure of producing one unit of water and pipe-borne water is provided for 47.7 percent of the people in the country. :It will increase by 60 or 65 percent in the next three years," he said.
"Supermarkets charge Rs 60 for a bottle of water but the Water Board charges only Rs. 12 for 1,000 litres of purified drinking water.
The Board expects to produce bottled drinking water in future, he said.
