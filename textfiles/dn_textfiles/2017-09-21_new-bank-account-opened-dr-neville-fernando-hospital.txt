New bank account opened for Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital

 
A new bank account has been opened for Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital with the approval of the Health Ministry, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara said in a statement.
In his statement Dr. Bandara has said that all funds allocated by the Health Ministry to Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital will be deposited in this new account.
The Teaching Hospital will continue to bear Dr. Neville Fernando ‘s name only as an appreciation for his donation and not to indicate it’s ownership, he said.
The main objective of releasing this statement is preventing the people from getting a wrong idea about the account after hearing certain statements made by some politicians, Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
The only difference between this hospital and the Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital is that Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital does not charge money from any patient for any treatment.
All services will be conducted free of charge, he said in his statement.
