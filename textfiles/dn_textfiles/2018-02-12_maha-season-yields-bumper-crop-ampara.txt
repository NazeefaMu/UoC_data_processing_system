Maha season yields bumper crop in Ampara

Harvesting for the Maha season is in full swing in the Ampara District in areas such as Nintavur, Sammanthurai, Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai, Vangamem and Irakkamem.
This year saw a bumper harvest of 120-135 bushels of paddy per acre. Many farmers cultivated red rice this season.
The price of one bag of paddy is Rs. 2,500 and is expected to increase. Farmers are happy that their produce can be sold at the guaranteed price. But some rice mill owners are reducing the price as those areas experienced little rain.
Many hectares were brought under paddy cultivation in the Ampara District for the Maha season this year. Farmers want to complete harvesting before the rains begin.
