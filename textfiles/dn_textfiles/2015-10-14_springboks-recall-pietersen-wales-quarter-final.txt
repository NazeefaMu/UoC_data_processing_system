Springboks recall Pietersen for Wales quarter-final

South Africa have recalled experienced wing JP Pietersen for their World Cup quarter-final against Wales at Twickenham on Saturday.
Pietersen -- who scored a hat-trick against Samoa -- is the only change to the starting team that beat the United States 64-0 in the Springboks' final Pool B match, at London's Olympic Stadium last week.
The 63-times capped Pietersen has recovered from a knee injury and takes over from Lwazi Mvovo.
Bryan Habana, who needs one more try to break both New Zealand star Jonah Lomu's World Cup record of 15 tries will revert to the left wing against Wales.
Veteran lock Victor Matfield was again left out because of a hamstring injury, with Eben Etzebeth and Lodewyk de Jager in the second row.
South Africa suffered a shock 34-32 loss to Japan in their opening match of this tournament but recovered to top Pool B.
"It made sense to reunite Bryan and JP on the wing as it brings a lot of experience to our backline, which has been doing well despite the relative inexperience of Handre Pollard, Damian de Allende and Jesse Kriel," said South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer after naming his side on Wednesday.
South Africa's bench showed four changes from the USA match, with Adriaan Strauss, Jannie du Plessis, Ruan Pienaar and Pat Lambie -- who have 252 caps between them -- among the replacements.
"We've seen first-hand how important it is to have experienced players on the field at the end of a match and to have this kind of experience available on the bench in a knockout match is great," said Meyer.
