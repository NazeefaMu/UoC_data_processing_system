Century after the fall of  Capitalism

The victory of the proletarian revolution in Russia in October 1917 was the key historical event of the XX century. Almost all the progressive and right thinking historians believe that it radically changed the entire course of man’s destiny and generated a marked development of a new culture in human relations. The Great October Revolution not only laid the foundation stone for the first socialist state, ending man’s exploitation, it also inspired people of all countries to fight the York of Capital.
It found its continuation in the deeds of the builders of socialism, in the heroism of anti-fascists, in the defeat of Hitler’s Germany and militarist Japan, in the establishment of a new socialist order in Eastern Europe, in the collapse of the colonial system, in the storm over Latin America, in the inspiring Cuban Revolution, in the courage of Che Guevara, Salvador Allende (Chile) and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and today’s leap forward achievements in People’s Republic of China and Revolutionary Vietnam.
In short, it heralded the emancipation of mankind from the York of Capitalism and paving the way for a more democratic and humane way of life, for the suppressed masses all over the world.
February Revolution and October Revolution
It showed in no uncertain terms that there is a way out for the oppressed to attain liberty, equality and fraternity by putting into the dustbin of history, The Horrified System of Booms and Slumps. In short, Capitalism. Even the present President of Russia, V. Putin has called for an honest assessment of the 1917 revolution that occurred in his own country.
These are his own words- “We all know what consequences the so-called great upheavals we usually have. Unfortunately, our country had to face many such upheavals in the 20th Century. 2017 will mark the 100th anniversary of the February Revolution and October Revolution. On this occasion, we could once again assess the causes and essence of Russian revolutions. Not only historians, but the entire Russian Society needs an honest, deep assessments of those events”.
Agricultural performance of Russia on the eve of the World War I showed the lowest yields in Europe. The peasants who were toiling in the fields used ten million wooden ploughs; 30 % of them had no working animals to draw the plough and had to hire a horse from the neighbouring Kulak at exorbitant rates. Poverty, hunger and disease with a very high rate of infant mortality were the order of the day.
By 1910, around 54% of all Russia’s industrial workers were employed in factories with 500 workmen or more-the highest percentage in the world of its kind. However, the control of these factories was highly concentrated. Monopoly organisations-either trusts directly owning group of factories, or syndicates marketing their products-controlled over 75% of Russian output, most of the coal and iron are mined, a very large proportion of metal goods such as steel rails, girders, and agricultural machinery, most of the oil and sugar production, and so on.
The speed at which Russian industry developed from the 90s onwards must not, however, hide from us the incredibly backward state of the Russian economy. In spite of all this development, when compared to the proportion of her size, Russia’s network of railways in 1913 was four times smaller than that of the U.S.A; and twelve times smaller than that of Germany and United Kingdom.
Her output of coal, in proportion to the population, was five times less than that of France, fifteen times less than that of Germany, 26 times less that of the USA and 31 times less than that of Great Britain. Moreover, the lag was increasing at an alarming rate.
The Russian output of iron per head of population was three times less than French in 1900. It was six times less than German output in 1900. Further, it was already eight times less than American output per head in 1900.
Although these figures reveal that there was some industrial development in Russia during this period, it was mainly due to the influx of foreign capital. The rulers of Russia turned to the French money market for the loans which constantly needed to balance its budget.
Beginning with loans for urgent treasury purposes and railway construction, foreign capital imports began to flow into the coal, iron and steel industries, attracted by largely heavy profits (25-50 %) than it could earn at home. Between 1896 and 1900, a quarter of all new companies were foreign and by 1900 foreign capital accumulated for 28% of the total. By 1914, the proportion had risen to 33%. Foreign capital controlled 45% of Russia’s oil output, 54% of her iron output, 51% of her chemical industry, nearly 75% of her coal output. More than half the capital of six leading banks of the country-themselves controlling nearly 60% of all banking capital and nearly half of bank deposits- was foreign.
Marxist theories
Between 1878-1800, in St Petersburg and other industrial towns in Russia, numerous workers’ organisations with a revolutionary programme were continually being formed, even though they were regularly suppressed by the police.
However, the political literature that came out during this period, revealed that their formations and militant activities were being powerfully and energetically reinforced by a stream of Marxist literature, at first smuggled in from abroad and then re-produced by hectograph and secret printing press within the Russian border. This development was a direct result of the organisation called, Emancipation of Labour Group founded in Geneva by Plekhanov.
In this exercise, he was actively supported by Narodnik organisation. During later years the Narodniks shed their ultra-left ideas and accepted the teachings of Marx and Engels. Plekhanov began a series of brilliant polemical explanations of Marxist theories and successfully challenged the ideas of the terrorists, the Narodniks and other advocates of rival theories established in workers’ ranks. In this emerging revolutionary field, Plekhanov’s task was taken over and developed at home cleverly by a young student of a later generation., Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin), whose brother had been executed by the rulers of Russia for having connections with Narodniks in 1887.
Hearing the grave situation in Russia, Lenin came back to his Motherland in 1893 and got deeply involved in the series of strike struggles of the workers. Further, apart from helping the struggles of the workers, he initiated various programmes to establish Marxist study circles in the main cities and also carried out various propaganda works relevant to the changing political situation in the country.
