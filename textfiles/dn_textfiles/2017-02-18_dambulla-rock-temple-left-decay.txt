Dambulla rock temple left to decay

The Dambulla rock temple which is a world heritage, is in a deplorable state due to the lack of maintenance and conservation.
The history of the rock temple dates back to 2000 years. King Walagambahu is considered to be the founder of the cave temple. The caves were used by the king as his hide out.
A stupa was later constructed enshrining the gold ornaments of Somadevi. It is known as Samadevi cheitya.
Sinhalese kings and provincial leaders developed this historic place.
The inscription of King Nissankamalla is visible at the entrance to the temple. The murals and hood pictures of shrine rooms spread over 22,000 square feet.
It is the largest cave consisting of murals in South Asia, archaeologists said.
The murals of the caves are fading.
The paintings have cracks and peeled off owing to the lack of maintenance.
