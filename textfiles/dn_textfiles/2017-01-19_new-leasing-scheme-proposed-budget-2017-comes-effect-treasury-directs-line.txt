New leasing scheme proposed by Budget 2017 comes into effect: Treasury directs line ministries to take specific action to implement Budget proposals

The Secretary to the Treasury has informed the secretaries of all line ministries to take necessary steps to implement all development proposals made by Budget 2017 for each ministry.
These proposals in the Budget which had already been passed by Parliament would be implemented through the relevant ministries and their affiliated institutions. Certain Budget proposals during the past had not been implemented properly during the targeted period of time, thereby the country had lost its expected benefits.
The prime objective of this programme is to ensure the proper implementation of all development projects proposed by Budget 2017 in time. The Ministry of Finance has summarized in a report to all ministry secretaries concerning the projects coming under the purview of each ministry and how such projects proposed by the Budget are to be implemented.
The report also includes details with regard to new laws to be introduced if necessary. The report has further advised ministry secretaries to prepare an action plan and implement all the projects and proposals made by the Budget within this year, in order to eradicate poverty, generate employment enabling the the public to increase their income.
Budget 2017 has proposed 325 projects to be implemented and the National Budget Department has allocated the necessary funds for each ministry to implement them, hassle free. Accordingly, Treasury Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga had already informed ministry secretaries to prepare procurement plans and action plans with immediate effect and submit them to the Director General, Budget Department, to enable him to provide the necessary grants for each project. Certain Budget proposals have been implemented with effect from the very midnight following the Budget which was presented to Parliament, while the responsibility of implementing the balance was left with the respective ministries and their regulatory bodies.
Accordingly, prices of several essential commodities including kerosene, sugar, canned fish and powdered milk have already been dropped. Relevant Acts and regulations introduced under a move to simplify the tax system, would be implemented with effect from 01.04.2017.
The specific feature in preparing the Budget this time was the inclusion of proposals by people from all walks of life, including ordinary people, businessmen and professionals. Tourism has been bouncing back in the country and a group of businessmen engaged in transporting tourists, had requested for assistance to improve the sector.
Accordingly, new regulations with regard to leasing loans for vehicles would not be applied to transport service providers in the tourism sector. They would be able to enjoy 100% loan facilities for the leasing out of vehicles.
At the same time, university scholars who brought forward research details, pointed out the need for a regulatory body with regard to three wheelers. Budget 2017 which welcomed the argument of the university experts, had proposed new regulations in leasing out three wheelers.
Accordingly, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake proposed in Budget 2017, that loan to value ratio should be 25% for three wheelers, 50% for motor cars and vans and 90% for lorries and buses.
Therefore, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has advised commercial banks and leasing companies to follow the new regulations in granting loans for vehicle leasing, including three wheelers. Currently, loans could be borrowed by paying 10% of the total value of a three wheeler, which a borrower intends to buy. In future, under the new leasing regulations, 25% of the total value of a three wheeler should be paid instead.
Proposed traffic laws and spot fines are scheduled to be revised in the near future and the Finance Ministry believes that the new regulations imposed on loans would make an impact on leasing out of three wheelers. 325 projects have been proposed to be implemented within this year.
Each line ministry and its affiliated bodies, should prepare their own action plans to properly implement the proposed projects which have been earmarked for each ministry.
Treasury Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga has informed all ministry secretaries to set up task force to assess the performance of each project and inform the outcome monthly to the Treasury.
