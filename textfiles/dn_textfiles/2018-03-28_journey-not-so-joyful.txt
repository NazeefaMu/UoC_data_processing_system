journey  not so joyful

Madhura Charika is a simple tale but craftily shot, adding drama and poignancy to a narrative that shows a small child actor, contained and confident, paired with an old veteran. Although the entire movie is understated, a particular strength of presence pervades the film, through the roles of the actors. The actors rarely display grand emotion and the scenes are not over dramatised; if at all, they are underplayed, adding a sophisticated touch of irony. Its power is derived from the audience’s unconscious desire to see this old actor gaining his just reward in a final curtain call of glory, which never materialises. Equally compelling is the compassion of strangers on the streets – a prostitute and her pimp assist the dying man – making for an unlikely but welcome ending that restores our faith in the essential goodness of man. 
For a moment we fall in love with Wilson Godamanna the octogenarian grandfather settled down with his family in the lush hill country. The trivial stubble does not disturb his pleasing outlook. Godamanna is anyway portrayed as an elder, tidy and neat.
Yet what is not pleasing is what he has to endure towards the last stages of his life.
In Sri Lanka there is one certainty to which all the filmmakers have arrived in unison: there is no cinema industry in the country. For some, the industry is still in nascent stages. For some, it's still in teething stages. Apparently, the industry is not born yet for some.
Udayakantha Warnasuriya toys with the irony of his own career when he allocates a few scenes to portray how Sri Lanka's cinema functions. The same old crowd frequents the Tharangani Hall, the contemporary Mecca whenever the National Film Corporation chooses to organise or collaborate a film fest. The crowd is treated to a sumptuous feast.
An ageing Wilson, happily settled in a hamlet off Nuwara Eliya with his son's family, journeys to Colombo to watch a film with his pre-teen grandson in tow. The cultural big shots in Colombo, in the meanwhile, look for at least one actor in the antique film shown to celebrate the 68th anniversary of Sinhala cinema. Following a series of unexpected adventures, Wilson finally reaches for what he deserves.
At the moment we are surrounded by more buttonholes who keep on talking about the predicament of Sri Lankan cinema than those who actually try to fix it. We need buttonholes. That's no issue. But we need more people to work on making the Sri Lankan cinema an industry.
Warnasuriya employs a new trope: inserting old scenes from the films. They do not hurt the flow of the movie. But it does not add much colour to the flow, if not for occasional humour. But what Wilson remembers comes as a flashback truly bringing forth his atavistic desires.
More than cinematic beauty Warnasuriya takes us to the philosophy with the plot outline. He deals with what most of his contemporaries have been coughing up for years and decades. [Spoiler alert] Wilson develops an interest in going to Colombo from the moment he set eyes on the newspaper item about the festival. But his son is more interested in plucking yams. That's fair by him. His father's chosen career has not bequeathed him any wealth. He has to earn a living and leave his father to his own artistic devices. While the cinema professionals finally hit the bed, satisfied that they did something worthwhile, a sex worker and her facilitator (euphemism intended) gets active towards midnight to offer a helping hand to dying Wilson.
As the mystery unfurls things get clearer, or so we can imagine, and Warnasuriya spirals his plot into a dark conclusion. Madhura Charika may not be Warnasuriya's masterpiece, yet it is an atmospheric feast of visual beauty. With the green scenery in the background, there lurks a tragic present and a buried glory. Warnasuriya methodically sets up his characters and introduces Wilson's past veiled in the vintage scenes. It is a subtle exploration of Wilson Godamanna’s secret passion for glory. Udayakantha Warnasuriya meticulously manages the film and its direction, controlling its pace, raising and lowering the intensity of the rise and fall of Wilson Godamanna.
To check the quality of our own cinema as an industry we need to weigh its score against Hollywood, Bollywood, Kollywood or at least Nollywood. But sadly we have no criteria to measure the quality. And worse, the industry does not rake in enough money to ventilate some decent professionalism to the industry.
Udayakantha Warnasuriya (director, scriptwriter and producer) Dayawansa Jayakody (co-producer) and Kumara Wanduressa (co-producer) deserve much kudos for introducing an insightful cinematic work to the local audience.
