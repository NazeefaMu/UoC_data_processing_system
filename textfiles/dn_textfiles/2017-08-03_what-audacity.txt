What audacity

Joint Opposition stalwart Bandula Gunawardena has called upon Minister Ravi Karunanayake to resign from his post without waiting until the proposed No-Confidence against him, over the bond affair, is tabled in parliament. What audacity. No doubt, while wrong doers in the Yahapalanaya government should be exposed and punished, the JO led by Mahinda Rajapaksa is the last entity which can take a stand in this regard. It is public knowledge that a good majority of JO MPs in the present parliament who have taken a holier than thou attitude vis-a-vis the current imbroglio in the Yahapalanaya government, stemming from the alleged bond scam, have all serious corruption cases lined up against them.
Those shouting the most about the alleged bond scam are the very ones who are the living examples of rags to riches tales. It is abundantly clear that these paragons of virtue are today attempting to draw a red herring, to detract from their own shenanigans, while in power, by targeting a beleaguered minister of the government. They are also being ably assisted in this campaign to paint themselves lily white, by targeting the government, by select media groups, which are going overboard in this exercise.
Karunanayake has been made the whipping boy for obvious reasons - to shift the public attention away from the mega swindles of these worthies when they were granted immunity to do as they please under Rajapaksa. Among the most vociferous in this band of JO MPs is a personage who started life as a two bit salesman but went onto purchase palatial homes in elite Colombo addresses. Another, who had an unaccounted Rs. 400 million in his possession and was summoned by the Bribery Commission to make a statement failed to make the trip on grounds that he was stung by a polanga (russel viper). There is another who is tearing his hair and gnashing his teeth over the bond issue, currently being investigated for swindling millions by forging a power of attorney signature.
In the melee surrounding Minister Karunanayake, what is being overlooked by the public is the fact that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the bond affair was appointed by the Yahapalanaya government, no less, to inquire into the allegations against a top flight minister of the same government. Minister Karunanayake is being made to face the full glare of the public spotlight as the case against him is played out in the open. What is more, he is to be grilled by state counsel of the Attorney General's department representing the government.
This, needless to say, is in contrast to the Rajapaksa era when all financial scandals were swept under the carpet and the AG's department made a cipher of the government. No investigation was conducted or a Commission of Inquiry appointed to probe the multi-billion dollar loss to the country by the notorious hedging deal which even drew strictures from the highest court of the land. Neither was there any probe into the Greek bond affair that drained the country of billions. The monumental rip-off associated with the construction of the Sooriyawewa Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium was nobody's business. The astronomical losses suffered by the national carrier, driving it into a bottomless pit of debt and financial ruin, due to the cavalier fashion it was run by the brother-in-law of a VVIP is not even talked of today despite the Weliamuna report detailing not only the financial profligacy but also other shenanigans of the individual at the helm.
The lukewarm response displayed by the government to these instances of mega corruption, the slow investigations process and the absence of follow up action has today emboldened the perpetrators of these deeds to such an extent they have succeeded in driving the government into corner. It is a case of the hunter becoming the hunted, due to the vacillation of the government in bringing to book the top leaders of the former regime, their associates and kith and kin who are today sitting pretty, and, what is more, challenging the government on the corruption front. No doubt, it is a betrayal of the mandate received by the Common Candidate to go after the mega crooks and recover the accumulated loot.
Even at this late stage the President should take steps to speed up investigations into the doings of the Rajapaksa era, if for nothing else, to wipe out the smirks on the faces of the rogues and plunderers who are today reveling in the difficulties the Yahapalanaya government has plunged itself into, while disporting themselves as paragons of virtue. The public are still waiting for the outcome of the investigations into the loot stashed away in the Dubai banks and other offshore destinations. Or the hotels said to have been purchased by members of the former first family. It is the lack of progress in these matters that have made these rogue elements take the moral high ground and are trying to turn the tables on the government.
