Rakeeb selected Kalmunai mayor

The first sitting of the Kalmunai Municipal Council was held on April 2.
The Mayor, Attorney A.M. Rakeeb, was appointed from the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) that secured 22 votes. Kaththamuthu Ganesh from the TULF led by Ananda Shangari was appointed the Deputy Mayor.
The Kalmunai Municipal Council was ruled by the SLMC from its inception. This is the fifth consecutive victory of the SLMC led by Rauff Hakeem, Water Supply and City Planning Minister.
The new mixed election system put all the parties in trouble as they did not secure the maximum seats to rule the council. The SLMC secured 12 seats, Independent Group-6 secured nine seats, TNA secured seven seats, NFGG one seat, NC one seat, TULF two seats in the Kalmunai Municipal Council. The Independent Group-6 that represents the Sainthamarthu Village urged the Government to declare a Local Government Body for their village.
The members elected under the Independent Group did not participate for the yesterday's voting.
