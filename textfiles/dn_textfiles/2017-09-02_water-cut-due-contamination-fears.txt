Water cut due to contamination fears

The Water Supply and Drainage Board yesterday shut down the water purification plant at Kandana, Horana as a precautinary measure for fear of contamination after a fuel bowser toppled at Kiriella on the Panadura–Ratnapura Road.
National Water Supply and Drainage Board officials who visited the scene confirmed the possibility of fuel residue from the bowser draining into the Kalu Ganga which is just 750 metres away from the scene of the accident.
Water supply to Bandaragama, Horana, Boralesgamuwa, Moratuwa and Piliyandala was disrupted as a precautionary measure until officials confirmed that the water is not contaminated.
Water Board officials said that there is a possibility of water being contaminated as the accident had occurred on Thursday night and fuel coming out from the toppled bowser may have seeped into the Kalu Ganga due to heavy rains experienced in the area that night.
However, another bowser was brought to the site to remove petrol from the toppled bowser yesterday morning. Traffic on the Panadura Ratnapura road came to a halt for a few hours due to this accident.
