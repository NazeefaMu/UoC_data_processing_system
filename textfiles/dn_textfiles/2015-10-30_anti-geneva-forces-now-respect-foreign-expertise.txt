Lawyer MR is confused on the law
Anti-Geneva forces now respect foreign expertise

The initial opposition to the recent Geneva Resolution on Sri Lanka was largely based on what was said to be foreign interference in the internal affairs of this country. There were concerns expressed about the participation of foreign experts in the fields of law, investigation, and the judiciary, which critics said would be a major threat to country's the sovereignty.
The new trend emerging from these critics of the Geneva resolution, especially those who follow the Mahinda Rajapaksa line, be they politicians, academics or media personnel, is a recognition of the importance of such foreign personnel and their contribution to aspects of accountability; and loud calls for their statements, reports or observations made to the Paranagama Commission on Missing Persons, to be released.
This is a strange twist of both events and strategy, with those who opposed any foreign involvement in our internal affairs, especially on matters of accountability and judicial action with regard to the ending of the battle to defeat the LTTE, are now the keenest to have the inputs from foreign personnel, in their battle to oppose and hopefully defeat the Government's position on Geneva 2015.
MR's predicament
Let us first discuss the predicament of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is clearly moving against the leader of his own political party, the SLFP and its alliance the UPFA, President Maithripala Sirisena, with regard to Sri Lanka's co-sponsorship of Geneva 2015. His latest statement made at the MR political arsenal, the Abeyaramaya, following his failure to participate in the parliamentary debate on the Geneva Resolution, is certainly a package of confusion, hardly expected from one who was Head of State until just ten months ago.
He is very much concerned about the change of laws and the Constitution, too, enabling the presence and participation of foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators and, especially lawyers, who will act to punish the war heroes who defeated the LTTE, bringing to an end a bloody conflict that went on for 30 years. "War Heroes" have now come into the parlance of political rivalry that one has serious doubts about how much of genuine respect those who claim to defend or speak on their behalf have for them today. One question in this regard is whether MR considers the Army Commander who led the ground battles against the LTTE in its final stages, giving leadership and direction to the heroes of those battles, as a war hero or not?

The 15th UNHRC session held in Geneva recently
Was the treatment of Gen. Sarath Fonseka, immediately after his defeat in the contest for the presidency in 2010, and other heroes who were with him, an act of honour and respect for a war hero or heroes, the complete negation of such respect? We can leave this for MR to chew on as he considers his next political moves against the trend of the SLFP moving away from him in the days ahead.
Confusion most confounded
To get back to the foreign personnel and experts that were once unwanted and now most wanted by his supporters, MR shows confusion most confounded on the matter. He poses the question that if we change the law to enable foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators to serve in our legal system, what would happen "after they finish jailing our war heroes?" His statement asks: "If the amendments to the laws continue to remain even after jailing the war heroes, foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators and especially lawyers, will, continue to work in Sri Lanka, and that may pose a major problem for the legal profession. There are many lawyers in Parliament and I too am a lawyer."
Confusing as it may be, the antics are interesting. It is a an effort to obtain the support of lawyers, including those in Parliament, being a member of the same fraternity, as he now has to remind both the profession and the country. The other tactic is to use the war heroes for political gain, when it is very clear that there is no move against the troops who were heroes in battle, but only against those who may have violated the rules of combat and engagement in battle.
Even though he may not have practiced law (while busy making law) for many years, his education in law would have told him that laws can be enacted for specific purposes and goals, and they could be repealed with the conclusion of the allotted tasks, at the very time they are passed. Any foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators and lawyers, who may be brought down for special work, would certainly be required by to leave once their work is completed. This is a simple legislative act, and should not bother a former Head of State, and would certainly not have any adverse impact on our legal profession.
It is necessary to ask MR and those who share this Abayaramaya thinking, about the so-called far reaching and adverse nature of the proposed changes to the Constitution, as they see it, whether they did not think of such adverse situations and in fact the dangers to the State, democracy and the sovereignty of the people, when MR introduced the 18th Amendment to the Constitution. It repealed the 17th Amendment, which provided for the independent commissions, and also extended, ad infinitum, the term of office of an executive president of this country. This amendment certainly had very harmful effects on the judiciary, the administration of law and certainly did affect the legal profession most adversely, and was proposed and adopted by a government led by this same lawyer.
Foreign expertise
To come to the current affection, endearment and regard towards foreign experts, we now see Gammanpila and others of that political ilk, including the double or treble turncoat professor of law, see the importance and necessity of the observations made by eminent persons from abroad who were brought by MR to advise the Paranagama Commission.
There is glowing praise today, not undeserving, but surprisingly, of Sir Desmond de Silva QC, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, Professor David Crane, Mr. Paul Newton and Major General John Holmes. What is interesting is that all praise for the observations by these personalities to the Paranagama Commission, comes almost wholly from those who saw the biggest dangers in having foreign experts get involved in our own matters of peace building, reconciliation and accountability.
The demands keep increasing for their observations to be made public, and charges are made against the Government for not tabling these observations in the Parliament, and also for the Paranagama Commission Report not including these observations.
As for the Paranagama Commission, it is up to that Commission to decide what it does with observations and recommendations made to it from experts and other personnel who assisted it.
The final report indicates these have been studied by the Commission. There are strong views expressed that, were these observations made known in Geneva, we may not have had to face Geneva 2015. No doubt these are interesting opinions, regrettably soured by their involvement in the politics of power and not politics for national progress.
Whatever these recommendations and opinions may be, the fact is they were made by foreigners who did come here to be of service to this country, in our need to know the truth about all those thousands who went missing during the prolonged armed conflict. They are similar to what MR calls the "judges, prosecutors and investigators" who may come here later. Their recommendations, if they are as good as many claim them to be, gives a fillip to those in Government and its supporters among the public, who realize the value of obtaining foreign expertise to help resolve the situation we face with regard to the missing and dead in the prolonged armed conflict, the issue of those held without trial or much delayed trial, and the relief that can be given to the families of those who have been the victims of a reign of terror by the LTTE and in the battle to defeat its violence against people of all communities.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesighe's request for assistance from Japan for such expertise, and the opportunity now being opened to obtain services from the Commonwealth member states on this matter, is certainly a move in the right direction, underscored by the praise showered upon these foreign experts who made recommendations to the Paranagama Commission. This is the meaning of Sri Lanka being a participatory member of the United Nations and a responsible member of the international community.
One important matter that requires emphasis, arising from both the Paranagama and Udalagama Commission Reports, is that this country is not wholly barren in the expertise we need. We have many who are very capable, in their special fields of expertise, if given the freedom from political interference, and would certainly benefit from assistance from similar expertise coming from abroad. This is no threat to national sovereignty or to the war heroes who brought peace to this land.
