President will be SLFP candidate at 2020 Presidential Election: Duminda

President Maithripala Sirisena will be our candidate for the 2020 Presidential Election, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday said.
The General Secretary was speaking at a press briefing held at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday afternoon.
He urged all SLFP supporters to stand with President Maithripala Sirisena to revive the country and form a SLFP government and invited all others to join President Sirisena to revitalize the country discarding party politics.
Minister Dissanayake said President Sirisena always puts the country first before the political party he represents.
The recent setback in the Local Government Election is a challenge that Yahapalana government needs to overcome and that it should not be the downfall, Minister Dissanayake said.
“We should come back stronger with an expedite plan to turn the tide and bring victory again to this government. We resurrect the country in 2015. Now the time has come again to revive the changes it achieved in 2015,” he said.
“What is in jeopardy is our children’s future. We must not allow power hungry politicians to destroy this country once again. I urge this country and its people to stand strong and continue with this Yahapalana government. People should realise the difference between personal aims and common goals in the politics,” Minister Dissanayake said.
Minister Dissanayake assured that the government will learn from its errors. He requested the SLFP candidates at the LG polls to work with the government to develop the villages.
Minister Dissanayake said the government will produce the accused before law and the rest is in the hands of judiciary of the country.
“We cannot bring accused persons to book. We can only produce them before courts. We as a Yahapalana government cannot manipulate the legal system of the country. If we do so, it would be that the government misusing its powers,” he said.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera pointed out that the SLFP/UPFA has secured the remote controller to decide on which political party would come into power in 167 councils. While highlighting that SLFP has received 1.7 million votes at the LG Polls, Minister Amaraweera said they will work with the political party who would allow them most power in the council.
He said they have already started acquiring power in these councils through discussions.
Minister Amaraweera said that they would introduce a special development project to all the Councils to secure power.
He said the Delimitation Committee on the Provincial Council election has handed over its report.
Minister Amaraweera said there is a need for amendments to the new system before going to another election.
