Rs. 25,000 fine for ‘mosquito breeding’: Cabinet nod for amendments to Mosquito Breeding Act

Amendments to the Mosquito Breeding Act No 11 of 2007 received Cabinet approval on Tuesday.
Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne this week sought Cabinet approval to instruct the legal draftsman to draft amendments to the Mosquito Breeding Act.
“We are going to increase the fine from Rs 5,000 to Rs 25,000 and the fine will be higher for commercial places compared residential”, said the minister addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday.
He added that the current Act did not permit officials to enter premises without permission from the owner but this would be amended,
“It will be amended to allow them to enter premises but they would need permission to enter someone’s house,”explained the Health Minister.
