Tinsel Tales: Lights and Baubles

Bells jingle, lights glitter, trees are topped with sparkling stars, and children everywhere dream of Santa Claus and presents. But the best gift of all-the most magical gift of the season-is when we spend Christmas with those we love – under a Christmas tree.As in your house, so in mine, there stands a Christmas tree in the corner of the living room. Alive. Breathing. Watching. And finally talking.“You want to write about my story?” asks my tree. “No” I tell him. Everyone already knows your story. It began in Germany almost 1,000 years ago when St Boniface, who converted the German people to Christianity, was said to have come across a group of pagans worshiping an oak tree. In anger, St Boniface cut down the oak tree and to his amazement a young fir tree sprung up from the roots of the oak tree. St Boniface took this as a sign of the Christian faith. But it was not until the 16th century that fir trees were brought indoors at Christmas time.
“But there is more to the story of Christmas trees”. Insists my tree. “ Read Penne Restad's book on Christmas trees called “Christmas in America” to find out more about how Christmas is celebrated today.” I follow his advice and surf the net in search of the book. Yes, Penne Restad, a University of Texas historian, has much to say about the role of the Christmas tree in the modern world. As she sees it, the Christmas tree is the focal point of a celebration that honors families and the home, separate from the religious holiday on the same date.
“The Christmas tree has become a physical center of the holiday,” says Prof. Restad. “You walk into a house, see a Christmas tree and know that is where everything will happen, where everyone will be. It's the heart of the familial celebration of Christmas that may have no connection to the religious celebration.”
I read the words out loud to my Christmas tree realizing the truth behind her observation, for here I am, a non-Christian (and I know there are many others like me) with Christmas trees in our sitting rooms right this minute. This is why, the tree, decorated in millions of different homes every year all over the world can be seen as “a unifying thread” explains Prof.Restad. “We're all doing the same thing but we're doing it in our own, personal way.”The one in my house, who has suddenly turned into my guru on Christmas trees appears to be a stickler for perfection. He offers more advice. “Why don't you read the article written by Prof.David McGrath about Christmas trees for the Los Angeles Times, last Christmas?” Tired of being so obedient, I decide to postpone my search and check my email inbox instead. But the transformation in my tree is too hard to ignore. The leaves begin to droop reminding me of Grumpy in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Ok. I mutter under my breath and search for Prof. McGrath's article.
It turns out he is a father who wants to offer his daughter Janet, many arguments against the wasteful practice of buying a real Christmas tree. He confesses he had had the same argument with his wife for thirty years. “Real ones had always been important to her — the annual pilgrimage to the tree lot on a chilly night, the scent of pine, keepsake ornaments. For me, it's a mess of trouble for something you discard after two weeks, not to mention $50 that would be better put toward gifts or charity. At least, that's been my losing argument going on 30 years.” He wonders why Janet and her husband Kevin should launch their own 30 years of wasteful practice and hopes Kevin might be allergic to the pungent smell of pine leaves and not buy a real tree. But when his daughter telephones to ask him, from 1,500 miles away what kind of tree they should buy he gives in, forgets all his arguments and suggests she buy a “Uh, probably balsam fir. They last the longest.”
I decide to write to Prof. McGrath, though I am sure he would not want to answer the questions of a strange, foreign journalist sent in an email, even in this season of giving. To my surprise I receive a response. “Since my Times piece, there has been more research and debate about the tradition of real tree vs. artificial, much of which shows that buying real trees is better for the environment than buying “artificials”, because of the global/chemical benefits of tree farms.” Prof. McGrath tells me. “What I found with both my wife and daughter, is that the proverbial family heart trumps such practical concerns.” Prof. McGrath thinks that what is vital is that “it doesn't have to be a tree, per se: any talisman or symbol that serves to perpetuate the idea and feeling (love) of family, even when far from home, or when members are absent, is what's vital. It could be a tree or a music box or a dish or a photo or a song. For my wife and children, it's the tree, and any pragmatic objections that I have are dwarfed by the primacy of family.”
Perhaps imagining the fellow Christmas trees standing in the houses of Prof. McGrath and his daughter Janet right this minute, my tree too cheers up. And I realize how attractive he is, even though till now I had only noticed the gaps between the branches on his left side, and that he was stooping too much to the right. Looking at him now, from this particular angle, in the glow from the monitor of my computer I realize he is as handsome as...well...Daniel Day Lewis!
No wonder as I gaze at my Christmas tree I feel exactly like how Scrooge feels at the end of Charles Dickens’ Christmas Carol. “...as light as a feather, .. as happy as an angel, ...as merry as a school-boy...as giddy as a drunken man” (though totally sober).
So, in the spirit of the festive season, let me borrow a quote from Scrooge to end my story. “A merry Christmas to every-body! A happy New Year to all the world!”
