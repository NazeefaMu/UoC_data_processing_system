Two poachers nabbed

Tangalle Organized Crimes Prevention Unit (OCPU) officers arrested two suspects yesterday on a tip-off, while they were hunting in the Samaguliya reserve in Tissamaharamaya to supply game meat to hotels in Kataragama. Two local firearms were also seized.
The suspects were identified as a 26–year-old married man of the Tissamaharamaya fisheries village and a 33-year-old of Beralihela, Tissamaharamaya.
They had been in the business for a long time.
The suspects were handed over to the Tissamaharama Police. They were to be produced before the Tissamaharaya Magistrate’s Courts.
