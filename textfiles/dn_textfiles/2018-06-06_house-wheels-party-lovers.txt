House on  wheels for party lovers

A tiny house has been designed just for people who like to party. The teeny £107,000 house comes on wheels and features a wet bar and a large garage door wall which opens up to make room for party guests.
It also includes a spacious kitchen and living area, luxurious bathrooms and a large bedroom flooded with natural light.
The home is 32-foot-long, eight-foot-six-inches-wide and 13-foot-six-inches tall.
It’s built on a 30-foot-long triple-axle trailer, so that it can be towed virtually anywhere – including the beach.
It’s made using recycled steel and has a cool butterfly roof, giving it a rustic look.
The Breezeway home was built by Tiny Heirloom for a private client and it was strategically designed just for socialising.
“This home was designed for outdoor entertainment in good ol’ Texas,” they said.
“Outfitted with an in-house Bose sound system, a wet bar, and a spacious full kitchen making hospitality a breeze. The large garage door opens up to bring the outdoors in and vice versa on those days where it’s just too nice to shut out the outdoors. Most tiny homes don’t factor in the need for social space, but the Breezeway’s interior design was left relatively empty to create a flexible area.”
“A handcrafted built-in dog kennel just to the side of the garage door allows our client to keep their pup close by and secure when needed. Reclaimed barn wood lines the kitchen walls with LED accent strips behind wine racks add a rustic yet sophisticated element to the design,” the spokesperson for Tiny Heirloom continued.
With a linear actuator TV lift and touch activated storage door openers this home makes you feel ahead of time. A secondary swivel TV in the master loft provides great viewing from the comfort of your bed or from the kitchen below.
“The master bath suite is one of our most luxurious to date. With marble styled walls, fully tiled shower, and half glass entrance it appeals to all the senses and its attention to detail can only truly be felt when you step inside for the first time. Topped off with storage and a washer and dryer combo this bath suite has it all.”
