Power set, two engines released for use after repairs

A power set with six compartments and two engines repaired at the Ratmalana railway workshop were released for use yesterday by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva. The department has spent Rs. 10 million for the repairing of train engines and Rs. 50 million for repairing the power set.
A Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) official said the Ratmalana workshop handles Rs.150 million worth repairs of engine and train compartments every year. The workshop was started by the British and now there are around 3,000 workers.
“It repairs around 40 engines and 150 compartments per year. Since the repairing is carried out here, the country can save a large amount of foreign exchange used for the import of new engines and compartments,” the official added.
