Conditions unmet: GMOA threaten strike tomorrow

 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will embark on trade union action from 8.00 a.m. tomorrow if the Government fails to meet eight demands today, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
 Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo he said that the first of the demands was that all details pertaining to white van number NP – 0410 – used in the abduction attempt on Ryan Jayalath - is disclosed to the public.
 He also demanded that the identity of those who arrived in the van to abduct Ryan Jayalath is disclosed, as well as the identities of those that gave the order, and any other connection between the police and those that came in the van that needed to be laid bare.
Dr. Aluthge said that the second demand was that legal action is taken against all those that arrived in the van to abduct Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee (MFSAC) Convener Ryan Jayalath on Thursday (27). 
The third demand by the GMOA is assurance from the government that such incidents would not be repeated in the future.
The fourth demand by the GMOA is that government publicly apologise to the nation for attempting to suppress the work of a student activist by attempting to abduct him.
The fifth demand to the Government is that it release without charge all students attached to the MFSAC who were arrested at a protest on the weekend.
The sixth, seventh and eighth demands are that the government give written assurance it will appoint an ‘acceptable’ Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President, that the minimum standards on medical education is gazette and that recruitment of students to SAITM is discontinued.
