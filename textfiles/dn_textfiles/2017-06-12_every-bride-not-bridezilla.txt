Every bride is not a Bridezilla

By now, we should all know that no matter how much you crave the spotlight, when it comes to weddings, you let the happy couple have their moment in the sun.
There's a multitude of reasons for this, common decency probably being the top one. That's not to say, however, all brides are attention-starved harpies who will destroy anyone who dares not play second-fiddle to them.One bride in fact recently coordinated an amazing surprise for her best friend at her wedding, using the tossing of the bouquet as her perfect moment. Do you see where this is going yet?
Yes, it's a big-hearted bride who gets together with her bridesmaid's partner to organise him proposing to her friend - and lets herself get upstaged in the process. The moment the bridesmaid was proposed to was captured on camera by professional photographer Ross Dance Photography.
"Leading up to the wedding Jessica's bridesmaid and best friend (also Jess) worked tirelessly to ensure the preparations and wedding day were perfect," he wrote.
"To show her appreciation, the bride decided to share her special day with her friend, coordinating the proposal with Jess' boyfriend.
"Instead of throwing the bouquet, the bride spun around and walked over to her best friend. Everything froze as she said 'Jess... turn around...'"
