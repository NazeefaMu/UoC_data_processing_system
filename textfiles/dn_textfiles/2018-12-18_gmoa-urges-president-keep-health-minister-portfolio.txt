GMOA urges President to keep Health Minister portfolio

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) requests President Maithripala Sirisena not to appoint Dr. Rajitha Senaratne as the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister again, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the reasons for not appointing Dr.Senaratne as the Health Minister have already been submitted to the President in writing along with the signatures of 14,000 MBBS doctors. This is the first time that such a petition signed against a Health Minister.
According to Dr.Aluthge, the facts for not appointing Dr.Senaratne had been submitted in details. In addition, the GMOA informed the President that as a former Health Minister with a good understanding about the subject, he can keep the Health Ministry with him without appointing a Health Minister.
"The health sector in Sri Lanka will make a progress if President Sirisena keeps the Health Minister portfolio under his purview. An emergency meeting of the GMOA's Executive Committee will be called as soon as possible to discuss future actions in connection with the issue," he added.
