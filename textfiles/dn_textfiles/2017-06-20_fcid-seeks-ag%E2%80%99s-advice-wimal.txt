FCID seeks AG’s advice on Wimal

The FCID yesterday informed Court that it has sought the Attorney General’s advice regarding two suspects, including National Freedom Front leader MP Wimal Weerawansa for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the government.
When the case came up before Colombo Fort Magistrate Ms Lanka Jayaratne, the Court was informed that the FCID has sought the Attorney General’s advice regarding future legal action against two suspects including Wimal Weerawansa under reference number CRS/14/17.
Meanwhile, the Magistrate permitted MP Weerawansa and second suspect Samantha Lokuhennadige to go abroad and ordered to temporally suspend their travel ban. They are currently out on bail.
The FCID conducting investigations into the alleged misuse of state vehicles had informed Court that Weerawansa had given his written and verbal approval to the commission to commit these offences under Public Property Act and Penal Code while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister.
“These vehicles had been given to the SEC on a rental basis to carry out ministerial functions. However,the vehicles in question had been allegedly given to five relatives of the former minister including his sister.Ten other vehicles were given to 10 officials of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna and the other vehicles were given to his staff members who were not entitled to receive them,” the FCID had told Court.
The FCID alleged that Weerawansa had given these vehicles for the use of his close relatives and private staff members without Treasury approval during 2010 to 2015.
However, the defence had denied the allegations and informed Court that the FCID is conducting a politically motivated inquiry to punish the government’s political opponents.
The FCID had filed a B report in Court against Weerawansa alleging that he misused 40 vehicles while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the state.
The FCID OIC, Chief Inspector Anura Premaratne appeared for the prosecution. President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for the suspects.
