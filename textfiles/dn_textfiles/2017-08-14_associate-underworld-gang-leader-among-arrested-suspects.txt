Associate of underworld gang leader among arrested suspects

One suspect injured in the shootout at the Kurana Junction in Negombo was reportedly an associate of the underworld gang leader, ‘Makandure Madush’.
On last Saturday, a group of STF personnel was shot at when they arrived at the junction on a tip off that a gang were travelling in a van towards Negombo for a robbery.
The STF personnel, when they attempted to stop the van, were shot at by the suspects in the van.
In retaliation, the STF personnel had opened fire on the suspects. During the shootout, one suspect was seriously injured and admitted to the Colombo National Hospital and another to the Ragama Hospital. One suspect was a former Navy deserter.
The suspects, Champika Kumara Jayatunga (28), Ranhoteegedara Vajira Kumara (41), Janaka Aruna Shantha (40), and Alawatte Kamkanamlage Tharindu Madusha (31) were arrested by police.
Two 9 mm pistols and two T-56 automatic assault rifles and some ammunition were seized by police at the location of the shootout.
