Over 60% foreigners invest in Serenia Residences Talpe Galle

Sri Lanka’s luxury beachfront properties are currently riding the crest of a real estate boom from both tourism as well as investment growth.
“This has resulted in Sri Lanka’s Serenia Residences experiencing as much as a 60% investment from foreign nationals. Foreign investors have observed that Sri Lanka is traversing the same development direction as Singapore or Hong Kong,” said Sabina Karunanayake, Co-Founder, Serenia Residences.
Traveling from Colombo to Galle now takes as little as an hour and a half from the previous four hour drive, and the extension of the Southern Expressway due to be completed by 2019 is yet another advantage and attraction for potential investors”,
Sophisticated foreign investors are now recognizing the appeal of the Southern Coast of Sri Lanka, and are buying primary residences here, as well as seasonal homes and investment units. “They appreciate the safety and security of a freehold condominium unit on and above the fourth floor.”
“It’s a beautiful location where individuals, couples and families can find spacious residences at per-square-foot prices that are nearly half those of Bali or Thailand”, said Karunanayake .
Italian, German, British, Australian and Singaporean buyers, in particular, are finding that Serenia offers many attractive options both for those seeking primary residences or second homes and investment properties”.
