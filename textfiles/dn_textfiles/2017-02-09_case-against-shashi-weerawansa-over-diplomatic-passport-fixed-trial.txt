Case against Shashi Weerawansa over diplomatic passport fixed for trial

The case filed against Shashi Weerawansa, the wife of National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa over an incident where Shashi Weerawansa had fraudulently obtained two passports, including a diplomatic passport by submitting forged documents to the Department of Immigration and Emigration, was yesterday fixed for trial by Colombo Chief Magistrate.
The seventh, 10th and 11th witnesses of the case were noticed to appear in Courts on May 25, 30 and 31 by Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara.
Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing on behalf of the CID informed Court that a bail order issued by previous Magistrate enabling the accused to appear before Court’s registrar once every three months instead of appearing before the CID last Sunday of each was an informal order and contrary to the general Court procedure. DSG Peiris moved the incumbent Magistrate to revise the earlier order since it had been made without a reasonable ground over an accused charged under the Immigrants and Migrants Act.
President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing on behalf of the accused moved Court not revise the previous Magistrate’s order as it had been issued based on a Court of Appeal judgment. The Chief Magistrate announced that he would make an order in this regard on the next hearing date. At a previous occasion, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) filed a charge sheet against Shashi Weerawansa under two counts.
Shashi Weerawansa was arrested on February, 2015 over the charge of obtaining diplomatic and general passports illegally. She had allegedly submitted a birth certificate with forged names and dates of birth to obtain the passports. She is currently out on bail.
DSG Peiris, Chief Inspector Jayantha and Police Constable Ganegedara of the CID prosecuted. President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for the accused.
