Surrogate for daughter-in-law’s Baby

Kayla Jones, 29, married her husband in 2012 with the knowledge that she would never be able to become a mum and would need to use a surrogate to carry their future children.
According to a story published in The Independent, the woman from Texarkana Arkansas was unable to carry her own child after she underwent partial hysterectomy at 17 but always harboured the hope of becoming a biological mum with her husband.
But after several other surrogacy options didn’t work out, Kayla took her mother-in-law, Patty Resecker, up on her offer - a decision Kayla “couldn’t have been more thrilled” about.
According to Kayla, who shared her story on LoveWhatMatters, her mum-in-law always joked about being their surrogate. After a couple of their surrogate options did not work out, they started to take her mother-in-law more seriously.”
Despite originally finding the idea crazy, Kayla started researching the concept and found other instances where grandmothers had acted as surrogates.
The couple and Patty began undergoing tests to see if Patty was capable of carrying the child - and it turned out that she was actually a match. Using the IVF process, Patty successfully became pregnant in May 2017 - after the second embryo transfer, a day Kayla described as the “second best day of my life.”
The couple ended up surprising Patty with the results in a moving video that marked the beginning of their journey to parenthood.
And seven months later on December 30 2017, Patty, Kayla, and her husband welcomed baby Kross Allen Jones.
Speaking about the decision to serve as her daughter-in-law’s surrogate, Patty, 50, said she felt “blessed.”
Speaking to LoveWhatMatters the grandmum said, “I’ve recently had the privilege of doing one of the most rewarding things: to carry my own grandchild for my son and daughter-in-law. This is something that has blessed not only me and my family, but also Kayla’s family.”
