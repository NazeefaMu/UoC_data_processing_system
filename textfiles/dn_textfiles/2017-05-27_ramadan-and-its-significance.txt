Ramadan and its significance

Millions of Muslims around the world begin fasting this month. Holy month of Ramadan starts this month on 27th or 28th which depends on the sighting of the crescent moon. Ramadan is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar or ‘Hijri’ calendar based on the lunar cycle, which begins in 622 AD when beloved Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) migrated from the holy city of Makkah to Madina.
Nearly 1.6 billion Muslims in the world believe Ramadan is the holiest month in the year because the Qur’an, the holy book of Islam was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) in this month. Muslims around the world are preparing for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after having a meal in the early hours before ‘Fajr’ prayers early in the morning and keep fasting without any bite or sip of water until the ‘Maghrib’ prayers at sunset. It continues either 29 or 30 days in a lunar month.
When the holy month of Ramadan begins worldwide, countries across the globe face different fasting hours. According to the latest maps, the Muslims in Denmark are observing longest fast in the world; it is around 21 hours of fasting. Iceland, Sweden and Norway are the countries with second longest hours of fasting at 20 hours. The Muslims in England also observe one of the longest fasts varying from 18 to 19 hours. Asian countries such as Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka observe fasting 14 to 16 hours. Shortest fast is being observed in Argentina and Australia where fasting does not exceed 10 hours.
Basically the countries in the Arctic Circle observe longest fasting hours. Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Canada, Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland are in the Arctic Circle.
Why do Muslims fast?
Fasting or ‘Sawm’ in Arabic, literally means ‘to refrain’ is one of the five pillars of Islam. The other pillars are the ‘Shahadah’ which is declaration of faith; ‘Salath’ is the five time prayers; ‘Zakath’ is giving alms to poor and needy and the ‘Haj’ is pilgrimage to Holy city of Makkah. Fasting in the month of Ramadan is obligatory for Muslims as mentioned in the Holy Qur’an - the book which contains the message of Almighty Allah that gives guidance for all humanity. Holy Qur’an says, “O you who believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous” (Sura Al-Baqarah, 2:183). It further says, “whoever sights (the moon of the month) the month of Ramadan, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey, then an equal number of other days. Almighrty Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and (wants) for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that (to) which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful” (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2;185).
‘Lailathul Qadr’- the night of power in the last ten days of the month of Ramadan is a significant day for Muslims in which the Noble Qur’an was revealed to prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Muslims spend this night in prayers and meditation. “This night carries more blessings than a thousand months” (Sura Al-Qadr, 97:1-5).
Fasting is not only abstaining food, drink and other pleasurable activities, but also refrains backbiting - talking bad things about others when they are not presence, using foul languages.
Fasting does not mean Muslims retreat from their daily routine. They are encouraged to continue their normal work and usual activities in their day-to-day life. In fact, this is where the challenge of patience and endurance comes in. Muslims believe fasting is not merely a physical ritual, but is primarily a time for reflection and spiritual recharging.
The holy month of Ramadan is also a time of community. Muslims invite their neighbours and friends whoever Muslims or non-Muslims to share their evening meal with them at ‘Iftar’ -the time of breaking fast. In the night, Muslims perform special prayers such as ‘Taraweeh’ and ‘Withr’ in congregation as a community.
According to Islamic teachings, every healthy Muslim men and women are required to fast during the month of Ramadan after the age of puberty. Children, people who are sick or who have mental illnesses, travellers, women who are menstruating, postnatal, pregnant or breast-feeding do not have to fast.
How do Muslims fast in countries where no sunset?
Wherever the Muslims live, it is obligatory to observe fasting after sighting the moon in the month of Ramadan. But, there are countries where the sun remains visible at midnight in the Arctic Circle, and in northernmost Finland, the sun does not set at all for 60 days during summer. According to the ‘Fatwa’- the rules given by the scholars in the Islamic point of view, in places where it is not possible to see the crescent moon, the Muslims may begin fasting according to the closest place where the moon has been sighted or they can rely on the calculations of astronomers whom experts in Astronomy. As a result, some scholars have said it is permissible to follow more reasonable dawn and sunset times of another closest country.
The Islamic Centre of Northern Norway, issued a ‘fatwa’ – a ruling by a scholar of Islamic law or Muslim judicial authority – that gives local Muslims the option of following the fasting hours of Mecca, when the fasting day in Norway exceeds 20 hours.
The Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America made a similar ruling that Muslims living in the most northerly regions of Alaska can use the dawn and sunset times of another part of the country where “day is distinguishable from night”.
Medical aspects of fasting
Fasting can have a number of health benefits, as well as potentially helping overweight people. During fasting, the body uses up glucose and then starts to burn fat, this can lead to weight loss. Dr Razeen Mahroof, an anaesthetist from Oxford, says Ramadan is not always thought of being an opportunity to lose weight because the spiritual aspect is emphasised more generally than health aspect. However, there is a strong relationship between diet and health and it’s a great chance to get the physical benefits as well. In his statement to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK “a detoxification process also occurs, because any toxins stored in the body’s fat are dissolved and removed from the body.”
In another report issued by the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK says, ‘after a few days of the fast, higher levels of endorphins – hormones related to mood – appear in the blood and can make a person more alert and give an overall feeling of general mental wellbeing’.
A Swiss physician Dr. Barsilus says “the advantages of hunger as a remedy exceed those ingesting medicine several times”.
The physiological effect of fasting includes lowering of blood sugar, lowering of cholesterol and lowering of the systolic blood pressure. In fact, Ramadan fasting would be an ideal recommendation for the treatment of mild to moderate, stable, non-insulin diabetes, obesity, and essential hypertension. Following a drop in blood sugar level and using the reserves of glucose found in liver glycogen. Hence, during fast body uses the glucose stored up in the liver glycogen and reduces the sugar level in the body. This is a very effective and natural treatment method for people suffering from diabetes.
Spiritual aspects
Fasting in the month of Ramadan, allows one to build a sense of self-control and will power, which can be beneficial throughout life in dealing with temptations and peer pressure. Muslims learn to control their natural urges such as hunger and thirst through fasting. And also it helps to resist temptations for thing that are not necessary, such as drugs or other harmful substances to the health.
Especially fasting teaches the human beings to “purify” their bodies as well as their souls by developing a greater sense of humility and spirituality. It teaches a greater sense of generosity and forgiveness. Fasting develops feelings of generosity and good-will toward others. Fasting also teaches self-control or restraint, good manners, good habits.
A person who doesn't have control over ‘himself’ is always caught in ‘inferiority complex’ phobia. A person who cannot control himself can never develop leadership qualities. Fasting is an effective method to develop self-control and hence build our character.
Learning to refrain from eating and drinking even when there is a desire for it is all a practice of self-control.
Peace and tranquillity
Ramadan teaches peace and tranquillity. Those who observe fast during the month of Ramadan get practice to maintain peace and tranquillity in their whole life avoiding personal hostility.
When we remain thirsty and hungry in Ramadan the we experience the affliction that the poor and needy people of the society experience the whole year. Hence, fasting is a way of bridging the gap between the different classes and in and out groups in the society.
