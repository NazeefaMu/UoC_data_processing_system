Born of freshness

 
 
 
 
 
 
Arul Subramaniam in a note on FB dated June 3, 2016, says:
Dear K S Siva Anna,
This morning, when I casually went through my collection of old books, I had the opportunity to go through your book ‘Contemporary Tamil Writing In Sri Lanka’ published in October 1974 (42 years back). I was amazed when I read your brief review of my first novel published in 1973. Like Dr Kailasapathy and Dr Sivathamby, you too commended that novel in a grand manner. Thank you, Anna, for giving me the chance to refresh my memories of those astonishing moments.
I give that writing for you to recollect:
Arul Subramaniam’s “Avarkalukku Vayathu Vanthu Viddathu (They have come of age) is a splendidly written novel by a new writer. It gives excellent reading fare as a novel showing the gradual development of characters and their relationships with each other, besides it is also a progressive piece of writing on the theme of national integration.
A Tamil youth, Ariyam from Trincomalee, conditioned by the local political climate there, comes to Colombo only to realize that the Sinhala people are not bad as all that. He develops an attachment - both physical and platonic towards Monica at whose house he is boarded. He marries the girl eventually but is in a dilemma as to whether he should break the news to his parents, whom he dares to disobey. It is the struggle between conviction and commitment and the attachment and obligations to his parents that worries him. He is not irrational as to take hasty decisions. It is his slow process of both keeping his wife and winning over his conservative, hard-core parents to his side that the novel describes.
I will not be doing justice to the novel by merely telling what the novel is about. Readers themselves should read it to see in what a grand manner he has written this realistic social piece. Trincomalee has produced an outstanding writer and his first novel is a major contribution to Tamil fiction.
As Dr K. Sivathamby has written in his foreword, this book too should be translated into Sinhala for the benefit of the majority of the readers, especially to show that not all the Tamil people are cast in the same mould. Those who scorn at our local Tamil writers that their writing is merely propagandist will have to sit back and review their thoughts, as people like Arul Subramaniam are writing in such a way that structure and theme are inseparable in their creative writings.
Arul Subramaniam has the naïve, unspoilt freshness in him and this helps him to write his stories without any inhibitions. This is a realistic tone. As a contemporary writer, he sees the inner realism rather than the obvious.
Rajakavi Raheel’s Poems
Raheel is a well-known poet and broadcaster hailing from Nintahavoor in the East of Lanka. He lives both in Lanka and Seychelles. Recently when I visited Pirai F M, a regional broadcasting station of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, I was invited to be interviewed as a former announcer and writer/critic. Rafik another poet from Akkaraipattu and Gayum from Sainthamaruthu working for the radio station with limited facilities but presenting quality programmes were instrumental in extending the invitation to me.
Raheel was the interviewer. He gave me his own three books and two were anthologies of poems. Colourfully printed in India, these books are attractive. Tamil honours graduate from Peradeniya,, Raheel attracts attention with his short and witty poems. The book Thevathyin Anthapurathil Paddanmpoochik) kudiiyirrruppu ((The occupation of the Butterfly in the harem of the Angel)
Raheel seems to be a lover of his ideal pretty woman. All his poems are on her and her femininity All his poems are lyrics for film songs.
Let me attempt to render into English some of the lines which lovers may like.
* Poetry is a flower that blossoms after it has withered away.
* The poet is a candlestick, only when he has melted away, what remains as light is the poem.
* When you breathed in, the wind must have thanked the God.
* To look at the brightness of your teeth the stars ill come down even in daytime.
* The parrots worshipped God asking Him the colour of your skin.
* The flute is satisfied only when your name is mentioned.
* It seems that the swans last wish is to improve on your walking.
* The pride of the cuckoo birds will vanish they listen to your voice.
* Don’t chase the ants that believe you are a sugarcane garden.
* Those. bees are awaiting when you would become a flower.
* When you re silent I could hearth footsteps of the ants
* If you show your nails the butterflies will look for their face on it.
* The Spider that looked at your face weaves a silk net in happiness.
* When he told me that he hasn’t seen a black flower showed him your lock of hair.
* No drying or withering for the flower that you touched
* Having seen your nose stud, the poet said in a beautiful day a single star glistens.
* My seventh sense is your beauty that told me what is love
* You speak in two languages- eyes and voice.
The book in many colours is full of pictures of beautiful young women.
Rapakivi Raheel has brought out1 2 books of poems, a short story collection. He has written serialized novels for magazines. His first novel was published in 2015. He had earned appellations for his varied talents.
