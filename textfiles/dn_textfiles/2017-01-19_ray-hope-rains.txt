A ray of hope for rains

Meteorology Department experts yesterday said the country’s Eastern and Northern Eastern regions are in for some heavy spells of rains for seven days or so starting from January 22.
This is apparently due to the subsequent movement of wind patterns in the Bay of Bengal which is moving towards the country from the West. Weather watchers said it comes like a wave.
Meteorology Department Director Forecasting Sarath Premalal said, there is a slim chance of the North East monsoon being established, but they cannot say that there would be rainfalls enough to fill up hydro reservoirs whose levels have fallen. Nevertheless, he said, there is a good chance of that the rains would continue.
“We cannot forecast how much rain in terms of amount yet, but the rains are inclined to pick up. We have to wait for the showers to come. The rains will be felt throughout the country for about a week,” Premalal said.
Asked why that a drought is expected with rains around the corner,Premalal said the monsoons last year did not establish at proper times. We did not have expected rains, he explained.
