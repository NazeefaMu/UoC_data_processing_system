The store’s international brand offering includes Pepe Jeans, Mothercare, US POLO, Allen Solley, Speedo and Crocs, alongside an extensive range of clothing and accessories from ODEL’s own private labels.
“We are delighted to be in Negombo, a thriving and bustling town, which is a perfect location for a store of this nature,” said Ashok Pathirage, Chairman of Softlogic Holdings PLC, who opened the new store.
“Our expansion plan caters to the needs of both demographics and we are sure that the new ODEL and Softlogic Max store housed under one roof, with ample space, and a wide choice of shopping options that provide a great retail experience will be a very welcome addition to our loyal customer base in the area.”
