Health Minister to lead delegation to Russia

A Sri Lankan delegation including consultants led by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, will take part in the first WHO Global Ministerial Conference on `Ending Tuberculosis (TB) in the sustainable development era: a multi-sectoral response' to be held on November 16 and 17 in Moscow, Russia, Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Ministers, leaders of UN organizations, NGOs, high-level representatives from civil society, academia and the corporate sector, would take part in this two day conference. It is hosted by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation.
The Ministerial Conference “Ending Tuberculosis in the Sustainable Development Era: A Multi Sectoral Response” aims to accelerate efforts of all WHO Member States in taking effective measures to end the global TB epidemic by 2030, through a multi sectoral and interdisciplinary approach within the Sustainable Development agenda, he said.
A Ministerial Declaration will be signed at the Conference, containing bold commitments by countries to accelerate action to end TB and meet the milestones towards the 2030 SDGs. This will inform the UN General Assembly High Level Meeting on TB in 2018, he added.
