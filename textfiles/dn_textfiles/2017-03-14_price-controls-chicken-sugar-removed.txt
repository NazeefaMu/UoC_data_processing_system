Price controls on chicken, sugar removed

The government has removed price controls imposed on chicken and white sugar.
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Badiudeen yesterday said steps were taken to publish a gazette notification in this regard.
He said the decision to remove price controls on chicken and white sugar was taken by the ministry’s Cost of Living Committee after taking into account the consumer demand, the import prices and initial market prices for chicken and sugar.
According to an Industry and Commerce Ministry press communiqué, the price controls imposed on broiler chicken with skin at Rs. 410 per kilo, broiler chicken without skin at Rs. 490 per kilo and sugar at Rs. 93 per kilo, have been taken off by the government.
The decision is the result of abundant availability of chicken and sugar in the market.
