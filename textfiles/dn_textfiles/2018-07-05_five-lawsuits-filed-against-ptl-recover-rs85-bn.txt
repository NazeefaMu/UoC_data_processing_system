Five lawsuits filed against PTL to recover Rs.8.5 bn

The Attorney General yesterday informed the Court of Appeal that five lawsuits have been filed in the Colombo District Court against Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) to recover the losses caused to five government institutions during two controversial bond auctions held held in 2015.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC appearing for the Attorney General informed the Court of Appeal that the PTL has illegally earned profits, incurring Rs.8.5 billion direct losses to five government institutions including Employees Provident Funds (EPF), the Employees Trust Fund (ETF), National Savings Bank and Sri Lanka Insurance.
Kodagoda made this remarks when the revision applications filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena were taken up for argument before Court of Appeal.
