Capt. Tissa Wimalasena further remanded

 
Two suspects including Captain Tissa Wimalasena, the driver and security officer of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, were today ordered to be further remanded till August 14 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court for allegedly operating an illegal quarry on a government owned land in the Koratota area causing a loss of Rs.29 million to the government.
Two suspects Tissa Wimalasena and Lal Priyantha Peiris, a former member of Puttalam Pradeshiya Sabha, were arrested by FCID under the provisions of the Public Property Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The suspects were charged with having operated a rock quarry, situated at the Land Reclamation Commission, claiming that it belonged to the Maga Neguma project.
Additional Magistrate Chanima Wijebandara had earlier refused to grant bail on the suspects citing that there are no exceptional circumstances to release them on bail.
