Safety gear for Kelani Valley railway workers

On a request by maintenance workers of the Kelani Valley railway line, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and railway officials have provided the workers with safety helmets, jackets, boots and gloves and other safety equipment.
The workers had informed the minister during an inspection tour of the Kelani Valley railway line recently, that they have been injured on several occasions due to the lack of proper safety gear.
The minister responding to their requests ordered railway officials to provide safety equipment immediately. The minister said it is the responsibility of railway officials to look after the railway labourers and upgrade their welfare facilities.
