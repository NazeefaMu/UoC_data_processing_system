Minimum standards of medical education to be gazetted soon

Steps will be taken to gazette the minimum standards of medical education without delay, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said there is no truth in the accusation made by the Government Medical Officers Association in connection with delaying issuing the gazette notification on the minimum standards of medical education.
The process of gazetting the minimum standards of medical education commenced after 2015. The standards are in the language translation division of the Legal Draftsman's Department, the minister said.
