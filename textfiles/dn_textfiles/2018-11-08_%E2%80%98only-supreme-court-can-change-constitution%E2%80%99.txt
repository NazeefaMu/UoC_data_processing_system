‘Only Supreme Court can change Constitution’

Former ministers such as Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Sagala Ratnayake should join the majority in the Parliament or make a formal complaint at the Supreme Court without getting involved in illegal activities and acts of sabotage in order to mislead the public, Co-Cabinet Spokesman and State Mass Media and Digital Infrastructure Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said.
He was addressing the media at the weekly Cabinet press briefing held at the Government Information Department auditorium in Colombo, yesterday.
Rambukwella said that there was no need to talk about the letter sent to public sector employees by former Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara as there was no validity in it.
“He is not a Cabinet minister anymore. No one can go against gazette notifications issued by the President,” he added.
Minister Rambukwella said it was the same with the letter sent by the former Minister Sagala Ratnayake. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had told that he would act according to the gazette notification issued by the President. All state officials, especially those in Parliament, work according to the gazette notification and nothing else, the minister added. Co-Cabinet Spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that the the former ministers should not attempt to influence state officials and make them break the law, or even the Constitution—something which cannot be done.
Only the Supreme Court had the power to interpret the Constitution. Therefore, the former Prime Minister should go to the Supreme Court if he wished to get it done, he added.
