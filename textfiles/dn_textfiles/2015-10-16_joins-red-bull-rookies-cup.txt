Jaden takes his first step towards MotoGP career
Joins Red Bull Rookies Cup

The amazing achievements by the two young brothers, Jaden and Aaron Gunawardena at the Asia Cup of Road Racing in Japan not only put Sri Lanka on the map of racing but also opened the doors for a Sri Lankan to work their way up to a MotoGP. Although Jaden managed to get an opportunity, twelve year old Aaron would have to wait another year before having a go at the Rookies cup as he does not meet the minimum age.
The 2016 Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup season will be the tenth season of the Red Bulls MotoGP Rookies Cup. After the selection event which is now in progress at Circuito Guadix in Spain the pre-season testing will be held in April 2016 in Aragon. Teenagers from around the world know that the best way of getting a start in Grand Prix motorcycle racing is by entering the Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup. Since its inception in 2007 it has grown into one of the most thrilling 2 wheel spectacles in the world.

The Rookies Cup has released new stars into the world of Grand Prix racing, GP winners and a new generation who will compete through the Moto3, Moto2 and MotoGP classes. Every year the level of competition has climbed and this year's intake are set to raise the bar yet again for the 10th running of the Cup.
If the selection goes as planned Jaden would be starting his International racing career at the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez in April 2016. The series takes a broad sweep around the classic Grand Prix circuits of Europe including the usual run through the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Great Britain and San Marino before ending the year back in Spain again with the Grand Prix of Aragon on September 24 and 25, 2016.
