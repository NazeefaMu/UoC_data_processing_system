Dengue on the rise in South, 12 deaths

From January this year, 4,796 dengue patients were reported from the Southern Province, Provincial Community Health Specialist Harshani Ubesekara said.
Of them, 2,008 were reported from the Galle District including 12 deaths. The Matara district reported 1,625 dengue cases, while 1,163 patients were reported from the Hambantota district. Seven of them died, she said.
Harshani said a comprehensive dengue eradication programme was already in operation in the area along with state and private sector agencies. Arrangements were made to set up emergency treatment units in all rural and regional hospitals. Existing emergency units will be improved, she said.
“The province has eight base hospitals but only the Balapitiya and the Tangalle Hospitals have emergency treatment units. We are to establish emergency units equipped with at least three beds at other hospitals in the district,” Harshani said.
The Provincial Health Ministry is to provide the Balapitiya, Kamburupitiya, Tissa, and Tangalle hospitals with dialysis units, Dr. Harshani said.
