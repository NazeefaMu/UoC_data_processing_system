X’mas gifts to Elders in need

The distribution of X’mas gifts to underprivileged and destitute Senior Citizens at Wattala Devsiri Sevana Home for Elders was conducted by HelpAge Sri Lanka during the X’mas week last month.
Abour 44 Elderly men and women of `Devsiri Sevena’ together with Rev. Father of the Anglican Church, who managed the Home enjoyed the day with the staff of HelpAge Sri Lanka.
It was a very pleasant evening for elders. The ceremony commenced at 3 pm. The elders were between the ages of 60 and 80 years. The programme was conducted on a grand scale. All elders took part in various fun activities, dancing events and musical competitions.
A group of elders with the assistance of all other inmates in the Devsiri Sewana Elders Home presented Sinhala and English X’mas Carols and hymns to the music provided by elders themselves.
The group dancing items, which were presented by elders along with the officials of HelpAge Sri Lanka became an unforgettable scene to everybody.
Council Member Nishantha Gooneratne gave away gifts, while Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge admired the values of elders and services rendered by elders to the society in the past.
HelpAge Finance Manager Sumeda Hastanayaka, Youth Education Director Geethal Mendis and Head of HR Administration Nelum Ekanayake and a large group of HelpAge staff were also present to grace the occasion.
