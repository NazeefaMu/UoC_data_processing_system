So, you want to start-up and develop a small business – Part 08:
Mastering the art of keeping your start-up costs low

Now it’s time we get down to the nitty-gritty. Having come up with an idea that works for you - financially, emotionally, intellectually, marketwise, (or however else you define it) - the next step is to figure out what it will actually cost to start that business and what level of sales you will need to achieve to sustain it.
Figuring out your start-up costs and potential sales is a matter of making educated assumptions. Last week, we suggested that you do a lot of research, much of which will come in handy here. So, what will it cost to start a business like the one you visualize?
The numbers you input here will help you figure out how much money you will need and can make, and they will apply equally to the business plan that you will write (explained next week). Remember, you will incur additional expenses when starting a business from scratch.
One of the most common causes of new business failures is not having enough cash to meet expenses, especially in the first 6-12 months of starting. But if you identify and plan for these costs, this is less likely to happen. You can use our guide to help calculate your start-up costs so you can avoid as many surprises as possible
Expenses
Remember - some of these expenses will not be encountered again - the cost of incorporation, security deposits, that sort of thing. Others are ongoing expenses - marketing materials, rent, and so on.
Calculating these costs is a four-step process. The first three steps help you understand how much money you will need for initial start-up costs, the purchase of assets, and monthly expenses. The fourth step helps you understand your potential sales and how much money you will need to break- even and earn a profit.
As you calculate these expenses, a word of caution is in order: be conservative, both in your analysis and when it comes time to actually purchase these things. Cash is the lifeblood of your business, but especially your new business. And, as a new business, you won’t have the sales or experience to create a steady cash flow to replace what you will be spending.
Don’t blow it. Don’t spend too much. Buy used. Buy from bargain offers. Horde your preciouscapital. Richard Branson once said: “A business has to be involving, it has to be fun, and it has to exercise your creative instincts.” Always remember it.
Step 1: Calculating Start-up Expenses
Put a realistic figure next to each category: (1) Creating your legal structure (sole proprietorship, partnership,or limited liability company): (2) Accountant: (3) Building out the space, decorating, and remodelling: (4) Licenses and permits: (5) Stationery and logos: (6) Marketing and sales materials: (7) First month’s rent and security deposit: (8) Insurance: (9) Telephone and utility deposits: (10) Signs: (11) Internet and website: (12) Others:
(Word of advice about the website! Your website is often the first thing customers will see, and first impressions are everything. There are some good platforms that make building your own site easy, or you may want to pay a professional to take care of it. Either way, site expenses will include the following: Website design/branding, Hosting fees, any software needed and Domain name.
A clean, professional website that is easy to navigate is worth every cent spent.If you do hire a professional, find one who can provide a package deal that includes site design, content, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Even if you start with a smaller package, it will be easier to add SEO later with a company you’ve already been working with.)
Step 2: Purchasing Assets
What kinds of assets will you need in order to open your doors? Real estate: Furniture and fixtures: Equipment and machinery: Vehicles: Inventory: Supplies: Others:
Step 3: Ongoing monthly expenses
Keep adding—and yes, these numbers can be daunting. But the fact is, starting a business is a fairly expensive proposition. That is why it is so important to be smart and frugal.
In this section, you will calculate what it is going to cost to run your business in a typical month. Rent: Utilities: Payroll: Owner’s draw: Supplies: Insurance: Transportation: Legal and accounting: Advertising and marketing: Inventory: Taxes: Debt repayment: Working capital: Others:
Total the ongoing monthly expenses up and multiply the last total by 6. That will tell you how much money you need to run the business for six months. Then, add it to the totals calculated in Steps 1 and 2. This will tell you how much money you need to open your doors and to stay in business for six months.
It isideal to have a minimum of six months’ working capital in the bank before you start.
Example
Let us work out a simple example.
Here’s an example: Suppose you want to open up a small Pizza Parlour
Step 1. Total start-up expenses: Rs. 1,100,000
Step 2. Assets to be purchased: Rs. 750,000
Step 3. Ongoing monthly expenses: Rs 500,000
Start, then, by multiplying the ongoing monthly expenses total (Step 3) by 6 - even that is optimistic, as it will likely be more than six months before your revenues will be consistent. The total is Rs, 3,000,000. Adding Rs. 1,100,000 and Rs. 750,000 (Steps 1 and 2) to that number, we see that your Pizza Parlour should ideally have Rs. 4,850,000 to get up and running.
Note that we said ideally. Not all businesses will have six months’ worth of working capital in the bank before they open their doors. Although six months’ worth is ideal, life and business are not always ideal, and if you will have less than that, it is still possible to make a go of it - it will just be more difficult.
Starting a new business is challenging enough, but having a cash crunch from the get-go makes it that much harder. The six-month figure is intended to give you enough of a cushion to get started, open your doors, create some sales, and move forward.
Now the question is, how much pizza you need to sell to make a profit?
Step 4: Your previous research will tell you how much you can expect to make in this business. The numbers calculated in the preceding steps (especially ongoing monthly expenses) will give you a break-even threshold of sales that you need to achieve.
Your Pizza, for example, must gross at least Rs. 500,000 a month to break even. That means you must earn Rs. 15,667 a day. If an average pizza dinner is, say, Rs.1500, then you must serve at least 11 customers a day to break even. Anything above that figure is profit that can be earmarked initially to pay off the start-up costs.
Although 11 orders a day may seem doable, it will likely take a while for the restaurant to achieve that level of sales. Building a name and reputation takes time. It is far more difficult and expensive to create a new customer than it is to keep an existing one; the problem for new businesses is, of course, that they have no existing customers, so all customers take effort. This simple example assumes that all things remain stable during the six months and you have healthy profit margins.
Having enough money in the bank before you start means that you will have the time necessary to build and grow your start-up. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that it will take at least six months before you, or any business, begins to make a consistent profit.
Finding the money
In our example, your Pizza Parlour should have almost Rs. 500,000 in the bank before the doors open. Wherewill you find that kind of money? The next instalment will explain how to write a business plan that can get you the funding you need, and laterwe will show you where to shop that plan. The money is there; you just need to know where to look.
As the final point, we re-emphasise: it will be the cashflow, not profits, that make or break your business.Even if you make a healthy margin, if you run out of cash, you can’t pay your bills. Even if you are feeling confident about your start-up costs by looking at your financials with a critical (and open) eye doesn’t stop there. It’s important to ensure that as you get on with running your business your costs don’t creep up.
