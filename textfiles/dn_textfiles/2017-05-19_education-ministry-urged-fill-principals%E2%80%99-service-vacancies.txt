Education Ministry urged to fill Principals’ Service vacancies

A collective of education sector trade unions, including the Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) urged the Education Ministry to take action to fill vacancies of the Principals’ Service.
The collective of education sector trade unions, while holding a media conference yesterday alleged that the authorities are delaying the appointment of qualified principals for vacancies.
Ceylon Teachers' Union Chief Secretary Joseph Stalin addressing the media said that selected persons for Grade 3 and 2 of the principals’ service have not been inducted to needy schools.
Two recruitment examinations for the Principals’ service have been held in 2009 and 2015 aiming to fill vacancies in schools.
Base on the result of the examinations, qualified persons were absorbed to the Principals’ Service after a training.
But the Education Ministry has failed to give schools to these selected persons since acting principals are performing at school, where there are vacancies.
Stalin requested speedy appointments for those who passed principal grade examinations.
He said the authorities are delaying the appointments in support of acting principals who have not passed any principal grade examinations.
According to him, most acting principals are henchmen and supporters of the henchmen and supporters of Provincial level politicians.
“Most acting principals are henchmen and supporters of national and provincial level politicians.
Politicians are safeguarding these acting principals instead of appointing the qualified persons, who have been absorbed to the Principals’ service,” he said.
It is up to the Education Ministry to take action to appoint the qualified principals, he said.
