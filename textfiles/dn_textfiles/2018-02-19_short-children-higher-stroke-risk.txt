Short children at higher stroke risk

Short children are at greater risk of suffering a stroke later in life, according to new research. The latest findings were based on more than 300,000 Danish schoolchildren born between 1930 and 1989.
Those who were two inches shorter than average at seven, 10 and 13 were 11 per cent more likely to have an ischaemic stroke as adults than their taller peers. This is the most common form of the disease where a clot blocks blood and oxygen flow to the brain. Most cases were diagnosed between the ages of 55 and 75.
Men, who were short as children were also 11 per cent more likely to suffer a stroke triggered by bleeding on the brain, called an intracerebral haemorrhage. This did not apply to women.
Strokes, which occur when the blood supply to the brain is cut off, are the third most common cause of premature death and a leading cause of disability in the UK. They affect 57,000 people a year in England, alone.
The average height of a 13 year old child is five feet three with a seven year old measuring around four feet. A previous study of more than a million adults found those who were two and a half inches taller than average were six and ten percent less likely to die from an ischaemic and intracerebral haemorrhage, respectively.
But this is the first of its kind to look at the link with height in childhood. It could lead to prevention strategies, such as promoting healthier lifestyles for youngsters and encouraging women to eat well in pregnancy.
Senior study author Professor Jennifer Baker said: 'Our study suggests short height in children is a possible marker of stroke risk and suggests these children should pay extra attention to changing or treating modifiable risk factors for stroke throughout life to reduce the chances of having this disease.'
These include healthier diets and protecting against stress, said Professor Baker who is a metabolic geneticist at the University of Copenhagen.
She added: 'Although short stature has associations with the risk of stroke that are nearly as strong as for body mass index, studies investigating growth, as opposed to weight gain, have been neglected.
'A potential explanation is that it is not possible to intervene on adult height, and the effects of doing so in childhood are uncertain.
'However, in addition to being genetically determined, adult height is a marker of exposures affecting childhood growth - for example, maternal diet during pregnancy, childhood diet, infection, and psychological stress - of which many are modifiable and all are thought to affect the risk of stroke.'
Researchers noted that a decline in stroke incidence and mortality rates in most high-income countries, mainly in women, occurred simultaneously with a general increase in adult height.
