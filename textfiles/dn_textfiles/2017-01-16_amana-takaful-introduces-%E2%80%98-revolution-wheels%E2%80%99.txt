Amana Takaful introduces   ‘The Revolution on Wheels’

Amana Takaful revolutionised the insurance industry with the introduction of ‘Takaful’ Insurance, which shifted the focus of ‘benefits’ from the company to the customer.
Stemming from a concept steeped in tradition that has endured for over a thousand years, rooted in the principles of Transparency, Mutuality and Trust and steadfast in their attitude of Equality (“Open to All”), Amana Takaful has made a considerable impact on the industry, redefining the way insurance is looked at.
Within the principles of Takaful (Mutuality), Amana Takaful has offered a range of solutions to their customers, fulfilling the entire gamut of insurance needs, from ‘Motor’ (Total Drive), ‘Business’ (Business Cover), ‘Travel’ (Travel Pal), ‘Education’ (Adhyapana) and even an exclusive solution for ‘Ladies’ (Crystalline) , to name a few. Living up to their standard of Mutuality and reaffirming their attitude of Equality (“Open to All”), Amana Takaful has revamped and relaunched their solutions for Motor Bikes (Smart Rider Cover) and Three Wheelers (TukTukFull) under the theme ‘The Revolution on Wheels’, providing unprecedented benefits and considerable relief to Motorcycle Riders and Three Wheel Drivers.
“We are pleased to fulfil our promise to our customers, by offering comprehensive solutions which provide significant relief to every single citizen of this country, from any accident or mishap that may occur on the road. These policies are intended to function as a ‘safety net’ in case of tragedy, for Motorcycle Riders and Threewheel Drivers, an objective we are faithfully committed to, as a Protection and Indemnity Solutions Provider in Sri Lanka”, stated Fazal Gaffoor, CEO of Amana Takaful, at the press conference held recently, for the launch of these two innovative insurance solutions.
“These two new solutions, along with all others provided by Amana Takaful, could be obtained by visiting or calling any of our branches spread throughout the island, which will assist you in obtaining the solution best suited to you, wherever you are in the country, thus keeping to our commitment of being “Open to All””, Gaffoor also said.
