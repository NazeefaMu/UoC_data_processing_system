President stresses improving attendance in Parliament

President Maithripala Sirisena stressed the need of improving attendance of Parliamentarians and having their active contribution in committee deliberations to enhance Parliament’s efficiency.
He also strongly advocated for an increased female representation in the Legislature for improved efficiency.
“There are 225 MPs in our Parliament, but we struggle to maintain the quorum of 20 MPs during the sittings.
Parliament sits only for eight days per month,” the President said.
“The Consultative Committee meetings and other Oversight Committee Meetings often get postponed due to poor attendance of MPs,” he said.
“The contributions of the committees largely impact the country’s development,” the President noted.
The President’s comments came in the wake of Parliament sittings coming to abrupt endings frequently due lack of quorum of MPs over the past few weeks.
President Sirisena was addressing the inauguration ceremony of “EvalColombo2018”, the first-ever global conference on evaluation, in Colombo yesterday.
The three-day forum themed “Responsible Parliaments: Embracing Evaluation for Agenda 2030” is attended by 104 MPs from across the globe and about another 150 stakeholders representing various governments and civil society organisations.
“There is a belief that women are more efficient than men. Fifty two percent of our population is women. To my belief, if we can increase female representation in Parliament at least to 60 percent, it will help increase the efficiency of our Parliament,” the President opined.
“There are 1.5 million public servants in our country, but as per the reports, public sector efficiency is only 30-35 percent. This is not a satisfactory level at all. The efficiency of politicians influence the efficiency of public servants,” he added.
The President also stressed the need to focus on national data and information to attain sustainable development goals.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, delivering the welcome speech, said large sums of public money are being wasted due to lack of proper evaluation and plans. “We need to make sure that the public funds are being used efficiently and effectively,” he added.
The Speaker said the conference organised by the ‘Global Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation’ and ‘Sri Lanka Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation’ was an example of having fruitful Parliament to Parliament relations.
The Speaker pointed out that the “Parliament diplomacy” was a concept initiated by him in 2016.

Policies without evaluation cast burdens on the people - PM
Disna Mudalige
Sri Lanka is a classic example of policy without evaluation that ultimately resulted in burdens on the people and high level of debt, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
“We would not have had this high level of debt if there had been policy evaluation,” the Premier said referring to the Sooriyawewa Cricket Stadium, Mattala International Airport and Hambantota harbour as examples of investments with no returns.
The Prime Minister was addressing the inauguration ceremony of “EvalColombo2018,”the first-ever global conference on evaluation, in Colombo yesterday.
The forum themed “Responsible Parliaments: Embracing Evaluation for Agenda 2030” is attended by 104 MPs from across the globe and about another 150 stakeholders representing various governments and civil society organisations.
“Much of the borrowings could have been avoided or put into more useful sectors if we had done the evaluation. Most of our spending had gone into non-tradable goods without doing research,” the Premier said.
We have to start again to turn them around as tradable goods,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe noted.
The Premier, observing that a Private-Public Partnership has been initiated to develop the Hambantota Port and that similar arrangements are being negotiated with regard to the Mattala Airport, however said that turning around the Suriyawewa Cricket Stadium is beyond hope.
“I don’t think we can ever make arrangements to successfully run a cricket field in the middle of nowhere and next to a wildlife national park. Only elephants come to play in this cricket field,” the Prime Minister commented.
“The end result is that we somehow have to pay back the loans. We have no option but to raise our revenue by increasing the taxes, and you being public representatives, know how hard this is,” he told the gathering.
“We have to restart our whole economic policy. That will take a few years,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. He also expressed his confidence that “EvalColombo2018” would result in the introduction of an evaluation culture in Sri Lanka.
“We do policy making, implementing and monitoring, but we rarely go into the benefits and impacts of our policies. “Policies are not for the politicians, but for the people. We have taken measures to strengthen Parliament after 2015, especially through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
We have set up Oversight Committees and a Public Finance Committee, and we will bring in legislation shortly to set up the Parliamentary Budget Office. These are in addition to COPE and COPA. We have to bring in evaluation as part of the functions of the Oversight Committees and such evaluation reports must be presented in Parliament,” he noted.
The Chair of the ‘Global Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation’ and Minister Kabir Hashim, recalling that the first draft of National Evaluation Policy was presented by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe in 2001, named him as the “Sri Lanka’s political champion for an evaluation culture”. “The PM has started the ball rolling and we are determined to go all the way until we attain the results.
This is our civic responsibility. We do this voluntarily because we believe in good governance.
Evaluation as a tool serves the ordinary people who elect the politicians. Every penny counts with depleting natural and financial resources all over the world,” he added.
