Mahinda Rajapaksa leads MPs not attending parliamentary sittings: Muthuhettigama

Former President, Kurunegala MP Mahinda Rajapaksa has set up a record as the parliamentarian who has not attended parliamentary sittings the most number of times, Ports and Shipping Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama said.
He was addressing a press conference at Galle on September 7.
He said it was not to join the Joint Opposition but to remain independent that he requested SLFPers to leave government ranks.
"They could not remain in the Government since fraud and corruption was rampant in it. When they try to highlight the corruptions, they were marginalised. That is why I talked less in parliament. There was nothing to praise in the Government," he said.
He said the opposition was performing its duties strongly while the Government was acting weakly. "They would request the President to direct powerful ministers to steer the country on the correct path at least now," he said.
He said Agriculture Minister and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake held second with regard to absenteeism in parliament after Mahinda Rajapaksa. "I am the third]," Muthuhettigama said. He said he kept away from parliament because there was nothing to talk. He said he requested the President to establish a SLFP Government by 2020 rallying round disgruntled elements in the Joint Opposition.
"It would enable them to engage in lively debates and useful discussions in parliament," he said.
