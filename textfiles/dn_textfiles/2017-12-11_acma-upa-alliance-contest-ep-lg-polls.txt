ACMA, UPA Alliance to contest Ep LG polls

The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) led by Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen and the United Peace Alliance (UPA) led by MP Basheer Segu Dawood have agreed to contest the upcoming LG polls together under the United People’s Alliance (UPA) banner.
The UPA will field candidates for the Muslim dominated areas in the Eastern Province under the Peacock symbol.
SLMC Former Secretary General M.T. Hassan Ali has been appointed as the chairman of the new party.
“This is a turning point in Sri Lanka’s Muslim political history. The ACMC I lead and the United Peace Alliance led by Basheer Segu Dawood MP are joining to form the United People’s Alliance (UPA). The UPA we are creating today will first contest in the Eastern Province where a Muslim majority exists.
UPA will enter local politics in the Ampara District in the forthcoming LG polls. The symbol of UPA is the Peacock and its Chairperson is M.T. Hassan Ali, former Secretary General of SLMC,” Bathiudeen said.
“Hassan Ali, being a former Parliamentarian and a State Minister, is well positioned to start off UPA’s journey. As the leader of the ACMC, my role in the UPA is to be decided later on,” the minister said addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
United Peace Alliance Secretary Ali said he appreciated the stand taken by the Minister to form an alliance to propagate the Muslim community’s interest in the east.
“He could have declared himself the leader of this alliance, but he gave me the leadership of the alliance. We praise Minister Bathiudeen for his concern towards the Muslim community,” Ali said.
