Bahrain tourism industry to reach US$1 billion by 2020

The tourism industry in the Kingdom of Bahrain is growing rapidly and is expected to reach US$1 billion by 2020, according to figures released ahead of Arabian Travel Market 2017, which takes place at the Dubai World Trade Centre April 24-27.
Bahrain witnessed an 8.4% increase in inbound traffic in the third quarter of 2016 and a peak of 1.4 million arrivals during the month of August. With the Bahrain Tourism and Exhibition Authority (BTEA) spearheading a robust marketing campaign, the Kingdom expects to welcome 15.8 million annual visitors by 2018. This will represent an increase of 36.2% on current figures and will place the country’s tourism industry on track to reach its $1 billion 2020 target.
Simon Press, Senior Exhibition Director, ATM, said, “The Bahrain Tourism and Exhibition Authority has engaged with a number of public authorities and private sector organisations over recent months and the returns are beginning to be realised.”
