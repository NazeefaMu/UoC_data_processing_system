Lawful, disciplined drivers in Colombo to be awarded

A special programme to award lawful and disciplined drivers in Colombo will be launched by the police from Monday (18).
The programme will continue for few weeks in the Colombo area. Police officers will be posted at several locations in Colombo who will inspect drivers’ conduct, identify disciplined/lawful drivers and present them stickers and gift vouchers.
It is a concept of Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara. He will participate in the first day of the programme in Colombo today. The police implemented a similar programme in Kandy from August 15 to 20 in Kandy and gave out gifts and vouchers for 300 selected drivers.
The Asiri Health provides its support to the Police in the programme.
