State Minister Senasinghe hails Turkish investors

At the invitation of the Embassy of the Republic of Turkey in Sri Lanka a ministerial delegation led by State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe together with the representatives from Board of Investment (BOI), Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) and Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) are currently in Turkey attending meetings related to trade and investment promotions.
The delegation will also attend the 86th Izmir International Fair opening ceremony and seminar program.
The State Minister was awarded a ceremonial welcome by the Minister of Trade and Customs and Deputy Minister of Economy in Turkey.
State Minister Senasinghe held very productive meetings with trade chambers in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir in addition to attending the Izmir International Fair. Investments and Sri Lanka's entry into the Turkish market are stated as at the top of his agenda.
“As our bilateral trade grows I invite the prospective Turkish investors to invest in Sri Lanka. We have allocated 20,000 acres for five free trade zones of which the first will be opened at Kalutara District. Also investors could gain immediate access to South Asia's huge market through us,” said State Minister Senasinghe addressing the Ankara Chamber of Industry.
He has proposed to initiate a Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) with Turkey's aggressive attempts to strengthen economic relations between two countries. The two parties took stock of all exports and investment engagements especially in the textile, tea and boat building sectors. One of the major highlights of the State Minister's visit was his efforts to introduce Sri Lanka's new products to the Turkish market.
State Minister Senasinghe will be attending the opening ceremony of Izmir International Fair and he will address the Turkish Business community during the Sri Lanka business day seminar at the Izmir Fair.
