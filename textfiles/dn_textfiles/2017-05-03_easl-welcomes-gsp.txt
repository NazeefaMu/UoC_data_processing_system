EASL welcomes GSP+

The Exporter’s Association of Sri Lanka (EASL) has welcomed the efforts of the government to secure the vote from the EU Parliament to regain GSP+.
Once the concession is fully in place, Sri Lankan exporters can look forward to being in a position to be more competitive, thus revive markets and capture new export opportunities.
Exporters of apparel, fish and seafood, ceramics, spices, fruits and vegetables and floriculture in particular, will be able to increase their exports to the EU and enhance forex earnings,the EASL said.
