CEB worker unrest due to acts of last govt.

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said that the previous administration should be held responsible for the present unrest of the CEB employees. He said that the past regime had granted huge increments to the top level staff ignoring the workers in the lowest grades.
“It was also a creation of the past regime which granted big increments to the high level workforce ignoring the workers in the lower grades,” the President said . He added that Facebook and certain social websites had become obstructions to the Government efforts to build national unity and religious accord.
