The Lanka Powerboat Association (LPA) is bringing two international powerboat events to Sri Lanka this November.
This unique, action-packed powerboat event which will feature Formula 2 (Super Cat) and P750/Thundercat powerboats will take place at Bentota on November 11 and 12.
All of the invited drivers will be providing a thrilling water sports experience at the lagoon and in the sea. The event features two days of white knuckle, edge of the seat racing by international champion powerboatdrivers in P750/Thundercat and F2 (Supercat) boats.
The championship will consist of circuit and offshore racing with the drivers of both classes of boats jostling for positions on the water in two finals to crown the winners.
Water based Power Sports have mass appeal to all ages offering fantastic entertainment. Thousands of spectators now follow Powerboat Racing, which is positioning itself as one of the most prominent watersports of the 21st century.

This will provide professional training for our future generations of Aquabike/Jet Ski racing competitors and officials. It is one of the highest priorities of the UIM. There goal is to establish a world-wide network of training centres to ensure the success and growth of the sport in all its disciplines, with Sri Lanka being the first.
The secrets of safe, responsible and environmentally friendly racing start with good training and attracting those who will be our Aquabike/Jet Ski stars of the future. The LPA is looking for eight people who would like to participate in the Ambassador Training Program.
