Heavy rains in Galle

Owing to the torrential rains that lashed throughout Galle from Saturday until yesterday morning, vast expanses of low-lying areas in and around Galle and a number of highways were inundated with rainwater causing immense hardship to the public.
The highest rainfall (175mm) was recorded within the Four Gravets Divisional Secretariat division.
Dangedara, Julgaha Junction, Wackwella Road, Sanghamittapura, Didiswatte, and Ambalwatte were among the areas which were flooded.
Almost all leading access roads to Karapitiya Teaching Hospital were waterlogged and traffic movement was completely interrupted. The ambulances that handled emergency cases had to find alternative ways to reach the hospital.
Galle Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said that they had to assist a number of vehicles that were dispatching emergency patients from other provinces to the hospital during the night.
DMC officials said that a house at Bataganwila was damaged by a landslide and a portion of hillock at Heenpendala had slid onto the road.
