CIMA Business Leaders Summit on September 11

CIMA Business Leaders Summit 2017 organized on the theme “What’s Next: The changing business landscape” will be held on September 11, from 9.00 am at the Oak Room, Cinnamon Grand, Colombo.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the Chief Guest and will make the keynote address at 6.30 pm.
This year’s discussions are underpinned by the wider concept of business innovation; how organizations are adopting digital business models whilst creating value for their stakeholders and addressing pressing issues such as climate change and global and domestic factors, which have an impact on their business practices.
Mohit Pande, Country Head - India, Google Cloud, will speak on how Google is disrupting traditional business models, with a particular focus on Google’s future developments and how organizations will have to adapt to remain agile in the face of such challenges. Currently, Pande leads Google’s business for Cloud in India and has extensive experience in the technology industry in India and South East Asia.
Another key presentation at this year’s summit will be delivered by Azran Osman-Rani, CEO and Group COO, iflix Malaysia. Iflix is a disruptive internet television video-on-demand subscription service which was launched in May 2015 and now operates across South East Asia.
With his immense experience in leading businesses from start-ups to IPO (he was previously the founding CEO of Air Asia X, the world’s pioneer low-cost, long haul airline), Osman-Rani will share his insights on cultivating a global mindset for organizational growth and how Asia’s emergence as an economic power presents new opportunities that organizations can take advantage of.
