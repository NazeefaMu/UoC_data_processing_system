Health Minister requests PM to re-investigate Avant Garde case

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to re-examine the judgement of the Attorney General on Avant Garde and re-investigate the case.
Minister Senaratne said people are questioning when the government punishes robbers. There are issues in the conduct of the Justice Minister. He delayed investigations into crucial issues for two years, he said.
Minister Senaratne made these observations at the inauguration of a new bus stand at Dompe, Kirindiwela recently.
The minister said the cases relating to the previous regime should be heard every day similarly to the way cases on Vidya’s murder and Bharatha Lakshman’s murder is heard.
