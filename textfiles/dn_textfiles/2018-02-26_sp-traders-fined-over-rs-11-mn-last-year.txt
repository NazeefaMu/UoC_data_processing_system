SP traders fined over Rs. 11 mn last year

Southern Province (SP) Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) investigation officials have collected Rs. 11,488,000 from errant traders as court fines through sudden raids and mobile inspections conducted in the South during last year.
The total number of raids done in the Southern region during 2017 was 2,772.
Accordingly, the number of raids carried out in the Galle district was 768 and the revenue collected from them was Rs. 3,435,500, raids conducted in the Matara district were 972 and the income collected was Rs. 3,903,500, and the number of raids made in the Hambantota district was 982 and a revenue of Rs. 4,149,000 was obtained through them.
Errant traders were prosecuted at the Galle, Matara, and Hambantota Magistrates’ Courts. Charges filed against them were selling rice at exorbitant rates, hoarding of rice varieties, sale and display of food items unsuitable for human consumption, altering set prices on labels, selling electrical appliances without issuing warranty cards, masking of price tags, among other offences.
Given the rising number of complaints by the public regarding such malpractices, the CAA has increased its number of sudden raids and mobile inspections, investigation officials said.
The CAA is also currently conducting awareness programmes on consumer rights for schoolchildren, members of voluntary organisations, the public, and the trading community.
CAA officers conducted the aforementioned raids on the instructions of the Industries and Trade Ministry and under the supervision of the Galle, Matara, and Hambantota District Secretaries, officials added.
