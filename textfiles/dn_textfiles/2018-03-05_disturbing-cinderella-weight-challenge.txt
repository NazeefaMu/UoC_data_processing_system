Disturbing 'Cinderella weight challenge'

With their huge eyes, massive eyelashes, teeny-tiny waists and chirpy demeanours, many of aspired to be a Disney princess when we were younger.
Then reality - and age - taught us that, endearing though they may be, they’re just cartoon characters after all, and don’t always translate into the real world. This fact hasn’t stopped the latest diet challenge, however. At its focus is Cinderella!
While Cinderella may have taught us “a dream is a wish your heart makes”, her proportions could only belong in a fairytale.
Which makes the ‘Cinderella weight challenge’ all the more dangerous. The challenge basically asks followers to reach a BMI of 18, which is officially classed as being underweight.
To calculate your ‘Cinderella weight’, you have to square your height in metres and then multiply that number by 18.
Thought to have started in Japan, the trend is quickly spreading.
Several people on Twitter have been sharing the worrying amount of weight they’d have to lose to complete the challenge.
The diet challenge has also been slammed for its use of ‘Cinderella’, which romanticises the idea of the extreme weight loss being encouraged.
While a person’s “normal weight” may vary, a healthy BMI is 18.5 to 24.9. Mirror
