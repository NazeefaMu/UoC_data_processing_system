Saegis  Campus   launches  scheme   for less priviledged students

Saegis Campus has stepped forward to lend a helping hand to students from low-income backgrounds to gain the opportunity to enroll for higher educational degrees by launching a special scheme in collaboration with some of the leading Banks in the country .
This scheme constitutes a special fund launched by Saegis Campus that can be utilized by these students to study for a degree that matches their talents and interests. The students will not have to pay for their studies immediately but would instead, utilize the funds offered by Saegis Campus to pay for their degree.
This also means the student will not require to provide any guarantees to the Bank, as the Campus would act as the guarantor for the student. The students would only commence paying for their studies upon completing their degree and gaining employment. Once employed, the student would contribute a particular portion of their salary towards the payment of the degree, over an agreed period of time
Outlining the mission of launching such a scheme, Bandara Dissanayake, Founder and Chairman of Saegis Campus stated “It has always been my mission to pay particular attention to gifted and talented students, to identify them and to ensure that their learning needs were are met. It must be remembered that such students deserve to be given every opportunity and support to make the best use of their potential and help them to use their abilities to the betterment of themselves and the organizations they serve. If we aim for high achieving, well-rounded, thoughtful learners to be produced in our country, who are ready and confident to take on new challenges and new opportunities that will lead to new industries and new markets being formed through their entrepreneurial vision or outlook, it will in turn contribute positively towards the betterment of our economy and the business landscape of the country.
Bandara continued “With the economy and global marketplace constantly changing, and the cost of higher education continuing to rise, we hope that launching special schemes of this nature, will pave the pathway towards helping our younger generation not to be hampered due to lack of funds to enhance their talents and pursuing the career of their dreams . Therefore, identifying gifted and talented students and giving them the right opportunities in life to have progressive careers will be a continuing voyage that SAEGIS will undertake as a key constituent of our mission.”
