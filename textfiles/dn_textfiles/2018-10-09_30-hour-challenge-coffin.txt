30-hour challenge coffin

Adventure lovers are you ready for the best 30 hours of your life?
A theme park called Six Flags amusement park in Missouri is holding a contest for the brave hearts- those taking part will have to stay in a coffin for nearly 30 hours straight!
The Fright Fest 30-Hour Coffin Challenge will take place October 13 and reward those who make it through the night with two 2019 Gold Season Passes, a Fright Fest prize package, two VIP Haunted House passes and a ticket for two to ride the Freak Train for Freak Unleashed, reported Fox News.
The winner will also be entered in a draw for a 300 USD prize.
The amusement park will provide a deluxe 2’ x 7’ coffin along with one six-minute bathroom break every hour. Phone charging stations and meals are also included.
The competitors are allowed to bring a friend during the operating hours, but once the park closes, coffin dwellers will be left alone. However, Six Flags assured its guests that a representative will be present at all times.
Are you brave enough to take up this challenge? You can also take the coffin home if you win!
