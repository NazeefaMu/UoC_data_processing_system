Questions and answers

Property rights of an adopted child
Question
I am an adopted child. My adoptive father passed away and my adoptive mother is living with her elder brother. She is trying to sell the property and house and donate the money to her brother’s children. I am frustrated as I have no place to live with my children. She says that I am not entitled to any property because I am an adopted child. Is an adopted child entitled to parent’s property?
- Ruvini, Kadawatha
Answer
If you are a legally adopted child, you are entitled to your parent’s property. But a person can transfer his/her property to any person by a deed or last will. If your father died leaving his own property, then half of his property goes to your mother and the other half goes to you, as you are the only child. Therefore, you can claim your inherited property.
