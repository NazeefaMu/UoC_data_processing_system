Flemingo opens first of its kind duty free store at BIA

"With the upward trend in Sri Lanka tourism and new airlines flying to Sri Lanka creating an increased transit market, we see great opportunities in Sri Lanka," said Abraham Alexander, GM Operations, Flemingo Duty Free. Speaking to Daily News Business, he said that they have strong sales especially from the departure section and surprisingly the main area of sales are from chocolates. “I think this is the highest sales record in the region in this segment.”
He however ruled out opening up another shop at the Mattala international airport. “For now we don’t have plans to open there.”
He said that the ban in selling tobacco especially at the arrivals is an issue. “However this is a decision taken by the government and we respect that. We not happy that there are a lot of uncalled for taxes for tobacco sales at the departure section too and this is worrying.”
He said that they have a very strong market in the departure lounge specially form Maldivians and Indians and this segment is growing.
“Flemingo Duty Free has opened its new departure store at the Bandaranaike International Airport”, said CEO, Flemingo Duty Free, Sri Lanka, P.K. Thimmayya.
