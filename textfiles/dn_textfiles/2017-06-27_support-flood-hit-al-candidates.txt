Support for flood-hit A/L candidates

All candidates due to appear for G.C.E. (A/L) Examination - 2017 from the recent flood and landslide-hit administrative districts are to be assisted by the Examinations Department.
This is according to a request by Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
Accordingly, Commissioner General of Examinations W. M. N. J. Pushpakuamara made arrangements to provide past question paper kits to affected students free of charge to get them ready for the forthcoming (A/L) Examination.
These have been handed over to zonal education offices of flood-hit administrative districts, said Kurunegala District Senior Director of Education W. M. Balasooriya.
