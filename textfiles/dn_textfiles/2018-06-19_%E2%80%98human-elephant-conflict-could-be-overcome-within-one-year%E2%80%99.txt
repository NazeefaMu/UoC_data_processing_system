‘Human-Elephant conflict could be overcome within one year’

The prevailing Human-Elephant (HE) Conflict in the country that had caused numerous difficulties to the public, could be overcome within a year if the recently proposed plans could be continued directly sans any obstacles, Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka said.
Addressing a gathering at Kekirawa, recently, he added that non-governmental organisations that depend on foreign currency were levelling baseless allegations regarding the environment and wild animals. They had seen animals only at the zoo, not in the jungle. Therefore, intelligentsia do not heed such claims.
The minister said, “After assuming my duties, I decided to launch a plan to end the existing human-elephant conflict within one year.
Accordingly, necessary physical resources would be provided for that purpose. At present, the electrified fences spanning a distance of 4,000 kilometres would be further expanded to an additional 2,500 kilometres.”
Minister Fonseka said lands for two enclosures would be allocated in the Horowpathana and Lunugamvehera areas as well.
Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma also participated.
