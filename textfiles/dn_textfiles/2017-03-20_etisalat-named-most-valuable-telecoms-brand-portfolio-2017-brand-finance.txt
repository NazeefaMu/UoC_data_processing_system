Etisalat named most  valuable Telecoms Brand Portfolio for 2017 by Brand Finance

Etisalat is recognised as the most valuable of any telecoms brand portfolio in the Middle East by leading London based brand valuation and strategy consultancy ‘Brand Finance’. This recognition was mainly due to its focused programme on brand activities, management of significant global sponsorship properties and local events targeted at both consumer and business customers as well as the increased revenues has contributed to the brand value.
Etisalat headquartered in UAE has its brand presence in Egypt, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, the company has ownership stakes in Mobily in KSA, Ufone and PTCL in Pakistan, and Maroc Telecom and Moov brands in Africa. At a value of US$ 7,728bn, this places the Etisalat Group portfolio a comfortable US$ 1.5bn ahead of second-placed telco.
A key contribution to this result was an increase in the strength of its flagship brand, Etisalat, jumping from a rating of AA- last year to AA+ for 2017. This is the first time the consulting firm has evaluated a brand based on its portfolio. Etisalat Group was also assessed on its focussed programme of brand activities, mainly comprising of the management of significant global sponsorship properties such as FC Barcelona, as well as local events targeted at both consumer and business customers.
Brand Finance values thousands of brands annually to compile its ‘Global 500’ and ‘Telecoms 500’ listings, as well as numerous other sector, region and individual market league tables.
Commenting on Etisalat’ s strategy, Brand Finance CEO David Haigh said: “As well as developing its core brand, Etisalat has pursued a broader brand portfolio strategy to build business value through leveraging branded assets. Brands such as Mobily in Saudi Arabia provide access to very significant GCC markets and in addition, the portfolio approach has provided a foothold in key regional territories adjacent to the Middle East base - for example through Maroc Telecom in North Africa and in Pakistan. The latter gives the opportunity for branded development of a broader converged proposition, involving mobile and fixed line operators Ufone and PTCL. This brand portfolio strategy opens up a range of opportunities in the future to use brand as a means of growing further business value.”
