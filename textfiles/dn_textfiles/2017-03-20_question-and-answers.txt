Issues on arbitration
Q: I am a law student following a Diploma in Arbitration. Canarbitration take place out of Colombo? What is the difference between ad-hoc and institutional arbitration?
A: Under Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995, arbitration of a dispute can take place in any part of the country.
However, under the Arbitration Act enforcement, applications under Section 31 (1) has to be made to the High Court and challenges to Arbitration awards under Section 32 should also be made to the High Court. Incidental applications should also be made to the High Court.
The High Court referred to in the Act has been defined under Section 50. "High Court" means the High Court of Sri Lanka situated in the judicial zone of Colombo or situated in such other zone, as may be, designated by the Minister with the concurrence of the Chief Justice by Order published in the Gazette.
In the circumstances, until such time, the Provincial High Courts are designated by the Minister with the concurrence of the Chief Justice even if arbitration takes place in a place other than Colombo. The relevant High Court before an application for enforcement should be made is the Colombo High Court.
Arbitration when administered by an institution according to the rules of the institution accepted by parties to the arbitration is designated as institutional arbitration.
When no specified institutional rules are referred to in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitration that takes place proceed on an ad-hoc basis on rules agreed by the arbitrators at the time of arbitration.
In many circumstances of ad-hoc arbitration, parties and arbitrators informally follow accepted model arbitration rules such as those of the UNCTAD. The advantage of institutional arbitration is that the responsibility for organizing the arbitration is entrusted to arbitration institutionally.
