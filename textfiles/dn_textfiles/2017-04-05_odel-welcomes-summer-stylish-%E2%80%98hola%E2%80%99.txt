ODEL welcomes summer with stylish ‘Hola!’

In a new collection that will instantly have fashionist as queuing to fit on, style authority ODEL has perfectly captured the vibe and faded charm of Cuban aesthetics to welcome the summer fashion season with a resounding ‘Hola!’
The shabby chic, cool and easy-going feel inspired by República de Cuba has been cleverly combined with the imperatives of Sri Lankan fashion to create pieces that look straight off the designer catwalks of world capitals but are impeccably in sync with local climes and moods.
ODEL’s ever increasing emphasis, post-acquisition by Softlogic, on offering top-notch global fashion brands and real-time styles alongside high street labels has taken a step further with this latest collection, with a greater focus on flamboyance.
Designs inspired by Balmain, Chanel, Rochas, Tibi, Etro, Dolce &Gabbana and Michael Kors to name a few, reflect the exuberance and creativity of tailored shapes and free-flowing fabrics, with bold hues juxtaposed with sun-faded pastels in a tribute to the fashion world’s current love affair with Havana.
Summer would not be the same without striking prints, and the new collection has plenty – from Cuban souvenir, floral patterns and outlines, ethnic geometrics and bird life. The colour palette for the collection is a mix of bright shades of fuscia, red, orange, green, blue and yellow. As always, ODEL’s collections, available at 22 trend-defining stores, cater to all age groups, genders and sizes, and encompass shoes, bags and other fashion accessories, making it the single destination for all things fashion.
