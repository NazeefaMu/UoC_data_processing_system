HNB completes SME awareness  program in Kuliyapitiya

Local pioneers in the field of Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) lending, HNB PLC, announced the recent successful conclusion of another awareness and financial capacity building workshop for SME customers in the Kuliyapitiya region.

“The nation’s SME sector continues to serve as one of the primary sources of employment and income generation for thousands of Sri Lankans across the island. Our goal is to provide not only the access to finance, but also advisory and related services that will help these businesses to grow, and in so doing, serve as a reliable partner in that growth,” HNB Deputy General Manager - SME & Midmarket, Jude Fernando.
HNB Expo credit scheme, 27th Lane Business Hub, Web X Pay, ERP Solution and Insurance were among some of the key products highlighted during the programme.
HNB will continue this process in other regions as well in order to strengthen the financial knowledge and digital literacy of SMEs in Sri Lanka.
