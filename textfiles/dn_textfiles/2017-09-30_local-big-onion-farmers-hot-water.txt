Local big onion farmers in hot water

The tax on imported big onions has been increased by one hundred percent by the government with immediate effect. But, the price of indigenous big onions is still the same. Its price is less than Rs. 40 per kilo, the farmers said.
Currently, the Dambulla Dedicated Economic Centre is receiving indigenous big onions while imported onions are freely available in the market.
Due to the inclement weather, big onion cultivation during the current season had reduced.
The farmers had cultivated less than 2,000 acres in the district, while it is not sufficient at all. Hence, they had to shoulder a huge expense for the big onion cultivation. However, the anticipated big onion harvest could not be obtained in the current season. Meanwhile, its price has also dropped sharply.
Moreover, the businessmen have stocked onions in large quantities and is gradually releasing their stocks to the market.
Therefore, it is directly influencing the price of indigenous big onions.
Under this situation, the local farmers are in hot water and are helpless. The new tax increase has only benefited the businessmen because they have now stocked imported big onions sufficiently.
Therefore, the farmers urge the government to take immediate action to purchase the indigenous big onions from the local farmers at a reasonable rate.
