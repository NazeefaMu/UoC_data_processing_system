Rag Returns!

‘Rag – The Musical’ is a work of fiction inspired by the experiences of its creator Jehan Aloysius and his University batch-mates, and deals with the topical issue of ragging sensitively and intelligently. The musical, which is filled with memorable melodies and meaningful lyrics, presents a positive message of non-violence and unity which is relevant to students in all educational institutions. The three nights limited engagement at the Lionel Wendt theatre will be staged on November 2, 4 and 5.
The show’s creator Aloysius states, “The cast has come a long way over the last few months. CentreStage Productions always promotes new talent in the lead roles, rather than relying on a star system of regular leads. As a result, we feel we’re constantly adding to the talent pool of performers of the English and Sinhala theatre by training new performers to become stars. It’s a risk and extremely hard work for the director. Yet it’s one worth taking – especially when the new talent finally blossoms by delivering an excellent performance! The absence of the star-system also allows for a generous sharing of ideas, skills and advice without any barriers of egos.”
The cast believes that ‘Rag’, being a home-grown original musical, would be a radical counterpoint to the more glitzy foreign imports.
The musical is written and composed by Jehan Aloysius. Avanti Perera performed the music tracks and orchestrated Aloysius’s melodies and score. The choral arrangements are by Deshan Cooray and Eshantha Peiris.
The key singing roles are played by newcomers Dion Nanayakkara, Julian Anderson and Keminda Heethawaka Arachchi, as well as experienced performers such as Stigmata Frontman Suresh, Jazz sensation Tanuja Perera and classical soprano Dmitri Gunatilake.
As usual with CentreStage Productions, the cast is a vibrant mix of singers, actors, dancers and acrobats who have been given training at workshops in various aspects of musical theatre – from singing, dancing and acting. Many of the newcomers who have never danced or sung before, have discovered that they have been able to pick up the complex choreography, stage fighting and choral singing essential for this musical.

The show will be a fund-raiser for theatre-based humanitarian work conducted through the troupe’s 'StageHands' and 'Power of One' projects, which includes volunteer workshops for students on the issue of bullying and ragging.
