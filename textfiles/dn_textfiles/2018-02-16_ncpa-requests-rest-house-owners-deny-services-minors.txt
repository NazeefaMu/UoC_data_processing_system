NCPA requests rest house owners to deny services to minors

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) requested all owners of lodgings and rest houses countrywide not to provide room facilities to teenagers, school students or underage couples at any cost, as sex crimes among present youth have been on the rise.
Numerous such cases have been reported to the NCPA during the recent past and many social and voluntary organizations too, have pointed out this situation through their social media channels, recently.
Many adults have seduced female students and later, accompanied them to nearby rest houses, where they proceeded to abuse the girls.
The NCPA had requested owners of lodging places to inspect the NICs of both males and females who arrive seeking rooms.
A programme is currently underway to crack down on lodging places to nab errant rest house owners and sex offenders.
Those who bear information regarding such situations should contact 1929 or the nearest police station, said D. M. Pemasiri, a senior official attached to the Kurunegala district NCPA office, yesterday.
