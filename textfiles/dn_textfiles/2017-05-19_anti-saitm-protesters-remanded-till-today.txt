Anti-SAITM protesters remanded till today

Eight student activists including a Buddhist monk attached to the Inter University Student’s Federation (IUSF) were remanded by Colombo Chief Magistrate till today (19).
They were arrested for allegedly violating and defying a Court order while engaged in a protest held in Colombo last Wednesday (17) demanding to abolish the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
The Cinnamon Gardens police complained that the protestors disregarded the Court Order and attempted to proceed towards Viharamaha Devi Park despite the Court order being read out to them, urging not to proceed with the procession causing disturbance to public peace and obstructing the regular traffic flow. Police said the protestors refused to accept the Court order.
On May 17, the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court had issued an order preventing the protesters from being a nuisance to the public during a street protest that was to be held in the Colombo city against the SAITM.
