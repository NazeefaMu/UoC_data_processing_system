Late President Premadasa, an ‘epoch maker’: President

Present Sri Lankan politicians are keen on realizing their own dreams rather than working to make the dreams of citizens come true, President Maithripala Sirisena said when he graced the 25th Death Anniversary commemoration of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, yesterday.
The 25th Death Commemoration of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa was held opposite his statue at the Colombo Courts Complex in Hulftsdorp yesterday under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.

Such a personalized political culture has stemmed many issues that curb the collective effort to develop the country, President Sirisena added.
The commemoration ceremony was held opposite the late President’s statue at Hulftsdrop in Colombo yesterday morning, with the participation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, late President Premadasa’s family members, Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake, ministers, parliamentarians and other guests.
President Sirisena, addressing the gathering said the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, in contrast to the present politicians, was an ‘epoch maker’ who dedicated his life to make people’s dreams come true. Observing that the late President was a “man of the poor and needy”, President Sirisena said the late President had a clear and solid vision to uplift the people.
“The late President Premadasa was not a representative of the elite society. He was a man of the people. He had to meet numerous challenges coming from his background. Finally, he was assassinated. Remarkable leaders such as the late President Premadasa were targets of many. That happened not only in Sri Lanka, but around the world. We have much to learn from this exceptional leadership,” President Sirisena pointed out.
President Sirisena said the present Yahapalana government can draw many examples and guidelines from the vision and mission of the late President Premadasa. He also said that the Yahapalana government can bring about the social revolution that the late President strived hard for.
“We should clearly understand the mandate given to the Yahapalana government in 2015. We need to concentrate on the average citizen. We should remember the kind of enthusiasm our people had to change the previous regime. We should know why the people gave us the responsibility of developing this country,” President Sirisena said.
“They want a government that does not repeat the errors of the ex-regime. They urge for a good society, clean politics, people-oriented approach, an office that loves and empathizes the average citizen. Of all our responsibilities, we first need to understand the political consciousness of our people,” President Sirisena said.
