BoC Seychelles Branch  honoured for service excellence

The Bank of Ceylon’s Seychelles branch was honoured for distinguished service and commitment to strengthen the co-operation between Seychelles and Sri Lanka at the Service Excellence Awards Ceremony named as Sewaabhimani Honours Awards at International Conference Centre, Mahe, Seychelles on October 9.
The award was presented by President Maithripala Sirisena, on his two-day official visit to Seychelles.
The Country Manager for BOC Seychelles Lasantha Dissanayake received the award on behalf of the Bank.
“Since its establishment in 2014, BOC Seychelles has proved its resilience today by receiving this award of service excellence.
Whilst facing various challenges that a branch is exposed to when operating overseas, these four years have seen us grow steadily providing an outstanding service to customers of both Seychellois origin and Sri Lankan origin.
This is not only an award for business excellence but also an award for our perseverance and determination to achieve our objectives as set out in our original business plan,” said Senarath Bandara.
“This would not have been possible if not for the support given in these four years by the Government of Sri Lanka, the Government of Seychelles and the Central Banks of the two countries. This support is what made it possible for BOC Seychelles to operate successfully.
