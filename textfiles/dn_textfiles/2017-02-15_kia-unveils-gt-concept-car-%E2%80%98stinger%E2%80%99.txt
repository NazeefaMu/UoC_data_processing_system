Kia unveils GT concept car ‘Stinger’

Kia, a popular automobile brand in Sri Lanka, has unveiled the brand’s highest performing vehicle the all new 2018 Stinger as the first step in a new direction for the design and performance driven company.
Kia’s GT Concept Car come to life as a true Gran Turismo fastback, the 2018 Stinger was developed by team headed by Albert Biermann, former Vice President of BMW’s M Division and now head of Vehicle Test & High Performance Development at Kia.
The Stinger has been described as “a Korean car with a heavy dose of Teutonic DNA” – a reference to its German designer, German engineer and trials at the Nürburgring in Germany.The Kia team includes Chief Designer Peter Schreyer, the man behind the Stinger's striking looks, who was head of design at Audi and Volkswagen before he joined Kia.
In a recent report on the Stinger, ‘Business Insider’ headlined its commentary “Kia has a new car that should scare BMW and Audi.”
The Kia Stinger offers a choice of two turbocharged engines, a 2.0-litre 4-cyl generating 255 horsepower and a 3.3-litre twin-turbo V6 enginedelivering 365hp, both matched with a 2nd generation8-speed automatic transmission with five drive modesfor exhilarating performance and a premium sports car feel.
Unveiled at the 2017 North American International Auto Showwhere it won two top awards, the all-new Kia Stinger is available with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive (AWD),and its luxury amenities, head-turning design and superior performance have been hailed as a redefining of the Kia brand.
“Although it may be some time before we see a Stinger on local roads, its arrival is great news for Kia enthusiasts, because it is anemphatic affirmation of the brand’s true credentials in the high-performance motoring segment,” said Mr Mahen Thambiah, Managing Director of Kia Motors (Lanka) Limited.
Kia’s first sedan with available AWD, the Stinger has a new Dynamic Stability Damping Control suspension that adapts to different styles of driving.
The sporty and aggressively styled exterior with its fastback silhouette and sleek rear-wheel-drive proportions exudes disarming confidence. Longer and wider than a BMW 4 Gran Coupe, with a longer wheelbase than the Lexus GS, the Kia Stinger delivers elegance and athleticism. From the back, four oval exhaust pipes lend a commanding presence even during departure.
Praised as “intimate yet expansive” and“minimal yet luxurious,” the Stinger’s cocoon-like interior is intelligently configured and is more traditional than futuristic with a sporty upscale feel and premium materials. It features aircraft-style spoked vents, metal-ringed gauges and satin chrome trim. Available ultra-soft Nappa leather covers the deeply contoured seats, and the driver’s seat has available adjustable bolsters for outstanding comfort. Gregory Guillaume, Kia Motors Europe’s Chief Designer says of the new automotive masterpiece: “The new Kia Stinger is a true gran turismo, a car for spirited long-distance driving. It’s not about outright power, hard-edged dynamics and brutal styling at the expense of luxury, comfort and grace. The Stinger has nothing to do with being the first to arrive at the destination – this car is all about the journey. It’s about passion.”
