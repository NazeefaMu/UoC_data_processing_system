Roses and Champagne

April 1999 The venue is the Seville Spring Fair, Spain. Their eyes lock across the crowds. She introduces herself as Máxima Cerruti and says she is an Argentinean banker working in New York. He simply says ‘I am Alexander’. They get on well together. When he later tells her that he is a prince and not only just any Prince, but the Prince of Orange and heir apparent to the Dutch throne, she laughs. She thinks he is joking.
He is not, of course. The Prince makes sure their paths cross again, a few weeks later in New York. Within two years their love blossoms until one day, he decides to propose to the girl of his dreams at the Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague. They had been roller-blading when Alexander suggests they have a break and lures Máxima to a pond where he has hidden roses and champagne. By the side of the pond, he proposes in English so he could be sure Máxima would understand him, and she immediately says yes. He then presents his bride-to-be with a platinum-set engagement ring.
But as most things in life their journey of love too had its setbacks. The romance caused an uproar when the political past of Maxima’s father was revealed. Things were finally sorted out when the Dutch Government asked her father to agree not to attend the wedding. Her mother too decided to stay back in Argentina.
Two days before the fairy tale event took place, a dinner and a ball were held for 500 guests at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam to celebrate not only the upcoming wedding, but also the 64th birthday of Queen Beatrix. The next day, February 1, 2002, 1600 guests attended a concert and a luncheon at the Concertgebouw, a concert hall in Amsterdam. The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra played Sergei Prokofiev’s orchestral suite, Romeo and Juliet. As a surprise for the Argentinean bride, a tango was also played.
On her wedding day, Máxima wore a dress designed and manufactured by the Valentino fashion house in Rome. The dress was made of ivory mikado silk, a blend of silks that results in a heavier fabric frequently used for cool weather weddings, and had long sleeves and a cowl-like neck. It was close fitting to the waist with a slightly flared skirt with embroidered lace panels and a five meter long train. The long veil of silk tulle was dotted with hand-decorated motifs of flowers and tendrils of lace. Her tiara was composed of pieces from the jewel collection of the Royal House of the Netherlands. In her hands were an elongated bouquet of white roses, gardenia, lily of the valley, and two kinds of greens.
The bridesmaids wore a skirt of red satin and a blouse of red velvet with matching red satin shoes. They had burgundy-colored floral wreaths in their hair.
On his wedding day, the Prince wore the full uniform of the Captain in the Royal Netherlands Navy.
Among the guests present were the UK’s Prince of Wales, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and former South African President Nelson Mandela. Also, there were the kings of Sweden, Norway and Belgium and the queen of Denmark, along with Japan’s Crown Prince Naruhito and Jordan’s Queen Noor, the widow of King Hussein.
As the wedding ceremony took place in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam church in Holland, the streets outside turned into a mass of orange as about 80,000 spectators waited in the winter sunshine for a glimpse of the couple.
After the formal ceremonies, Prince Alexander and Princes Maxima rode through Amsterdam in a gilded carriage, escorted by more than 200 police and royal grenadiers on foot and on horseback.
As the couple stepped on to a balcony of the Royal Palace, many in the crowd waved small plastic flags saying “kiss”.
They did, and the crowd cheered.
Many years later Prince Alexander confessed, “I’m glad I found a normal woman to marry.” But a skeptical look from his wife caused him to correct himself. He laughed and said, “I mean, an extraordinary woman that can keep me down to earth.”
Here then is the story of Romeo and Juliet, retold, with a happy ending.
