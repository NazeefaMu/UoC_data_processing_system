Commission probing SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka
Annual share values from 2006 to be submitted

The Presidential Commission investigating alleged fraud, corruption and misuse of state assets and funds in SriLankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka, yesterday directed Assistant Manager of the Registration of Companies Department to submit a report on the value of the annual share capital of the three concerns from January 1, 2006 to January 31, 2018, to the Commission within two weeks.
The Commission also directed him to submit this report to the Commission through the Secretary of the Commission.
The Commission issued this order after considering a submission made by Senior Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe on the requirement of such a report.
The two-week period was given by the Commission as the witness asked for time, citing his tight schedule of work involving several other court cases.
The Commission, thereafter, postponed further hearing till 10 am today (7), since it had not received the notes of the previous day’s hearing up to noon yesterday.
When Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe requested the Commission to notify the Presidential Secretariat about the failure to submit evidence notes on time, the Commission said it would take action in this direction.
