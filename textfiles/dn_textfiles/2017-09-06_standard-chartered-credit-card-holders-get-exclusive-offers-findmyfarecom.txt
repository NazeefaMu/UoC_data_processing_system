From The Surf, Suriya Resort and Spa, Club Hotel Dolphin, Paradise Resort and Spa, to Cantaloupe Aqua, Amethyst Resort and the historic Earl's Regency in Kandy. It is also noteworthy that, while this offer expires on August 31, the period of stay extends even further. Terms and conditions on this and other offers on findmyfare.com apply. At the same time, Standard Chartered credit card holders visiting findmyfare.com throughout the year will have access to an exclusive 20% off deal on all flights until December 31, 2017, with travel up to March 31, 2018. This unprecedented, year-long promotion is a direct result of findmyfare.com's strong relationship with the Bank, which allows it to bring further savings to cardholders throughout the year.
Most importantly for findmyfare.com customers is the hassle-free nature of all bookings made on its easy-to-use website, whether local or international. Due to findmyfare.com's ongoing efforts, most installment plans available via findmyfare.com are immediately converted online itself without the need or hassle of a call to the bank. This is applicable to not only Standard Chartered but also many other local and international banks in Sri Lanka.
