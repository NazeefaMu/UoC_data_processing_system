Bar Association elections today

The Bar Association will hold elections to appoint a new president today. 
The elections were scheduled to be held earlier this month, but were postponed after the Judicial Services Association withdrew from acting as Presiding Officers.
The Judicial Services Association was against the appointment Ramanathan Kannan as Batticaloa High Court judge.
