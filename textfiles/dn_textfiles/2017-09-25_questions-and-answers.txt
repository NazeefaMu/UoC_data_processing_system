Questions and Answers

Illegal Contract
Question
I am a retired engineer. I joined a reputed construction company after retirement and worked there continuously for five years and stopped working in July, 2017. At the time of joining the construction company, I was asked to enter into contract with the company and I did so accordingly.
The contract had a clause stating that I would not be eligible for EPF, medical benefits and bonus. I signed the contract as I thought these were normal conditions. My contract has been renewed every year for five years subject to the original terms and conditions of my original contract. Please let me know the followings.
1. Is it legal to enter a clause in my contract and deprive me of EPF payments by the company?
2. If I am entitled to EPF, irrespective of the above clause in my contract, what steps should I take to claim EPF?
3. At the time of concluding my contract, I requested the company to pay me EPF, but they remained silent.
4. Can I complain to the Labour Department and with whom should I correspond?
Rupasiri - Panadura
Answer
Although you are a retired engineer, as you are working in a private company on contract basis, you are entitled to EPF.
Paying EPF is a statutory obligation, so the company can’t avoid statutory obligations and draft/enter into illegal contracts; therefore, you should complain to the Commissioner of the EPF Labour Department, claiming your EPF with all dues and interest. However, the contract you have entered into is illegal. An illegal contract has no legality from the beginning.

Answer
According to Pension Regulation Gazette No. 1719/3 dated August 15, 2011, a child with a mental disability can claim parent’s pension under following circumstances:
1. Physical or mental incapacity should have been either from birth or before the expiry of prescribed age limit for orphans
2. In case if not disabled from birth, entitlement to pension shall be from the date of approval by the medical board
3. In case if the Director General of Pensions is satisfied himself that the orphan is disabled, the child shall be referred to a medical board
4. Upon one’s own livelihood-making ability consequent to entitlement to property, family income, other sources of income and being in marriage, power of taking decision to pay pension to such a disabled person shall be vested in the Director General of Pensions
5. Pension payment to a pension recipient shall be stopped upon the involvement in anti-social or corrupt activities or leaving the country by recipient
6. A suitable guardian should be appointed on behalf of those disabled who are unable enough to handle financial matters. The guardian should spend the pension money only on the livelihood of disabled orphan
7. Director General of Pensions shall have the power to make full pension or a percentage thereof
8. There shall be no heirs, dependents and executors having power of attorney in respect of this pension
9. Those who have not been disabled from birth shall be referred to a medical board once in every five years
10. These regulations shall be implemented by Director General of Pensions and appeal against a decision given by the Director General of Pensions should be directed to the Public Administration Ministry's Secretary and his decision is final
In this case, you have not mentioned the age of your disable sister. However, those are the provisions applicable for your situation.

Revocation of a Deed of Gift
Question
I am a Law student. Please advise whether it is possible to revoke a revocable Deed of Gift of a minor without sanction of the District Court?
Can a Deed of Gift of an adult with a clause of revocation be revoked writing a mere revocation deed or should sanction from District Court be obtained after filing an action?
Answer
In both cases, as the deeds of gifts are revocable it can be revoked without a legal action.
However, with regard to a minor, the Court is the upper's guardian and the Court considers the best interest of a child. So if the deed is irrevocable, then the donor has to go to Courts to revoke the deed of gift. In a revocable deed, the donee accepts the gift subject to the condition of revocation by the donor.
