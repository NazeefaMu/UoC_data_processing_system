Kelaniya University Sanskrit Department Ven. Prof. Induragare Dhammarathana Thera speaking on the occasion said the topic of the book and the timing of its release - a book written by a woman released on World Women's Day - was highly significant.
The Thera said the book explains religious and social struggles of the post-war period of the country.
Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera said the freedom gained by the tri forces is being eroded. He said all should understand that the tri forces and the people made many sacrifices to gain freedom.
The thera assured that the patriotic forces will never allow the separation of the country and will always come forward when the country needs protection.
President’s Counsel Manohara R. de. Silva delivering the keynote address praised the author for coming out with a highly relevant topic at a crucial juncture in the country’s history.
He described the book as one which discusses social and religious issues arising in the aftermath of the conflict in addition to various issues faced by those who migrated to foreign countries during the conflict.
