Electric fencing offers solution to human-elephant conflict

Months ago, President Maithripala Sirisena was riveted by yet another story of human–elephant conflict (HEC), when a child was killed by a wild elephant on her way to school, and he asked for a solution to mitigate the problem.
In Sri Lanka, HEC is more intense than anywhere else in the world. After decades of trying the same approach, a new proposal, which will be delivered to the President next week, outlines how strategically placed electric fences will help humans and elephants coexist.
Humans and elephants share about 44 percent of the land in Sri Lanka, and elephants have dwindled to a population of 4,000, one-fourth of what it was 100 years ago.
Because of the human–elephant conflict, each year, 70 people and roughly 250 elephants die. The Daily News reported that 2016 was the worst recorded year of the conflict, where 279 elephants and 88 people died.
Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando, a leading HEC researcher and a consultant on the proposal, explains where change is needed.
“The conflict is because we have been continuously opening up areas where there have been elephants and cultivating land,” he said. Elephants raid crops, people’s livelihoods, and humans try to defend them. “The males and females have very different social organisations,” said Dr. Fernando, explaining that along gender and age, male elephants are more or less likely to pursue crops and risk conflict. “The females with young ones don’t want to take the risk,” he said, “but males cannot be driven, they become more aggressive,” so most HEC involves single male elephants.
Dr. Fernando says that for 70 years, the government’s Wildlife and Forest Ministries have only been increasing the problem. They try to force elephants into protected areas, but end up separating them. As a result, typically, females and young ones are driven into protected areas that have already reached capacity and where resources are scarce. The females and babies die of starvation, and the single males are pushed into areas where agriculturalists live.
“If we continue to separate elephants by chasing them, the conflict will only increase,” said Fernando.
The new proposal describes strategically placed electric fencing, what Fernando calls, “the only thing that is effective.” The electric fencing that the ministries currently maintain “is in the wrong place,” said Fernando, which only separates elephant communities unnecessarily. “We should be fencing, but we should use fencing in a logical manner to protect crops and settlements. That effectively mitigates the conflict,” he said.
Fernando’s approach has already proven successful in Sri Lanka’s North and West, where the highest levels of HEC occur. “If it is effective where there is the highest HEC in Sri Lanka, then obviously it’s going to be effective,” he said.
