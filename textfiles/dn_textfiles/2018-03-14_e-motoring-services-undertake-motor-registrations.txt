E-motoring services to undertake motor registrations

The Department of Motor Vehicle Registrations has decided to introduce E-motoring services to undertake the registrations of new vehicles and other services in the department.
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation has decided to hand over the E-motoring service to the private sector.
E-motoring had been suggested several years ago but the implementation of it had been delayed.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva visited the Department of Motor Traffic in Werahera recently and stressed on the importance of e-motoring and the need to implement it.
Driving licenses at present are also printed by the private sector.
