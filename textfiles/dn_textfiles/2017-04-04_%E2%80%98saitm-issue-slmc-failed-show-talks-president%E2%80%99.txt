‘SAITM issue: SLMC failed to show up for talks with President’

Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) had not showed up for any of the discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena relating to the issues of granting provisional registrations for medical graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
“Three meetings were held by President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss the SAITM issue but a written letter was sent by SLMC on the third meeting session stating that they will not attend any meeting until they receive a response from the Supreme Courts for their appeal,” Kiriella said.
The Minister was speaking at a media briefing at the Education and Highways Ministry Auditorium yesterday.
Minister Kiriella also said that the Government could not solve this issue without the support of the SLMC.
Referring to a series of strikes conducted in line with the SAITM issue,the Minister further said that during previous regimes, strikes were conducted to ensure the execution of court orders even though a new culture had been created so as to conduct strikes against Court orders.
