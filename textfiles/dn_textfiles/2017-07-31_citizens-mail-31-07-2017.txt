Grateful tears to a dutiful servant
The Jaffna High Court Judge who bowed with tears to the wife of the police officer who was shot dead in Jaffna will certainly go down the history, firstly, how a citizen of Sri Lanka values the life of another citizen and secondly how deep the pain of a superior public servant towards another public servant who had served him for so many years so faithfully.
The grief of the judge was obvious as seen by us at the inquiring table, at the morgue and in the funeral house. Amongst the words he uttered in sorrow, “It is like a funeral at my own house.” “He was my shadow for 15 years” were very sad. The bravery of the dead police sergeant who attempted to save the life of his master deserves the salute of the whole nation. He had been with master for over15 years giving the latter the required protection even during the height of terrorism in the Northern Province.
A few are trying to create a smoke of suspicion where there is not a fire of truth at all. There belief is that it was a plan to kill the judge so as to prevent the ongoing case of the student Nithya who was raped and killed.
Judges act on evidence proved by the prosecution -- the police and the other relevant state institutions. So attempting to murder a judge thereby expecting some sort of relief or release for the case is a foolish action. If one judge is deprived another will be there to carry on justice.
The government by promoting the slain sergeant posthumously and enrolling his one time WPC wife back to the police service has offered the family a great consolation, though the loss of a husband and father cannot be compared to anything in this world.
