Treasury Bond issue: Auditor General stands  by his statement

Government incurs losses
Auditor General (AG) H.M. Gamini Wijesinghe said he stands by his statement that a loss has been incurred by the government due to the Treasury Bond issuance on February 27, 2015.
The Auditor General was testifying before the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury Bond Issue yesterday.
Additional Solicitor General Yasanta Kodagoda led the evidence.
Kodagoda questioned AG Wijesinghe on the special audit report regarding the Treasury Bonds issued by the Public Debt Department of the Central Bank from February 2015 to May 2016. The audit report was submitted on June 29, 2016. The commission questioned AG Wijesinghe whether he would define the outcome of the Treasury Bond auction as a ‘loss’ or a ‘disadvantage’.
The questioning was based on the differences in Sinhala terms used in the COPE report and the Auditor General’s report regarding the outcome.
The COPE report used the Sinhala word ‘awasiya’ which means a disadvantage, whereas the AG’s report mentioned it to be an ‘alabhaya’ meaning a loss.
AG Wijesinghe said the transaction has incurred a loss and not a disadvantage.
The term ‘disadvantage’ came into use later, used by the COPE committee, he said.
The Auditor General said the immediate loss incurred by the transaction is Rs. 400 million. The gap of Rs. 0.4 billion can be calculated examining the difference between the face value of the Treasury Bonds which is Rs. 10.058 billion and the amount received from the auction which is Rs. 9.658 billion. The discount given to these bonds is the reason behind the calculated gap, AG Wijesinghe said.
He said the value of accepted bids taken as a percentage of the value of bids offered, it would be a 905 percent.
In comparison with the acceptance of bids from 2008 to 2014, the highest percentage would be a 407 percent at the auction held on May 8, 2012.
Asked as to what would have been the best option that the Central Bank could have taken to fulfill the government’s debt requirement on February 27, 2015, AG Wijesinghe said the Public Debt Department should have taken Rs. 2.6 billion through the auction method and raised the rest via the direct placement method from the captive sources such as the EPF, ETF, Insurance Cooperation and the Bank of Ceylon.
Asked as to who decided on a 12.5 coupon rate fixed on the Treasury Bonds issued on February 27, 2015, AG Wijesinghe said he did not receive a proper explanation as to who fixed the rate.
He said it seems that the officers of the Public Debt Department have decided on the coupon rate as they prefer.
AG Wijesinghe was asked by the commission as to why he did not attach the second option sheet provided by the Public Debt Department to the Tender Board on February 27, 2015. There have been two option sheets, the first one which includes the proposition of the Public Debt Department and the second one, including the actual decision to accept Rs. 10.5 billion at the auction.
AG Wijesinghe said he would look into the matter and inform the commission by the next day.
 
The Auditor General is to appear before the commission today as well.
