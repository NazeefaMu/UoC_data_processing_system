Ministry focus on changes to Muslim Marriage Act

The Women and Child Affairs Ministry in efforts to address violence against children, stressed the need to reform the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) which provides legal legitimacy to child marriages.
A ‘Country Discussion Paper’ titled, ‘Preventing Violence Against Children in Sri Lanka’, launched by the Women and Child Affairs Ministry yesterday acknowledged the need to address the issue. The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) is currently investigating on best ways address these gaps at the community level.
Minority politics and religious pressure however has stalled all reforms to the MMDA for the past 60 years.
“International Committees always look at this issue and ask Sri Lanka to revisit it but it becomes an issue as it becomes political and a country which is willing to take many decisions which are not minority friendly, are extremely sensitive when it comes to touching family law. It is a classic irony, they do many things the minorities do not want in the country but when it comes to women and personal laws, it becomes an issue of political correctness. It is a consistent problem in reforming personal laws”, Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children Board Member , Prof Savitri Goonesekere said.
Under the General Marriage Ordinance of Sri Lanka which applies to all citizens except Muslims in the country, 18 is the age of marriage while age of sexual consent is 16; below which termed statutory rape. Under the MMDA however there is no minimum age of marriage.
The Paper also highlighted that in 2009, 13.8 percent of women in Sri Lanka married by the age of 18, with 1.7 percent marrying before the age of 15. In 2011, a qualitative study showed that there had been an increase in child marriage numbers due to better reporting.
The Ministry’s publication observed, “Child marriage in Sri Lanka is largely driven by teenage sexuality and cultural concerns around unmarried girls being sexually active with marriage intended to ‘legitimise’ sexual behaviour, including in the context of statutory rape””, but, “early marriage hinders girls’ education, economic security, autonomy, lowering their status within the family and community and increasing their domestic and care burdens. It also lead to emotional stress and trauma”.
As it is only the MMDA which gives legal provisions for child marriages, Colombo University senior lecturer Dr Farzana Haniffa said activists have not been successful in persuading mainly male legislators to take forward reforms.
A committee appointed by the Justice Ministry in 2009 headed by Justice Saleem Marsoof to look into reforms is yet to release its report but Dr Haniffa noted that the report may come out soon with dissenting voices.
“We have three groups of reformers, the Muslim Personal Law Reform and Action Group (MPLRAG), the JSM committee which has no consensus within and a group of concerned citizens and the Kandy Forum”, she said.
She noted that while MPLRAG was pushing for reforms through a rights based perspective, it was making the community look bad, “it is reminiscent in the way in which recent Anti-Muslim community has portrayed the community”, she said.
“There is push back from the community. In articulating the rights perspective, the criticism should not be done in a way that undervalues the commitment a large section of the community has to religious positions. It must be taken into account in the context that the Muslim community in the last 30 years has become a group that primarily identifies as a religious community, we cannot ignore that as part of the reality of reforms”, Dr Haniffa said.
