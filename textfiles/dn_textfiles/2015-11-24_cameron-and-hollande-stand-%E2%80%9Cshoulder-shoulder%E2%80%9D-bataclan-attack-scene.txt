Cameron and Hollande stand “shoulder to shoulder”at Bataclan attack scene

FRANCE: British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande have visited the Bataclan concert hall in Paris where 89 people were killed on 13 November.
Cameron said on his Twitter account he had stood “shoulder to shoulder” to Mr Hollande at the venue.
The two leaders viewed the floral tributes placed outside the music venue, where fans of US rock group Eagles Of Death Metal were killed.
The only Briton to have died in the attacks in Paris was at the Bataclan.
Nick Alexander, 36, had been selling merchandise for the band. Cameron is meeting Mr Hollande as the French President starts an intensive push to create a “grand coalition” to destroy the so-called Islamic State, which will take him to Washington and Moscow in the coming days.
IS claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks in which 130 people were killed.
US President Barack Obama has pointed to an “increasing awareness” by Russian president Vladimir Putin of the need to eradicate the threat from IS as efforts continued to forge a co-ordinated response.
The US president also urged leaders “to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business”.
Cameron will present the case for escalating British military involvement against IS in the Commons later this week. - AFP
