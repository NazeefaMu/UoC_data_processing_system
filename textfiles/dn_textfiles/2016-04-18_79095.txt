Malinga ruled out of IPL

After all the furore surrounding the appearance of Sri Lanka's iconic fast bowler Lasith Malinga in Mumbai with the Mumbai Indians squad it has been revealed that he will not be a part of the IPL this season.
Sri Lanka Cricket on Saturday went overboard when they issued a statement to some sections of the electronic and print media stating that Malinga had gone to Mumbai without obtaining prior permission from them and that he was training with the Mumbai squad in preparation to play in the IPL.
However subsequent events have revealed that Malinga had gone to Mumbai to get an assessment on his injured leg from a team of doctors in Mumbai.
Charlie Austin who manages Malinga told the Daily News that the doctors who examined Malinga have ruled him out of the IPL for this year.
"The doctors have told him that his injury would require at least nine months to heal and ruled him out of the IPL," said Austin. "They have stated that he does not need an operation but only rest.
"Mumbai Indians wanted Malinga's fitness assessed so that they could in the event of him being unavailable request for a replacement. He is unlikely to be fit for the upcoming tour of England and probably be out of the Australian tour as well," he said.
Austin said that he would be writing to the West Indies Cricket Board as well withdrawing Malinga from the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) which is due to start in July.
"He told me last week he is not going to play in the IPL and Dr David Young (orthopaedic surgeon from Australia) had told him that if he doesn't get better in another three weeks which is unlikely till now his only option is to have an operation to try and save his career," Austin further explained.
"Mumbai Indians invited him over as a courtesy to meet the squad and the management and their medical staff wanted to look at his injury and see whether they can give any assistance. He was not going to play. (It is relevant to note that Malinga is currently on a two-year contract with Mumbai Indians which includes the current IPL).
"Realistically he can't play there's too much pain. He told me, 'even if I play one game I won't be able to recover for the next, so what's the point I will just ruin my leg and that will be the end of my career'.
"His thinking was he is better off having this operation and try to get fit by the end of the year and see if he can play for another year or so. The operation he probably will have it in Australia. He is anyway taking injections he has been taking them every day for six months. He administers that himself. He told me last week he wasn't feeling any improvement," Austin said.
"If he was fit he would have played in the IPL and earned himself US$1.3 million. Anyone in their right mind would like to earn that kind of money towards the end of their career. He tried to play in the Asia Cup which was a stupid idea and he was in enormous pain and obviously he wasn't fit enough to play in the World T20."
Malinga is expected to appear before SLC's three-member medical panel of doctors headed by Prof Arjuna de Silva on Wednesday to assess his fitness. Based on the Mumbai Indians medical advice he appears to be out of action till September. On the same day Malinga is due to face a disciplinary inquiry as well for allegedly making adverse comments against the SLC with regard to his selection to the Asia Cup and World T20 teams.
Malinga will be the second replacement Mumbai Indians will be calling for during the ongoing IPL. Earlier West Indies opener Lendl Simmons was ruled out with a back injury and was replaced by New Zealand batsman Martin Guptill.
Malinga is an icon whom Sri Lanka or Mumbai Indians or any team would love to have in their side. His statistics speaks for itself: First and only bowler in the world to claim four wickets in four balls in the 2007 World Cup game against South Africa, he had two more ODI hat-tricks against Australia and Kenya thus establishing himself as Sri Lanka's limited-over spearhead. His finest moment was leading Sri Lanka to win the World T20 title in 2014.
