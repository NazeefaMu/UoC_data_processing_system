Janashakthi Life goes to Nugegoda

Following the rebranding of its Life Insurance business as Janashakthi Life, Janashakthi Insurance PLC is forging ahead with the expansion of its dedicated Life branch network.
Janashakthi Life opened its first model branch at Railway Avenue, Nugegoda to serve its loyal customers. The Company anticipates the completion of the entire branch network by November 2018, as a crucial step in spreading the strength and light of the Janashakthi Life brand to all corners of the nation.
