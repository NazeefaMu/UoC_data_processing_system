Pizza Hut celebrates 25 years in Sri Lanka

Pizza Hut, the Home of Pan Pizza, celebrates 25 years of heart-warming moments in Sri Lanka.
Looking back at our road towards this silver landmark, we are proud of the strides we have taken in this beautiful country.
Featuring 57 outlets around the island to-date, Pizza Hut plans to expand its already extensive network, in order to be closer to its valued customers, whose continued patronage it has enjoyed during this incredible 25-year journey.
What makes Pizza Hut special is that it has and always will strive for perfection in both product quality and service standards. Whilst we will always be the Home of Pan Pizza, we will continue to introduce new taste sensations and new recipes whilst becoming a technological trendsetter.
“We perfect our recipes and come up with the most innovative products for our faithful customer base, adding a local touch into world renowned flavours and crusts. This surely leaves a lasting impression in the hearts of our customers. It gives us so much joy to see our food being enjoyed by our loyal customers”, said Yasa Nadaraja, CEO of Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.
Sharmila Arasaratnam, Director Marketing of Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. added, “We owe so much of our success today to all our wonderful and loyal customers who have embraced this brand and made us a part of their lives. We look forward to the next 25 years and creating many more memories with our customers.” As Pizza Hut reaches the pinnacle of 25 years in Sri Lanka, we invite you, our most valued customer, to raise a slice to another 25 years in Sri Lanka.
