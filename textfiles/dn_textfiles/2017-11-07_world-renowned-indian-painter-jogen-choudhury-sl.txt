His early works show an attention to figuration that carries through in his current pieces.
Born in 1939 in Faridpur, Bengal, Chowdhury studied at the Government College of Art and Crafts, Kolkata, from 1955-60, followed by a stint at L’Ecole Nationale Superior des Beax-Arts, Paris from 1965-67 on a French government Scholarship. His recent solo exhibitions include ‘A Calligraphy of Touch and Gaze’, presented by Kalakriti Art Gallery at ICIA, Mumbai in 2008 and ‘Abahoman: Flowing Life’ at Vadehra Art Gallery, New Delhi in 2007. Chowdhury has also had solo exhibitions at Gajah Gallery, Singapore; Gallerie Foundation for Indian Artists, Amsterdam; and the Fine Art Resource, Berlin.
In 1966, Chowdhury was awarded the Prix le France de la Jeune Peinture in Paris and in 1986, received an award at the Second Biennale of Havana, Cuba. He was presented the Kalidas Sanman by the government of Madhya Pradesh in 2001. Jogen Chowdhury has been elected as a Member of Parliament to RajyaSabha in 2014.
