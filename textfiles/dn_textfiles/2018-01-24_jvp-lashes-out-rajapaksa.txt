JVP lashes out at Rajapaksa

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) lashed out at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on what it called a media statement which was full of lies and wrong interpretations released by Rajapaksa.
The remarks made in a media statement by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his corrupt clan reflect the unfortunate political situation they are in, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) issuing a special statement said yesterday.
Referring to a media statement released under the signature of former President Rajapaksa, on January 21, the JVP said it is a case of undressing one’s self in a glass box.
The JVP points out that the said media statement which was full of lies, wrong interpretations and allegations shed light to former President Rajapaksa and his clan’s political nakedness.
The JVP observes that Rajapaksa’s allegation that the certain committees to investigate into corruption to be under the monitoring of the JVP leader MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake to be completely baseless. “If we were given such a power to investigate into corruption taken place in the country, former President Rajapaksa and his clan would not be leveling allegations at others.
The statement further points out that Rajapaksa needs to have a look at the website that monitors members of the parliament to figure out who properly fulfill the role of Opposition. It observes that JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake to be the most effectively active MP at the parliament where as Mahinda Rajapaksa listed at 184. The JVP questions as to who then fulfill the role of an active Opposition party, Rajapaksa or the JVP. They also points out that former President Rajapaksa always evades from being present at the parliament or refrain from voting whenever there is an important matter comes under the spotlight.
The JVP also states that it is their party who took the initial legal steps against Sunami Sahana Mandalaya and fought against the Cease Fire Agreement in 2002, not Mahinda Rajapaksa.
JVP refuses Rajapaksa’s allegation that Uma Oya project was implemented by the JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake when he was holding the position of Agriculture Minister. The statement points out that it was Rajapaksa who high handedly carried out the project without a Environment Impact Assessment while granting the contract to the project to an incapable Iranian company.
JVP also observes that such a statement is unbecoming coming from a former President of the country.
“The present government has not outlined a new constitution as yet. We believe if we can pass a new constitution in parliament which will assure the rights of all the people in the country, strengthen democracy and abolish the executive presidency it would be a great achievement.
We know that we cannot defeat the attempt to divide the country cannot be nullified until we accept the rights of all ethnic communities and establish peace.” the statement also said.
