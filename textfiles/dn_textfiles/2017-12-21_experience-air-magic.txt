Experience  an air  of magic

The Steuart by Citrus will usher the dawn of the New Year 2018 with an international buffet. Diners on New Year’s Eve 2017 (December 31) will be in for a thrilling night with entertainment complemented with an array of beverages for a tantalizing gastronomical experience. Diners can enter a raffle draw and stand a chance to win an exciting airline ticket along with a variety of attractive prizes.
Christmas at the Steuart&Co Pub and Kitchen has taken on an interesting twist this year, with the classic Christmas tree being turned upside down! Colombo’s first ever upside down Christmas tree is suspended from the ceiling, and lends an air of magic and awe to the festivities, in addition to the mouth-watering range of delicacies available this Christmas.
Those who walk in on Christmas Eve (December 24) can revel in a delectable feast from 7.30 pm onwards, and on Christmas Day (December 25) yet another culinary delight awaits them with a special Christmas Lunch from 11 am onwards. Housed within the Dutch Hospital precinct in the heart of Colombo, The Steuart by Citrus originated from the country’s first mercantile institute – The George Steuart & Co Ltd, which was founded in 1835.
