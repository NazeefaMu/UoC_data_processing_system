The radar tower buildings will be established in Puttalam and Pottuvil.
A Doppler Weather Radar Network including C - band Pulse Compression Solid State Dual Polarization Doppler Meteorological Radar Systems, Meteorological Radar Central Processing System, Meteorological Radar Data Display Systems and Meteorological Data Communication Systems will be installed in those buildings.
