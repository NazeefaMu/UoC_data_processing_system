Demonstration demanding jobs for Biyagama youths at oil refinery

Residents of Biyagama held a demonstration against not recruiting employees from the Biyagama electorate to the Biyagama Oil Refinery.
The demonstration organised by the 'Podu Jana Ekamuthu Sanvidanaya' was held opposite the Biyagama Oil Refinery yesterday.
The entrance to the oil refinery and the Pattivila-Kiribathgoda road were blocked by the protesters.
The protesters said employment opportunities are provided to people from Galle, not to residents of Biyagama.
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody represents the Galle electoral district. Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardane met the protestors.
The protesters said 75 persons were recruited to the Biyagama Oil Refinery, without offering a single opportunity for the youth in the Biyagama area.
The protesters said they protected the oil refinery from LTTE terrorist attacks.
State Minister Wijewardane promised the protesters to discuss the matter with Minister Weerakkody and get employment opportunities in the refinery for the youth in Biyagama.
