Assembly of the medical professionals

Hundreds of South Asia’s most prominent physicians are collaborating to discuss critical developments in the medical field, at the 51st Annual Academic Sessions of the Ceylon College of Physicians (CCP), inaugurated at the Galadari Hotel, Colombo, recently.
While a wide range of urgent medical topics were discussed—including digital healthcare, ethical dilemmas in the changing medical field, evolution in the treatment of cardiological, neurological, and end of life diseases—the takeaway from the 51st Annual Academic Sessions is comprehension.
