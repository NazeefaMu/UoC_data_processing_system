Tarantino will retire after two more movies

 
Quentin Tarantino has confirmed plans to retire after directing two more films.
"Drop the mic. Boom. Tell everybody,'" the filmmaker said on Thursday while being interviewed at the Adobe Max conference in San Diego. 
While Tarantino hasn't officially announced his next film following 2015's The Hateful Eight, the 53-year-old mentioned during the event that he is working on a historical, 1970's-based nonfiction project that "could be a book, a documentary, a five-part podcast."
Tarantino is a cult filmaker, known for his aestheticization of violence and gore. 
His films include Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction, (1994), Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2 (2003, 2004) and Inglourious Basterds (2009).
