Nabbed for harvesting lobsters illegally

Four people were arrested by the Galle Police Anti-Vice branch for illegally harvesting lobsters in shallow seas in Jakotuwa, Galle.
Police recovered 41 full grown lobsters in the possession of the suspects.
According to fishing regulations, lobster harvesting is prohibited during February, September and October as it is the breeding period of marine crustaceans. Police investigations revealed that the suspects had caught the lobsters to be sold to tourist hotels in the area which pays around Rs. 2,000 each.
Galle Police Anti-vice branch made the arrest on a tip off from public.
