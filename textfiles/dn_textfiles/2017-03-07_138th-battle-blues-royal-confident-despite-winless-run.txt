138th Battle of the Blues : Royal confident despite winless run

With last year’s sensational win still lingering in the back of their minds Royal College will be raring to go and may be anticipating a repetition when they take on their traditional rivals S. Thomas’ College Mt Lavinia in the 138th annual Battle of the Blues cricket encounter at the SSC grounds on March 9, 10 and 11.
The current season cannot be considered as one of the best for both schools where performance is concerned. Royal come out for the ‘big’ one without a single outright win, a handful of first innings wins and a bad loss to Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa which they would like to forget. Whatever the outcome during the season, either side has the tendency to give their best when it comes to the big occasion. So it is apparent that in this game too one outstanding performance at the most unexpected and crucial moments cannot be written off that could change the course of the game.
Royal’s top order batting seems to be impressive with skipper Helitha Vithanage topping the 1000- run mark with three centuries. Their openers Ronuka Jayawardena and Lasindu Nanayakkara have been striking the ball well and with last year’s centurion Pasindu Sooriyabandara and Kavindu Madarasinghe an impressive debutant in the runs, Royal’s batting looks capable enough to rattle up big scores and apply the pressure on the Thomians.
Kavindu Madarasinghe playing in his first year is in the range of the 1000-run mark (911) with a century and six fifties to his credit. Himesh Ramanayake is another blooming all rounder to watch. Himesh is the son of former Sri Lanka Test paceman and national bowling coach Champaka Ramanayake. Himesh played an integral part in last year’s victorious Royal team. The tally between the two schools stands at 35 wins to Royal and, 34 to the Thomians with the rest ending in draws in the 137-year long history of the series.
Himesh Ramanayake and Ganith Sandeepa have shared the ‘red cherry’ to good effect with over 70 wickets between them.
Royalist and former Sri Lanka cricketer Sumithra Warnakulasuriya has the distinguished honour of making the highest individual score 197 in the 1980 encounter. In 1972 Duleep Mendis struck 184 to remain as the top scorer in the series for the Mount Lavinia school. The 254- run partnership for the third wicket between Anushka Polonowita and Yasas Dharmaratne in 1996 stands as the highest partnership for any wicket.
Last year too, both teams scored a total of 300 plus, but the mere 127 scored by the Thomians in their second innings with Himesh Ramanayake taking four wickets made the difference and paved the way for the Royal victory. This year too, Ramanayake will be there as the deputy skipper with all the regalia to torment the opponents.
Skipper Vithanage too has excelled with the new ball and besides his batting could provide Royal stability. There is Abhishek Perera and Chamaka Edirisinghe as the other seamers. According to knowlegeable followers of the game off spinner Ganith Sandeepa and 15-year-old Manula Perera a left arm leg spinner playing in his first season are capable of making inroads into the Thomian batting.
Royal College squad: Helitha Vithanage (Captain), Himesh Ramanayake Vice Captain), Pasindu Sooriyabandara, Ronuka Jayawardene Ganith Sandeepa, Kavindu Senaratne, Manula Perera, Krishigan Raveendranathan, Lakindu Nanayakkara, Gayan Dissanyake, Chamaka Edirisinghe, Abhishek Perera, Gothama Ranasinghe, A.Wickremasinghe, Yuvin Herath, Kavinda Madarasinghe, Kushan Gunaratne.
