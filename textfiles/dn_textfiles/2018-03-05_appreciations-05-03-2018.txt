[APPRECIATIONS - (05-03-2018)]

Charles Henry de Soysa
Visionary ahead of his time
We the descendants of our ancestor late Charles Henry, whose memory lingers on through his unsurpassed largess to the nation, particularly in the fields of health, education and agriculture, paid homage to him at his statue at the de Soysa Circus. We were joined by past and present pupils of Prince and Princess Wales Colleges, Moratuwa, the principals and staff of the two schools and others from the hospitals he built.
Reading through the de Soysa saga, a historical perspective of the family history, I found that my father, late Professor C. C. de Silva, Charles Henry’s grandson, had written the foreword. He first described Charles Henry’s father, late Jeronis, as the Kohinoor (diamond) of his parents, whose example led Charles Henry to his achievements and success and made him share what he had with the underprivileged. Jeronis had begun life with a capital of Rs. 800, but died a millionaire. He too had been generous to the poor and underprivileged, and no-one who asked for his help was sent away empty-handed.
Charles Henry was one of the first pupils of S. Thomas’ College (STC), when it started in Mutwal in 1851. Bishop Chapman who was the founder of STC, was an admirer of Jeronis, and when the latter died, the Bishop spoke on the text, Know ye not that a prince has fallen this day in Israel. The first property Jeronis purchased was the Hanguranketa Estate. After an auction, several English planters and businessmen offered to buy it from Jeronis at double the price. His answer was, "I did not buy this land to make foreigners rich, but for my family and I to prosper; to enable us to help those in need."
Charles was in his early twenties when his father passed away. The crown of Charles’ benefactions to the nation in the field of health, was his donation of the land and the building for the De Soysa Hospital for Women, which has helped millions of mothers for well over two centuries. That was a time when not many mothers went to hospitals for delivery, and it displays his amazing foresight as a visionary ahead of his time.
His other benefaction of paramount importance was the vast acreage for the erection of buildings, playgrounds for Prince and Princess Wales Colleges in Moratuwa. He wanted the people of his hometown to be inferior to none other in education. The alumni of these two colleges have adorned the corridors of power, in the church, state, and university faculties, besides many learned professions. There are also many successful entrepreneurs who have been educated at these colleges, who like the benefactor of the schools, have left their footprints in the sands of time in our country’s history.
It has been said that for every rupee, Charles gave the state Rs. 100 in private unknown gifts to poor relatives, employees, the sick, blind, elderly in need, mentally-handicapped, and socially-underprivileged, to provide dowries for their daughters, and to churches and temples of all creeds. Although a Christian, he was generous to all religions and saw far beyond the narrow peripheries that divided all faiths.
During a visit to the UK in 1886, he donated large sums of money to hospitals there, and my father recalls seeing plaques in memory of these donations in two of the hospitals, in which he worked in London. They were The London Hospital and the Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street. He was also bestowed a signal honour by being elected an honourary member of the Atheneum—the oldest and most prestigious club in London, where it was almost impossible for an Asian at that stage of time to get membership. It is few that are remembered, wept for, sung and honoured for 100 years or more after their deaths.
It is good to realise that we remain a cultured nation in which the name Charles Henry de Soysa is still honoured and cherished as one of the greatest philanthropists in this country. There are several legends about our revered ancestor and his life. There are countless stories about the people he helped. He was a lover of animals and could not bear to see either a fellow human being or an animal in distress and reached out to them. Another famous story is his reception to HRH, the then Duke of Edinburgh. Special crockery and cutlery were used for the banquet all of pure gold studded with gems. The evenings programme included a banquet of monumental proportions, puppet and magic shows, dances and music by the Ceylon Rifles Band, all amidst a carnival atmosphere at Alfred House named so after the Royal visit, earlier known as Bagatalle Walauwa.
He also gifted a model farm which now is a model farm road, with several houses, including the Golf Club. He was the first Ceylonese banker and a well-known planter. He helped his alma mater, S. Thomas' College, with financial support whenever they needed it. He was sensitive to the needs of our people in all spheres, including education, health, agriculture and in their social, cultural and moral development. In spite of his vast fortune, he did not live in an ivory tower, away from others, but equated himself with the social and cultural life of the common man. His range of interests was so vast, that his influence impinged on the social, cultural and economic life of the people of the 19th century on many points, which was a notable contribution to the history of that period.
He sponsored the Moratuwa Carpenters' Society on co-operative lines long before the concept of co-operatives became a reality here. In 1884, he founded the Ceylon Agricultural Association, which later became the Low Country Products Association. The Moratuwa Mahajana Sabha, which emerged from the Moratuwa Association, was initiated by him. His numerous acts of charity were done with an amazing sense of liberality, which is why his name lives on.
I conclude with the same quotation my father used to describe his renowned ancestor, whose life reads like an incredibly fascinating fairy tale. They were these immortal words from Hamlet:
What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty! In form and moving how expert and admirable! In action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a God!

Lady Chrysobel Rajapakse
A pillar of hope
Ten years ago, ammie passed away at the age of 93. Her involvement with the All Ceylon Women's Buddhist Association (now the All Ceylon Women's Buddhist Congress), was all-consuming, and spanned about 50 years or more. She was a founder member, guided by benefactor/founder Juliet Jayawardene.
It is a fact that my mother was instrumental in getting almost a two-acre land on a lease from the government; a prestigious property in Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 7, where our Headquarters are situated. I note with pride that the trustees at the time of its inception (one being my mother), requested the then Justice Minister L. A. Rajapakse (my late father) for approval, and was incorporated under the trust's ordinance.
The gazetted evidence as proof, is in a framed picture, and adorns one of the walls of the board room. I am currently the president of the All Ceylon Women's Buddhist Congress (ACWBC). Ammie worked together with other Buddhist ladies, following the founder's foresight, to start a home for blind women, home for young working girls, and a home for destitute elderly women. Back then, sources of income were from organising regular flag days and kantha melas for 2 to 3 days at large grounds—an enjoyment even for children, as the atmosphere was that of a carnival!
Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Elina Jayawardene, Cissy Cooray, Eileen Amarasuriya, Daisy Seneviratne, Semitha Tennekone, Yasoma Punchihewa, Lucille Amarasuriya to name a few, including my mother, worked together with Lady Evadne de Silva and Lady Laura de Silva, as a team. These women served with dedication. They held honourary office, and I would like to mention here that Lady Evadne de Silva was its founder president, and my late mother, its founder secretary. Senior members still serving may remember these facts.
Ammie had a vision to start some years later, a hospice for destitute elders on the premises itself. The elders had no need to go back to their families when they were too old or needed special care. Sirimavo Bandaranaike opened the Suwa Sevana—a hospice with about 10 beds. The present residents are in good spirits and care, and need not worry about final religious rites, as expenses are borne by the congress. My mother's mother, H. M. Gunasekera, together with Lady Evadne de Silva, helped initiate Gamini Matha—a home for male elders, at Slave Island. Their pictures adorn the entrance of the home, usually decorated with a garland of flowers. Ammie's brother, U. N. Gunasekera, added a floor to the paying elders' home at the ACWBC at the request of my mother, and kept costs to a minimum.
Getting through Maths and English Literature at school was due to her diligence, tutoring me and my siblings. She always wore a sari for tennis, and won once or twice, the ladies' doubles tennis trophy at her club in Colombo. She continued to wear saris while playing tennis in Paris, when my late father had a diplomatic appointment in France. My French friends wondered if her religion was different to mine, as I wore western sports attire to play tennis.
Some of her domestics received gifts of houses or paddy fields for services their rendered, whilst still in service. I have admired my mother and remember her with affection.
May Ammie's journey in Samsara be short.

Nelson Fernando
A generous soul
I fail in my duty if I do not write a few words of appreciation and gratitude about the generosity of this remarkable, yet simple man. Wealth and generosity went hand-in-hand with him.
“Freely you receive and freely you must give;” the word of god exemplified in his life.
His heart was always open to the underprivileged, just as his gate remained open almost all throughout the day. Everyone who entered his premises for any need, did not leave empty-handed, be it relatives, friends, religious activists, social service personnel or strangers. His son and my cousin, Sanjany, continues to follow his father's footsteps.
Nelson uncle was well-prepared to face his death. I can remember his prompt answer to a query raised by a pastor more than 15 years ago. The pastor asked, "What else do yo wish for in life?" Nelson uncle replied, "I want to enter the kingdom of heaven."
This should be the faith of every believer.
Believers of god do not die; they simply go before the presence of god for everlasting life. Nelson uncle is surely one of them.

Somapala Gunadheera
Remarkable record holder
Somapala Gunadheera was a unique person who established many records in his life. It was a shock to hear of his demise and the private funeral arranged according to his wishes. The announcement in the Daily News on February 13 confirmed the sad news.
Gunadheera ('Some' to his friends) won the fifth standard scholarship and entered Galahitiyawa Central College in 1944 as one of her first students. After a brilliant school career, he passed the Senior School Certificate (English) Examination with credits and distinctions in 1948. On the basis of that success, he obtained an exemption from the Matriculation Examination of the University of London.
As there was no Higher School Certificate (HSC) class at Galahitiyawa, he entered the Piliyandala Central College in 1949 for higher studies. While studying for his HSC, he passed the Intermediate Arts Examination of the London University and studied on his own for the degree examination, while serving as an assistant teacher in the Education Department. He passed a Bachelor of Arts (BA) Examination in 1955.
In 1956, he passed the Ceylon Civil Service Examination and became the first Central College student to enter the civil service. He was attached to the Jaffna District Secretariat during his cadetship. Thereafter, he held many senior posts in the administrative system of the country.
Gunadheera was blessed with a brilliant memory that helped in his studies. His thirst for knowledge helped him to pass his departmental examinations in quick time. After retirement, he studied law and practiced as an attorney. Later, he passed the Master in Law (LIM) Examination and helped other lawyers through his advisory services.
While working in the public service, he gave his unstinting support to the development of cultural activities of the country. He led some of the drama panels of the Arts Council and produced his own plays such as Umatusanwrusawa and Sri Gajaba. His first radio broadcast was in 1950 on the Didactic Literature of the Sinhalese. Later, he produced a teledrama series entitled Dharmadhikaranaya, based on our legal system.
After retiring from civil service, he functioned in many senior positions such as National Institute of Business Management (NIBM) Director-General, Steel Corporation Chariman and Southern Province Development Authority Chairman, before he began his legal practice.
He initiated the Central Colleges Past Pupils’ Association and was its first president. This Association has now expanded and developed itself with a large membership consisting of central college students serving in various positions in the public and private sectors, as well as those who have retired from service.
The national press and reputed journals carried a large number of scholarly articles written by him during the last few decades. Such articles on topics of national interest were popular and widely read.
His expertise in learning languages was remarkable. While serving in Jaffna, he studied Tamil and made his farewell speech in that language. He was equally proficient in English, Sinhalese, and French as well. His demise is a great loss to the country. We have lost a good friend and a helpful colleague.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!
