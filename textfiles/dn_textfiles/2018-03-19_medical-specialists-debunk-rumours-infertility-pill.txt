MEDICAL SPECIALISTS DEBUNK RUMOURS OF 'INFERTILITY PILL'

Rubbishing reports that long-term sterilization (or infertility) pills were being used by one community against the other, doctors last week emphasized that such pills have not yet been discovered by the medical world. They also stated that any pill incorporated into hot foods like kottu rotti would be inactive under any circumstance.
This notion that sterilization pills were being mixed into food items sold at Muslim eateries has also been dispelled by the Government Analyst’s report, which confirmed that no sterilizing content was used in that particular food and the suspected particle was a mere ball of starch.
At present, there is no contraceptive pill which is known to exist that can cause infertility or sub-fertility by simply being added to food, said Consultant Physician Dr. Upul Dissanayake.
Addressing a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) Auditorium in Colombo last Thursday, this group of independent senior medical specialists said there were no sterilization pills in the pharmaceutical sector known to the medical profession that can cause permanent infertility.
The group of senior medical professionals noted that this media briefing on the so-called sub-fertility pill had risen in the aftermath of a major uproar in the country lately, leading to racial clashes in the Kandy and Ampara districts.
The media conference was convened by Prof. Chandrika Wijeyaratne, immediate past president of the Sri Lanka Medical Association, and was attended by a large number of senior consultants.
“We are a group of medical professionals not affiliated to any professional organization,” said Dr. Upul Dissanayake. “We have come out on our own accord to dispel some myths on the current news which is causing much tension, the so-called infertility pill, said to be mixed with food served at eateries.”
“The pharmaceutical industry has been searching for a medicinal drug which can cause temporary infertility so that it can be used as a male contraceptive agent, similar to contraceptive tablets taken by women to prevent pregnancies,” added Consultant Physician and Clinical Pharmacologist Prof. Chandani Wanigatunga. “However, such a medicine has not been developed yet.”
crux of fertility
Fertility in males and females is influenced by many factors; medicinal drugs are only one factor which can potentially affect fertility. Male fertility depends on the presence of adequate numbers of active spermatozoa which are normal in structure and function in seminal fluid. When either the number of spermatozoa are reduced or their function and mobility are impaired, the ability to impregnate a woman is reduced and this results in sub-fertility (difficulty in conceiving a child), and in extreme situations, infertility (the inability to conceive a child). Similar factors may affect the fertility of a woman.
Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr. Lakshman Senanayake said surveys have shown some decline in the country’s male fertility.
“In the past, not many males were willing to come forward and have themselves tested. However, now males are coming forward to have their fertility tested and this enables us to have some idea of the numbers. One of the main causes of male fertility is lifestyle changes. As men work in offices for longer hours, they wear tight clothing for long periods which can impede their fertility. Further, smoking and consuming alcohol could also have an effect on male fertility. But, there is nothing to suggest that male infertility is caused by any contraceptive pill,” he said.
These specialist doctors noted that some medicines used for other purposes may reduce the sperm count in men or affect fertility in women, as a side effect of their use. But such a reduction in fertility by these drugs can be reversed in most instances. All such drugs, however, can only be obtained with a valid prescription from a registered doctor.
Furthermore, a single dose or a few doses of these medicines are not adequate to cause significant changes in sperm counts or sperm function. In essence, there are currently no easily available drugs or compounds, in Western medical practice, which can significantly affect fertility if they are administered once or for a short period to an individual. There is also no documented instance of the use of such drugs aimed at reducing fertility in the population anywhere in the world, these specialists emphasized.
Meanwhile, an expert in Forensic Science, Toxicology, and Pathology, Prof. Ravindra Fernando said in instances of such complicated issues, it is the Government Analyst’s Department that makes the final decision. “The Government Analyst has examined the substance that was found in the kottu roti which created panic in the country and determined that it was a particle of starch. Now there is no suspicion whatsoever that it was not a tablet but a mere particle of starch, which led to this unfortunate incident.”
No such drug exists
As the specialists vehemently expressed their opinion that in Western medicine there was no tablet that could cause sterilization of males or females by a single or short-term dose, the media raised a question whether native medicines could be used for such a purpose. Dr. Upul Dissanayake, in reply, said even in native medicine, there was no proof to suggest that such a pill could be made, let alone that it exists at present.
“We are 100 percent certain that there is absolutely no drug in either Western or native medicine that can cause such infertility by oral administration,” he said. “The chemical compounds used in medicine are obtained mainly from plants, but they are all chemicals. Taking into consideration the current progress in medicine, Western or native, there is absolutely no possibility that such a drug can be manufactured.”
There were also allegations that certain infertility substances were being applied to female undergarments to cause barrenness. However, these specialists noted that this is an absolutely baseless allegation, as there is no such thing known in the medical profession that can cause barrenness.
Proactive action
Explaining what action the medical profession would take in the future to come forward and clarify matters of medical relevance, Dr. Anula Wijesundara who will be the next President of the SLMA, said, “The Sri Lanka Medical Association is basically a professional association that is non-political and non-profit-making that serves the interests of the medical professionals in the country. Hereafter, we will certainly highlight important problems which clearly arise from false information. This year and the next, we will continue to highlight controversial issues to the public by conducting press conferences of this nature.”
Meanwhile, explaining the process followed when food samples are to be tested for any reason, Dr. Janaki Widanapathirana said, “Only the public health inspector and the public health officer have been given the authorization to investigate such complaints, through the Food Act. When a problem occurs, the public health inspector goes to the relevant place and gets a sample of the food item. If the food is a ‘dry food’, three samples will be taken. One sample will be given to the owner of the restaurant. The public health inspector would take one and the third will be sent to the Government Analyst for investigation. However, the sample would be investigated by the Government Analyst only under two circumstances: if the sample is a biological sample or if the chemicals of the sample could not be tested by the public health inspector. These samples would be sent either to the Medical Research Institute or to the National Institute of Science. The police do not hold any power or authority in these investigations.”
These specialists also noted that women today are more career-minded and as a result, they delay marriage until they reach their late 30s. Towards the close of the third decade in life, it is considered safe for a woman to take on the added responsibilities of marriage and family, without having to pay the price her grandmother did for domestic security. But there is a price to be paid for postponing commitment, too. This also sometimes leads to women passing their ideal child-bearing age, making it difficult to conceive, in some instances.
Hence, they said, there are many factors that lead to sub-fertility or infertility in our society today, and introduction of some ‘pill’ is definitely not one of those factors.
The media briefing on this issue was attended by Consultant Physician Dr. Upul Dissanayake, Consultant Endocrinologist Prof. Chandrika Wijeyaratne, Professor in Pharmacology Prof. Chandani Wanigatunga, Consultant Physician Dr. Anula Wijesundara, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr. Lakshman Senanayake, Consultant Rheumatologist Dr. Lalith Wijayaratne, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr. U.D.P. Ratnasiri, Specialist in Forensic Medicine Prof. Ravindra Fernando, Consultant Physician Dr. Panduka Karunanayake, Consultant Paediatrician Dr. Lakkumar Fernando, Professor in Pharmacology Prof. Shalini Sri Ranganathan, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne and Consultant Physician Dr. Priyankara Jayawardena. Around 132 medical specialists, administrators and medical officers have also signed the statement issued on the ‘infertility pill’ issue representing the Medical Council and the College of Physicians.
