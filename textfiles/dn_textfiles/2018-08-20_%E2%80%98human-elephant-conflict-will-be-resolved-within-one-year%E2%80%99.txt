‘Human-elephant conflict will be resolved within one year’

Wildlife Minister Sarath Fonseka said that within one year he will provide a lasting solution to the human-elephant conflict.
He said the President was informed about the required officials and other things and he had promised to take steps in this regard. The plans were drafted to end the issue, the Minister said.
Minister Fonseka was participating in a discussion at the Seruwila Divisional Secretariat after an observation visit at the Selvanagar, Dehiwatte, and Kawantissa on Friday (17).
The Minister said the ministry has planned to erect electric fence for 4,500 kms. He said the President approved a proposal he made to assign 3,000 Civil Security Department personnel to the Wildlife Department and to set up guardrooms every 10 kms to guard the fence.
The residents of the area drew the attention of the Minister towards the disturbances made by the Wildlife Officers for fishing. The Minister said he would take steps to minimise disturbances by the Wildlife Officers for fishing at Mavilaru and requested the people not to destroy the forest or hunt animals.
