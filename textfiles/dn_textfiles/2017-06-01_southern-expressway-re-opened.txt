Southern Expressway re-opened

The Southern Expressway, which was partly closed due to floods over the past few days, completely re-opened yesterday, Road Development Authority sources announced yesterday.
As parts of the Expressway went under water due to flash floods, vehicular movement was restricted over the past days. RDA officials said last night that the road is open again.
