RTI Commission appoints Director General

The Right to Information Commission has appointed Piyathissa Ranasinghe as its Director General.
Ranasinghe was a senior Consultant to the Minister in charge of the Media during the implementation of the Right to Information Act, which has been in effect since February.
The RTI Commission rules on appeals when citizens filing RTI requests, believe they have been refused information illegally.
The group has ruled on 54 major appeals since the implementation of the Act, according to a media release.
As a result, people have been able to access previously private documents for the first time, such as information on State recruitments and alleged malpractices in the government, overseas travel details of politicians and unauthorised constructions, according to the release. The Commission also said an “innumerable” number of letters and requests sent by public agencies and citizens are still being processed.
