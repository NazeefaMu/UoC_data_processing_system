NFGG candidate takes oaths as UC member

National Front for Good Governance (NFGG) candidate M. T. M. Noorul Ameen, who was elected as a member of the Puttalam Urban Council (UC), took his oaths in the presence of Puttalam Quazi judge Abdhul Cadhar. The ceremony was held on Saturday (24) night at the Puttalam Mosque Cultural Hall.
During the event, candidates who contested in the recent local government elections from all parties, high officials of parties, ulamas of mosques in the area and other social activists participated.
NFGG office bearer Asheik Rismi was the chief guest of the event. Addressing the ceremony, Rismi said, “NFGG membership is a neutral one; the party has planned not to support any other parties in the urban council’s future activities.”
