Dutch ingenuity at work with expansion of Panama Canal

 
Last March, it was announced that the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) ordered a vessel scheduling and maritime resources management system called Quintiq. A Dutch software company developed the system and this is not the only innovation the Dutch brought to the new Panama Canal.
The expansion of the Panama Canal was completed last summer. The project, also called the Third Set of Locks Project, doubled the capacity of the Panama Canal by adding a new lane of traffic allowing for a larger number of ships. The width and the depth of the lanes and locks were also increased, enabling larger ships to pass. All this marine traffic needs a system that gives oversight. That is why the Panama Canal Authority selected Quintiq to plan, schedule and optimise all vessels transit operations through the Canal to reduce costs, improve safety and increase overall efficiency and reliability.
