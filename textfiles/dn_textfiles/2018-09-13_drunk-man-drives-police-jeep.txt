DRUNK man DRIVES OFF IN POLICE JEEP

A suspect who had driven a police jeep under intoxication was arrested in Thelippalai South on Tuesday.
Police said they had received a 119 emergency call around 7.35 pm on Tuesday regarding a dispute at a house in Kachchai involving a group of persons under intoxication.
 Subsequently, policemen from the Thelippalai South Police had been dispatched to settle the issue. When the police had gone to the scene and brought the situation under control, one of the drunken men had pushed a police officer and tried to manhandle him, obstructing him from carrying out his duties.
The police driver who was in the jeep had got down to assist the police officer.
Another man had then got into the police jeep and had driven off in the commotion. Police had pursued after the vehicle and arrested the suspect and recovered the vehicle. The suspect will be produced in court on charges of stealing public property and obstructing police duty.
