Voice of the people ON MAY DAY

May Day rallies clearly illustrate the stark political, economic, and social cleavages in Sri Lankan society. Three major demonstrations that took place in Colombo, those of the UNP, JVP, and Joint Opposition (JO), drew crowds in the tens to hundreds of thousands that hailed from all corners of the island.
While the constituents of the JVP and JO were quick to condemn the coalition government’s progress, or lack thereof, those of the UNP pointed to its triumphs.
Period of freedom

“The rule of law has been reinstated in the country, and the legal situation is in good condition. It’s not like the earlier days where there were white vans. It’s a period of freedom in Sri Lanka,” said K. Perera, a farmer from Ratnapura.
Corruption free society
U. Gunawardene, like Perera, defined the success of the coalition government in negative terms, in that he pointed to the abuses of the former government that no longer occur explicitly.
“The corruption of the last regime is over. I can say that with confidence. No longer do people, especially enemies of the past regime, have to fear for their lives,” he said.
Development poised to flourish
M. Rafeek, however, acknowledged that many of the promises that Ranil Wickremesinghe made when he reassumed the role of Prime Minister had not yet come to fruition.

“We have to give the administration more time. It’s only been two, two and a half year. They deserve our patience. They have done a lot to improve the rule of law.”
“They just secured GSP+, which is a good sign. I think increased foreign direct investment and infrastructure development will come in the next two or three years,” he said.
JVP can form a society for all to live together and prosper
The JVP supporters, however, were far less forgiving of the coalition government, as many of them noted that there is little difference between it and the Rajapaksa regime.
“All these politicians are the same. They say the right things, but then nothing ever comes of those words. We need to form a society for all people to live together and prosper. I think the only party that gives us that hope is the JVP,” said T. Banda, a farmer from Kurunegala.
The idea of hope permeated the rhetoric of the JVP supporters who spoke with the Daily News, each of whom pointed out that the UNP and SLFP, as well as the JO, do not properly or effectively fight for the poor and vulnerable.
“They might tell you that they will increase subsidies for farmers or provide better education for children, but they really won’t do anything about it. The poor in villages are in the same situation as we were three years ago.”
“The JVP has a plan to make the poor economically empowered. They know about the interest of the poor, and hopefully they will get power in 2020. That way we can make the country work for rich and poor equally,” said Renuka, a farmer from Anuradhapura.
Nandasena, another farmer from Anuradhapura said he thinks the JVP will fight for him.
“We just need a party that will give us a voice. The corruption and greed that are going on in the country are worse than when I was young. We need a voice,” he said.
Unlike UNP supporters, most of whom pointed to their party’s achievements in favour of talking about the policies that would lead to greater prosperity, the JVP marchers put forth a coherent set of policies that they believe would improve the quality of life for most Sri Lankans.
Many held signs protesting education privatisation, environmental destruction, inadequate support for farmers and other labourers, and corporate corruption.
“These are the policies that will make Sri Lanka a more equal and fair place that allows everyone an opportunity to improve their life,” said Renuka.
Govt does not provide sufficient subsidies
The JO supporters, by contrast, seemed to care little for policy. Marching up Galle Road between rows of buses, this mostly male group, many of whom were in an inebriated state, enthusiastically extolled former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
“Mahinda is an honest man. The government is not providing me sufficient subsidies. I know that Mahinda will give me more,” said Sudath, a dairy farmer from Tangalle.
“Mahinda is my president. All the corruption accusations against him are baseless. He is the only one capable of fixing the country,” said C. Fonseka of Colombo. When pressed on exactly how Rajapaksa would fix Sri Lanka, he replied: “I know he would.”

In between complimenting Rajapaksa and various members of his family, the supporters railed against President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe in colourful language.
But N. Fernando, a tour guide from Panadura, gave a more measured endorsement of Rajapaksa.
“You have to give him credit for ending the war, building the highways, the Hambantota port, and the Mattala airport. The coalition government has not provided that kind of development at all,” he said, while adding that, in his estimation, none of Sirisena’s or Wickremesinghe’s promises have become a reality.

“All these people are saying Rajapaksa is corrupt, but look at the bond scandal. These people are doing the same thing,” he said.
Suffice it to say that there was little agreement on the best way forward for Sri Lanka. UNP supporters pointed to past achievements as proof that their party is on the right track, while backers of the JVP and JO lambasted the unity government.
While the JVP backers offered some policy recommendations that they hope would lead to prosperity, the JO patrons celebrated Mahinda as the saviour.
As he walked by, a monk shouted that Mahinda was a God worthy of praise.
