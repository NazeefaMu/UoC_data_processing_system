Over million employees do not have social security coverage: Labour Minister

Sri Lanka has about 1.4 million employees without any type of social security coverage, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
He was addressing a meeting held for the Ministry employees recently.
Minister Seneviratne said about eight million private sector workers should obtain EPF and ETF membership, but only 2.6 million have the membership.
The Minister said 230,000 private companies and institutions operate in the country but only 75,000 of them are inspected by the Labour Department officials. "In 2016, 7,178 private companies were registered with the EPF but the number was inadequate. Labour Officers must inspect more companies," he said.
"The labour officers should treat employees and employers equally. "Reportedly, they offered a cup of tea and a seat for an employer recently while two employees were standing outside the office. Certain officials do not follow ethics and regulation. They bring disrepute to the Labour Department, he said.
