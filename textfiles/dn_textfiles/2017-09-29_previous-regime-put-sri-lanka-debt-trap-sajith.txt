Previous regime put Sri Lanka in debt trap: Sajith

Sri Lanka has been caught up in a debt trap due to the short sighted policies of the previous regime, Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
The Minster was addressing the gathering of parents, teachers and well wishers of the Suriyawewa National School at its fiftieth anniversary.
He said the previous regime set up a playground at Suriyawewa. The necessity of the school is a swimming pool. The international play ground was set up at a cost of Rs. 420,000,000. He said this amount used for the playground could have been utilised for the development of the schools in 21 Grama Niladhari divisions in Suriyawewa.
