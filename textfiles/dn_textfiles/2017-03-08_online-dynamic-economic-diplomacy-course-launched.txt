Online Dynamic Economic Diplomacy Course launched

The Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Department of Commerce yesterday launched an “online dynamic economic diplomacy course” with Harvard University’s Centre for International Development (HUCID).
The course is aimed at building the capacity of government officials to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).
The official signing of the agreement took place at the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
The 18 week-long course will serve between 35 and 40 government officials working in 15 to 20 missions abroad and in Colombo.
Participants in the course will be able to play a more proactive role to improve the volume of FDI and the diversity of Sri Lanka’s exports.
Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said Sri Lanka is behind neighbouring countries towards economic development, and that it is necessary to bring in Harvard’s help to catch up.
“We have good runners in the race, but we need some strategic thinking.
How do we get ahead? So we have come to the best in the world to coach our runners.
We believe that with their help and our dedication, we will be able to win this race,” he said. Prof. Matt Andrews of HUCID said many countries are ahead of Sri Lanka in attracting foreign investment, but building the capacity of the country’s foreign officers is a good way to catch up.
“Sri Lanka needs to improve the capabilities of its foreign officers, because they are the ones who are connected to companies outside the country.
These companies are also going to be the source of inward investment,” he said.
“We really are excited to see people learning and growing. But a key part of the course is actually getting people to try out new strategies to connect with businesses and bring business back to Sri Lanka,” he said.
