Happiness within reach

We do everything in life to reach that elusive goal – HAPPINESS. Wealth, fame, beauty, social position or passing examinations will bring you only a temporary form of happiness. Most wealthy people are unhappy in their lives. Fame is just a bubble. If you do something wrong, your fame will vanish. Beauty is only skin deep. Age will rob you of your beauty. Social positions will only bring you a limited kind of happiness. After passing an examination you will be happy for a short period. Then how to retain happiness throughout life?
We are born with certain skills. Identifying them is a difficult task. Some of us consult astrologers in order to find out our life’s calling. Those who take part in reality shows will teach you a lesson or two. Very often we see young men and women who aspire to be superstars. But when they come on stage, they cannot sing or perform. Those who have no aptitude for singing or dancing try to be singers and dancers. Those who cannot write even a meaningful paragraph try to be journalists and authors. All these things happen when you fail to identify your real talents. A deputy principal of a well-known school sat the final examination in laws leading to the LLB degree on nine occasions. Although he got through the examination and started practising as a lawyer, some of his students were leading lawyers and judges!
If you can identify your real talents early in life, you will achieve your goal in the long run. Try to use your special skills and aptitudes as early as possible. We are made up of different characteristics both physical and mental. If your friends are attending law classes, do not follow them unless you have an aptitude for law. Even identical twins differ from each other. Therefore trust your gut feelings.
Greatness
Some people are born great. Some achieve greatness. Greatness is thrust upon the others. Greatness comes to those who have faith in themselves regardless of the fact that their opinions and ideas might be unpopular. Copernicus and Galileo were ridiculed for their theories that the earth and other planets moved around the sun. Martin Luther was persecuted because his religious opinions differed from those of the established church. Louis Pasteur faced bitter opposition before his views on protection against bacteria were accepted by the scientific community. World famous Beethoven’s harmonies were declared to be outrageous at the beginning.
Newton and Albert Einstein evolved scientific theories which were not understood by his contemporaries. What is more, Jesus Christ was persecuted and crucified because he challenged the established order.
One of the first lessons in philosophy is: Know thyself! We come to know ourselves through introspection. In other words, we should examine the motives of our actions and beliefs. The celebrated British philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote: “Why I am not a Christian” out of conviction. The established church hounded him, but he did not change his views. We should be frank enough to criticize ourselves. Self-criticism is the prime condition of self-knowledge.
To know yourself better, ask yourself: What is my real ambition? If you have no ambition, you will never succeed in life. But your ambition can change when you grow up. A child may want to be a doctor when he grows up. However, when he becomes a young adult, he may want to be an engineer. Sometimes even after achieving your ambition, you might deviate from it. A young doctor who practised for a short time is a software engineer today.
Know yourself
If you wish to know yourself, you should have a firm stand as regards religion, art, politics, and music. Everybody needs to be familiar with such fields of study. Select your field of activity and stick to it early in life. If you are satisfied with your selection, you are on the correct path to happiness.
The other secret of happiness is to be yourself. If you have decided to follow a certain course of studies, stick to it. You should not waste time trying to experiment with many different fields of activity. Our life is relatively short and we have no time to learn everything under the sun. This is the Age of Specialists. Although there are some drawbacks of being a specialist, it is good to know one subject well. When the war-time British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was asked whether he knew French, he said he never studied it but he knew his English well!
Unhappiness creeps into your life when you start comparing yourself with others. Our paths to success in life are varied. Having assessed your capabilities, do your best in whatever you do. Many people who try to do certain activities without the necessary skills end up with a nervous breakdown.
Polonius advised his son, “To thine own self be true, and it must follow as the night and day, thou canst not then be false to any man.” These words contain the best advice for anyone who wishes to be happy throughout their lives.
