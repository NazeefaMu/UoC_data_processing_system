Police Sergeant killed in Matara shooting;:
Family provided compensation

IGP Pujith Jayasundera yesterday (26) provided compensation of Rs 2.56 million to the wife and children of late Matara Police Sergeant Suranga Pradeep Weerasinghe, who was killed during a recent shootout with armed robbers.
The IGP who was on a visit to attend a World Conference for IGPs in the United States, returned to the island early last morning.
His first task after his return was to visit the dead Sergeant’s house in Godagama, Matara and express his condolences to the family.
Southern Province Senior DIG, F.Fernando, Matara Division in charge, SP Gayanga Hasantha Marapone and Police Media Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara were also present on the occasion. The compensation included Rs 1.5 million from the Police Rewards Fund, Rs 1 million from the Agrahara Insurance Fund and Rs 60,000 from the Seva Wanitha Unit Fund.
IGP Jayasundera speaking to late Sergeant Weerasinghe’s wife; Saumya Kumari Abeywickrama (33), said her daughter Methuli Dulanya (5), and son Mathila Nethsala (3), would not have lost their father if he was wearing a bullet proof vest. Thus, in future he would make it mandatory that all officers who undertake such operations to wear a bullet-proof vest to avoid such unfortunate incidents. He added that all officers undertaking such operations had been provided with bullet-proof vests but in this instance, given the urgency of the situation, the officers had left without wearing them. In future, he said he would make it mandatory.
