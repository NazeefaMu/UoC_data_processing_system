Ayurvedic drugs to be tested on NCP kidney patients

It is intended to commence providing Ayurvedic drugs and treatment for kidney patients in the Ayurvedha Hospitals Network of the North Central Province (NCP) from next January.
This was disclosed at a special meeting held at the Anuradhapura Provincial Ayurveda Hospital, recently, with North Central Provincial Chief Secretary H. M. P. Bandara, Provincial Health Secretary Saman Bandulasena, Provincial Ayurvedha Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis, Provincial Health Services Director Dr. Palitha Bandara, and a number of western and Ayurveda-specialised doctors participating in it. It was decided at the meeting to adopt and practice Ayurveda treatment.
Drug courses are being followed at the special kidney diseases treatment clinic in Kebitigollewa, where patients are given medicine and health care services free by an integrated team of western and Ayurvedic doctors headed by Dr. Nishantha Kumarasinghe (MBBS/PhD), a senior lecturer at Kotelawala Defense University. This traditional indigenous treatment is based on some precious ancient prescriptions revealed to Dr. Kumarasinghe by late Veteran Ayurvedic Physician Ven.Waharaka Abhayarathanalankara Thera. It is revealed that during the first year and a half since the Kebitigollewa free kidney diseases treatment clinic commenced, hundreds of kidney patients including CKDu patients, have been cured using the ancient prescriptions.
NCP Chief Secretary H. M. P. Bandara told the Daily News that it is decided to open special ailments treatment clinics based on the Kebitigollewa module in the Anuradhapura Ayurvedha Provincial Hospital, Rambewa, Padaviya, and Medirigiriyaayurvedic Hospitals as an initiative for the benefit of kidney patients who are in abundance in those areas.
A particular series of drugs will be manufactured at the Anuradhapura Thelhiriyawa Ayurveda drug-manufacturing plant on a large-scale for treating a number of patients. A sum of Rs. 2.5 million would be allocated as the first step to start the manufacturing process, and the provincial council would extend its support to obtain 23 herbs required for the manufacturing of these drugs by providing essential infrastructural facilities. It is a good omen to see that both western and Ayurvedic doctors have united to rescue the province from the kidney disease menace at this juncture, Bandara said further.
