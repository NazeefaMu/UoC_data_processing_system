Rapid special action plan to eradicate Dengue

A rapid special action plan to eradicate Dengue was implemented in Puttalam 5th ward, during last weekend in order to prevent Dengue before it affects the general public.
This action plan was implemented by the Dengue eradication team of Puttalam Urban Council, under the guidance of the Chairman K. A. Baiz.
The Puttalam Health Medical office, the Road development Authority, the Malaria Prevention Unit and Puttalam Police have collaboratively engaged as the partners to implement this action plan.
While conducting this, the Chairman of Puttalam Urban Council K. A. Baiz directly visited this area and stayed there until the end of the plan implementation, and made orders to the relevant authorities and to the Urban Council workers. The members of Puttalam Urban Council M. S. M. Rafeek and Farwin Raja also have participated in this campaign.
The Chairman of Puttalam Urban Council K. A. Baiz said that, “Many losses of lives have occurred in this area, due to Dengue. Also, due to the rainy season in Puttalam in recent days, there are much more chances for Dengue breeding too. That’s the main reason why have we started such an immediate action plan”.
The officers visited all the houses in 5th ward and they explained about the affects of Dengue. Also, many places which were conducive for the Dengue breeding were identified during their home visits and were demolished.
