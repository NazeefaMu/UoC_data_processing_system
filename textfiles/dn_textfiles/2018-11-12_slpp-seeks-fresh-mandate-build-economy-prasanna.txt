SLPP seeks fresh mandate to build economy - Prasanna

Only a stable government under a practical leader can bring the country back from the present economic crisis, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Gampaha District leader Prasanna Ranatunga said. Therefore, he requested a mandate from the people at the forthcoming general election to create a good future under such a leader.
He was speaking at a meeting at the Reggie Ranatunga Memorial Conference Hall in Udugampola on Saturday. Ranatunga said the rule of the United National Party is now over and the time has come to get the approval from the people of the country for a new programme to be launched under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He said they had fulfilled the promises given to the country in 2005 and now they have come before the people seeking a fresh mandate to build the economy of the country.
The decision taken by President Maithripala Sirisena at this moment was a very difficult one. They should respect it as it was taken for the betterment of the country.
He challenged former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to contest with them at the coming election.
Ranatunga also added that the people of the country only want Mahinda Rajapaksa as their leader, and therefore, they would dedicate themselves to creating a better future for the country under his leadership.
