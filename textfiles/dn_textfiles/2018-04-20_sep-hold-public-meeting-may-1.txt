SEP to hold public meeting on May 1

The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) will hold a public meeting in Colombo on May 1 to celebrate the solidarity of the international working class and oppose the government’s attempts to sabotage May Day celebrations.
Issuing a statement on the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS), the SEP said that the meeting will be held at New Town Hall at 3 pm.
On March 28, President Maithripala Sirisena announced that the Cabinet had decided to postpone all May Day meetings, rallies and marches scheduled for May 1 to May 7, which has been proclaimed a holiday.
The President said that the decision was taken on the advice of the Maha Nayaka Theras in order to avoid an overlap with the Buddhist festival of Vesak.
SEP in their statement further said that the government’s decision to undermine May Day is in line with its promotion of reactionary Sinhala-Buddhist chauvinism.
"It is bound up with the enormous political crisis of the government. Amid a growing wave of strikes and protests, the government fears that May Day could become a focal point for the hostility of workers, the oppressed and rural poor, and a threat to bourgeois rule," they said.
They noted that workers have waged a series of strikes in different sectors, including the universities, ports, electricity, petroleum, postal, railway, health and plantations, despite the efforts of the trade unions to derail and suppress them.
"The working class is opposing the government’s ruthless attacks on living and social conditions in implementing the programme of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).”
They called on workers and youth to attend the May Day rally organised by the SEP and its youth movement, the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE).
