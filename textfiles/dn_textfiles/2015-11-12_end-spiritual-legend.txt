[END OF A SPIRITUAL LEGEND ]

Giant in stature, humble in personality
Some little known aspects of Ven Sobitha Thera:
Sachitra Mahendra
Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera now needs no more introductions, eulogies or harangues. Different authors have serenaded – splendid as well as harsh – on this eminent monk. This brief essay, much personal in content, touches a lesser known stage about a fascinatingly influential figure of our times.
“Unvahanse apavath velaa…” (which could be loosely translated as ‘he has passed away’) read a message on my inbox. It was 10.22 on the night of November 7. The emotional surge within me was so much that I even forgot to key a word of thanks to my informant. Back from a long tired journey, I badly needed a good sleep. All the same, the memories of a distant past reemerged and a sleepless night was before me.
The acquaintance with Ven Sobhitha Thera could be traced as far back as the 70s when my parents settled down in Mirihana. Kotte Sri Naga Vihara became the family temple, and the Thera became the family monk.
Now, I embark on something I cannot obviously recall. What my parents and siblings narrated remains etched in my memory, and I would picture how that particular event unfolded. On the day yours truly was born, my parents took me to the temple straight from the nursing home.
Ven Sobitha Thera was sweeping the temple garden, as my parents entered the temple.
Upon sighting my parents, the Thera kept the broom aside. He welcomed my parents and siblings with a congratulatory smile.
“We should bless this child.”
Saying so, he stepped into the abode and took the large Pirith thread bundle. That well known melodious vocal recital would have lasted half an hour or a little longer. As we left the temple, my brother looked back to notice the Thera return to sweeping.
Ven Sobitha Thera was an amiable elder to any devotee he sights at the temple. He did not care very much about his popularity (or civil power, rather) when he opens up a conversation with a devotee. Even though he is too busy for a small talk, he would certainly greet you with his warm smile.
The Thera’s real personality rests alive at the Naga Vihara. Although smaller in size as compared to most mainstream Buddhist temples, Naga Vihara is home to verdant greenery. The bridge, the pond underneath and schools of fish swimming leisurely are a signatory sight of the entrance to his little abode.
And you were always welcome to enter this little green kingdom. My brother would often ask the Thera for a plant or two. Ven Sobitha Thera would not think twice in such instances. He would generously offer a plant. They always exchanged plants with each other. In his own territory, Ven Thera lived with much ease. No politician could shake him with luxury. He won the hearts of devotees. They were the patrons who looked after him well even during the tough times when he had fallen from grace of certain politicians.
Another emotional memory of him pops in. I was to receive a Buddhist award for my novel ‘Didulana Duhuvilla’ at the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress. He was seated at the front seat, which was enough opportunity for me to seek his blessings. I worshiped him before reaching for the award. He blessed me with his usual hearty smile. That smile, even to this date, I find it difficult to understand. It was he, more than the award, who filled my soul with joy.
A different book of mine was launched at the Naga Vihara premises on the publisher’s requirement. Written about Ajahn Chah, a Thai tradition monk, the book was subject to a brief but comprehensive analysis of the Thera. Surprisingly, he referred to that book on many occasions as well. Ven Sobitha Thera was a rare personality who could encourage the youth without any malice in his heart. He was always in the company of the youth when it comes to social welfare activities.
All that reached culmination, when we as a family offered him a gold medal. That was our simple token of appreciation for what he had done to us. He was not much bothered about Vinaya rules. But he did not live against the Vinaya. He was more concerned about the societal well being.
Ven Sobitha Thera did not belong to any political party. He loved every politician as an elder who would point out where you err with affection. That rare personality in him stood tall wherever he trod. That is the emblem of this social reformer called Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera. His is a story of a great humanitarian achievement narrated fascinatingly and awe-inspiringly.
Sri Lanka mourns activist monk
Venerable Sobitha stood up to autocratic leaders, fought corruption
Sri Lankans, including church leaders, are mourning the death of a prominent Buddhist monk known for railing against corruption and taking on his country's powerful leaders.
Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, who was instrumental in changing Sri Lanka's political regime in the lead-up to the January presidential elections, died Nov. 8 in Singapore, where he was receiving treatment following heart surgery. He was 73.
"The passing away of Venerable Sobitha Thera is a great loss to the country," Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith of Colombo told reporters November 10. "He is actually a selfless, generous religious leader for all the people."
Anglican Bishop Dhiloraj Ranjit Canagasabey of Colombo said Venerable Sobitha worked tirelessly to advocate for a society based on justice and truth.
"The highest tribute we could pay … is to continue with his struggle to ensure that the qualities of honesty, transparency and justice are strongly entrenched in the public life of this country," the bishop said.
Venerable Sobitha was known for his outspoken views against corruption and for challenging his country's leaders — especially at a time when Sri Lankan presidents wielded significant power.
The monk and his organization, the National Movement for a Just Society, backed the former Health Minister, Maithripala Sirisena, in his bid for the presidency ahead of January elections, opposing the powerful Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had been seeking a third term in office. Rajapaksa lost his seat in a surprise defeat.
Jehan Perera, executive director of the Colombo-based National Peace Council, said Venerable Sobitha challenged authorities at a time when the government was increasingly authoritarian, ethno-nationalist and corrupt.
Perera said he met Ven Sobitha recently, before the monk underwent heart surgery.
"He was anxious not so much about himself as about the sense of drift in the government on the issues of good governance most dear to his heart," said Perera, whose organization will posthumously award the monk its Citizens' Peace Prize.
The government has declared a national day of mourning for Ven Sobitha today when his cremation is scheduled.
Thera authored new doctrine for good governance - Bogollagama
Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera was a distinguish Buddhist monk who not only confine his life long service to the Dhamma but also dedicated himself for the valid causes for all Sri Lankas, former Minister Rohitha Bogollagama said in a condolence message.
The message adds: “His contribution as the Chief Incumbent of Kotte Sri Nagaviharaya during the last few decades showed his commitment to serve the people of Kotte as a learned priest and a social worker. There is no single household that he had not visited at a time of need and grief in the area. The people looked up to him as both a religious leader and a noble human being.
“The Thera authored a new doctrine for good governance with recent developments in the political spectrum of Sri Lanka. It is registered among the people as the need of the hour. It is unfortunate that he did not live long to bear the fruits what he thought the best for the country. I wish the late Thera may attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana.”
Thera’s passing away, irreparable loss to democratic process
The sudden demise of the effervescent colossus among the community of the Maha Sangha in contemporary times, Most Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Nayake Thera who was greatly admired and endearingly respected by all walks of life for his distinctive articulation, outspoken and fearless stance on socio-political issues that have plagued the society for long, touched all Sri Lankans deeply as the news about his loss, broke in Singapore.
Our protagonist, Ven Sobitha Thera who had a reputation for being a forthright social critic stood out not only as a clever epigrammatic Dhamma orator, but also as the unfailing social reformer who championed the cause of the under-privileged, and single-handedly rose against corrupt politicking that has brought about an immense destruction to the mother Lanka in our post-independence era.
In his 60 years of monkhood, needless to repeat, he emerged himself to be one among the handful of erudite and most articulate Buddhist monks that inextricably intertwined ethno-religious issues with those of sociopolitical importance and dimension. His monkhood was devoted to resolution of issues, pertaining to the Sasana, Nation, Language, Society, Morality, Politics, Education and more prominently, the progress of the country at large as a civilized society.
Early life
Born in Maduluwawe, Padukka, Ven. Sobitha Thera, having entered the monkhood at the age of 13 in 1955, received his higher ordination on June 15, 1962 under the tutelage of the then Sri Naga Vihara incumbent, late Ven. Mulleriyawe Rewatha Thera, Ven Dewahandiye Sri Saddhatissa Nayake Thera and Ven Angammana Gunarathana Thera, both from Kotte Road Sri Jayawardhanaramaya and entered the Vidyodaya University ( currently, the Sri Jayawardenepura University) for higher studies after completion of his Pirivena education at Kelaniya Vidyalankara Pirivena. He assumed as the incumbent at Kotte Sri Naga Viharaya in 1967 and founded many a Daham projects in the premises. Upon his graduation receiving a B.A (honours) degree, the amiable Thera as a young dynamic monk commenced his teaching career and later became the Principal at Sri Perakumba Pirivena, Ethul Kotte and the Principal at Kuda Uduwe Nalanda Pirivena after he had a stint as the vice principal at Gangodawila Subhadrarama Pirivena.
As he himself declared during his 70th birth anniversary felicitation ceremony at the BMICH in May 2012, the Ven Thera, born to a middle class family in the rural Maduluwawe, refreshed the memories of his humble beginnings and told the gathering how he underwent hardships as he took to schooling where he used to walk back and forth about 5-10 miles every day from home to the school, for which he could be proud as he used to reminisce such practices as exemplary to the budding youth and all other segments in society.
Dedication for public wellbeing
Ven Sobitha Nayake Thera’s sustained role as a social reformist distinctively unparalleled and went deep into the hearts and minds of the people who kept closely in touch with this personage, largely because of his soft-spoken and friendly nature. His patient hearing to grievances or criticisms, maintaining the highest degree of composure was remarkably noteworthy. His charming smile, robbed the hearts and minds of everyone who came before him. He symbolized the true compassion that a Buddha Puthra should harbour, irrespective of his hectic day’s workload or schedules. This embodiment of virtues was also the guiding light to hundreds of novice monks who reached him in search of solutions.
His epoch-making characteristics inevitably favoured the oppressed as a true patriot cum social worker as he gradually began to fathom out social realities, shedding a sarcastic eye on the stereotype. He had the wisdom of focusing on issues and systems that erode the social fabric in the land in varying proportions. He foresaw all those and raised his piercing voice against tyrannical suppressive measures of governments or their leaders.
While growing to be a towering strength to all, he all alone flexed his muscles, pooh-poohed Machiavellian practices of corrupt political stalwarts and began to publicly ridicule them, despite many risks, involved in such verbal attacks during those dark days. His Kotte Sangha Sabawa stood behind him and supported his initiatives. Besides his role as the incumbent at his simple abode, Kotte Sri Naga Viharaya which functions as the umbrella centre for more than 50-75 organizations, Ven Sobitha Thera spearheaded a well-known National Campaign for a Just Society, Temperance Youth Organization, National Heroes’ Foundation, National Sangha Council, All island Pirivena Teachers’ Association, Sri Lanka-Korea Buddhist Association and Eye Donation Association. His multi-faceted society-oriented assignments which received his patronage, leadership and guidance were numerous as he himself once admitted because they all liked him so much and were behind his lively advice.
Preacher par excellence
Ven Thera mainly due to his inborn talents enjoyed his own intonation pattern of articulating most difficult sections in Dhamma, Tripikata and the Buddha’s doctrine in an impressive manner which lured the devotees en masse. On some days, he had to deliver more than 3-4 sermons (Bana) every evening at a stretch in different venues, leaving some 30-45 minute gaps in between because of the popularity he had mustered as someone who could simplify and explain even complicated Abhidhamma sections of Buddhism to laymen. Our monk was so magnanimous that he never wanted to decline any invitation if his hectic schedule somehow or other permitted it. Otherwise, he himself used to propose an alternative date with a kind comment to ensure that his Dayaka who invited him go off fully contended.
His erudition in Dhamma as a true ‘Buddha Puthra’ enabled him to reach every layer in our society, mostly the underprivileged in far remote areas, and in many instances, the Thera after accepting what he was offered as ‘Pirikara’ for a sermon, returned all of them then and there to the same rural temple with overwhelming pleasure.
May our Ven Sobitha Thera attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana !

Thera won the hearts of public - Gayantha
The Sri Lankan Community was deeply grieved to hear the untimely demise of Ven. Maduluware Sobitha Thera who had won the hearts of the public including all Buddhists, said Parliamentary Reforms and Media Minister and Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatilleke in a condolence message yesterday.
The message said Ven. Sobitha Thera was a moral advisor who attracted the hearts and minds of devotees by preaching the Dhamma in a simple but firm voice. He communicated his ideas to the public at large impartially without taking sides. No one was able to obstruct his path as he continued his endeavour as a Buddha monk for the benefit and welfare of the public. It is no exaggeration to say that the Ven. Sobitha Thera was the modern image of heroic leaders of the past who took the forefront to defend the country in times of crisis in the history.
He dedicated his life selflessly to create a just society in the country. Although he is no more, his name will remain in people's memory for ever.
May the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha there attain the supreme bless of Nibbana.
