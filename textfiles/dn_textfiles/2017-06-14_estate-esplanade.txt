Estate esplanade

I was born in a tea plantation district at Nawalapitiya and spent my holidays in tea estates where my father was a Tea Estate Conductor, a prestigious position, in estates and a later a small holder of tea plots and my eldest brother too ended up as the superintendent of Brambley Estate Kandapola, when the European planter enlisted to join the army in World War II.
Hence my interest in recalling the happy times I spent during my school holidays, brings back to mind the contribution made by Indian Labour for James Taylor and his successors to bring the Tea industry to a major foreign exchange earner. It was due to the disliking of our Sinhalese to work in tea estates which made the tea plantation owners to bring South Indian labour.
In this context it is apt to quote Emerson Tennent:
The temptation of wages and no prospects of advantages has hitherto availed to overcome the repugnance of the Sinhalese and the Kandyan to engage in any work on estates, except the first process of felling trees.
Again Sir Hugh Clifford, Governor of Ceylon, in his address to the Second Annual Agricultural Conference – Ceylon held on March 11, 1927, had this to say, confirming the statement of Emerson Tennent:
The Ceylon Estates enjoy a perennial supply of voluntary labour is one of the happy accidents which has contributed to the welfare of this fortunate isle, but if the soil of the districts of Madras Presidency, from where that supply was drawn were as fertile as is that of most thickly populated parts of Ceylon, the estate owners might whistle in vain for Tamil labourers to flock to their assistance and our principal agricultural industries would quickly languish, for the place of these workers on the upland tea estates at least could never be taken by the people of this island, The repugnance to work upon estates is I believe as an unconquerable today as it was seventy years ago.
Annexed is a poem describing the life of the early estate Indian woman labourer, for those of today to know the toils and hardships they underwent to bring this valuable asset for prosperity of Sri Lanka
I conclude I this historic note, with the present trend of young Tamil estate youth, both girl and boys taking to other employment in cities and urban areas, there would be no hands to work in Tea Estates – plucking, pruning etc in the near future. What plans have the authorities, the government, made to sustain this industry. 
 
LETCHUMIE 
Here lies an unknown Letchumie 
Under the Tea Bushes, green and shady 
From where she came and where she went
None cares to know how her life was spent.
 
Rises to the beat of Tom Toms in misty morn
Rapped in a Kambili to keep her warm
To the Perettu she walks to earn her wage
Sun or rain, to her, is the same.
 
Up the hills and down the dales,
Every tea bush she reaches with eager face
Her fingers go clip clap, plucking the leaves
When the basket is filled, with smiles she beams
 
The shouts of Sinna Dorai, Kanakapullai and Kangani
She is accustomed to that endless daily symphony 
She bears all that for the love of her brood
Her naked children wait for her return with eager looks.
 
When day’s work is done, she hastily walks
To her ‘Line Room’ for her household chores
Lovingly she pets her dog, cat and hens that lay
The only leisure and pleasure she gets for the day.
 
Sitting, Dining, Bedroom, all in one, except the ‘Lat’
The floor is swept to spread her mat
A tin contains her savings of few rupees and cents
The world revolves in this room, Ten by Ten.
 
Ebony coloured skin, tanned in sun and rain
Her lips are Red with betel stains
Hair parted with Pottu on her radiant face
She is a beauty on a Thai Pongal Day 
 
Huddled in this only room, she goes to sleep
With her brood and pets around her feet
Thus ends the day with no regrets
With daily duty daily done to her ability best.
 
Far away from her homeland now she rests
After her blood, tears and sweat she had shed
Offering her bones and flesh to nourish her alien soil
For the prosperity and peace of this beautiful Isle
 
Her blood runs in our country’s veins
And her toils were to our national gains
Future generations could live without any need
For she had left a fortune in a Cup of Tea
 
Let not racists speak and look with scorn
As she, to this world was lowly born
She has played her part well in her struggled life
Let us be grateful and not unkind
 
When she is judged on the Judgment Day
She would head the list for the sacrifices made
For her merits are boundless and her sins are less
Her place in Heaven is assured, with eternal bliss.
