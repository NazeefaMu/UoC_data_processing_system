Majority of financial disputes due to indebtedness to salesmen

Nearly 70 percent of complaints regarding financial disputes referred to Mediation Boards for settlement are due to people of low-income families falling prey to institutions and persons offering credit, and household and other goods at their doorsteps for repayment on installment basis, it has been revealed.
This indebtedness among low-income groups adversely affected the country's economy, Mediation Boards Commission sources said.
The sources said the Commission planned to set up special Mediation Boards for the settlement of such financial disputes in the future.
This would be done after a thorough analysis of the financial disputes relating to low-income groups which had been ever increasing, sources added.
According to an initial survey, many people in the low-income groups had fallen into dire straits by obtaining credit and goods on repayment basis from institutions and persons visiting their doorsteps.
