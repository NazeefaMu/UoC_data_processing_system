Uma Oya seepage to be fully plugged by January

The water leakage near the Ella Karandagolla tunnel in the Uma Oya project will be fully plugged and sealed in January 2018, Project Director Dr. Sunil de Silva said. He gave this assurance during a meeting of the Badulla District Co-ordinating Committee yesterday.
Dr. Sunil de Silva said the leakage speed which was 1,400 litres per second originally had reduced to 400 litres per second by yesterday (Oct. 23).
This was following remedial measures taken by the Norwegian specialists in the field.
