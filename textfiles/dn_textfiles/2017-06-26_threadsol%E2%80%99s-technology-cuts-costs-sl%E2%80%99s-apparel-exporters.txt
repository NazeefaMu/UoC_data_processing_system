ThreadSol’s technology cuts costs for SL’s apparel exporters

ThreadSol, an enterprise material management provider for the sewn products industry, has been successful savings of upto 10 percent in fabric for garment manufacturers in Sri Lanka with its innovative solutions, IntelloBuy and IntelloCut.
Textiles and garments industry in Sri Lanka depends heavily on imported raw material and accessories.
More than 70 percent of the raw material and 70-90 percent of the accessories used in this industry are imported.
Since fabrics and accessories account for more than 70 percent of the cost of production, lack of backward linkages is a major constraint to the development of this industry.
ThreadSol’s IntelloCut is a material planning and optimization solution for the sewn products industry.
With the help of its advanced algorithms, IntelloCut gives the most optimized fabric usage plan for optimized cutting and wastage reduction.
ThreadSol’s IntelloBuy is a material estimation solution for the sewn products industry. It is the second product by ThreadSol.
IntelloBuy gives accurate buying consumption for a particular style which saves millions of dollars of material cost at fabric buying stage.
ThreadSol has successfully partnered with the largest manufacturers in Sri Lanka including MAS Holdings, Orit Apparels, EAM Maliban Textiles, Omegaline, Crystal Martin, Brandix, and Hirdaramani and helped them reduce their wastage to under 1 percent.
Azeem Ismail, Managing Director, EAM Maliban Textiles, is using ThreadSol’s IntelloCut in 10 of his factories across Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam.
He says, ‘IntelloCut has reduced our effort by effectively handling multiple fabric groups and planning all end pieces which would otherwise be wasted. Indeed a solution worth recommending.’
ThreadSol aims to improve the apparel industry with current technology available in the world and provides all real-time information of the factories to manufacturers on their mobile phones.
“IntelloCut is a powerful business tool that has helped us standardize our cut planning process to achieve consistently high utilization of our fabrics across all sites,” said Colin Vose, COO, Crystal Martin Sri Lanka.
“Sri Lanka’s apparel manufacturers have realized the gravity of targeting fabric cost to increase their profits. In order to stay competitive they need to automate their processes by using the right technology. We are proud to stand by them in these evolving times,’ said Prateek Nigam, Country Manager (Sri Lanka) - ThreadSol.
