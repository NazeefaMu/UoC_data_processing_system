Iron Lady snares second gold

Rio de Janeiro, Tuesday: Hungary's Katinka Hosszu said she felt in "great shape" on Monday as she powered to her second gold medal of the Rio Olympics -- and stayed on track for three more.
Hosszu, dubbed the "Iron Lady" for her renowned stamina, won the 100m backstroke in 58.45sec, ahead of American Kathleen Baker, as Canadian Kylie Masse and China's Fu Yuanhui finished in a dead heat for bronze. Hosszu, who returned little more than an hour later to book her spot in Tuesday's 200m medley final, said she wasn't feeling any pressure from her heavy schedule, which also includes the 200m backstroke and 200m butterfly. On Saturday, the 27-year-old shattered the 400m individual medley world record for her first ever Olympic title.
"I was already very relaxed before the 400IM which was surprising for me," said Hosszu, who arrived in Rio in search of her first Olympic medal.
"I have been racing so much in the past four years that that was kind of my goal that when we get to Rio it would kind of be second nature and it really feels that way.
"I know I've done the 400IM and the 100 back a million times and now I'm fresh and in great shape," she added. Hosszu was sixth at the turn with world champion Emily Seebohm of Australia leading.
She roared home as Seebohm failed not only to improve on the silver she won in London but faded to finish a disappointing seventh.
"I can't believe I won the 100 back," Hosszu said. "I dreamt about it, but I could have done eighth, it's so close."
Seebohm, swimming in unfavorable lane seven after a lackluster semi-final performance, was left looking for answers after coming into the Games with the top time of 2016.
"I definitely wanted to take it out (fast) and obviously it hurt a bit on the back end," she said. "I did a fantastic warm-up. I couldn't have done anything differently.
"My semi needed to be better so I could be in an inside land and have someone to push me," she concluded. AFP
