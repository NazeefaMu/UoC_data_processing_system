Point of view
Equities retained their positive momentum this week, surging ~64 points over the course of the week to push past the key 6500-mark after a 2-week hiatus.
Despite a marginal 2 point drop at the start of the holiday-shortened trading week, investor sentiment turned bullish over the remainder of the week, driven largely by news of the sale of JINS General Insurance business and interest in index-heavy weights such as CARS and NEST. JINS accounted for 13.92 Index points as news of global insurance giant Allianz acquiring the Group’s General Insurance business for a cash consideration of Rs. 16.4Bn pushed the stock price up by ~72% W-o-W.
Despite the general recovery in appetite for risky assets, turnover levels on the Colombo bourse remained mostly flat over the week, gaining just 6% W-o-W to remain at Rs.0.85Bn cf. Rs. 0.80Bn last week; YTD turnover levels so far this year have remained at Rs.0.89Bn, 2.2% lower than the Rs.0.92Bn recorded in FY 2017 but 39% higher than the Rs. 0.64Bn recorded in the comparable period last year.
Institutional and HNI participation over the week however, declined from the high 60-65% levels witnessed so far in 2018, to remain at just 26% over the week.
Net foreign inflows to the CSE meanwhile fell from the notable Rs.1.4Bn recorded last week to an inflow of Rs.259Mn over the week.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the beginning of the Dec’17 corporate earnings season which has just begun.
Urban inflation falls sharply in Jan’18
Urban inflation levels in Jan’18 fell to a 6-month low of 5.8% Y-o-Y, down sharply from the 7.1% Y-o-Y recorded in Dec’17.
The significant decline in headline inflation was driven largely by base effects and a general reduction in F&B prices (from 14.4% in Dec’17 to 10.5% in Jan’18).
Core inflation levels meanwhile, continued to ease from its high of 6% Y-o-Y in August to record a level of 3.5% by Jan’18. Lower inflation levels in January are likely to support the CBSL’s current monetary policy stance (ie: less pressure to increase rates) particularly in the context that the LKR has remained largely stable over 2017 and YTD 2018.
The LKR has depreciated ~0.6% against the USD so far this year, compared to a total depreciation of 2.0% during 2017.
Support for the LKR in 2017 stemmed from a stronger B-o-P position on the back of continued financial inflows mainly in to G-Sec markets and the tourism industry.
Foreign investments to G-sec markets continued to draw net inflows between Mar-Nov’17, while long-term loans to the government increased on a net basis during Jan-Nov period and foreign investments in the CSE remained a net positive cf. the net recorded during the corresponding period of 2016.
Despite a higher trade deficit on the back of higher imports offsetting the double-digit growth in exports therefore, the BOP over Jan-Nov’17 recorded an overall surplus of ~$ 2.0Bn while gross official reserves increased to $7.3Bn billion (equivalent to 4.2 months of imports) cf. $6.0Bn recorded at end-2016.
