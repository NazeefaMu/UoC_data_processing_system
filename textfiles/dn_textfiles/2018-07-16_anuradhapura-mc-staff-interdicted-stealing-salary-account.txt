Anuradhapura MC staff interdicted for stealing salary account

A woman officer and four minor employees attached to the Salaries unit of the Anuradhapura Municipal Council have been interdicted in connection with an alleged financial fraud which has occurred in 2014, Mayor H.P. Somadasa said, addressing a press conference held at the Municipal Council.
Somadasa said initial investigators revealed that the suspect had allegedly spirited away more than Rs. 3 million by computing salaries of close associates among minor staff in excess of the due amount and crediting the money to their bank amounts. He said an internal investigation is now being conducted to ascertain the amount of money which had been pocketed in this manner.
