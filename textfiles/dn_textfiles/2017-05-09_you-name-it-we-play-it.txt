You name it, we play it

The Marians were formed through the sacrifice and courage of one man. This man is Nalin Perera. Over the years it has become one of the most versatile and dynamic bands in the Sri Lankan music industry.
Daily News features the Marians comprising of Prasanna Rosa (Lead Guitar), Ruwan Fernando (Rhythm Guitar), Chaminda Silva (Bass Guitar), Dileepa Mangala (Key Boardist), Subash Punyasoma (Drums), Jayantha Kandabadage (Percussionist), Shivantha Fernando (Vocalist) and Shehan Jayasuriya (Saxophonist) and led by the inspiring Nalin Perera (band leader).
As a band Nalin tries to inculcate in his band members, an acceptance of different music styles. Nalin points out that in Sri Lanka lots listen to Sinhala, English, Hindi and Tamil.
“As a band we try to cater to a diverse audience. We really like to play some retro type music. In the international music industry you have rock, classical and jazz. So you can’t take one side in Sri Lanka because people like to listen to different types of music. So we do every kind of music style. That is the talent we have today. You name it we can play it. Music is a Universal language. It does not matter if you cannot understand that language – Hindi, Sinhala or Tamil. So why should we limit ourselves to one language/ one music style to produce our music?” said Nalin putting things in perspective.
The Marians perform in a lot of weddings. So they have to cater to the diversity out there. There are Tamil weddings, Sinhala weddings and Muslim weddings.
“We perform so many styles of English songs. We perform the hits, all the styles, even hip hop. As a musician you need that power to entertain. That is why we have so many fans all over Sri Lanka! We never forget any community in Sri Lanka. Music is the bridge to communication between different communities. It is really great! In India we try to do some Hindi Songs. They were highly impressed with our Hindi songs. In USA and Australia, same story, the crowd loved it!,” pointed out Nalin.
The Marians have put out seven albums, all originals. They have also have done some video productions. We have done some 60 – 70 original songs. In addition to all of this Nalin has done his solo performances.
“Our band can understand the audience very easily, through our experience. We see the audience and we can judge within a second what to do. That is because of our experience. We have been doing it for almost 30 years in front of different types of people. My band line up is highly professional. They know what I am thinking and the goals I have and my vision. That is essential for a leader,” stated Nalin.
“When I was doing my A/Ls I organized a singing competition which marked the beginning of the Marians. At that time I was the head prefect of the school. At that time I did not have a name. So I happened to talk to the principal and revealed to him my intentions of starting a band. So we both brainstormed and came up with the name ‘Marians’, since my school is Chilaw St. Mary’s college. So those were the early beginnings of the band,” said Nalin Perera.
At the very early stages of his youth Nalin’s intention was to become a musician. He spent a lot of time familiarizing himself with music neglecting his studies. In the years to come he would devote his life entirely to music. “I got 4 Fs. But I had a great ambition to become a musician in this country. I have been influenced by so many people. One is Sunil Perera of Gypsies. We formed a friendship that has benefited my music. He helped me a lot. I met musicians who were around that time and we properly formed a band releasing our first Album in 1989 and subsequently did some shows,” stated Perera. The band Marians has been in action for 29 years, dominating the music scene in Sri Lanka. “To me discipline is very important. That is something I am very keen on. If you have no discipline you cannot go forward and progress. We are very qualified in our fields. The band members have experience in different kinds of bands but finally they joined with me to do a different kind of music, to do something new. That is something I always think of. Something new,” pointed out Nalin.
Nalin feels that dreams can be realized. “In this country parents want children to be doctors or engineers or a lawyers. But my intention was to become an artist. That is what I focused my mind on. I told me self –‘you do whatever you like’. You have to find out who you are. Luckily I got that chance. When I was doing my A/Ls I did Bio Science. Somewhere down the line I felt that this was not going to work. Then I changed my class to Math because my good friends were there. During that time I did not study anything, I allocated all my time to music – band rehearsals. My parents were a little unhappy because they expected me to become a doctor one day,” explained Nalin.
Seeing tear drops from his father’s eyes broke his heart, but Nalin was set on his path.
“That was like a fire burning in me. I had never seen tears in his eyes. But those tears gave me the incentive. We were not a very wealthy family, but my father provided for us. I felt that what I do, I must do it properly being the eldest in the family. With my determination, hard work and sacrifice I awaited my time. Then I met my wife at that time. Her parents helped me a lot to develop my band. The challenges I faced in my life helped me to take Marians up to a high standard. I wanted to become a musician because I had a passion for it. So today I have achieved that dream. It does not matter who you are. Or where you came from. Only thing that matters are your thoughts. Your mind is the most powerful weapon that you will possess in your life. So my advice to anyone is to work on your dreams. Work hard and you can make it a reality,” elucidated Nalin.
Nalin’s son is studying for his O/Ls this time. “But I can see that he is not studying. He wants to become a film maker! So this is just like flashback to me. My wife is so worried about him. But I know one day he will succeed. You have to believe in yourself. You have to give your children a chance to aim at their goals. If you impose barricades life goes down. You see every person has a different kind of talent. In my life I want to give my fullest support to the newcomers. These talents create a different world in this country. I can see that today so many people are enjoying my singing,” added Nalin.Nalin feels his duty is to provide entertainment. With a fine band behind his back the sky is the limit for Nalin. Today he is thinking of new innovative things to do with his band in this country.
“As a band leader, singer and TV Presenter I have lots of good ideas for my future and for my field. I have also acted in a film in 2003. I feel that one is free to do anything. One day we will close our eyes for the final time in this world. And you can’t take anything with you. So do the right thing. As a musician I have done a lot for this country. As a human being I have done so much for charity. And I am still doing. God has given me the chance to become an artist in this world. Under the sun and moon we are all the same,” revealed Nalin.
