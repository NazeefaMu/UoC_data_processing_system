Aaron Finch laments Australia’s ‘horrific’ batting:
‘Car crash in slow motion’

Australia captain Aaron Finch was disappointed at how his side got shot out for 89 by Pakistan in the first T20I, likening the performance to a ‘car crash in slow motion’.
In a chase of 156, Australia slipped to 22/6 inside the Powerplay as Imad Wasim and Faheem Ashraf wreaked havoc, and it was only through a 38-run stand for the seventh wicket between Ashton Agar and Nathan Coulter-Nile that they were able to recover somewhat.
Finch, who himself got out for a duck, didn’t mince words in his assessment of the top order and took the blame for failing to get his team off to a better start.
“Opening the batting, it’s my responsibility to get us off to a good start and set up the chase there,” said Finch. “I take full responsibility for that.”
“I think any time that you’re chasing a total like that it’s important you have a solid start and for me to get out in the first over and not give us that was not good enough. That Powerplay was horrific ... it was like a car crash in slow motion.”
Finch admitted that there could be a few shake-ups to the personnel after that ‘awful’ performance, particularly in the batting department. He did however spare a word of praise for the bowlers, who kept Pakistan in check despite opener Babar Azam scoring an unbeaten 68.
“I think all in all, our bowling performance was pretty good. Our fielding was slightly sloppy, then the batting was awful. Definitely when that happens, when you lose a game so badly, you have to look at everything.”
For Pakistan, they’ll have fewer selection considerations to make ahead of the second T20I at Dubai on Friday if any at all. They looked solid in all departments. Not too many batsmen had a chance after a lengthy 73-run partnership between Azam and Mohammad Hafeez for the second wicket, but a eight-ball 17 not out cameo by Hasan Ali in the end gave Pakistan late impetus.
Sarfraz Ahmed the captain was delighted at the overall performance.”The partnership between Babar and Hafeez was crucial for us. We knew, if we make 160, we will be in the game,” he said.
“We want to take wickets in the Powerplay and we did that today. Imad was superb in his comeback match. The hitting done by Hassan Ali in the death overs dragged the total over 150 and that brought us back in the match.”
