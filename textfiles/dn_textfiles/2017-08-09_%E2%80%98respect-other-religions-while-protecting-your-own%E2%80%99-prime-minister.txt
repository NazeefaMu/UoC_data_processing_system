‘Respect other religions while protecting your own’: Prime Minister

 
It is equally important to respect other religions while protecting your own as no religion developed in Isolation Prime Minsiter Ranil Wickremasinghe said
The Prime Minister made these remarks addressing the gathering today at 20th Commemorative lecture of Deshamanya M.A Bakeer Markar at Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
He said it was the division among communities that paved way for conflicts.
"We can't let go of divided identities.  Irrespective of one's religion, we should move forward as one nation and that would further strengthen our development”, he said.
The commemorative lecture was delivered by former Prime Minister of Turkey Prof Ahmet Davutoglu on " Multi culturalism as a basis for peace".
