Home gardening promoted at school level

Under the ‘Sustainable Development Programme’ implemented by the Education Ministry, a home garden project was implemented growing crops such as vegetables and other supplementary food crops, at selected schools in the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone.
The schools are greatly interested in home gardening and fruit cultivation under the national programme. They are also benefited by this programme, said Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director A.M.Rahmathullah, when he visited the Pottuvil divisional schools during an inspection tour recently.
Cultivation of vegetables, other supplementary food crops and fruits also have been given priority under the national programme in the Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai and Pottuvil divisional schools in the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone.
Twenty seven schools in the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone have implemented the special ‘Sustainable Development Programme’ activities. Rs. 50,000 has been allocated for development of each school. The Education Ministry has allocated the funds for this scheme.
Under this programme, home gardening, environmental protection, drug prevention, kidney disease prevention and child protection work programmes are underway, he further said.
A supervisory committee has been appointed to monitor the works within the Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai and Pottuvil Divisional schools in the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone.
