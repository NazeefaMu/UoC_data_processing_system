ETI Directors barred from leaving

Directors of Edirisinghe Trust Investments Limited (ETI), Jeewaka, Deepa, Nalaka and Asanka Edirisinghe have been barred from travelling overseas.
They have been ordered to appear before the Fort Magistrate on July 17.
Depositors held protests and lodged complaints over ETI’s failure to pay back depositors’ money. A probe found that in 2012 ETI Finance, which was a licensed finance company, was keeping a second set of books and taking public deposits which were not disclosed to the Central Bank.
