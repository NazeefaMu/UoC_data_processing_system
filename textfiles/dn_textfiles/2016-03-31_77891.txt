Flames of the Golden Blues on April 2

St Anthony's Girls College, Kandy will go out favourites when they take on Mahamaya Girls College, Kandy, in their 2nd Hockey Big match known as the "Flames of the Golden Blues' which will be played at St Anthony's Girls College Sports Complex, Katugastota this Saturday April 2nd commencing at 8 am.
Director of Sports and Physical Education of the Central Province Department of Education Athula Jayawardena will be the Chief Guest.
The Anthonian girls won the inaugural encounter last year by a comfortable margin of 3-0 following a major role played by two of their top players Sanduni Devagiri and skipper Nadeeshani Warigahetti. They will be in the team this year too. Last year St Anthony's Girls College won the All Island Schools Girls under 19 hockey championship and finished second runner up at the National School Games. They were also runner in the Central Province girls schools under 19 hockey championship.
Mahamaya Girls College who were one time National School Games hockey champions but for some inexplicapable reason stopped playing the game till it was revived a few years ago.
Both teams coached by Sri Lanka women's coach G G Dharmaratne who had to play a neutral role last year wearing two hats.
