Second phase of drought relief distribution in Anuradhapura delayed

Drought affected families in the Anuradhapura district complain that they have not received second quota of the free dry food ration still. A few weeks ago 157,593 families received first portion of the ration to the value of Rs. 2,500 each.
The Disaster Management Ministry reportedly had postponed delivering the food rations saying that recipients in 22 Divisional Secretaries have to be rechecked for their eligibility to receive the second portion.
Anuradhapura District Secretariat sources said 157,503 families selected for the relief but that number has been reduced to 138,000 on the grounds that they had not taken part in social work at drought relief work sites as directed by the authorities. The sources said reports in this regard were already submitted to the Ministry and the second phase would commence on September 15.
The Acting Government Agent said distributing drinking water through bowers had been slowed down since the drought affected areas were now receiving rains. Earlier 28,000 families were supplied drinking water and now only 17,000 families receive water from the bowsers. Thambuttegama and Thirappane are not supplied water from bowers at present.
