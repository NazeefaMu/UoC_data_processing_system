Caretakers accused of abusing 22 children

Twenty two children allegedly abused by caretakers of an orphanage in the Rasnayakapura village in the Kurunegala District were admitted to the Kurunegala Government Hospital for treatment under police protection last week.
The orphanage managed under the guidance of the Childcare and Probation Department of the North Western Province Provincial Council has housed 32 children.
The remaining children were handed over to their relatives and the place was now closed down.
The orphanage has been operative for 26 years under a three-member committee guided by a Buddhist monk in the Kurunegala district.
Nikaweratiya police are investigating.
