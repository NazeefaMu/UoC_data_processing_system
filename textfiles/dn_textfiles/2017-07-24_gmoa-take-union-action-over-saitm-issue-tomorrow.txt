GMOA to take union action over SAITM issue tomorrow

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has decided to take stern trade union action from 8.00 am tomorrow (July 25) if the Government failed to meet eight demands today (July 24), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said their first demand was to announce the ownership of the white van number NP - 0410, the identity of thugs came in it, the person who gave them the order, the details of the connection (if there is any between the police and them) and to assure that such events will not take place in the future.
Dr. Aluthge said secondly they demand to take legal action against all persons connected to the abduction attempt. They demand to apologize the nation for the abduction attempt, not to suppress innocent unarmed students and release all the university students now in custody without any charges.
The Government should give a written assurance today (July 24) for appointing a President for the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) acceptable to the SLMC, declare the final decision on gazetting the `Minimum Standards of Medical Education’ and release a legal document assuring that the SAITM will discontinue enrolling students and offer them degrees, he said.
