[COURTESY CORNER] When the world shows empathy and fights doggedly for children’s rights
Looking after our little ones!

Friday November 20 was United Nations’ Universal Children’s Day. It was first established in 1954 to promote international unity and awareness amongst and about children worldwide.
UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund, promotes and coordinates this special day, which also works towards improving children’s welfare. On December 14, 1954, the resolution 836 (IX) of the General Assembly encouraged the establishment of this day across many countries, in order to ‘promote the ideals and objectives of the Charter and the welfare of the children of the world’. The date chosen (20th of November) marks two important events in terms of establishing children’s rights. The first event was when the Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1959, and the second event was the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989. This year it was celebrated under the theme: ‘A Benevolent Land that Dazzles the World with Child Friendly Environment.’
Issuing a message for World Children’s Day, President Maithripala Sirisena said the unconditional responsibility for the protection of children lies with the entire nation. In his hard-hitting statement the president lamented that recently reported incidents show that the responsibility of protecting children has been shirked by society. He said that the problem should be rectified immediately and provisions must be made to implement laws and introduce new laws, or amend existing laws.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s communiqué on the occasion stressed that it behoved all society to protect and shield children by understanding their mindset. He reiterated that treating them with loving care, buffering them against suffering and pressure directed from society and family and strengthening them to face challenges of life was a primary consideration. He added that sheltering children against disasters and abuse has become a grave responsibility cast on parents and elders.
The occasion also allows the discussion of children's rights in conjunction with the sustainable development goals. Goals such as poverty reduction, health, education, sanitation and equality are all important not only for sustainable development but also for children's rights and well-being.
True, not all of us can look back on our childhood as the most joyous time of our lives. The more privileged among us are perhaps unaware that millions of children in our own nation as well as in many undeveloped countries elsewhere are subjected to untold hardships from the time they come squealing into the world. Their parents too in many parts of the universe struggle with their own problems such as lack of health care, financial insecurity and abuse. The idea of a Universal Children’s Day was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1954 to protect children working long hours in dangerous circumstances and provide all of them with access to an education.
Nearly 25 years ago, the world made a promise to children. That we would do everything in our power to protect and promote their rights to survive and thrive, to learn and grow, to make their voices heard and to reach their full potential. In spite of the overall gains, there are many children who have fallen even further behind. Old challenges have combined with new problems to deprive many children of their rights and the benefits of development. To meet these challenges, and to reach those children and helpless elders in society who are hardest to reach, we need new ways of thinking and new innovative strategies. There is much to celebrate as we mark the 25th anniversary of the Convention, from declining infant mortality to rising school enrolment, but this historic milestone must also serve as an urgent reminder that much remains to be done.
And what about the children we have sworn to nurture and protect? Are we focusing enough on child labour, which refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful? Forced labour in general takes different forms, including debt bondage, human trafficking and other forms of modern slavery. The most vulnerable victims are young women and girls forced into prostitution, migrants trapped in debt bondage and sweatshop or farm workers kept there by clearly illegal tactics and paid little or nothing. Children everywhere hold the key to the future of a country. It is the responsibility of every single person to safeguard children.
UNICEF estimates that over half of the 30,000 child sex workers in Sri Lanka are boys. Does this not sound the alarm that we are increasingly on the way to earning the shameful reputation of becoming a nation of perverts, pederasts and paedophiles? It is because of our silence that these depravities will continue.
All Sri Lankan voices should be heard to boom with outrage against such abuse of our children. Remember that our children should be considered more precious resources than the nation’s gold reserves.
Here in Sri Lanka a senseless conflict which raged for nearly 30 years has taken a devastating toll on thousands of families.
Now with the war six years behind us there must be a concerted effort to help this unfortunate segment of the population to ensure their basic survival.
Have we given a single thought to the orphans of war and the victims of natural disasters who have never felt the touch of a mother’s love? Or of a family which has lost its breadwinner father and protector and is struggling to survive?
Everyone, regardless of their sundry spiritual beliefs, should reflect on the needs of these dispossessed widows, children and the old and infirm from both sides of the ethnic divide.
That is because they have all been pursued by the remorseless furies of terror, bereavement, bloodshed and brutality.
Among them are the swarms of orphaned children, those forsaken waifs and strays of war whose predicament should inflame the empathy and heartfelt emotions of every decent soul.
