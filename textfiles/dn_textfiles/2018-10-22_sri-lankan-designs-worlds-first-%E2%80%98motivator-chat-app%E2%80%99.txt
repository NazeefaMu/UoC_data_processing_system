Sri Lankan designs worlds first ‘Motivator chat App’

A young Sri Lanka entrepreneur has designed the world’s first academic social network, ‘Motivator chat App’ which would be launched end of this year.
The mentor behind this App Jude Lakshan Ukwatte said that this App would have a global patent and it would be launched in Copenhagen. This is because the intellectual property laws are very strong in Copenhagen. He said that this ‘Motivator Chat App’ would be different to any other App or system since it would motivate users. “Motivator chat inspire and empower people to overcome their hurdles. He said that he expected over 5 million users in the first year of its operation. “My target is 20 million users by 2020. I will promote Motivator chat App through social media.”
“I expect many CEO’s and influential people using this App and they would communicate and share their experiences.” He said that the idea behind the creation of this App was generated, when he was at the London South Bank University (UK) where he received both his BSC in Business Management and the MBA.
He said that the App would be operated on a subscriber model and they would also entertain certain amount of advertising.
“We will first invest around Rs. 75 million for the launch and also to maintain a Data Farm to store information of our users”. Data farming is the process of using designed computational experiments to “grow” data, which can then be analyzed using statistical and visualization techniques to obtain insight into complex systems. After two years we hope to have a second Data Farm in Kandy where over 100 would be employed. Investment would be over Rs. 150 million. The second stage of the Motivatorchat App’ would be to introduce to other languages such as Nigerian, Spanish, Tamil and later Sinhala.”
Jude Ukwatte based in Copenhagen is also a Director of Lanka Property Club. (SS)
