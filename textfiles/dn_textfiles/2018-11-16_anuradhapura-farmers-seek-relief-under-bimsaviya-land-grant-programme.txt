Anuradhapura farmers seek relief under Bimsaviya land grant programme

Farmer organisations in the Anuradhapura district request that the conditions in relation to the Bimsaviya land alienation scheme be revised and the surveying and other fees be reduced.
The representatives of Mahakanadarawa, Rajangane, Padaviya, Wahalkade, Nachchaduwa, Nuwarawewa and Galenbidunawewa farmer organisations made this request to the Anuradhapura Government Agent and the Additional Government Agent (Land), at a recent meeting of the Anuradhapura Land Commissioner’s district agriculture committee.
Referring to the matter, Rajangane integrated farmer organisations Chairman Nihal Wanniarachchi said that the majority of land being surveyed for issuing Bimsaviya ownership certificates belonged to low-income group farmer families and it was not justifiable to levy a sum of around Rs. 75,000 per allotment for surveying, etc.
According to the Land Commissioner’s Department, under the present system, low-income group landowners were required to bear expenses such as payment to the government Survey Department for supervision and the licensed surveyor for surveying the particular land for becoming eligible for a Bimsaviya ownership certificate.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake commenting on the matter told the Daily News that he has instructed the Anuradhapura Deputy Land Commissioner Sandya Abesekara to take up the matter with the Land Ministry for granting some relief since the low-income group families face the problem of heavy charges under the Bimsaviya programme.
