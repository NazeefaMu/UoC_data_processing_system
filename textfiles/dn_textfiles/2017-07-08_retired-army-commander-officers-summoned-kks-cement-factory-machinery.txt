Retired Army Commander, officers summoned in KKS Cement Factory machinery removal probe

The Presidential Commission investigating into mass scale corruption and frauds has summoned former Army Commander, General Daya Ratnayake, retired Major General Mahinda Hathurusinghe, retired Major General Udaya Perera and a former Defence Ministry Secretary before the commission on July 14 to obtain a statement over the removal of machinery running into millions from the Kankesanthurai Cement factory for scrap iron.
The commission has begun investigating into a complaint that the army was involved in removing machinery weighing over 600 tonnes from the Kankesanthurai cement factory without the approval of the Cement Corporation.
