Agriculture losses Rs.18 bn annually: Experts

The annual losses incurred by Sri Lanka during cultivation, harvest and post-harvest amounted to Rs. 18 billion, research done by a team of Chinese specialists revealed.
Crop damage caused by animals, loss during harvesting, and neglect of crops due to lack of marketing facilities contributed to this colossal loss, according to the report submitted by the team appointed by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a Ministry release said.
The report also included recommendations made by the team to overcome this loss. The report said that 30 percent of the crops were damaged by wild animals and birds, which included monkeys, wild boar, porcupine, peacocks and elephants.
Another 30 percent crop loss was incurred due to post-harvest losses and drought conditions, resulting in only about 40 percent of crops being utilised for consumption.
The team told the Minister that losses could be overcome by utilising new technology, modern harvesting methods, and educating farmers about these techniques.
The Minister also thanked the Chinese team for submitting the report containing the recommendations.
