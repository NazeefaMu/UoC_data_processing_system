‘Mahinda Rajapaksa forgets his criticism of Army commanders’

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who accuses the government of targeting war heroes, seems to have conveniently forgotten the manner in which he targeted commanders of the Army during his rule, Regional Development and Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
The Minister said that one should preach to others by following such advice oneself.
Field Marshal Fonseka was speaking to the media after his maiden inspection tour of the Yala National Park in his capacity as Wildlife Minister, on May 21.
He observed that a Minister should make public statements in a responsible manner and said that he would guard his tongue whenever innuendos are levelled by others. Fonseka said there were allegations of illegal clearing being undertaken in the Nimalawa section in Yala. He said he would look into the matter and take necessary remedial action if warranted.
The Minister said most illegal activities were taking place due to a severe shortage of wildlife officers and he would take necessary action to rectify that problem. Steps would be taken soon to declare the elephant corridor in Hambantota as a state reserve though a gazette notification.
He said out of the five human deaths caused by elephant attacks recently, three had occurred because the people concerned had ventured into the reserve in an unauthorised manner. As such, a quick solution had to be found to the human–elephant conflict.
