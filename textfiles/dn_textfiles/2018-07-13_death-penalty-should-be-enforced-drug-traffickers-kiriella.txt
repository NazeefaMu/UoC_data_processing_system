Death penalty should be enforced on drug-traffickers: Kiriella

Leader of the House and Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said he was prepared to impose capital punishment on drug-traffickers in future.
“The first step to build a nation free of drug-related crimes should begin at home; parents play a pivotal role in nurturing the future generations of this country,” the minister said, “I served in the Kandy courts as a lawyer for a period of 25 years, during which I had witnessed multiple cases that involved children addicted to drugs and alcohol.”
“When I listened to their stories, I understood that they became addicted to drugs and alcohol due to unstable domestic environments; there were even a few cases with children from upper-class families being addicted to drugs and alcohol,” he said, adding that therefore, it was of utmost importance for parents to build a safe environment for their children, to avoid such unfortunate incidents from recurring in the future,” he added.
The programme which was initiated by President Maithripala Sirisena in order to eradicate drugs and alcohol in this country, was designed to encourage and educate people against drugs; it is a great programme, Minister Kiriella said.
He added that Cabinet had held discussions regarding the matter, and that they were ready to enforce strict rules on drug-traffickers—even the death penalty. Although there were numerous rules and regulations in place at present, the unit which was family must be strong in order to fight the drug menace in the country.
“Before 1815, there were no bars in Kandy; it was after the colonisation by the British Empire that our people were drawn to alcohol and drugs. In 1810, King Sri Wickrama Rajasingha drove back the British forces,” he said.
“But during the five years that followed, the king became addicted to alcohol and lost the trust and respect of his court and rulers. As a result, the British were able to claim power over Kandy once again. We must learn from the mistakes of our past to move forward as a country,” he added.
A large number of ministers and parliamentarians were present at the event, which was chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena.
