No show by Joint Oppostion

 
Journalists and photo journalists who visited the Rajagiriya Dr. N.M. Perera memorial hall to cover a hastily convened press conference organised by the Joint Opposition at 11 a.m. yesterday had to kick their heels and waste their valuable time as they were later informed by short messages that the press conference was canceled after several hours.
