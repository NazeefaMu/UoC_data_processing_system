GMOA’s token strike in six districts

The token strike launched by the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday in protest of not offering a people friendly solution to the SAITM issue, will continue today in six districts, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the token strike will take place in state hospitals in Vavuniya, Matale, Anuradhapura, Badulla, Monaragala and Matara districts today.
The token strike will hit five more districts tomorrow, he said.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said the government is not declaring the solution for the SAITM issue.
“Public servants should be careful when following orders of politicians because they will be imprisoned if they break law and support them. It is questionable how one politician got so much of power to pump millions of rupees to the Dr. Nevil Fernando Hospital,” Ananda said.
