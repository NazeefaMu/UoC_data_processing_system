Sri Lanka wins toss, batting first vs Pakistan in 4th ODI

 
Sri Lanka, desperate to break a 10-match losing streak, won the toss and elected to bat first against Pakistan in the fourth one-day international a short while ago.
Pakistan already has an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series and awarded an ODI debut to 23-year-old left-arm seamer Usman Shinwari, who replaced Rumman Raees.
Also, allrounder Imad Wasim returned after being dropped from the last game in place of Faheem Ashraf.
Sri Lanka, with its middle-order batsmen struggling, gave a debut to Sadeera Samarawickrama four out-of-form Chamara Kapugedera.
All-rounder Seekkuge Prasanna also received his first match of the series and replaced Jeffrey Vandersay, while fast bowler Suranga Lakmal returned in place of Dushmantha Chameera.
