Tips for growing vegetable plants in your backyard
1) Start small and plant things you'd really like to eat.
2) Pick a spot with at least 6 hours of good daytime light and access to water.
3) Make your own compost
4)Consider using a raised garden bed, which allows you to control the soil and nutrient blend.
5)Talk to other backyard gardeners in your area to get a sense of what grows well in your region and when.
 
Can you guess who said this?

“On March 20, 2009, I was like any other hopeful gardener with a pot out on the windowsill or a small plot by the back door. I was nervously watching the sky. Would it freeze? Would it rain? I had spent two months settling into a new house in a new city. My girls had started a new school; my husband, a new job. My mother had just moved in upstairs. And now I was embarking on something I have never attempted before: starting a garden.”
It was First Lady Michelle Obama who said so, in her first ever book:’ American Grown.’
All those who guessed the right answer may now proceed to quiz number two.
Who said the following?
‘I love to travel all over the country, spend at least six hours a day glued to my Mac writing away to earn a living and am always ready for an argument (provided it's about books) or an evening at the Punchi Theatre. Yet, since I started writing the “Down to Earth” series I realize I'd rather be digging around in my backyard than any other place on earth. Yet, during all these years I existed, the closest I came to gardening was over-watering the snake plant on my desk, which had an untimely death six months ago.’
If you can see the grin on my face right now, you would guess straight away who said the above. I did, of course.
I confess my attempts at gardening are still too amateurish to boast about. But, what I learned even within this short span with a spade in my hands is enough to keep me hooked to digging, for the rest of my life.
It came as no surprise that, after a spell of gardening of an evening, when I logged onto gardening sites on the net, I came across sites that said gardening could be a stress-buster.
I didn't need psychiatrists, though, to tell me that the process of gardening is incredibly cathartic. I already knew, from experience.
Even though, this may seem hard to believe (until you try it) every plant in your garden, will make you feel good. It is incredibly gratifying to watch a seed of bitter-gourd raise its tiny head from the ground, turn into a graceful vine and finally sprout beautiful four petaled yellow flowers. You might find the hours spent inspecting a Kathurumurunga plant for worms, too tedious, but scientists say, bending, stretching, reaching and stooping are invigorating. A good way to stop things from getting monotonous, according to expert gardeners, is to rotate your tasks from day to day. “Variety is a must if you want to develop a garden work/pleasure ethos. One day it's weeding, the next it's removing branches and dead leaves, the next it's watering. I love visiting nurseries-buying new plants and bushes is better than buying new shoes,” says Marian McEvoy, former editor of Elle Décor and House Beautiful magazines.
I know, you might find the transition from clothes and books and furniture to trees and flower beds not that easy. But the wonderful thing is whereas a skirt, or a settee, stays the same, a plant grows, changes shape and color, attracts bees and butterflies. They depend on you the way clothes and furniture do not. You have to water them, protect them from snails and beetles, pamper them with compost. Besides, clothes and furniture might fade, but they do not often wither and die. But, alas, death is a constant occurrence with plants, reminding you, every day, the philosophy of the sages:Nothing in this world is permanent, and we are foolish when we ask anything to last.
Still, it's hard to watch an innocent plant in the throes of death. So, making a fist at death and chanting Donne's famous lines, “Death thou shalt die”, I called the Horticultural Crop Research Development Institute, at Gannoruwa and asked them for advice. The answer I wanted to hear the most was what kind of vegetables will grow in my backyard, here in Colombo. The Programming Assistant who listened to me, very kindly explained brinjals, chillies, tomatoes and leafy vegetables like gotukola are the best plants for me. She assured me saying, “Gardening is not as complicated as you might think. All you need is a few square feet of the great outdoors, a water source, and a little time. Your grandparents did it, and so can you.” In other words, the mantra goes like this: Find a good nursery and buy three or four plants of each kind. Dig the holes in a sunny place, within sight of the house. Wait. Watch. Repeat.
The important word here, is ‘repeat. For, gardening is a never-ending process. Massive rainfalls or extended droughts cause havoc. Weeding is a pain until you get into the rhythm of it. Snails, caterpillars and beetles have insatiable appetites. Some plants need pruning every week, some never flower, some flower but never bear fruits. And yet, when something actually takes hold, sprouts and grows tall and straight, it is worth all the mistakes and frustrations.
Specially when the seeds you planted end up as food on your family's plates. I remember, Chef Pubilis, telling me sometime ago, it is essential that every household should have one tree of Karapinchha, one plant of green chilly and one bush of Rampe. In addition to all the other poison free, organic vegetables we could grow in our garden, that is. For, unarguably, fresh food is the best food! Ever wondered for how long the vegetables on your supermarket shelf have been there? For how long did they travel from Dambulla or Nuwara Eliya to your table? Comparing the flavor of a homegrown bundle of dambala with the taste of a store-bought one is like comparing Ceylon tea to any other tea in the world. If it tastes better, you will be more likely to eat the healthy, fresh produce that you know your body needs.
And, when they are growing in your backyard, you won't be able to resist them. Moreover, their vitamin content will be at their highest levels as you bite into them straight from the garden. Parents, take note: A study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that preschool children who were almost always served homegrown produce were more than twice as likely to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day-and to like them more-than kids who rarely or never ate homegrown produce.
So, keep digging: If I can do it, anyone can.

From a great gardner..
‘We may have a wider approach to garden design if we have been helped to appreciate other forms of art: to be aware of basic principles - balance, repetition, harmony and simplicity - which apply to all forms of creativity'
- Beth Chatto
The Beth Chatto Gardens prove that a garden can be created in any conditions if the correct plants are used.
When creating a garden you have to ‘accept the existing conditions, choose the right plants for that location and work with what is there – plants must fend for themselves’.
According to Chatto, using what is there is the key, rather than taking the option that most gardeners do, of making wholesale changes to the soil and site to suit the traditional style.
Everything in the garden is arranged so it looks good now and contributes in the future – one year, five years, ten years – so it is advantageous to know your plants.

Keeping orchids alive in your home
As indoor plants, orchids can look beautiful (although mind the petals as they are liable to drop off).
* When you buy an orchid, it usually comes in a pot of loosely packed material, often chips of barks and small stones. Beware of over-watering, for it likes nothing less than to sit in a wet container.
* It is better to be purposely forgetful with an orchid and ignore it rather than over-watering. When you do water it, give it a thorough wetting and allow it to dry out again before the next water.
* The colour of the leaves provide a good scale for how much light the orchid is getting. A rich, dark green leaf is a sign that your orchid isn’t receiving sufficient light, and a grass green colour – a light or medium green with yellow tones – means that your orchid is receiving enough light to bloom.
* A south of east-facing window is best for your friendly orchid, so position it well.
