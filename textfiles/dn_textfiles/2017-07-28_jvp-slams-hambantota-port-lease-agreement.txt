JVP slams Hambantota Port lease agreement

The agreement approved by the Cabinet to lease out the Hambantota Port to China, came under fire by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka.
He said the harbour is being constructed at a cost of US $ 1,380 million and the government is going to alienate it for 99 years to a Chinese company for US $ 1,400 million along with its services and businesses.
“According to the agreement, the company, Chinese Merchant, is also to receive an extra 1,150 hectares of land adjoining the harbour which is in excess of the 400 acres on which it is located,” Dissanayaka said at a press conference at the JVP Headquarters.
“They do not seem to have included in their agreement the estimates as regards the value of land in total,” he said.
“The construction of the Hambantota Harbour has cost the country US$ 1,380 million. Four years have gone by since the completion of the project. If one is going to construct a harbour in the present day, the cost would involve an extra 20 percent,” he pointed out.
Therefore, he said, “the government has apparently made an attempt to sell a valuable public asset in the country for a song as with this agreement.”
