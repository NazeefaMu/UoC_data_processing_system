Questions and answers

Custody of a child
Question
My wife has filed a maintenance case, claiming maintenance for her and our daughter. We have been living separately for three years. My daughter is now 10 years. She is living with my wife. I pay Rs. 15,000 per month to my daughter. Can I ask my daughter’s custody in my maintenance case? My wife is not allowing me to meet the child. I tried to meet her at school, but was not allowed. Please advise me, what are the legal remedies available?
Karunarathne, Katana
Answer
You can’t claim custody in the maintenance case. But you can request the court to give access to your child as you are paying maintenance to your child. If you need the custody of your child you have to file a custody case in the District Court. However as the upper guardian, the Court will consider the best interest of your daughter and give custody to a suitable parent.
Second copy of a Deed
Question
I bought a land five years ago. I am trying to sell the land to another person. I applied for a second copy of the deed of transfer and the Land Registry informed me that the notary who executed the deed has not handed over the second copy with stamp duty. But I paid the notary the total cost including the stamp duty on the date of execution. Will this situation affect my ownership rights?
Pujitha, Matara
Answer
It is the duty of the Notary to submit duplicates of the deeds he executed to the Land Registry where he practices before the 15th of every month. If the notary has given you the registered original deed it will not affect your rights. However, as you have paid the stamp duty and the notary hasn’t taken steps to register the second copy, it will be a ground to take disciplinary action against the Notary.

Damaged deed in the Land Registry
Question
My father had two paddy lands in Kandy. He passed away. I couldn’t find the deeds of the said lands but I have the deed numbers and registration dates of the deeds. I applied for copies of the said deeds from the Land Registry, Kandy. They informed that they are unable to provide the copies as the documents are damaged. How can I get those copies? There is no one interested about this land. How can I obtain the ownership of this land? Please advice.
Almeda, Bandaragama
Answer
You can obtain a certification from the Registrar of the Land Registry regarding damaged deeds. However, you can apply for extracts of the relevant folio of deeds. You can even ask from the Notary who attested the deeds if you know. If you are seeking the ownership, you can then execute a deed of declaration. But if there are other parties who have rights to the lands then they also can claim for their rights.

Functions of the Mediation Board Commission
Question
Please explain about the Mediation Board Commission and how it functions?
A Law Student, Kandy
Answer
The powers and functions of the Mediation Board are included in Mediation Boards Act, No. 72 of 1988 as amended by Act, No. 15 of 1997 and Act No. 09 of 2016. The Mediation Boards Commission (the Commission) consists of five members appointed by the President for a period of three years. Three of the members are required to be from among persons who have held judicial office in the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal (the highest courts in the land), one of whom is appointed as Chairman of the Commission.
The Commission is vested with the power of appointing mediators. It is also vested with powers of dismissal and disciplinary control of mediators and of supervising and controlling the performance and discharge of the functions and duties of mediators.
The Commission functions as an independent body and the mandatory inclusion therein of persons of the calibre of retired Judges of the Appellate Courts is an attempt to ensure its independence and inspire confidence in its impartiality.
