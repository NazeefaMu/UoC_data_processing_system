Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association:
AGM tomorrow

The Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association (SLTFOA) will hold its 28th Annual General Meeting tomorrow at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel.
The keynote address will be delivered by the Chief Guest, Finance and Mass Media State Minister Eran Wickremeratna. The Guest of Honour will be Tea Board Chairman Lucille Wijewardena.
SLTFOA, established in 1990, has a membership exceeding 300 in Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Matugama, Ratnapura, Balangoda, Kandy and Gampola. The districts come under the umbrella of Branch Chairmen. The Tea Factory Owners Association is headed by Harith Ranasinghe, who is a veteran tea planter and manufacturer.
The SLTFOA business matters are administered by a General Committee which meets monthly. The members of the committee are elected annually, district-wise at the Annual General Meeting.
The objective of the SLTFOA, a non-political, independent body, is to promote, foster and protect the tea industry.
The industry is catered mainly by the tea smallholder farmers responsible in producing about 75 percent of the national tea production - the largest volume of tea consumed by millions the world over as ‘Ceylon Tea’.
The members of the Association cater almost exclusively to the tea smallholder population in manufacturing their green leaf and providing services such as advisory and extension, the supply of input materials such as fertiliser, their welfare etc., including loans and cash advances on the supply of green leaf.
The Association serves today’s estimated extent of small holdings which is about 122,000 hectares, contributed by about 400,000 people directly or indirectly employed and has further plans to rake in all the private factories countrywide under its umbrella to improve and serve smallholders efficiently for sustenance.
The Association Chairman or his nominee is a member in Sri Lanka Tea Board, National Institute of Plantation Management, Tea Small Holdings Authority, Tea Research Board and Employers Federation of Ceylon.
The Association holds the status of an affiliated position in the Colombo Tea Traders Association.
