Singer ‘A’ division inter-schools league rugby 2nd round starts today
Joes firm favourites over underdogs Wesley

High riding St. Joseph’s College Maradana will go out firm favourites against unpredictable underdogs Wesley College in their Singer ‘A’ division inter-school league rugby tournament match to be played at Havelock Park today at 4.15pm.
The Josephians under the leadership of Sameesha Verangana have a good record this year having won four out of five matches in the first round and losing only to Royal.
The Josephian front has been tremendously bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards who have carried out wave after wave attacks on their opponents this season together with their whole ‘eight’ dominating the set pieces. They also have abundance of ball position through line outs, rucks and mauls spearheaded by crack number eight Tharindu de Alwis, third row forwards Dilshan Kelaniyagoda and John Ganegoda.
Along with their speedy three quarter line with the help of playmaker cum diminutive centre Gamunu Chethiya and winger K.D. Kavinda they are famous for their three quarter moves.
They also have a reliable place kicker in fly half Santhush Algama and his contribution in this match with his kicking boots will be vital for a Joes victory.
On the other hand Wesley after their loss to St. Peter’s Bambalapitiya (7-33) won their first match for the season beating D.S. Senanayake College Colombo (5-nil) and Zahira College (26-7) before losing narrowly to Isipathana College (17-22) in a very close game. They bounced back to defeat Dharmaraja College Kandy (23-15) last week.
Wesley are packed with some outstanding players in their ranks, such as their captain cum hardy number eight Dayan Sabar, Mursheed Doray, centre Sahan Hansaja, Dexter Goonethilake, Kavindana Perera and Theekshana Vithanage, all of whom are match winners. But they should get their act together if they are to pull off their fourth win for the season against the formidable Joes outfit. This year the Wesley team will be under head coach - veteran Samoan Paul Toiya.
If they play to their potential with play makers Murshid Doray together with their speedy centre Sahan Hansaja and their entire three quarter line they can create a shock victory today.
