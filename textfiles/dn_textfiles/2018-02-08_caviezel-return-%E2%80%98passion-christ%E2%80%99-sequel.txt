Caviezel to return to ‘Passion of the Christ’  sequel

Make way, the Jesus has risen. Reportedly, Jim Caviziel , who essayed the role of Jesus Christ in Mel Gibson’s highly-controversial movie ‘Passion of the Christ’, is poised to return to reprise his role as Jesus Christ in the much-awaited sequel of the movie.
It has been confirmed that the actor is in negotiations with Gibson, who is likely set to produce and direct again. The actor, 49, first played thirty-something-year-old Jesus 14 years ago.
The first part cost USD 30 million to make, was shot in Italy and the dialogue was in Aramaic, Herbew and Latin. The R-rated movie also courted controversy with its graphic violence and anti-semitic undertones. It was first reported 20 months ago that a sequel was in the works, but it wasn’t known until yesterday whether Gibson was interested in again casting Caviezel as Jesus.
Screen-writer Randall Wallace, who wrote Gibson’s Oscar-winning ‘Braveheart’, had been working on a screenplay for ‘The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection’. Gibson’s original ‘Passion of the Christ’ was released in 2004 and earned an impressive USD 612 million worldwide on just a USD 30 million production budget. ANI
