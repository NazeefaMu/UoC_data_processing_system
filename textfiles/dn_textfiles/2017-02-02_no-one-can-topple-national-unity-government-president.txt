No one can topple national unity government: President

Utterances that the good governance government will be toppled are only dreams. No one can topple this national unity government, President Maithripala Sirisena said while speaking at a gathering in Kaluwanchikudy yesterday.
The President said those who misused public funds during their ruling are dreaming to topple this good-governance government, but it is only a dream, which will never come true.
“I dare say that this strong government, the outcome of the political uprising in 2015 of patriotic people, especially of people against corruption and frauds, cannot be toppled. No one will be allowed to topple this national unity government formed amidst challenges and obstacles,” the President said.
The President made these remarks after commissioning a newly constructed OPD and ward complexes at the Kaluwanchikudy Base Hospital. The hospital was constructed at a cost of Rs. 523 million with the financial assistance of JICA.
“Certain politicians who no longer have the people’s support are boasting that the government will be toppled. But I must say this is only a pipe dream,” the President said.
The President said the government is engaged in forming a new Constitution aiming to strengthen ethnic harmony.
“As mentioned by the Opposition Leader, every countryman wishes to see a unity country. Accordingly, ethnic harmony will be strengthened while devolving power through the new Constitution. However, certain persons once again claims that the government is going to divide and betray the country through implementing a new Constitution,” he said.
The President said preliminary steps of drafting the new Constitution will be completed by the next few months. He said same allegation in this nature of dividing the country was raised when establishing Provincial councils of then government. But country has not been divided through Provincial Councils.
“Those days it was
said that visa would be needed for travellng from one
Provincial Council to another,” he added.
He said the government’s aim is to create a peaceful, strong country where anyone can live happily and peacefully. Therefore, the government will never allow to destroy ethnic harmony of the country.
