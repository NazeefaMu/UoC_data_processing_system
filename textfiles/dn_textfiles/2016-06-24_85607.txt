Ranjan’s fire held back

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe assured Parliament yesterday that he instructed Social Empowerment and Social Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake to stop the shooting practice that
he had intended to commence at the Madiwela Parliamentarians’ official quarters premises. The Prime Minister said that Ranjan Ramanayake was informed that facilities could be made for him to do his practice for film rehearsals in the Ratmalana shooting ground.
The Prime Minister was responding to a privilege issue raised by Opposition member Padma Udaya Shantha Gunasekara .The MP said that Ranjan Ramanayake had carried out shooting practices in the Madiwela Parliamentarians’ Official Quarters’ premises. He added that it was totally wrong. The Prime Minister added that children and wives of members were living there and his practice
was a disturbance to them. He added that the Police also have informed them about this matter . Replying to Opposition Member Chandrasiri Gajadeera the Premier said that he had not given permission to Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake to conduct shooting practise there and he also did not have powers to do so. He added that although he did not give permission, he asked him to stop it.
He also said that this matter was not related to the House and was not a privilege issue. He added Opposition members Dinesh Gunawardena and Bandula Gunawardena too kept him informed of this matter.
He also said that Ranjan was instructed that he could use a shooting ground for his practice. “If needed, Opposition member Mahindananda Aluthgamage too could use the same ground for his practice” the Prime Minister said.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake too said during his special statement under Standing Order 23(2) that Ranjan Ramanayake had done an insane thing and urged him to put a halt to it.
