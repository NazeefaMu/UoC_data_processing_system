12 Angry Men and 12 Angry Women

Following the success of Peter Pan last December, Cold Theatre 7 has something brewing for theatre enthusiasts and literature lovers this November. Reginald Rose’ 12 Angry Men, has been adapted to the silver screen as well as a television series and will go on boards at the Lionel Wendt from November 16 - 19.
Cold Theatre 7 is a theatre company established in 2013. While being a relatively new theatre troupe, it has produced Agatha Christie’s ‘And Then There Were None’ (2013), ‘The Mousetrap’ (2015) and a full length musical of an adaptation of J.M Barrie’s ‘Peter Pan’ (2016). CT7 also works towards promoting drama very specially in schools through the Inter – House and Inter School Drama Cup where they facilitate not only budding actors but also directors and production teams as well.
CT7 has a reputation for twisting productions in a bid to stir the enthusiasm of the audience such as the three performances of ‘And Then There Were None’, in 2013, which featured a different ending on each night. Just as well, 12 Angry Men, will be produced in two variations.
The play will also be portrayed by women, bringing 12 Angry Women on the boards as well. Both productions will be different from the other, not only in gender but also in terms of period, and the exploration of the text.
