Timber Corporation to launch  tree planting campaign

The State Timber Corporation will launch a project to plant two trees in place of one tree felling for timber, said Timber Corporation Chairman Shantha Bandara, yesterday.
He said he was formulating the project proposal and would discuss the matter with President Maithripala Sirisena, the Central Environment Authority and Forest Conservation Department to make the proposal a reality.
He added that the State Timber Corporation objects to the import of sleepers for railways. He said the Railway Department had bought sleepers it required for the construction and repair of railways from the State Timber Corporation. “A decision had been reached to import the sleepers,” Chairman Shantha Bandara said.
“The State Timber Corporation has the capacity to provide as much sleepers to the Railway Department it needs.”
He made these observations yesterday taking part in the first public ceremony to grant licences to small-scale carpenters to buy timber at concessionary rates, after assuming duties as the new Chairman of the Timber Corporation.
The ceremony was held at the State Timber Corporation auditorium in Battaramulla. Twenty five selected small-scale carpenters in Moratuwa were granted licences to buy timber at a rate of 20 percent less from the stores of the State Timber Corporation island-wide. The concession incurs a loss of Rs. 34 million to the Timber Corporation annually.
Timber Corporation Chairman Shantha Bandara said the concession granted to small-scale carpenters incurs a massive loss to the Timber Corporation but it is granted to uplift the economy of small-scale carpenters in the country. He added that the responsibility of carpenters is to produce quality furniture to prevent the import of furniture.
Chairman Shantha Bandara said the Corporation was ready to provide training to carpenters to enhance the quality of products. He added that the attitude of youths on carpentry should changed as it is a respectable employment that is lucrative.
