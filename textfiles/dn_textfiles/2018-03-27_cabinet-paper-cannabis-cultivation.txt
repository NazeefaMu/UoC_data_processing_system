Cabinet paper for cannabis cultivation

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had presented a Cabinet paper with regard to cultivating cannabis, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, it is proposed to cultivate cannabis in order to produce Ayurvedic medicines and expected to obtain the support of the members of the armed forces in this regard.
Minister Senaratne had pointed out that a number of countries cultivate cannabis and the crop can be used to earn foreign exchange. Cannabis cultivation can also be used to assist farmers who stop cultivating tobacco from 2020, he said.
Minister Senaratne said lands are required for Ayurvedic herb cultivation in the North and North Central Provinces. Crops would be purchased by the Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Corporation, he added.
This was discussed at the Health Ministry, the spokesman added.
