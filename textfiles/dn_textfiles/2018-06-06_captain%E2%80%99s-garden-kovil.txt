Captain’s Garden Kovil

It’s an iconic sight: the large gopuram of the Sri Kailawasanathan Swami Devasthanam Kovil towering above the train tracks in Maradana, greeting passengers as they travel to and from Colombo.
The temple, in its modern form, celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.
But the place of worship is actually much older. And few know the history of the city’s oldest and largest temple to Shiva.
“This temple was established by our community, the Chetti community, businessmen who came to Sri Lanka from India,” said S. Mahendran Chettiyar, one of the kovil’s trustees, in a recent interview.
According to an old deed, a shrine to Shiva has existed at the current site since 1783, Mahendran said. “But it could have started even before then, we can’t say,” he added.
Regardless, for more than two centuries, the kovil has been a place of worship for not just the Chetti community, but for Hindus from around Colombo and the region. Buddhists who want to make offerings to Lord Shiva or other gods at the temple’s surrounding smaller shrines, come here too.
Every year, the Defence Forces come to the kovil for poojas, the temple’s trustees said, and it is a common place for presidents and prime ministers to seek blessings. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe even came on a recent Friday evening, Mahendran said.
The story of just how a humble shrine grew into prominence is an interesting one.
Island temple
The Sri Kailawasanathan Kovil goes by many names, but they are all connected. Its official name refers to Mount Kailash, the mountain home of Lord Shiva in Hindu cosmology.
Colloquially, it’s called the Theevu Kovil in Tamil, meaning the ‘island’ temple. It’s also known by an English name, the Captain’s Garden Kovil.
In the past, the little rise of land the temple sits on used to be an island. Before Colombo’s wetlands were carved into canals and lakes, the area that now holds two corridors of train tracks was under water.
The small island was a place for sea captains to take rest, and N. Dharmaseelan Chettiyar, another temple trustee, said the Chetti community had set up some small shops there along with a shrine.
When the water was eventually diverted, and the British colonizers built train tracks in its place, the Shiva Temple remained.
Today, the temple grounds still feel like an island, sheltered from the traffic and noise of the city. Birds chirp in the surrounding trees, and devotional music wafts from the temple’s interior.
Apart from the occasional passing train, the kovil feels a world away from Colombo.
“This is a very isolated place. That’s why people love to come,” said Mahendran. “They can pray peacefully.”
The gopuram
Not much detail is known about the temple’s early days. The next major development in its history was in 1935, Dharmaseelan said, when the temple trustees decided to build a gopuram.
“During that period my grandfather was on the board,” he said.
But for lack of funds or manpower, it was never fully constructed. By 1988, it was only partially built. A new board of trustees convened, including Mahendran and Dharmaseelan, to finish the job.
But still it was not an easy task.
“We couldn’t finish it…we had a lot of problems,” said Mahendran.
Because of the ongoing civil war, it was hard to secure visas for the dozen-or-so sculptors who needed to come from India to make the intricate statues that decorate the temple’s gopuram.
When they did come, one of them died. “We had a lot of problems,” Mahendran repeated.
They finally completed the gopuram in 1994. Its layers of delicately crafted, primary-coloured statues are now a Colombo landmark.
Last year, they renovated the smaller temple to Ganesh alongside the main one. Its gopuram stands today in bright gold, red, green, and blue, just below its larger neighbour.
The expanded temple complex now draws hundreds of devotees a week. Tourists often wander in for pictures.
The temple is undoubtedly a hefty centre of Colombo’s spiritual life.
The future
The days of the small shrine on an island are gone.
But as for the descendants of its founders, “We still administrate the temple,” Dharmaseelan said.
The five trustees of the Sri Kailawasanathan Swami Devasthanam Kovil meet every Saturday evening to plan events like the annual Mahotsavam festival and renovations to the temple’s interior and exterior.
Renovations must be made every 12 years, they said, to combat water damage, dirt, and fading paint. A 12-year timetable is also auspicious, because it aligns with the Hindu cosmic cycle.
But the current trustees cannot do the job forever. Dharmaseelan is now apprenticing his 30-year-old son Sudan in the ways of temple administration.
He said passing the responsibility through family is the best way to assure future leaders are devoted to the preservation of the temple. “Because we know our children,” he said.
Sudan grew up going to the kovil, learning the stories and ways to worship Lord Shiva and the gods.
His father Dharmaseelan and other mentor, Mahendran, told the story of Shiva and the hunter, which is beautifully depicted on the temple’s ceiling, as one of the greatest teachings of the religion.
As the story goes, there once was a forest shrine tended to by a devout Brahmin, who was a vegetarian and worshiped Shiva in all the correct ways. In the same forest, there was a hunter, who every day would offer part of his kill to the Shiva lingam at the shrine.
One day, to test the hunter’s devotion, Lord Shiva made one of his eyes on the lingam bleed. The hunter took out his own eye with an arrow and placed it over the lingam’s, and the bleeding stopped.
Then, the other eye started bleeding. The hunter, knowing he would be blind after taking out his second eye, placed his big toe on the spot to mark its place, and began removing his second eye. Shiva then restored the hunter’s vision in honour of his sacrifice.
The Brahmin, watching from afar, saw that it was true devotion that really mattered, not just the actions and orthodoxy of rituals.
“This is the best story of Shiva,” said Mahendran. “Because it shows sacrifice, and love. Whatever I eat, I give to you.”
The trustees hope the next generation will take care of the temple so that it can live on into the next centuries.
Asked if he will be a trustee his whole life, Sudan, Dharmaseelan’s son replied: “We don’t know.”
“But that’s the idea,” he added.
