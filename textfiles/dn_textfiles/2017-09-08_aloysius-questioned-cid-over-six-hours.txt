Aloysius questioned by CID for over six hours

Arjun Aloysius appeared before the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday to give a statement to the CID. He was questioned by the CID for over six hours.
Meanwhile, President’s Counsel Nihal Fernando withdrew from representing Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) at the Treasury Bond Commission with effect from yesterday.
However, Fernando PC will assist the Commission until Kasun Palisena’s testimony is completed.
Fernando PC giving reasons for his withdrawal, said his client refrained from providing all the telephone call recordings and call information to the commission despite being instructed to do so.
Fernando PC said that he was not aware of the said information was in possession of the PTL. He said on September 4, 2017 it was revealed otherwise.
Fernando PC has spoken with the PTL company lawyer and had arrived at the decision to assist the commission until Palisena completes his testimony. Legal representative of former Governor Arjun Mahendran cross examined the witness next.
Counsel Chanaka de Silva pointed out that Aloysius must have received certain decisions taken at the State Bank Primary Dealers meeting which former Governor Mahendran has nothing to do with. It was previously revealed that Arjun Aloysius has received bidding information of some state institutes including EPF and NSB Fund management.
The tables turned when De Silva questioned witness Nuwan Salgado on the allegation that Mahendran asked for a statement given by Kasun Palisena to the COPE Sub Committee inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue.
The allegation was made based on a telephone call recording played before the commission yesterday (06). The said call recording was among the deleted calls by the PTL.
Referring to the date of the call recording which was August 12, 2016, de Silva pointed out that Mahendran was not the Central Bank Governor anymore at the time.
He also pointed out that the said COPE Sub Committee was not the first but the second one headed by MP Sunil Handunnetti, inquiring into the Tresury Bond Commission.
De Silva also pointed out that the said date however coincides with the date when present Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy testified before the COPE Sub Committee inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue.
So, when Palisena mentioned about “a Governor” to Salgado who was he referring to?, De Silva questioned.
