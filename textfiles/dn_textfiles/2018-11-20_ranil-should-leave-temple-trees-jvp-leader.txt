Ranil should leave Temple Trees - JVP Leader

Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated yesterday that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesighe should leave Temple Trees as he is no longer the Prime Minister of the country and just a Member of Parliament.
Addressing a media briefing held in the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, Dissanayake further said within the first two weeks of January, the country will have to repay a huge amount of loans repayments at once, failing which the country would have to face a serious economic crisis.
“If we fail to pay this loan, all other countries giving us loans would blacklist the country, ”he added.
