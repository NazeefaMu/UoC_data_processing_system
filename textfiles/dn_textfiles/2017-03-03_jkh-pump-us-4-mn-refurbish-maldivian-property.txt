JKH to pump US$ 4 mn to refurbish Maldivian property

John Keells Holdings (JKH) Leisure arm will invest around US$ 4 million to refurbish their water bungalows wing of the Maldivian property, Dhonveli. This will commence from October and the 30 bungalow wing will be closed during the time.
Leisure Sector President, Kishan Balendra said in addition they will also invest to build another hotel in the adjoining island. The island was with the group for several years.
“We have not decided on the theme or the size of this proposed hotel but it will be something in the excess of 50 rooms,” he said. Located no more than a 25-minute speedboat ride from Male, Dhonveli’s proximity and diversity combine to make it one of the most popular destinations in the Maldives.
Commenting on the Maldivian leisure sector he said that the unhealthy political situation in the country is having a negative impact for the industry.
“This is definitely affecting our bottomline.” He also said that some European countries have even stamped negative travel advisories against Maldives and this too will have adverse effect on arrivals. “Usually the Maldivian hotel sector from time to time in recent years undergoes this kind of downturn but it is for a short term. This time around it is longer and seems set to continue for more time.”
Asked to comment on their flagship property Cinnamon Life in Colombo 2, he said it’s moving ahead and even structures are being built.
“However it will take a longer time than we anticipated for it to be completed.”
Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts, a Sri Lankan chain, is looking to enter India with plans to set up two hotels there by 2020.
