Dusit Int’l to open in Bangkok

Thai hospitality group signs to manage the first hotel in Thailand’s largest outdoor shopping destination
Dusit International, one of Thailand’s foremost hotel and property development companies, has signed a hotel management agreement with Dhanasansombut Development Co., Ltd. to operate the first-ever hotel in the heart of Bangkok’s world-famous Chatuchak Market.
Forming part of Dhanasansombut Development Co., Ltd’s new mixed-use development, Mixt Chatuchak, the new hotel will comprise approximately 250 rooms and is strategically located a short walk from both the MRT (Mo Chit Station) and BTS (Chatuchak Station) mass transit rail systems, which provide easy access to all of Bangkok’s main attractions. Don Mueang International Airport, which serves key domestic and regional destinations, is only 30 minutes’ drive away.
Chatuchak Market, also known locally as Jatujak or JJ, is located in the north of the city next to Chatuchak Park, one of Bangkok’s largest green spaces and near Or Tor Kor, recently named one of the world’s best fresh markets by CNN.
Comprising over 8,000 stalls selling everything from clothes and furniture, to art, ceramics, plants, souvenirs, drinks, food and even pets, JJ is one of Bangkok’s top tourist destinations, attracting more than 400,000 shoppers every weekend. It is estimated that six out of every 10 tourists in Bangkok will visit the market during their vacation. Bang Sue Grand Station, which will replace the Bangkok Railway Station at Hua Lamphong as the terminus for all long-distance rail services from Bangkok, is also currently under construction next to JJ Market and is scheduled to open in 2019. The new station will be surrounded by several new commercial, business and residential projects.
“JJ Market is a true Bangkok icon and we are delighted to have this opportunity to become part of its vibrant fabric,” said Suphajee Suthumpun, Group Chief Executive Officer of Dusit International. “With several exciting developments set to open near the market within the next few years, the area will only become even more appealing and our new hotel will be perfectly positioned to meet the needs of the young, sophisticated travellers who visit the area seeking a distinctive localized experience.”
