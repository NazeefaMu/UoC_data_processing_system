World’s biggest bunny retiring from lavish lifestyle

The world’s biggest bunny rabbit and his glamour model owner are retiring together after their record winning eight year streak.
Annette Edwards, 66, who is currently the oldest UK glamour model, and her famous bunny, Darius, who is the world’s largest rabbit standing at 4ft 4inches tall, have finally decided to give up their lavish lifestyle for the simple life.
After her rabbit, Simon, died in mysterious circumstances during an aircraft flight last year, Annette was too frightened to travel with Darius and his other seven children, abroad.
And with it being Easter Bank Holiday Annette decided that the weekend would be the perfect opportunity to share the news that the pair are retiring together.
The news comes in hopes that Darius, who is now eight years old, will enjoy a less stressful life at home – though this will not hinder their Guinness World Record Titles, but Darius will no longer be available for interviews and Annette will no longer be stripping off for the camera.
The pair are hoping for an easier way of life – and plan on spending the next few weeks doing nothing but relaxing.
Annette, from Stoulton, Worcester, said: “We’re still welcoming tourists to visit us both but we will not be doing anymore long journeys or TV appearances. Darius has had an amazing career and loves people but now he’s getting older he likes to relax. I’ve done glamour modelling for over 40 years and finally feel ready to lead a quiet life, especially after tragically losing Simon last year. Darius has two children called Jeff and Grace that are likely to overtake his size and snatch his Guinness World Record in the next few years. I’m sure they will love the limelight as much as their dad did.”
