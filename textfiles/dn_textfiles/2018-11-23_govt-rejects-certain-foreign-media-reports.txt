CID Inspector Nishantha Silva’s transfer
Govt. rejects certain foreign media reports

Media Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera yesterday said the Government completely rejects certain foreign media reports that President Maithripala Sirisena had ordered the transfer of the Officer-In-Charge of the Organized Crimes Investigation Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Inspector Nishantha Silva. The Minister said the transfer had been done by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the President was not involved in any manner.
He also said that the National Police Commission had annulled the transfer later.
Earlier, Inspector Silva had been transferred for normal Police duties in the Negombo Police Division.
It was reported in the media that subsequently, Nishantha Silva had made an appeal to the NPC regarding his transfer.
Meanwhile, replying to a journalist’s question about the progress of the investigation into the alleged plot to assassinate the President, Minister Jayasekera said new information has surfaced and it would be revealed shortly.
