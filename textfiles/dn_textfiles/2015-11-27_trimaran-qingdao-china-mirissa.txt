The Trimaran "Qingdao China" in Mirissa

As part of the project "Guo Chuan Racing" to sail across the "21st Century Maritime Silk Road", the 29.7 m trimaran Qingdao China called over to the fishing harbour of Mirissa on November 16, 17 and 18 and was welcomed by officials of Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation, Board of Investment and Sri Lanka Coast Guard.
Sri Lanka and Qingdao in China share a common dream, the development of sailing and environmentally friendly recreational activities. The Building A Future Foundation (www.baflk.org) and its spinoff company Sail Lanka Charter (www.sail-lanka-charter.com) have been playing a pioneering role in the development of yachting - and water based tourism in Sri Lanka, together with the tremendous support from CFHC, EDB and BOI. The arrival of such an exceptional racing catamaran is only the beginning of more yachts that will include Sri Lanka on their route. To achieve this BAFF has built the first mini-marina's in Sri Lanka and has been trying hard to link up with other yachting hubs in the world.

"Potential of Sri Lanka as a yachting destination is huge! In China it took us 10 years to develop this industry. We have now marinas and sailing vessels all around our coast, but 10 years ago we were where you are now", Skipper Guo Chang commented.
"We have never been in such a harbour. Having our last generation trimaran in Mirissa fishing harbour is a proof that something is happening here", Quentin, crew of the trimaran added.

The organisers of the event "Guo Chuan Racing" (www.guochuansailing.com), associated to the movement "Peace and Sport" from Monaco, have chosen to moor in Mirissa, to mark the common visions to develop sustainable water based activities, creating local and environmentally friendly job opportunities.
In response to the warm welcome received in Sri Lanka, Liu Yu, Director of the Qingdao Administration Centre of Sailing Sport has decided invited 6 kids and 2 adults to participate in the next Qingdao sailing games in August 2016. They will bear all local expenses (accommodation, food, transfers, boats, equipment), while BAFF will try to find a sponsor for the flight tickets.
The trimaran Qingdao China, now belonging to the Chinese skipper Guo Chuan, has in the past posted several race records under command of the French sailor Francis Joyon.

The boat will further proceed along the silk route with stops in Mumbai, Alexandria and Monaco where it will participate in major sailing events, to showcase that Asian countries like China and Sri Lanka are ready and keen to develop this kind of activities. In this frame Sail Lanka Charter will join the effort by representing Sri Lanka as a yachting destination at the number 1 international boat show "Nautic" in Paris from December 5 till 13, 2015. The Building a Future Foundation founded in March 2006 in order to train youth into innovative activities and new skills which have an economic development potential, aims to promote and establish a boating and sailing culture in Sri Lanka, which in the long run will create a leisure boating market, with thousands of sustainable employment opportunities for the youth, in boat building as well as in chartering operations.

We believe that Sri Lanka has the potential to become the global yachting destination in South Asia. Thailand, which began incentivizing yachting just 10 years ago, now, has a thriving industry that employs over 30,000 people directly and indirectly supporting thousands of livelihoods. Sri Lanka is even better positioned than Thailand with excellent sailing conditions year round and the ability to leverage Sri Lanka's unique tourism potential to offer a diverse range of packages.
