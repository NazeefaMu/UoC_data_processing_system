Café Mocha “wrapped up”!

With a coffee culture that has evolved into a lifestyle in the city of Colombo, Barista through its signature outlet Café Mocha is extending its menu to include comfort food to go with your preferred Lavazza coffee.
Café Mocha is home to an extensive menu that offers a wide range of delicacies and the latest additions come all “wrapped up” in wholesome goodness.
Topping the new range of wraps is a combination of Chicken and Apple Slaw packed in to a paper thin wrap. The Grilled Chicken Wrap is the spicier version of the two with large chunks of grilled chicken and the works.
For those who prefer baguettes to wraps, Café Mocha is also introducing several new baguette sandwiches to their famous sandwich range. The Chicken Salami Baguette is a must-try for those folks who love indulging in a protein filled meal. If your preference is seafood then the Caribbean Style Tuna Baguette or the Tropical Prawn Baguette will definitely satisfy your taste buds. Café Mocha does not leave out the ever-growing vegetarian population either with a Fried Tofu Baguette. These new wraps and sandwiches are not only delicious and satisfying but will also be easy on the wallet.
