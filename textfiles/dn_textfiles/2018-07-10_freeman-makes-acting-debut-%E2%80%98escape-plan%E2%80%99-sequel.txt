Freeman makes acting debut  in ‘Escape Plan’ sequel

If you want to catch Falcons RB Devonta Freeman in action, but in a rather unorthodox way, you might throw your attention to the new ‘Escape Plan’ film.
Freeman will have a small role in the film as an inmate in whatever new dangerous prison Sylvester Stallone and now Dave Bautista will be trying to break out of. The film apparently shot in Atlanta, which might be how Free got involved.
It’s said his character landed in jail for missing a key block in a Super Bowl. Movie Buzz
‘Escape Plan 2: Hades’ is 
screening at 
MC – Colombo, Empire Arcade 
and other 
films halls islandwide
