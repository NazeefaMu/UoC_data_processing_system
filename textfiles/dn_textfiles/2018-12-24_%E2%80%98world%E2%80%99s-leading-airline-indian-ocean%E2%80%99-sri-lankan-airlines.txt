‘World’s Leading Airline to the Indian Ocean’ - Sri Lankan Airlines

Sri Lankan Airlines, the National Carrier of Sri Lanka and a member of the oneworld alliance, won the prestigious ‘World’s Leading Airline to the Indian Ocean’ title once again at the Grand Final Gala Ceremony of World Travel Awards, in Lisbon, Portugal recently.
In September this year, the Airline was awarded ‘Asia’s Leading Airline to the Indian Ocean’ and ‘Asia’s Leading Marketing Campaign’ titles at the WTA Asia Australasia ceremony and this award further reinforces the Airlines’ stature as a leading carrier in the Indian Subcontinent.
The award proves SriLankan’s presence in the South Asian region, strongly supported by its connectivity of 119 flights a week to 13 Indian cities (including seasonal operations to Bodh Gaya and Varanasi). The Airline also operates to other popular cities such as Dhaka, Karachi and Lahore.
The other contenders to the title were Air Austral, Air France, Air India, Air Seychelles, AirAsia, British Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines.
The other award winners were, oneworld alliance, Changi International Airport, Hilton London Heathrow Airport, England, Lisbon, Portugal, Royal Caribbean International and Armani Hotel Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
