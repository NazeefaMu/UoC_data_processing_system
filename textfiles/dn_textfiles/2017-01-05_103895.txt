Appointment with President could be facilitated: Minister

An appointment to meet President Maithripala Sirisena could be facilitated for those protesting against the public-private partnership of the Hambantota port and the proposed Special Economic
Zone to get their doubts cleared, UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He made this observation addressing a press conference at his Ministry premises yesterday.
The minister said those who spread falsehoods about this venture were trying to arouse the public and Buddhist monks by getting them on to the streets to create a clash with the Police and Security Forces.
“I believe the Buddhist monks would understand this reality and refrain from making any directive against the Government. These are politically motivated agitations” he said.
