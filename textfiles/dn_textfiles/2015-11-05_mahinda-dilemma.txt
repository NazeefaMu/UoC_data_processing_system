Mahinda in a dilemma?

Kurunegala district MP and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said some SLFP ministers in the government are requesting him to leave the SLFP while the people and the party supporters are asking him to remain in the party. "As a patron of the SLFP I am now in a dilemma," he said.
Rajapaksa said this participating in a public dialogue held at the residence of former Ambalantota Pradeshiya Sabha Vice Chairman P L Piyasena at Ridiyagama on November 4. The former President who declined to make a speech at the gathering asked the people to express their views saying he wished to sound public opinion.
The people present said they would not work for the SLFP to ensure its victory at the local elections and asked the former President the stand they should take at the forthcoming elections.
Rajapaksa in reply said President Maithripala Sirisena had promised to ensure a SLFP victory at the local elections.
The people said they did not agree with this view. Rajapaksa said when he lost the Presidential election, his ambition was to retire from politics and attend social functions of people. But, he was compelled to contest the general election at the behest of party activists.
He said the SLFP should contest elections together with its coalition parties. If not the SLFP was bound to face defeat if it went it alone history had proved it. Rajapaksa said "Today, I have become the common enemy of the UNP and the SLFP.
