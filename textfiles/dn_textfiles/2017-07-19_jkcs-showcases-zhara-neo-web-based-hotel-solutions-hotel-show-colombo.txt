JKCS showcases Zhara Neo web-based hotel solutions at Hotel Show Colombo

At the recently concluded Hotel Show Colombo 2017, which took place from June 30 to July 2, at the BMICH. John Keells Computer Services (JKCS) showcased Zhara Neo the company’s latest web-based hotel solution for small hotels, holiday villas and guesthouses. Zhara Neo was very well received with many hotel owners signing up for the solution.
Zhara Neo is a ‘single-screen’ system that any property owner or manager can use to manage bookings, check on room availability, roll-out promotions and manage day-to-day activities. Zhara Neo is fully web-based: so it is as easy as using a Gmail account. It is a subscription based as well which means hoteliers can sign-up for and access any time. The Sri Lankan hotel industry, overall, is on an upward trajectory complimenting the post-war tourism boom. New guesthouses, lodges and hotels are sprouting all around the country, preparing to capitalize on the massive tourism potential of the island. Those who cater to the needs of the travelers to the country have to rapidly keep improving their standards to be up the pace with the rest, creating the need for even better support products and services, hence gearing the whole industry towards excellence.
JKCS’s solutions in the hospitality space include the highly acclaimed Zhara HS line of hotel software systems. Zhara HS contributes to the industry’s excellence by assisting the hospitality industry to reach new innovative heights with their technology solutions.
Zhara HS is for medium to large-scale hotels and has helped Sri Lankan hotels take the technological leap towards cloud-computing systems, which bring with it increased operational efficiency and convenience.
Zhara NEO is the streamlined version for smaller hotels with fewer than 20 rooms.
With vast growth in the Sri Lanka hospitality industry expected in the coming years, JKCS and Zhara are ever-focused in assisting the hospitality industry in Sri Lanka to reach greater pinnacles.
