Sil Redhi distribution case: Court directs AG to consider amending indictments

The Colombo High Court hearing the controversial Sil Redhi distribution (fabrics used by devotees to observe sill) case yesterday, directed the Attorney General to consider the possibility of amending the indictments filed against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita, in connection with criminal misappropriation of Rs.600 million belonging to the TRC funds during the 2015-Presidential Election campaign. While making his dock statements, former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga informed Court that it is unfair to frame charges against him under Public Property Act since he had not benefited from the Sil Redhi distribution programme.
Lalith Weeratunga further told Court that he had to follow the orders issued by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the executive of the country.
Taking into consideration the facts, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga directed the Attorney General to consider the possibility of amending the indictments.
Further trial was fixed for March 6. The Attorney General had filed indictments against the two accused on three counts of committing a criminal misappropriation of funds amounting to Rs.600 million at TRC while spending for a ‘Sil Redhi’ distribution program in contravention of theTelecommunication Act, No. 25 of 1991 Act during the period of October 30, 2014 to January 5, 2015.
The prosecutors alleged that the funds referred to had been remitted to a bank account maintained by Secretary to the President.
The charges had been filed under the Public Property Act while listing 21 persons as the prosecution witnesses. Former Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya, former President’s coordinating Secretary (Religious Affairs) Ven. Vatinapaha Somananda Thera are among the persons who had been named as the witnesses.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the prosecution.
President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with counsel Kanchana Rathwatte and Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.
