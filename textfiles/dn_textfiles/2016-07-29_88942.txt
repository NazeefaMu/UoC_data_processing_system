Mendis batted out  of his skin - Lyon

 
Off-spinner Nathan Lyon who became the 16th Australian bowler to take 200 Test wickets during the third day of the first Test against Sri Lanka at Pallekele Stadium yesterday was full of praise for young Kusal Mendis who scored his maiden Test century.
“The wicket has improved and it has got a bit easier to bat but you’ve got to give where credit is due, the young fellow to get 169 has batted out of his skin and he’s played extremely well,” said Lyon at the end of the day.
“What stood out in his batting is his composure. He is only 21 and the way he went about it he got a simple game plan and he stuck to it throughout the day. Hats off to him he batted extremely well.”
Lyon who made his Test debut in Sri Lanka and took his first Test wicket (Kumar Sangakkara) at Galle in 2005 said his milestone of taking 200th Test wickets has not really sunk in.
“I am very proud of it, but it probably hasn’t sunk in yet because we are in the middle of a pretty hard Test match,” said Lyon. “I will look back at the achievement probably at the end of this Test and the series. It’s been a pretty good ride so far hope there are a few more to come.”
Dhananjaya de Silva became Lyon’s 200th victim when he was caught by Usman Khawaja for 36.
Lyon said that losing the services of left-arm spinner Steve O’Keefe in the 49th over was a ‘big loss’ and added: “It’s a big loss to lose someone like Sockers, a quality bowler on a wicket like that.
To see him go off the field early and for Australia to lose an important member of their bowling attack is a pretty big loss for us. He is very talented in these conditions. Injuries happen in cricket and we as a bowling unit have got to bounce back and pull together for him and hopefully get the right result for us.”
The way the Test match is poised Lyon said, “We haven’t written off Sri Lanka. For those guys to come and play in their back yard, know the conditions really well, we knew it was going to be a hard Test in the series. “You can’t give the team a sniff but credit to Mendis who scored 169 not out and batted extremely well. He has steered them into a strong position but we are confident enough to come back and take early wickets and then get batting.
“We missed our half chances and it’s been a tough day for the Australian bowlers but the good thing about Test match cricket is you can bounce back tomorrow and look forward to take the new ball and hopefully take some early wickets.
“Look to chase down whatever they set us. They’ve been pretty good today, simple batting plan and there are no demons out there and they scored runs. One big positive that’s been proved is that we can score runs,” he said.
