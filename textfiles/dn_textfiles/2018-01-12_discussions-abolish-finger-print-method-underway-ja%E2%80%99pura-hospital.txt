Discussions to abolish finger print method underway at Ja’pura Hospital

 
A discussion is underway between trade unions who are protesting against marking attendance by the finger print method and the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital governing board.
A token strike was launched by the nurses at the National Hospital and the Eye Hospital in support of the protest until 7 a.m. today.
However, Chairman of the Government Services United Nurses Union Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said that drastic measures would be taken by the unions after discussions, if a satisfactory solution is not provided by the governing body.
