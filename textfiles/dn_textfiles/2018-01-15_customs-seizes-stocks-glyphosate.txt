Customs seizes stocks of glyphosate

Customs recently seized a consignment of banned agrochemical glyphosate, illegally imported to the country.
The stocks of glyphosate were smuggled into the country under the guise of imported rice. The stock is worth more than Rs. 4 million, Customs said.
Customs officials had found the illegal stock during an inspection of a container. The glyphosate powder was packed similar to rice packings and hidden among bags of rice.
The stock was imported by a businessman engaged in importing food items.
Glyphosate was declared as a prohibited agrochemical by the government in 2015.
