No restrictions for ministers at Cabinet meetings: Samarasinghe

Every minister enjoys freedom of expression at Cabinet meetings, unlike during the previous regime, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said. He said that no Cabinet Minister could express their views at that Cabinet meeting of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
“When former President Rajapaksa was at the Cabinet meeting, no one except former Minister Basil Rajapaksa could dare to speak,” he said. Unlike at that period, any minister can express his or her own views at Cabinet meetings as there are no restrictions, he added.
