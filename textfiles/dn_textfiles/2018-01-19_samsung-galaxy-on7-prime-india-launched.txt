Samsung Galaxy On7  Prime India launched

 Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime India was launched at an event in New Delhi.
The budget smartphone was first listed on Amazon India last week, and was alongside also spotted on the Samsung UAE site.
The smartphone bears budget specifications, all of which were listed on the above-mentioned e-commerce sites.
As we have seen, the dual-SIM Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime features a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) display and is powered by a 1.6GHz octa-core Exynos 7870 SoC coupled with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. It sports 13-megapixel rear and front camera sensors with an f/1.9 aperture lens and an LED flash. The smartphone will be offered in 32GB and 64GB onboard storage variants, expandable via microSD card (up to 256GB).
The Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime comes with a hardware Home button, below the display panel, alongside featuring capacitive buttons. It has connectivity options such as 4G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.1, ANT+, Micro-USB 2.0, and a 3.5mm audio jack.
The UAE listed lets us expect two colour options to be launched in India, Black and Gold.
To be noted is that there were some differences between the Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime listing on Amazon India and the Samsung UAE site. The UAE variant featured an 8-megapixel selfie camera, while the Amazon India variant bore a 13-megapixel front-facing camera sensor. (Gadgets)
