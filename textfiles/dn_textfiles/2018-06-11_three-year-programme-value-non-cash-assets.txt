Three year programme to value non-cash assets

The General Treasury has launched a three year programme to ascertain the value of all non cash assets of the Central Government which had not been accounted so far.
“This is in keeping with a programme unveiled by Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera in the 2018 Budget to ensure accountability and transparency of the Government’s financial information,” Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga said.
He said according to conservative estimates, the total value of all Central Government’s non cash assets was Rs. 814 billion.
