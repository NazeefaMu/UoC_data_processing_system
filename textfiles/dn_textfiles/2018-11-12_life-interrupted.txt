Life, Interrupted

Be forewarned. If you are filled with the same kind of cynicism that courses through the veins of Mercutio, if you are allergic to sentimentality, and everything that comes with the tag called true love, this story is not for you. In all honesty, it would not be right to place Robert James Waller’s ‘Bridges of Madison County’ on the same pedestal with Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, Pride and Prejudice or even Romeo and Juliet. Yet, ‘The Bridges of Madison County’ which was on The New York Times bestseller list for three years, eventually outselling “Gone With the Wind” and inspiring a film adaptation starring Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, has a charm and sweetness that reaches places the classics fear to tread.
The story begins with Robert Kincaid, a lean, free-spirited 52-year-old photographer who packs a Nikon into his pickup and travels to Iowa’s Madison County, the location of seven covered bridges he is to photograph for National Geographic. There, he asks directions of Francesca Johnson, alone at home for four days while her husband and two children visit the Illinois State Fair. Initially, neither Robert nor Francesca expects their random encounter to lead to a deep connection, yet their mutual attraction is undeniable.
Francesca, an Italian war bride, 45 years old sees in Robert Kincaid a dream figure, ‘tall and thin and hard, moving ‘like the grass itself, without effort, gracefully.’ As she guides him to a nearby bridge and afterwards invites him for iced tea and then supper he talks of poetry, art, and how he writes, “First you must have the images, then come the words.” Francesca is thrilled: ” People in Madison County didn’t talk this way, about these things. The talk was about weather and farm prices and new babies and funerals and government programs.” As they talk Francesca transforms from a bored farm wife to the girl in Italy she once was, dreaming of unknown adventures. She invites Richard back for supper the next night, and with the help of a moonlit walk and Yeats’ poetry, they find themselves on the way to reaching the ecstatic oneness that lovers are known to reach. It is a certainty, says Robert, that “comes only once, and never again, no matter how many lifetimes you live.”
At the end of the four days when he wants her to leave with him, Francesca finds the notion enormously attractive. She envies his life of travel, but deep down she knows she will never leave her husband. “What’s he like?” Robert asks. “He’s very clean,” she replies. “Hard-working . . . gentle . . . a good father.”
And he is. The story never makes the mistake of portraying Richard Johnson as a bad husband. But he is a man of few words. With Robert Kincaid, there is much conversation; they talk of their ideals, their taste for vegetarian meals, of the amazing places Robert has seen in his travels.
In some ways, Robert and Francesca are avatars of Anna and Vronsky (Francesca too is married to a man she has little in common with), Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet (one completes the other), Romeo and Juliet (brief intense encounters). Yet, unlike Anna who breaks up her marriage, unlike Romeo and Juliet whose love paves the way for their deaths, Robert and Francesca act with caution and make decisions in the best interest of others even when this means there will no longer be any light in either of their lives from now on.
“We are the choices that we have made, Robert,” she reminds him. He accepts her decision to remain with her family, drives off and never sees her again. Yet, he confesses in a letter he sends her “So here I am walking around with another person inside of me. Though I think I put it better the day we parted when I said there is a third person we have created from the two of us. And I am stalked now by that other entity….But, I am, after all, a man. And all the philosophic rationalizations I can conjure up do not keep me from wanting you, every day, every moment, the merciless wail of time, of time I can never spend with you, deep within my head.”
Waller tells their story as though it were nonfiction, claiming to have heard about Francesca from her children after her death, read her journals, seen Robert’s relics of those four days and interviewed a jazz musician who knew the photographer.
This adds such a sense of reality to the story that after the book was published the National Geographic was flooded with inquiries from readers wanting to know more about the life and times of their photographer, Robert Kincaid.
It is easy to reveal the mechanism behind ‘Bridges’, but more difficult to explain why this bittersweet tale of lingering memories and forsaken possibilities is so deeply moving. We know from page one that they will meet, and fall in love and until Robert leaves, we hope against hope that the ending would not be so sad. And yet the inevitable happens. Robert drives off, crying. When he turns back for one last look he sees her sitting, “cross-legged in the dust where the lane began, her head in her hands.”
Francesca and Robert are Darcy and Lizzy, grown old. They are Darcy and Lizzy with baggage. The flowering of their love will be forever deferred; they know they are right for each other, but they will not follow up on this knowledge. They trample their love, destroy their dreams because of the choices one of them had already made. Thus ends “The Bridges of Madison County” leaving a lucid, true to life message. Two people who find the promise of perfect personal happiness, must understand, and accept that the most important things in life are not always about making yourself happy.
To quote from the description of the on-line book, “If you have ever experienced the one true love of your life, a love that for some reason could never be,” you will understand what this book is all about. Let me add to this. If you have been lucky enough to find true love and keep it, then here’s the chance to know what it feels like to say good bye to a love, so certain.
The best way to relish ‘The Bridges of Madison County’ would be to read it with your heart and not your mind. As Robert tells Francesca, “Analysis destroys wholes. Some things, magic things, are meant to stay whole. If you look at their pieces, they go away.”
