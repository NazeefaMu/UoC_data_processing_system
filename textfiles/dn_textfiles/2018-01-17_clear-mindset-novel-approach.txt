A clear mindset,  a novel approach

“I like to plan everything ahead. I am not much of a procrastinator. I like to have my work done well before time, so I am not stressed out the day before. This has helped me to lead the school students. I have a plan in my head about what is going to go on. I know what happens at what time. Everyone knows what they are doing,” said Rajakarier
In the space of just six years from the time he joined AIS, young Tarish Rajakarier, Head Boy of Asian International School, has grown in character and strength while diligently applying himself to the goals he set for himself which has resulted in the mantle of Head Prefect being entrusted to him. Perfect Prefects features Rajakarier who handles the many facets of his leadership role with faith and dedication.
Though not omniscient, Rajakarier delegates tasks to the prefects under him ahead of time while being well informed about all the details.
“I like to plan everything ahead. I am not much of a procrastinator. I like to have my work done well before time, so I am not stressed out the day before. This has helped me to lead the school students. I have a plan in my head about what is going to go on. I know what happens at what time. Everyone knows what they are doing,” said Rajakarier.
Agree to disagree
Rajakarier feels that you need to have a clear mindset and plan. Leadership becomes a lot easier when you have a clear vision.
“I discuss everything with the Head Girl before implementing a decision. We also talk to the student counsellor and the prefects. We won’t always agree but sometimes you have to agree to disagree. It is always for the best because each one puts in his or her opinion. That helps us make a better decision,” stated Rajakarier
Rajakarier pointed out that a lot of critical thinking comes into play when confronted with a difficulty or obstacle. When something comes up unexpectedly, it is up to you to rise to the occasion.
“You need to stay calm and not get flustered or stressed out. You need to think rationally. You need to work through your problems because everything has a solution. You just need to find the solution. As Head Prefects we have the student council and the prefects. We are not alone because we are backed by so many people,” said Rajakarier
Rajakarier also added that being unafraid to express his opinion has actually benefited his leadership.
Through difficulties
“When something goes wrong there may be a dispute amongst certain parties. The ability to say what you want about an issue you are faced with is a very important part in getting through difficulties,” pointed out Rajakarier.
Rajakarier came to AIS six years ago. He arrived at AIS, a mediocre student but rapidly excelled in studies and sports.
“When I look over the last six years, every year has been a milestone for me. I achieved something new at AIS and I believe it is because of the culture at AIS. The students are always there to support you. Unity is a big part of AIS. It is a very productive part – your life at AIS. The teachers take the time to know you as a person. Each student has different capabilities and the teachers apply their methods to suit the student. This has really helped me. I was not great in my academics and sports when I joined AIS. But now look where I am. I have come pretty far. I took a leap of faith and joined the swimming team one day. I have been part of the swimming team for about four years now. The same goes for my Tennis, Drama Competitions and House Captaincy,” explained Rajakarier.
He mentioned that at AIS you are motivated to do more for the school. His school house is a big part of him and he has always wanted to help his house. At AIS the students work hard for their houses.
Student population
“Being approachable to the students at AIS is very important to me. I think what is important when leading a student population is being fair and discerning between right and wrong. I believe in opening channels of communication amongst students and helping them resolve their conflicts with each other. Helping them work through their issues is beneficial to both parties. Helping two parties reconcile is an admirable quality. Being there for the students is important to me. A lot of trouble can be prevented. As a prefect you have a certain level of power and authority. Sometimes you have to exercise that authority and power. Smaller kids look up to you and idolize you. At times you need to be gentle and at times be strict. Again communication is the key here. They need to understand that there will be help for those you ask for it. Talk to your prefects, teachers and parents if there is a problem,” explained Rajakarier.
Rajakarier believes there is something good we can take out of every leader. The world identifies with people who have made an impact upon the world.
“Everyone knows who Donald Trump is, but I don’t agree with anything he is doing. If I was German in Hitler’s day and age, I would think that Hitler’s views for his country were brilliant. They brought the economy up and they improved their GDP. Those policies were good for the country. It was the same with Napoleon. Everyone did what was best for their country. They do what they think is right even though it may not be right. But I think you need to understand that what you want should be good for the rest of the world as well,” argued Rajakarier.
Rajakarier wants to study psychology and genuinely wants to help people out and do his part for society. What he needs to do should benefit society in some way.
“You need to take a leap of faith. Try something new. If I did not try something new like joining the swimming team, I would not be where I am now. You need to take a leap of faith sometimes and have a goal and work towards it. Sometimes you just need to go with the flow. Sometimes along the way you need to improvise and change your goals as you go along,” added Rajakarier.
Science and religion
Having studied history as a subject, the area that interests him is the March on Washington by Martin Luther King.
“I want to be a part of an event that makes an impact on history. Things that are remembered by people. When it comes to reading I like ‘Angels and Demons’, because I love how it combines science and religion. I would like to visit the Vatican because religion is a big part of my life,” said Rajakarier.
