Alternate views not split in SLFP - Dilan

Outsiders are not permitted to split the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) for political gains. Even though there are two alternative views in the SLFP, yet there are no fractions in the party, Minister Dilan Perera said.
He was addressing the SLFP weekly press beefing at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
Perera said that parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila has said that he will drag the UPFA to the fourth place at the forthcoming local government elections.
However, he accepted that there are two alternative views in the SLFP. "But it is clear that some are trying to convert these two alternative views into two fractions," he said.
"His (Gammanpila) saying indicates that he has undertaken a contract to bring the UNP at the first place at the local government elections. Anyone has total freedom to day-dream but those dreams will never come true," he said.
The minister added that the Budget 2016 has plus as well as minus points. The budget has tremendous steps for the betterment of the education sector. Under this, undergraduates will be allowed to obtain interest free loans for their educational needs. A housing scheme will be carried for estate employees. However, several proposals of the budget should be re-considered. The proposals relating to vehicle permits, vehicle emission testing tax should be revised. The budget has not concentrated on coconut and tea cultivators and growers when giving the fertiliser subsidy.
The people-friendly UPFA parliamentarians will vote in favour of the Budget 2016 at the third reading on December 19, he said.
Perera said that the SLFP will move forward under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Minister Sudarshani Fernandopulle said around 85 percent are provided with hygienic water supply by the Water Supplies Board and by community water schemes. Moves have been taken to provide the vulnerable people for kidney disease with pure drinking water under an expedited project. She said that the ministry is engaged in planning 100 towns aiming to set up systematic well-planned towns. As a remedy to the high traffic congestion experienced in Colombo city and suburbs, the 'Park and Ride' method will be implemented in future.
Under this motorists can park their private vehicles at parking plots established out of Colombo and reach Colombo using public transport system. It has been planned to establish parking slots in suburbs such as Moratuwa, Ja-ela, etc. Moreover as a remedy to the high traffic jam, two new highways will be established. Under this project a new highway will be constructed from Borella to Kaduwela and Kelaniya to Fort.
Speaking on the forthcoming local government election, Minister Perera said all UPFA local government members will be allowed to contest at the election. Besides, several new faces will be added under the consent of the organiser of the electorate.
