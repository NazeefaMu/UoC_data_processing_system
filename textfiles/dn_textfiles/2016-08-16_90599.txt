Office on Missing Persons: JO ready for further talks with President

The Joint Opposition is prepared to have further discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena regarding the Office on Missing Persons and had made a written request for such an opportunity, Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella said.
He said they are prepared to make any decision favourable to safeguard the rights of the present and future generation.
Rambukwella said President Sirisena still had an opportunity to intervene into this Act and they hoped the President would pay attention to it. He was addressing a press conference at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's Office at Battaramulla yesterday.
Rambukwella said the Joint Opposition informed the President about the dangerous situation arising from this Act before the Bill was introduced in Parliament but the government had got it passed in Parliament in a matter of 45 minutes by bringing it up hastily.
Prof. G.L. Peiris said the Office of the Missing Persons Act was the result of an international programme, rather than a local programme.
He said this Act had opened the doors for international intervention and influence due to several obnoxious clauses.
