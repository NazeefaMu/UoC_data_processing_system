Full text of speech by Chief Justice K. Sripavan at the farewell yesterday
Mr. Attorney General, Mr. President of the Bar Association and members of the Bar, you do me and the Court great honour by your attendance. I doubt very much whether I deserve any of the praise so generously bestowed upon me.
I was not inclined to accept a felicitation this time as I had the privilege of having four ceremonial welcomes. However,after considering the request of the President and committee members of the Bar Association to revive once again the old traditions of the Bar, I was compelled to concede to the request of the Bar. So, we have all gathered here today to revive that old tradition of this court. As I stated earlier this is the 5th ceremonial occasion that I am addressing you in the confines of the vast hills. The first was when I took office as a Judge of the Court of Appeal in 2002, and then in March 2007 when I was appointed the President of the Court of Appeal, thirdly in March 2008 when I was elevated to the Supreme Court and the fourth occasion was when I was appointed as the Chief Justice in January 2015.
After more than four decades in Hulftsdorp, engaged in the administration of justice in this country, I am bidding farewell to all of you. This moment gives me mixed feelings. I will be missing the daily glance of your smiling faces in this great judicial institution. Most of you have appeared and argued hundreds of cases on various subjects before me both in the Court of Appeal and in the Supreme Court. I was appointed the Chief Justice during a momentous and historically significant period of this country. I am extremely fortunate that I received great strength and support from several members of the official and the unofficial Bar and that is the reason I achieved this position. To be in the precincts of this great institution itself is a great honour and to be a Judge and later Chief Justice of this Court, is the greatest fulfilled dream of my life.
As a Judge I tried my best to discharge my functions, but it is ultimately for the members of the Bar and the public to assess my contribution, if any, to restore the independence and integrity of the judiciary and the development of law in this country. During this span of almost forty long years in the system, I have witnessed the joys and the pain in the eyes of litigants, who throng the courtrooms in their quest for justice. I have often said that no institution deserves to survive in a democracy unless it earns public esteem; and it can earn the public esteem only by discharging its duties impartially and expeditiously. It is true that large arrears are pending before our Courts. But there is a tendency in many quarters to exaggerate the number of arrears of cases. Therefore, as the Chief Justice I tried my best to improve this institution. As an initial step 3 Supreme Court benches were constituted from December 2015 and the judges were sitting at least 4 days a week. As a result of these tireless efforts of my colleagues 1636 cases were disposed in 2016 as opposed to 783 cases in the year 2015. There were 1508 cases instituted in 2015 and 1863 cases instituted in 2016, whereas only 574 and 1710 cases were instituted in years 2013 and 2014. Judges serving in the Magistrates Courts, the District Courts and the High Courts were directed to take up trials on a day to day basis. Due to trials being taken up on a day to day basis and the consequential workload, the burden on the members of the staff became unbearable and the Judicial Service Commission more recently was able to fill the vacancies in the cadre for scheduled public officers. In addition,23 High Court Judges were appointed during the last two years out of which, 21 judges are carrier judges. Three judges were also appointed to the Court of Appeal and one Judge to the Supreme Court during this period.
Justice Cardozo[1] once said about Judges –
“ There is in each of us a stream of tendency...which gives coherence and direction to thought and action. Judges cannot escape that current more than other mortals. All their lives, forces which they do not recognize and cannot name, have been tugging at them ...inherited instincts,traditional beliefs, acquired convictions and resultant is our outlook on life, a conception of social needs, a sense of 'total push and pressure of the cosmos' which when reasons are nicely balanced, must determine where choice shall fall.”
Mr. Attorney, Mr. President, thousands of lawyers are practicing in this country and over 700 lawyers were enrolled here just few weeks back. I know many of them do not have sufficient work. Some of the young members of the Bar still face several difficulties. I can only wish them all success in their career. My only advice is - what is required for the young lawyers at the Bar are punctuality, a clear head, a good memory, strong commonsense and an aptitude of analysis and arrangement. If they possess these qualities, difficulties in their profession would vanish, like the morning mist before the Sun.I am duty bound to say that a social duty is cast upon the legal profession to show the people beacon light by their conduct and actions. The poor, the uneducated and exploited mass of the people need a helping hand from the legal profession, admittedly, acknowledged as a most respectable profession. The Bar is an extension of the system of justice. An Attorney is our officer of Court. He is a master of an expertise but more than that, accountable to the Court and governed by a high ethic. The success of the judicial process often depends on the services of the legal profession. Its nobility has to be preserved, protected and promoted. An institution cannot survive on its name or on its past glory alone. The glory and greatness of the Bar depends on its continued and meaningful performance with grace and dignity. The legal profession being noble and an honourable one, has to continue its meaningful, useful and purposeful performance inspired by and keeping in view the high and rich traditions consistent with its grace, dignity, utility and prestige. The majesty of law and the dignity of the Courts cannot be maintained unless there is mutual respect between the Bench and the Bar. There should be a proper amity between the Bench and the Bar rather than any element of arrogance or superiority on one side. Proper coherence will bring best out of the judiciary and make the justice delivery system of the country more effective.
It is the constitutional duty of this Court to protect the rights of the people and uphold the democracy and rule of law in this country. The foundation of the judiciary is the trust and confidence of the people in its ability to deliver fearless and impartial justice. When the foundation itself is shaken by acts which tend to create disaffection and disrespect for the authority of the court by creating distrust in its working, the eddifice of the judicial system gets eroded. This Court enjoins far-reaching influence in constitutional history and progress of this country. This court has protected the interest of the people and safeguarded the independence of the judiciary. Through landmark decisions, this court has considerably strengthened our democratic foundations and commitment to the rule of law. This court has also contributed to the strengthening of country's national unity. It is a great fortune that I could be a part of the judicial system of this country.
Therefore, I consider myself to be privileged to have been part of this court, privileged to have walked with my distinguished colleagues here who gave me nothing but kindness, courtesy and respect, privileged to have sat with the eminent judges of our courts, privileged to have listened some of the best arguments from the best lawyers of this country and privileged to have been able to bask under the glory of this court. I could not have wished for more!
Mr. Attorney, Mr. President, when I lay down my Office, I remember all those who have helped me in discharging my duties in various capacities.
I wish to thank my superiors at the Attorney General’s Department where I had the pleasure of serving for 25 long years and for the interactions I had with my seniors and juniors which substantially contributed to my success. Today I wish to place on record my indebtedness and gratitude to the Attorney General’s Department, where I had the golden opportunity to work with six Attorney Generals.
My most significant recognition, is also to all of the judges, including those who have retired.Without exception they are men and women of considerable capacity and dedication with many of whom I have had the closest of interchanges of a jurisprudential character,whilst sitting on the bench of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. I shall miss the stimulation of their intellectual intercourse, personal support and above all their friendship. I am indeed grateful to my sister judge and brother judges of this court as well as the other honourable judges of the Original Courts for gracing this occasion.
I also wish to once again thank the members of the Judicial Service Commission, specially my two brother Judges, Hon. Dep and Hon. Sisira De Abrew, who always stood by me in the discharge of my functions relating to the JSC and the Judges Institute.
I am thankful to the Honourable Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice Mr. Jayamanna for allocating funds for the training of judges as and when requests were made.
I also wish to thank the Marshall, the staff and members of the Superior Court Complex Board of Management for the cooperation extended in administering and managing this court complex.
I have interacted with many members of the court when attending to day to day affairs of the court. As a collective and collegial body of men and women I could not have asked for a richer or more satisfactory experience. It is invidious to single out particular people, however, I should acknowledge the particular role of the Registrar, Supreme Court Mrs. Jayasekera for the contribution made to ensure the smooth day to day administration of the Supreme Court Registry.
I am greatly indebted to my Secretary Ms. Anandhi Kanagaratnam for her dedication sometimes under great stress, which has been of highest order.
I wish to record my deep appreciation of the work done by my private secretary Mrs. Nanayakara, who comes to office at least half an hour before I come and arrange the files which I have to attend in the course of the day and had served me since my appointment to the Supreme Court in 2008. I also wish to acknowledge the contribution made especially by those currently in office, Jagath, Roshan, Gamini and Chandima who have done so much to help me in the press of these last two years in office.
My special thanks goes to my driver Manjula and my personal security officers for their unfailing punctuality and absolute devotion to duty.
On a personal note I remember with gratitude my parents who taught me
the basics of life and my alma mater Jaffna Hindu College. My family remains the most important bond of my life. To some degree my role as Chief Justice has expanded our horizons. I thank my wife Jayanthy for selflessly putting up with my extremely hectic work schedule and attending to the needs of the family and continuing to be my perennial source of strength. My son Thaya and daughter in law Nira deserve to be mentioned for their unwavering support given to me at all times.
Today, I step out of judicial office and go into what I know will be a stimulating new phase of my life. I know that the time is now right, when I feel the energy to do other things. I am happy to be moving on! The greatest service to mankind is to share with others the joys of living.
The more you give benefit to others, the more you do good to yourself.I am confident that this institution will be placed in charge of a person who would be a fearless defender of citizens’ rights so that the future of this institution would be safe, secured and protected in his hands.
This court has got an array of excellent lawyers and I can only say that I am extremely fortunate to have discharged my functions in this court amongst these lawyers who have made history in the profession.
With these words, I once again express my deepest gratitude for the honour, you have done me today and thank every one of you for your kind presence this morning.
Full text of the statement by Geoffrey Alagaratnam P.C.,
President, Bar Association of Sri Lanka at the Ceremonial Farewell to Chief Justice K. Sripavan
Your Lordship the Chief Justice, the Honourable Attorney General, His Lordship the President of the Court of Appeal, the Honourable Solicitor General and their Lordships of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, Learned President’s Counsel and Honourable Judges of the High Court and the District and Magistrate’s Courts,colleagues and distinguished invitees,
We are gathered to bid farewell upon the retirement of Your Lordship the Chief Justice from the Apex Court of our land. No doubt all things must come to an end.
Your Lordship's appointment as Chief Justice came in the midst of tumultuoustimes. Our land had seen the back of an era and a Rule,which in every senseis best forgotten though it also reminds us of what should never be. Several events preceded your appointmentbeginning from the ouster of an incumbent Chief Justice to the installation of another whose memory has as it were been erased from the annals and records of our legal history. Since then the legal system and our land has been on a promised journey to restore and repair the Rule of Law and Democracy. Though over two years has lapsed since Your Lordship's appointment, we have a very long way to go. There is work in progress, a path begun by your Lordship, but by no means been smooth and even. We still continue to grope for the light and live in hope.
We of the Bar have in our own way striven to ensure professionalism at a greater level though here too there is more to be done.
As Chief Justice, Your Lordship has no doubt been accommodating and inclusive in asserting that a strong Bar and a healthy relationship and cooperation between the Bench and the Bar is critical if the legal system is to be effectiveand serve any useful purpose. We are conscious that a strong Bar is vital more so for the Independence of the Judiciary as the judiciary, in keeping with the dignity of a sacred office, does not and is not expected to have a voice of its own.
We have set out on the path of constitutional amendments, to secure the independence of the judiciary as well as its integrity, competence and transparency and the independence of the profession. Many measures are envisaged and many mechanisms are being looked at.
But we are reminded of the reality that constitutional or legal safeguards mean little unless the people within the structures and who work them do so with dignity and responsibility.
Whilst we do accept that a strong Bar is important, it cannot be ignored that the Bar itself is an equal partner with the judiciary, a reality which has to be faced upto.
Quite apart from that the contribution of the Bar to the independence of the judiciary cannot in any manner be underestimated. One need cite no examples to assert that the Bar has been at the forefront of defending the independence of the judiciary, sometimes even at risk to life and limb.
Admittedly also the contribution of the Unofficial Bar and the Official Bar to the jurisprudence emanating from our Apex Courtsis not a matter for doubt. We recently witnessed the passing away of Judge C.G Weeramantry, who at the age of 42 joined the Apex court, from the Unofficial Bar and also remembered him on the 20 February 2017 for his outstanding contribution to our law and beyond which is well known. Lest we forget we have had erudite members of the Bar, from Late Justice Mark Fernando, Late Dr.A. R. B. Amarasinghe, together with many others presently among us who adorned our courts. These individuals are among many others who meaningfully contributed in addition to many who also joined the judiciary from the Unofficial Bar at various levels of judicial office. Our memory serves us little if we are unable to recall the contribution of the Unofficial Bar to the judiciary at all levels Members of the Unofficial Bar in particular, have in the past and in keeping with our accepted rich traditions joined the judiciary through a sense of challenge and while recognising the call of duty with an element of sacrifice and more often not due to the non availability of pursuing any other calling in life.
We cannot but fail to remember that there has been a rich tradition of the judiciary comprising members of the career judiciary, and those of the Official and Unofficial Bars. The ratiocommonly referred to is 4 : 2 : 1, of career judges and members of the Official and Unofficial Bars respectively. In other words the judiciary if it is to be healthy and rich in approach and jurisprudence needs a mix of persons drawn from all these organisations. The Judiciary cannot be under the monopoly or control of any one of these organisations.
One of the areas related to the judiciary which the Bar has urged,apart from the mix of personnel in the judiciary, is the emphasis on persons of undoubted merit and competence occupying positions in higher judicial office, such as the High Court and higher courts. Towards this there has to be identified criteria to accommodate competence and merit through judicial audit or other mechanisms.
Reliance on mere seniority for entitlement or promotions though perhaps a relevant criterion cannot and should not be a compelling basis. My Lords, maturity and wisdom we hope does come with age but it is not always necessarily so. Sometimes years only confers old age..
The Bar has also consistently maintained that the composition of the Judicial Services Commission should be broad based as an independent body to include several other stake holders such as the President of the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General, the President of the Bar Association and perhaps representatives of other responsible civil society organizations. Such is also towards greater transparency in the matter of handling of matters related to tenure, promotions and disciplinary control over the minor judiciary in acknowledgement of the fact that the Judiciary serves and should represent the interests of society and is not an exclusivesecretenclave shroudedin mystery. The enactment of the recent Right to Information Act should buttress and emphasise the need for transparency and openness.
This need for a broader composition is especially where under previous dispensations there were claims of victimization and discrimination ofmembers of the minor judiciary due to the idiosyncrasies (to put it mildly) of some of Your Lordships' predecessors.
The call for a wider and broader body as representative of the JSC comes more to the forefront today in the hope that the JSC will have, the mettle to withstand and to display greater independence, transparency and consistency in its positions and deliberations bereft of external and internal pressures. The matter of appointments to the judiciary, especially the High Court and above, are specified in the Constitution and fortuitously with greater clarity after the enactment of the 19th amendment. The Constitutional Council plays its role for the apex courts while your Lordships in the Judicial Services Commission and the Attorney General, together with the President of the Republic have been identified as the persons, and the only persons , conferred with the authority or powers to appoint High Court judges. Such constitutional role having been discharged by your Lordships, no other procedure, formalities or pre-requisites apart from the impliedsuitability of a candidate can have constitutional relevance in this process of appointment.
No doubt, an informed process of consultation and verification, with important stakeholders will go a long way in ensuring the best persons are appointed. Yet, such informed consultation processes cannot be, I state here with responsibility, criteria for determining the validity of an appointment or for ex post factojustifying or varying the constitutional role undertaken and/or responsibilities of persons entrusted with the task of such appointments and which have been discharged. This duty cannot be abdicated.
Article 111(2) of the Constitution of our land is beyond ambiguity when it stipulates that ,
“Judges of the High Court shall
(a) On the recommendation of the Judicial Services Commission be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and such recommendation shall be made after consultation with the Attorney General.
Thus it is the recommendation of your Lordships in the Judicial Services Commission, in consultation with the Attorney General that is material in the matter of such appointment. Any other informal consultation process, though laudable, whether defective or not, can have no bearing on the exercise of the obligation cast by Article 111(2)(a) of the Constitution on your Lordships and goes without saying that when such recommendation is provided it has been done with due care and diligence.
It is most unfortunate that there should be confusion on such a fundamental position.
I trust the words of the Prince of Denmark,in Hamlet,would not be relevant to us, when he said; “Oh Judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason”!
The judiciary and the Bar have enjoyed a healthy relationship of cooperation. It is our earnest endeavour that the judiciary and Bar will continue to collaborate in the interests of justice There is more to be done towards Judicial and professional independence and for its integrity and dignity. What the future holds we cannot predict. As I said there is still work in progress. You leave today and so would I. My prayers and hopes for the profession and the judiciary is greater professionalism, a sense of responsibility and dignity which is fundamental and critical if any system however perfect, is to work.I hope my prayers will be answered.
After all is said and done My Lord, the Chief Justice, it must be said that you did exercise dignity, patience, transparency, humility and consistency together with the required authority when discharging your functions on the Bench, quite in contrast to the atmosphere that prevailed under a few dispensations before you assumed office as Chief Justice. We thank Your Lordship for this.
We wish you well.
