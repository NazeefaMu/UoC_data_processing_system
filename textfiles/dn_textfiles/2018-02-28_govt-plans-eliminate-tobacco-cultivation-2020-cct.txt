Govt. plans to eliminate tobacco cultivation in 2020: CCT

Centre for Combating Tobacco Director Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya said, “the government plans to eliminate tobacco cultivation in 2020 in Sri Lanka,” at a programe in Janaki Hotel on February 26.
Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention Director Dr. Samantha Kumara Kithalawaarachchi and Dr. Manuja Perera of the Public Health Department also participated for the programme. Center of Combating Tobacco (CCT), Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo and Presidential Task Force on drug Prevention had been carrying out investigations about tobacco cultivation.
Dr. Mahesh said that more than 80 percent of CTC’s tobacco leaf requirement is grown during the “Yala” season when the farmers have no alternative but to grow a cash crop for the lack of adequate water essential for paddy. The income derived during the handful of months in the Yala season turns the farmers into millionaires, allowing them to breathe easy during the rain-heavy, paddy cultivation-friendly Maha season.
A plethora of evidence exist to confirm that tobacco cultivation and its final product lead to many adverse effects on public health, environment and the socio economic status of the country.
Tobacco cultivation was first introduced to Sri Lanka under Portuguese rule in colonial times. At present Matale, Polonnaruwa, Monaragala, Kandy and Anuradhapura are identified as the main districts that cultivate tobacco in Sri Lanka. Ceylon Tobacco Company (CTC), the subsidiary of British American Tobacco (BAT) runs a leaf to cigarette manufacturing process in the country and domestically grown tobacco is also used in chewing tobacco products and other smoking products such as beedi, he said.
Dr.Mahesh further said that Tobacco farming is harmful to the environment and farm workers, with multinational companies contributing to the problem by exploiting local farmers. They found that tobacco farming causes green tobacco sickness (GTS) in farm workers who absorb nicotine through the skin when handling wet tobacco. GTS causes muscle weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, abdominal cramps, breathing difficulty, diarrhea, chills, fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate, and increased perspiration and salivation.
Children working in tobacco farming face other serious risks as well. Children also reported that tractors sprayed pesticides in nearby fields.
They said the spray drifted over them, making them vomit, feel dizzy, and have difficulty breathing and a burning sensation in their eyes. Many of the pesticides used in tobacco production are known as neuro toxins, poisons that alter the nervous system.
The long-term effects of childhood pesticide exposure can include cancer, problems with learning and cognition, and reproductive health issues.
