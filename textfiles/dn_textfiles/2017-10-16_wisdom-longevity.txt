Wisdom of longevity

Ayurveda, the 5000 year old medical system, origin of which can be traced back to the Indian subcontinent focuses more on healthy living than treatment of diseases. Ayurveda is from two Sanskrit words, ayus (life) and veda (related to knowledge). The earliest concept of Ayurveda was put into writing by VedaVyasa, the sage and shaktavesha avatar of Vishnu, Dhanvantari in Atharvaveda, which is one of the four ancient books of Indian knowledge, wisdom and culture.
There are three main Ayurvedic texts. i.e. Charak Samhita, Sushrut Samhita and the Ashtangha Hridaya Samhita.
Sushrut Samhita teachings contains 184 chapters and description of 1,120 illnesses, 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources and 57 preparations based on animal sources.
Charaka Samhita, written by Charaka is the principal classic reference. It gives emphasis to the nature of each person: body care, mental regulation, and spiritual/consciousness refinement.
The third major work is called the Ashtangha Hridaya, which is a concise version of the works of Charaka and Sushruta.
AYURVEDA IN SRI LANKA
Our ancient rulers played an active part in not only relieving the sufferings of the people when they afflicted with disease, but also in ensuring that minimum standards of sanitation were observed.
Mahawamsa, refers to several kings who founded medical institutions.
Mention is made of King Pandukabhaya as having set up a lying in home and a hospital. King Duttugamunu provided food for the sick and provided medical attention for them.
Upatissa ii founded hospitals “for cripples, woman in difficulty and for the blind and the sick he erected nursing shelters and alms halls.”
Buddhadasa (398-426 A.D.) an eminent physician himself is also credited with the compilation of Sarasthasangrahaya a compendium of all existing handbooks, composed in Sanskirt. He appointed physicians to treat soldiers, horses and elephants. Special asylums were set up for the cripples and the blind.
Dappula II and Kassapa IV built hospitals both at Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.
Parakramabahu 1 is also credited with establishment of hospitals and care of the sick. He built a large hospital “for many hundred sick people fitted for their sojourn there, and had placed in it, the way described, a complete collection of all articles for use. There also he gave to each sick person a special slave (attendant).” Two of the important officers in his administration were Mahavedana (Chief Physician) and Sulu Vedana (the Deputy Chief Physician). The royal hospitals were staffed with both male and female attendants.
Grant of medical facilities to Buddhist monks was considered an act of great charity as evidenced by references to such grants in inscriptions.
The slab inscription at Mihintale belonging to the reign of Mahinda IV is of special interest to the students of the Ayurveda. It refers to the practice of application of leeches to get rid of impure blood, a practice followed to this day.
The remains of the monastic hospital at Mihintale of which a detailed description has been given by H.C.P. Bell in the Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon for 1910-II provides the best archaeological evidence of a medieval hospital in Sri Lanka. Of special interest is the sarcophagus-like trough of stone called “medicine boat” discovered at this place. Such troughs have also been discovered at Thuparama (in Anuradhapura) and at Medirigiriya.
THE REVIVAL OF AYURVEDA
In 1925 there was a demand by some members of the Legislative Council for the allocation of a sum of money for the training of Ayurvedic physicians. This was followed by the passing of a resolution for the appointment of a committee to study the feasibility of this proposal. The Committee recommended, that a Board of Indigenous Medicine be constituted to deal with the subject of training of physicians, and that a College is set up in Colombo for this purpose with a hospital and an outdoor dispensary attached to it.
The first Board of Indigenous Medicine constituted in pursuance of this recommendation consisted of following members. K. Balasingham (member of the Legislative Council-Chairman) A. F. (later Sir Francis) Molamure, D. S., W. A. de Silva (who later became Minister of Health) (Later Sir) D. B. Jayathillaka (who became the Leader of the House in the State Council), Donald Obeysekara (Bar-at-law and chairman of the Oriental Studies Society) C. Muthukumara and M. S. P. Samarasinghe.
All of are remembered for their untiring efforts to restore Ayurveda to its due place. Two of them however stand out prominently. They are - K. Balasingham, due to whose efforts the College and Hospital at Borella were founded and Donald Obeysekara who made a significant contribution for the promotion of Ayurvedic medical education.
The setting up of the College and the Hospital at Borella in 1929 is an important landmark in the movement for the revival of Ayurveda in this country. Between 1929 and 1961 when the Ayurveda Act was enacted is a formative period, the major part of which is marked by the role played by S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike for his efforts in placing the College and the Hospital which were originally state aided organisations under direct state management, for the provision of administrative machinery, for the registration of Ayurvedic practitioners and for the establishment of the Department for the Development of Indigenous Medicine.
He also made a substantial contribution to the development of the Ayurvedic curative services by initiating a programme of construction of Ayurvedic hospitals under the management of the Department.

8.Rasayana Tantra (Health and Longevity): Deals with prevention of diseases and improving immunity and rejuvenation.
With the enactment of the Ayurveda Act No. 31 of 1961, the following important steps have been taken:
1) The establishment of the Department of Ayurveda.
2) The establishment of the Bandaranaike Ayurvedic Research Institute.
3) The expansion of the Central Ayurvedic Hospital, Borella and setting up of several hospital and dispensaries in different parts of the island.
4) Increase in the number of dispensaries run by the local authorities and payment of enhanced financial grant.
5) The establishment of the Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation
6) Upgrading the Ayurveda College as an affiliated body of the University of Colombo
7) The establishment of Boards for compiling the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia and indigenous prescriptions
8) Publication of books on Ayurveda
