China and Sri Lanka have a long Buddhist cultural relationship. Since the beginning of the fifth century, the king of the Sinhaladeepa sent the Master Dharma to the Liu Song Dynasty to offer Buddha statues. Master Fa-xian went to Sinhaladeepa seeking Buddhist sutras in the early eigth century. Vajrabodhi and his disciple Amoghavajra preached Buddhism between the two countries until the beginning of the 11th century. Monk Miao-de and others in Sinhaladeepa went to the Zhao Song Dynasty and offered relics, Sanskrit clips. This is reliable evidence; it can be seen in historical records for more than 600 years.
