No Sri Lankans were reported to have been affected as of yesterday by the flooding and landslides in Southwest Japan, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.

Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Maheshini Colonne, tweeting in her account, further said, “Deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life and property with many missing as a result of torrential rain in Japan. We in Sri Lanka offer heartfelt condolences to all those affected. Our thoughts and prayers are with the government and the people of Japan.” According to international media reports, heavy rains lashed Southwest Japan, triggering floods and landslides that killed at least 85 people and forced 2 million others to flee their homes.
