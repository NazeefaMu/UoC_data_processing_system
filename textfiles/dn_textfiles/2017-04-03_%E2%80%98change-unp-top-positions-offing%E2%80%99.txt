‘Change in UNP top positions in the offing’

The United National Party will implement several changes in its top positions to ensure that they are evenly distributed according to provinces and party seniority, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.The minister was addressing a media briefing after he called on Getambe Rajopavanarama Viharadhipati Ven. Keppetiyagoda Siriwimale Nayaka Thera to receive his blessings on April 1.
Distribution of posts according to provincial level without concentrating on a handful of people will provide an enormous strength to the party and the envisaged changes will be submitted to the UNP Working Committee for approval on April 5, he said. Responsibilities of the party will be entrusted to a wider circle to strengthen the party as it had the power to win any future election, the minister said.
Kiriella said the party had rewarded him for spearheading its victory in the Kandy district by appointing him as Leader of the House and he did not aspire for any special post during the impending party shake up.
