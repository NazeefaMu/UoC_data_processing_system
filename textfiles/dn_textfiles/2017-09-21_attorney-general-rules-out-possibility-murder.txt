Panadura Additional Magistrate Kalhari Liyanage who considered the instruction report of the Attorney General discharged the three wheeler driver Moderage Amila Sumith Silva who was in remand for the last six months, following a B report submitted to Court by the Panadura Police Traffic Branch.
After two days of the accident, the Panadura Police Traffic Branch submitted a B report to Court regarding the accident stating that the three wheeler driver had purposely caused the accident to kill Sub Inspector Premadasa by knocking down the motorcycle in which he was riding on the Panadura Hirana Road.
Sub Inspector Premasiri Bandara, 50, OIC of Panadura Moderawila Police Post and Community Unit of the Panadura Police, died as a result of a traffic accident occurred on the Hirana Panadura Road on November 13, 2016.
