Body of woman lecturer found

A body of a woman was found by police on the Trincomalee coast last Saturday.
The victim was identified as a 29-year-old lecturer of the Trincomalee campus of the Eastern University and a resident of Asikulam.
At the preliminary police investigations, it was further revealed that the lecturer had left the campus in a three-wheeler mentioning that she was going home.
However, her body was found later after a complaint was lodged by her family that she hadn’t returned home.
Police investigations are continuing.
