Chasing 327 lose four wickets for 53
Lanka staring down the barrel at 3-0 whitewash

England continued to reap the benefits of blunders done on the field by Sri Lanka to place themselves with a very good chance of making a 3-0 sweep of the three-Test series at the SSC grounds.
When play ended on the third day yesterday, Sri Lanka were struggling at 53 for four wickets in their second innings, still 274 runs adrift of the target of 327 they need to reach if they are to avoid a whitewash, and with only six wickets in hand.
Only two teams before have whitewashed Sri Lanka at home - Ricky Ponting’s Australians in 2004 and Virat Kohli’s Indian side in 2017. Joe Root’s side are on the verge of joining them when the Test resumes today on the fourth day.
England has already sealed the series by taking an unbeatable 2-0 lead and Sri Lanka who have always been behind them can show some heart by making a game out of this contest.
The target could have easily been a much smaller one than they have been asked to chase, had Sri Lankan spinner Lakshan Sandakan not allowed Ben Stokes the luxury of two ‘lives’ courtesy of bowling no-balls by overstepping his mark.
This sort of amateurism on the part of the bowler cost his side valuable runs. Stokes was given a life at 22 when he was caught at cover by Danushka Gunathilaka and at 32 when he was snapped up at slip by Dhananjaya de Silva. He made full use of his luck to help England recover from a shaky 39-4 to 128-5 putting together a stand of 89 with Jos Buttler.
England were eventually dismissed for 230 in their second innings with Buttler making a top score of 64 off 79 balls (3 fours) and Dilruwan Perera helping himself to another five-for (5/88) haul his second in the series and eighth overall in his career.
It was another case of England clawing their way back from a top order collapse to post a competitive total.
In the first innings Sri Lanka used up all their reviews by the 22nd over and had several decisions they could easily have turned in their favour ruled out by the umpire and yesterday it was the case of losing out on no-balls.
All ten wickets fell to the spinners with Malinda Pushpakumara (3/28) and Sandakan (2/76) taking the remaining five.
Sri Lanka began the day well claiming four England wickets for 39 runs within the first hour of play, but undid everything in the next hour to allow England off the hook through Sandakan’s negligence for which he and the support staff are answerable.
It is usually considered a cardinal sin for a spinner to bowl no-balls and Sandakan was twice found guilty of doing that and to make matters worse when he had dismissed the batsman.
Karunaratne was off the field for the entire England innings recovering from a blow to the chest from Ben Stokes while batting in the first innings, but it didn’t affect his batting position as opener.
Umpiring errors were galore yesterday with six decisions being revoked and none of the sides losing their reviews.
