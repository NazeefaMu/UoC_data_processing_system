Alzheimer’s IS linked to blood transfusions

A now-banned type of blood transfusion which was used globally until the 1980s may have given people Alzheimer's, a new study claims.
Between 1958 and 1985, abnormally short children in the US and the UK were given hormones harvested from cadavers to help spur their growth. But in the early 1980s, there was a global outbreak of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a fatal neurological disorder - and it was traced back to the blood transfusions.
The technique was banned in 1985, replaced with synthetic hormones, and researchers have been monitoring the survivors for other side effects ever since.
Now, a paper published today in the journal Springer presents new evidence for a popular theory that the technique created build-ups of amyloid protein in survivors' brains - paving the way to Alzheimer's.
The research team gave the hormones to mice, and the rodents developed signs of the disease within a year. The study, published in Nature, was carried out by University College London and led by Dr John Collinge, a professor of neurology at the UCL Institute of Prion Diseases.
The researchers drew one of their 2015 studies, which analysed the autopsied brains of eight people who died young from CJD. The disease is thought to occur when high levels of prions - known as 'amyloid seeds' - cause irreversible damage to nerve cells. More than 200 people worldwide died of CJD as a result of hormone transfusions.
All of the patients had been treated as children in the 1980s with a human growth hormone taken from cadavers. This procedure was first carried out in the UK in 1958, and in the US in 1963.
Although none of them developed the 'full picture' of dementia, six of them had worrying amounts of the naturally-occurring amyloid proteins in their brains.
In an Alzheimer's patient's brain, abnormal levels of amyloids clump together to form plaques that collect between nerve cells and disrupt their function.
Six of the brains also had some degree of of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which occurs when amyloids build in the brain's blood vessels and can cause bleeding. CAA is seen to some extent in nearly all Alzheimer's patients.
To build on this research, the scientists tracked down some of the batches of the human growth hormone that the deceased had been treated with.
Testing these samples revealed that some contained significant levels of both amyloid and tau proteins. Tau has been shown to form tangles in the area of the brain associated with memory loss in Alzheimer's sufferers.
The samples were then injected into mice who were genetically at-risk of developing the amyloid clumps seen in Alzheimer's. Other rodents were injected with brain tissue from known dementia patients.
The mice that were injected with the now-banned growth hormones showed clear signs of amyloid clumping along blood vessels in their brains and developed CAA within a year.
This occurred to a greater extent among the rodents who were injected with tissue from Alzheimer's patients. The study therefore suggests that human-growth hormone batches that have been stored for decades can still cause worrying amyloid clumps in mice.
'We have now provided experimental evidence to support our hypothesis that amyloid pathology can be transmitted to people from contaminated materials,' Professor Collinge said.
'We cannot yet confirm whether medical or surgical procedures have ever caused Alzheimer’s disease itself in people, or how common it might be to acquire amyloid pathology in this way.'
'It will be important to review risks of transmission of amyloid pathology by other medical procedures still done today, including instruments used in brain surgery, drawing on other research and what we already know about accidental CJD transmission.'
'This study did not look at surgical instruments at all, so we can’t make any conclusions about that and any suggested implications about that are speculation beyond the scope of this work.'
