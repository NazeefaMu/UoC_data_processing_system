England should extend Jones deal says Wallabies coach

Teddington, Friday: Eddie Jones should be given an extended contract as England coach in recognition of his achievements since taking charge, according to Australia counterpart Michael Cheika.
Jones, appointed after a defeat by his native Australia saw hosts England knocked out of the 2015 World Cup in the pool phase, began life as Red Rose boss in stunning style with 17 consecutive wins -- a sequence that included a Grand Slam and a Six Nations title.
His present contract runs to 2021, subject to a break clause related to England's performances at next year's World Cup in Japan. AFP
