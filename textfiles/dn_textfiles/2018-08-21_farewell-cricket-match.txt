The match was sponsored by Champa Stores, Kandy, and organised by the Kandy Cricket and Athletic Academy in which Indra Withananchchi is the Patron/President. All the players were awarded with trophies and the Principal was awarded with a memorial memento by the teacher-in-charge of Cricket, Bhagya Devapriya.
