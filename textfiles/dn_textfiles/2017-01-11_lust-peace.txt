Lust for peace

May I share my thoughts with my dear readers on a word that brings joy, hope, faith and love mingled with a lot of tears. It is the most beautiful word sought so much by humans, animals and plants between the beginning and the end of their existence.
Peace, Samaya, Samadanam is a word that has been with us from birth to death, and exists in all the languages of the world. A most sought after word. The white feathered dove has been the symbol of peace from time immemorial. The dreaded tentacles of pride, greed, anger, jealousy, lust, war and politics have always strived to strangle peace. To man, peace is the ultimate consolation in overcoming the tears and desolation caused by them and bequeaths to man an abundance of tears of thanksgiving and tranquillity. Peace is a state of harmony that exists between individuals, families, neighbours, ethnic groups and countries. At times we make peace with our lovely innocent animals. Peace of mind, peaceful environment, peaceful demonstrations, passing away peacefully. When the Red Indians wanted to have peace, they threw their tomahawks away and smoked the pipe of peace. Peace can be easily broken.
Of all the happenings, opposing peace, the most dreaded is war. Peace is made to shudder and cry. War of words, thoughts of revenge could culminate in a vale of tears. War is the precursor of hunger, despondency and loss of life. History has shown us how nations have been sliced to pieces until peace steps in. Breaches of peace cause man, animal and plant to embrace Mother Earth in death. It is only the victims of war who as the limbless citizens of a nation, orphans and refugees who walks, walk and walk to unknown lands carrying their starving children who cry and pray for peace.
It is not those who light crackers and parade on the streets who understand the meaning of real peace. It’s the unfortunate persons who have been bitten by the dogs of war and have been eye witnesses of their loved ones and friends being blown up to bits who will accept peace with bowed heads, smiles and tears. The lives of persons who lived in peace can be torn asunder by interested persons. Hidden agendas of a few make peaceful humans to go berserk while some shed crocodile tears. Politics, lust for power make peace to cry.
It happened in our gem of an island. A country universally excepted as a ‘hospitable nation with smiling people was shattered.
A nation prayed for peace. A joyous, nation, sighed in relief when peace dawned. Here, we cannot ever forget our beloved combatants who made peace to bloom once again. Millions of voices were raised in prayer to all the Beautiful Teachers in whom we believed. All prayed for peace. All of them granted our wish. In our own little gem living water played a vital vote in bringing us peace. Our sagacious monarchs of old gave their subjects water to irrigate, bathe and to drink and live in contentment and peace. Again it was water that was to give us peace, when the gates of Mawilaru sluices were opened, and quenched a parched part of our Mother Lanka with water and peace.
The league of Nations and the United Nations were founded to remove the stench of war from the face of the earth.
