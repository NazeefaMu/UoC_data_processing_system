WELL-WATCHED POT

An aluminium pot, a few stones and a burner were enough for Surahee Bohoran. She would assemble them for a makeshift oven and make a delicious cake. Watching his mother produce the culinary masterpiece with the most basic items tickled 14-year old Tony Bohoran’s taste buds. Of all the siblings, he was the first to taste whatever delicacy his mother chose to cook – be it a hopper or string hoppers. Dreams were taking form in his little mind and turned into a well-baked structure. Tony felt the heat in the kitchen. But he never got out of it. Instead, he chose to stir the pot and simmer himself down.
“My mother became a single parent in the early 1970s when my father passed away. Her day was filled with activities. She did dishes, cooked, washed clothes and educated us the children. She managed all this singlehandedly.” Bohoran now recalls with gratitude.
 
These were the days when the oven, like most other cookery equipment such as microwave oven, was still regarded as an out-of-bounds subject in everyday conversation. Though he does not now remember how his mother arranged the makeshift oven, the taste of the cake is still fresh in his memory.
Seated in the Managing Director’s chair with a calm authority, Tony Bohoran, who founded Raffles Restaurant chain 19 years ago, justifies why he released his collection of recipes invented over the last 15 years in a coffee-table book form. Titled ‘Tony’s Recipes’, the book introduces you to Tony’s world of starters, soups, salads, seafood, poultry, meats, desserts, refreshing beverages in addition to a guide of marinations for BBQs, general cooking and other useful information.
His culinary-savvy mother impacted Tony for the rest of his career. Following a few odd jobs, he established his career as a chef. Unlike most other chefs who came from the ranks, Tony opted for the academic path. He obtained a diploma and degree related to his field. The recipe collection is dedicated to his mother, the pillar of his success, as a token of gratitude.
Lack of professional recognition
Becoming a chef – or establishing as one – in Sri Lanka has dire consequences, as Tony opines. The industry lacks professional recognition. The qualified chefs tend to migrate for better pay and recognition.
“We need to address this issue. We need to treat the chefs as real professionals. That really does not happen in Sri Lanka. On the contrary, the chef is an industry in European countries, especially Australia. Most chefs are recognised with Michelin stars. You come across Michelin restaurants. People are motivated to enter the field. Like doctors and engineers, the chefs are well looked after,” Tony assesses the chef phenomenon in Sri Lanka.
A few years working under uncaring bosses forced Tony to establish his own business empire. When he left to initiate his own enterprise what he lacked was only money. The rest he had already earned: being constantly in touch with the Colombo society, familiar with its culinary tastes and requirements and the right kind of contacts. He had people to fund his new enterprise and head the kitchen. About 400 employees work under him today.
All that came to pass because he preferred the job of the chef to that of a cook.
Challenge accepted
“A cook will have to cook forever. To become a chef, you need to be multi-talented. You should have a capacity to manage people, calculate the costing, aware of the laws that govern the employees, nutrition and hygiene factors,” Bohoran anatomises the difference between the two familiar terms.
If you ask a cook to prepare a menu for one week, Tony goes on to explain, he will prepare something. But a chef knows the scientific norms of a menu. For instance, each person has a requirement of calories on a daily basis. Each person has a nutrition requirement which includes protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals. Besides you need to have iodine and iron as well. A chef takes all these factors into consideration when he prepares a complete menu.
To illustrate the chef’s task, Bohoran takes the case of Maldivians. He explains why the Maldivians are small-made compared to other Asians.
“In the Maldives, you don’t find very many natural resources. They do not have vegetables in abundance. Their main diet is fish and rice with a bit of onion. With the remaining sources, they prepare a marmite-like delicacy called Rihaakuru. It is full of protein. But their basic meal lacks other nutritious values such as vitamin and carbohydrate. They have an overdose of protein.”
Sri Lankan diet
More or less the same law applies to the Sri Lankan diet. Compared to the Sri Lankan diet, the European diet is well balanced with nutrients. They eat more protein, less carbohydrate with more vegetables and salads. That explains their well-built form. On the contrary, the Sri Lankan diet gives prominence to carbohydrate over the three main meals. The meal has lesser protein and vegetables. It affects the growth of body and brain.
A bulk of recipes in Tony’s collection are not vegetarian-friendly. Bohoran accredits it to the percentage. Only five per cent of the Colombo society is vegetarian, he claims.
“My wife is a vegetarian. But I am not. A lion cannot eat vegetables. A rabbit cannot eat meat. Likewise, the humans have to eat anything because they are omnivorous. They cannot survive with only vegetables. Leave vegetarians aside. The vegans lack the nutrients they require essentially. If you really want to become one, you should at least be lacto-vegetarian consuming dairy products. Otherwise, that meal habit makes you prone to many sicknesses and diseases.”

 
Remember to burn it down!
As for generating cholesterol, Bohoran comments that the eater should be able to control it. Cholesterol has become a menace because people do not burn their energies. The remedy for cholesterol does not lie in avoiding food that generates the fat-like substance in the body. Eat cholesterol-rich food, but remember to burn it down.
The collection has been prepared in response to various queries he had been getting. It is not for the industry, Bohoran insists. His target audience is the affluent housewives.
Tony Bohoran has a passion to spice up the industry with professionalism. He believes that the industry is not managed properly. Sri Lanka has way more to go with a tight competition coming from the fellow Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, India and the Maldives. With his globetrotting experience, Tony claims that Sri Lanka offers an inferior product at a higher price.
“Once, during my stay in China, I paid only USD 90 to a five-star hotel. The quality of the service and food was much better compared to Sri Lanka. It is beyond comparison. But you have to pay more than USD 90 to a five-star hotel in Sri Lanka.”
The Tourist Board has their own argument, Tony points out. If you don’t sell at a higher price, you will get cheap tourists. The cheap tourists are essentially the backpackers or the budget travellers. Arguments aside, the budget travellers will make it to Sri Lanka whether the prices are high or low. If you break down the tourist population, most of them are not high spenders. The tourists in Sri Lanka while on a transit are also considered a tourist arrival.
“First we need to attract people by giving them value for money. If I spend my money, I automatically value it. For that, we should have professionalism in the hotel industry. Sadly, Sri Lanka does not have it.”
And the remedy? It is the responsibility of all the stakeholders. The government has to get involved. The private sector must get involved in their own right. More marketing shall take place. Tony’s Recipes is an attempt to cater to that need.
You can become a cook by watching, Tony emphasises. But you can never be a chef automatically. It requires years of experience and experiment.
For most budding chefs, an invite to appear before Tony to show their culinary feat represents some chore. Bohoran has his own criterion when he recruits his chefs.
Before finalising the recruit, he asks the interviewee to make a creamy caramel. It is a basic recipe, Tony reminds, with milk, eggs and sugar. Once the caramel is prepared, Tony cuts it in half.
 
Perfect marble
I need to see the inside like a marble, Tony insists. The interior that looks like marble is perfect. If there are pores, it speaks for the cook’s capacity. He knows how to make a cream caramel, but not the technique. Every recipe has a scientific technique behind it.
“You should never beat up the eggs. What happens when you beat up is that the white and the yolk hold on to the air. As you beat, the air gets trapped in the custard. With that, it sets the air bubbles. That explains the pores inside.”
On a different note, Tony takes mayonnaise for example. You need the egg yolk and mustard for the preparation. Plus, you need to pour oil at the same time you beat it up. Practically speaking, you need both your hands. The hands have to function in sync. When you beat eggs, you incorporate eggs into the air. The oil gets coated in the air particles. If you happen to increase the speed of pouring oil, the preparation will collapse. A skilled chef, for that matter, should know the art of balancing.
“That is the issue with most Sri Lankan chefs. They do not know the technique. One major concern is that the government-sponsored Sri Lanka Institute of Hotel Management has space only for 30 students at a time. They receive about 200 applications. The leftover crowd chooses private hotel schools which are money-oriented. Finally, the outcome is inferior,” Tony explains.
Tony Bohoran is not a chef fallen from the skies. His is a long arduous journey. That journey began with the small step of a well-watched pot that belongs to his mother.
