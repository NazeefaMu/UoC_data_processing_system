Parked lorry runs off road

A lorry with a stock of liquor, which had been parked opposite a hotel near Bibile town on the Colombo -Moneragala road, while the driver and assistant had disembarked to have their meals, suddenly moved forward on its own for about 500 metres and ran off the road, yesterday.
Onlookers who rushed to the scene to save the injured if any, saw to their bewilderment that there were no occupants in the lorry. They later saw the driver and assistant emerging from the hotel. Bibile Police are investigating the incident.
