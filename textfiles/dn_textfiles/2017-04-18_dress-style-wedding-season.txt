Dress up in style this wedding season

Investing in the perfect outfit for one’s wedding can be costly, however with Hameedia’s three wedding packages which offer added value and discounts, grooms can spend wisely and still look their very best on the most important day of their lives. Groomsmen and wedding guests can also choose to invest in the packages, if they need high quality attire and mix of outfits to last them throughout the wedding season.
A total of three packages are available, and customers have to purchase a minimum of three suits and three shirts to be eligible for any discounts. Customers can make the most of these savings at any Hameedia and Signature showroom island-wide.
Additionally, all customers who opt for any of the packages will also be eligible to receive a Rs. 15 percent discount voucher and two redeemable vouchers which can be used by their best men.
Commenting on the offer, Fouzul Hameed – Managing Director, Hameedia, said: “Weddings are extremely important occasions and they mark the start of a significant journey. We want grooms to be able to look their very best and step out in style on the most important day of their lives, and our packages enable them to achieve that keeping affordability and cost-saving in mind. Weddings can be extremely expensive in their own right, so we hope that these offers will enable grooms to save on their ceremonial attire, without having to compromise on quality and style.”
Hameedia’s Ceremonial Collection feature an array of suits, tuxedos and formal wear in elegant colours and designs. Each suit has classic embellishments and can be tailored to suit a groom’s specific fit and preference. Hameedia’s Grooming Consultants are also available at all retail outlets island-wide to ensure that grooms receive the very best styling advice for their wedding day.
