Dusit  to outline ambitious growth strategy at ITB Berlin 2017

Bangkok-based hotel operator Dusit International is braced for its largest ever showing at this year’s ITB as it enters an unprecedented period of growth that will see its growth from 29 properties in eight countries to 69 properties in more than 20 countries in the next years.
Dusit International’s delegation is led by Chief Operating Officer Lim Boon Kwee, who says this year’s ITB Berlin held from March 8 to 12, offers the perfect opportunity for Dusit to showcase its latest products and development plans to the European market place.
“The last three years has been a time of steady growth for Dusit International as we looked to build our international presence beyond our traditional strongholds such as Thailand by entering into new markets in the USA, China and Kenya,” said  Boon Kwee.
“In order to further capitalise on the success and increased awareness of our core brands, Dusit Thani and dusitD2, we have dramatically ramped up our already impressive pipeline of new openings, with no less than 40 additional properties already confirmed over the next three to four years.
“These new openings will also see the company enter new markets in Turkey, Australia and sub-Saharan Africa while extending our presence in key markets such as China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
We very much look forward to discussing these developments with the attendees at ITB Berlin this year, at what is a very exciting period in our company’s development.” The group also has investments in Sri Lanka.
