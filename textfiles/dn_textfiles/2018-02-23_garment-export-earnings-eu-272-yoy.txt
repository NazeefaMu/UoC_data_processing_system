Garment export earnings to EU up by 27.2 % YoY

Sri Lanka’s external sector performance continued to improve in the month of December 2017, mainly with higher inflows to the Financial Account of the Balance of Payments (BOP).
Although earnings from exports increased at a higher rate, the increase in import expenditure resulted in widening the trade deficit in December 2017.
Continued inflows by way of tourist earnings and workers’ remittances, however, have contributed in curtailing the expanded trade deficit to a certain extent. Improvement in short-term and long-term capital inflows continued during the month. Reflecting the favourable developments in the external sector, the BOP recorded a surplus of US dollars 2,068 million in 2017, while gross official reserves of the country stood at US dollars 8.0 billion as at end 2017. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 2 per cent during 2017.
Earnings from exports surpassed US dollars 1 billion mark in December 2017 for the fifth time during the year and recorded a double-digit growth (year-on-year) for the sixth consecutive month.
Increased performance in industrial exports supported by textiles and garments largely contributed to this growth.
Recording the highest value for the year, earnings from textiles and garment exports continued to increase significantly in December 2017 with increased exports to the European Union (EU) following the restoration of the GSP+ facility in May 2017.
Earnings from garment exports to the EU increased by 27.2 per cent (year-on-year), while garment exports to the USA and other non-traditional markets increased by 18 per cent and 14.1 per cent, respectively, during December 2017.
Further, due to the combined effect of higher volumes and prices of bunker and aviation fuel, exports earnings of petroleum products increased significantly in December 2017.
Further, earnings from rubber products increased during the month mainly due to the export of tyres. In addition, export earnings from food, beverages and tobacco increased considerably in December 2017 owing to higher earnings from exports of vegetable, fruit and nuts preparations.Meanwhile, with the increase in the average export prices and volumes, earnings from tea increased in December 2017 favourably impacting agricultural exports. Earnings from seafood and minor agricultural products, particularly fruits and betel leaves also contributed towards the enhanced export earnings.
On a cumulative basis, export earnings recorded the historically highest value of US dollars 11.4 billion in 2017 mainly due to the notable increase in tea, textiles and garments, and petroleum products exports. In addition, spices and seafood exports also contributed towards the increase in exports during 2017. Nevertheless, earnings from gems, diamonds and jewellery, leather, travel goods and footwear and coconut declined during the year.
The leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka during 2017 were the USA (25.6 per cent), the UK (9.1 per cent), India (6.1 per cent), Germany (4.7 per cent) and Italy (4.7 per cent) accounting for about 50 per cent of total exports. Earnings from tourism and workers’ remittances were the main inflows to the external current account followed by the proceeds of merchandise exports. With December recording the highest number of tourists in a given month for the year 2017, earnings from tourism increased to US dollars 419.5 million1. Accounting for 51.2 per cent of total tourist arrivals for 2017, India, China, the UK, Germany and France continued to be the top five sources of tourist arrivals. For 2017, earnings from tourism are provisionally estimated to be an increase of 3.2 per cent to US dollars 3,631 million.
Workers’ remittances declined by 1.9 per cent to US dollars 671 million in December 2017. On a cumulative basis, inflows on account of workers’ remittances declined by 1.1 per cent year-on-year to US dollars 7,164 million2 in 2017 reflecting the geo-political uncertainties and the continuation of subdued economic performance in the major remittance generating destinations. Foreign investments to the government securities market witnessed a net inflow for the tenth consecutive month. Foreign investments in the CSE also recorded a net inflow for the month of December and for the year 2017. However, as repayment of foreign loans outweighed inflows, government long-term loans (net) recorded a year-on-year decline in the month of December as well as for the whole year 2017.
The gross official reserves of the country reached US dollars 8.0 billion (equivalent to 4.6 months of imports) by end 2017 compared to US dollars 6.0 billion recorded at end 2016. Total foreign assets, which include foreign assets of the banking sector, also increased to US dollars 10.4 billion (equivalent to 6.0 months of imports) as at end 2017 from US dollars 8.4 billion recorded as at end 2016.
