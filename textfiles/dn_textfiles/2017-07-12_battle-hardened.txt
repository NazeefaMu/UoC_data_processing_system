Battle-hardened

Passion for what he does and compassion for his fellow students are his defining attributes. Perfect Prefects talks to Trinity College Senior Prefect Rishane Madena who has learnt mental strength on the field of gladiators.
“I have been in the 1st XV Rugby team for three years now. I was also the captain of the Under 16 Rugby team. Since my younger days, I have had that leadership quality in me. My coach Lote Raikabula, a New Zealander, told us that he is not here to teach us Rugby but to make us gentlemen. During this one year I have learnt a lot through sports, more than what I have learnt in two or three years at school. He instilled a lot of cultures, a lot of tradition and a lot of qualities in our Rugby players. Mostly it was mental strength we learnt. And that was not only on the field.
Coach Lote taught us that if you are going through something bad, then you go into a dark place in your mental side. What he said was – enjoy that dark place. Don’t be reluctant to do anything in that dark place, because the day you become reluctant is the day you will fall apart. So enjoy the dark place and take it as a challenge. Every time I do something that is what I think of. Any problem that arises in school, I do not take it as a problem. I take it as a challenge,” explained Madena.
Trusted role
As a player on the field of Rugby, you play against another 15 men.
“As a team, we are a family. That is a culture that has been inculcated in us. I trust my teammates. We know our duties and roles. I can trust all 14 members to do their roles. According to that if I do not do my role it will fall apart. I focus on my role, and I see someone going off track, I will advise them,” said Madena.
Rugger players are like gladiators in battle.
“This sport we play is not easy. People compare Rugby to American Football and say that American Football is more dangerous. But in American Football, 80 percent of their bodies are covered in guards. This is not the case with Rugby players. In that sense, I would call us Gladiators. I am passionate about playing Rugby and even though I had suffered injuries -concussed and sustained gashes, had stitches and dislocated my shoulder, I strap myself and take some pain killers,” pointed out Madena.
Madena’s message to anyone who wants to become a leader is to stand for yourself.
“Be able to speak for yourself and be straightforward in what you say. People tend to use leaders as their own puppets. If you stand for yourself and if you are straightforward in what you say and you are confident and you stand by what you say, I think that is the best quality a leader could have,” stated Madena
Madena’s father was senior prefect in 1987 and his eldest brother was senior prefect in 2012.
“I get a lot of advice from them. They support me in a vast way. My mother also advises me. Any leader should be humble. He needs to adapt to all the situations. Being a Senior Prefect/Head Prefect, you have to be able to converse with all the students. Me, being the leader of the student body I should be able to converse with students, staff members as well as the administration. You have to have the ability to adapt to your situation and be able to converse with people in a way that it is appropriate. You need to be dedicated and committed to what you are doing by being the leader of over 3000 students. So we see to the welfare of the students as well,” added Madena.
Community feeling
Madena believes that proper values inculcated in the student will benefit the generations to come and that Trinity is a school that respects all four religions.
“When I look at the world I used to have a problem with racism. You still see people judging other people according to their religion. Being in a school where all four religions are respected, Trinity is a family and community and we do not have any grudges against any religion or race. If we can inculcate these values in our school, so can every other school. Then it will be good for the society in the future. And this will have a vast impact on generations to come,” informed Madena.
One big duty for him is to maintain the discipline of the school and see to the welfare of the students.
“As a Senior Prefect, some of the duties and responsibilities are looking to the welfare of all the 3,300 students. We as students, know all about the shortcomings of the school from our point of view. More than the administration or the staff realise it, we know how the students think. I and the prefect body being around school we see all the shortcomings and so we inform the administration. I personally am in the Principal’s office a lot talking everything about Trinity,” pointed out Madena
“Unlike other schools the senior prefect-ship is the term during our A/Ls. For example, in Royal, they start after their A/Ls. Our term starts in February to the next February. So that is during our A/Ls. So it is really tough balancing sports, studies and the Head Prefect-ship as well.
So yes it is a stressful situation so all of this is in my mind. But then again I love everything I do. I love to study. I have 16 other prefects in my Senior Prefect Body. They help me a lot and I delegate the work amongst them. I oversee everything. With their help, I am able to balance everything. They are a variety of students who are sportsmen and studious people. It is easy to delegate the work because of the talent at my disposal. In addition to the 16 Prefects and Madena there are 60 other school officers,” said Madena
At the beginning of this year, his ambition was to be a pilot.
“I have spoken to my parents and teachers and my counsellor, they all made me realise that Management and Tourism are the way to go for me. At the moment I am still focusing on my A/Ls and sports at the moment and the Head Prefect-ship as well. So after my A/Ls I will select the path good for me,” stated Madena.
