PC Secy. removed from post?

Secretary to the Police Commission Ariyadasa Cooray, had been notified officially yesterday, that he was removed from his post.
Cooray had said that the Commission informed him that he had been removed from the post as he was overage.
He said that based on a decision taken by the Police Commission, it was decided to remove Cooray from his post as his term had been expired. The Commission would take measures to appoint a new Secretary to the Police Commission shortly. This had been discussed by the Commission members and it is expected that the new appointment would take place during this week, according to internal sources.
When contacted, Ariyadasa Cooray said that he had been informed that he was being removed due to his age factor and that he would accept the Commission’s decision. He noted that his contract period had also ended and as such, he would accept this decision.
However, it so happens that the members of the Police Commission are all retired personnel.
Meanwhile, CAFFE and the Human Rights Centre issuing a statement, said the reasons that the Police Commission Secretary Ariyadasa Cooray, who was recruited on a contract basis, was removed because he had called for a report from the IG<U+200B>P <U+200B>regarding the conduct of the Police in the recent Digana and Theldeniya clashes.
The statement further noted that Cooray was being removed from this position as he had called for an independent investigation into the Theldeniya clashes and this move was to prevent that investigation, which drew unfavourable reactions from several prominent politicians.
