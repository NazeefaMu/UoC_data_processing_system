Teen inventor of generating electricity from waste water seeks help

Jittendran Jude Sajith of Mannar Sithyvinayagar Hindu College, a past student of St. Peters College, Colombo 4, participating at the International Conference of Young Scientists 2017, under the supervision of senior research scientist Dr. Gamini Piyadasa of the Sri Lanka Nano Technology Institute, invented a new efficient method of generating electricity from waste water that provides a solution to waste water treatment.
His research hypothesis states that he had increased the purification efficiency level by 16 percent and could generate electricity from one power plant per day that would supply electricity for the whole treatment process, and the surplus is sufficient enough to be distributed to 800 modern houses a day, estimating that each house consumes 55 units per month.
Sajith also stated that purifying the wastewater through the process that he recommends can completely reduce the Nano heavy metal particle contamination, where the traditional method of purifying waste water does not have a suitable and efficient method of purification.
He has introduced a new theory called 'The theory of electro negative interruption' and also relies under the existing Technology of Microbial Fuel cells.
Sajith's initial experiments which he conducted two years ago is that he has observed abnormal electricity generation from mud slug in lakes.
After long terms of statistical analysis and gathering information from the internet he came up with a solution stating that the electricity output was an effect of some biological action.
What he has found out after two years of research is that a certain rare bacterial species present in the soil is the reason for abnormal electricity secretion from mud, and also present in an existing technology called Microbial fuel cells.
Believing that he would come out with a solution, he further continued his research without quitting and as an outcome invented a method of generating electricity out of bacteria. Using the same bacteria, he modified the DNA of the bacteria enabling it to perform a heavy metal reduction process that would accelerate the electricity outcome and also through the modification of the DNA.
He stated that the antibiotic contaminant present in the waste water would be completely removed. When he presented his findings at local invention competitions, many including the jury panel stated that this cannot be true and the electricity outcome will be partial and would stop in a couple of hours.
Later he gained access to an advanced laboratory with incubation facilities which enabled him to prove that they were wrong about his theory.
His new control experiment made from a mobile phone charger out of 10 cups of organic lake mud that gave an output of 6 volts at 300m Ah made him charge a mobile phone and parallel connected to two leds which continuously worked for one month.
With that experiment he came to the conclusion that electricity production rate stopped leaving carbon credits in the soil, and then later designed a balanced chemical equation for the decomposition process taking place.
He has seen success in his research and is willing to expand his research to make perfection and implementation.
Sajith is in search of organisations and private parties to fund his project. He also requires recommendations to purchase his bacterial strain which is needed to complete his prototype construction..
