Ten model villages with  320 houses for K’gala

 Ten new model villages comprising 320 new model houses with basic facilities are being constructed in the Kurunegala District at present.
The construction work will be finalized within the next few months under the Housing and Construction Ministry.
Accordingly, low-income landless families will be given plots of land to build their houses. Each householder is provided a housing loan of Rs. 400,000. The loan interest per annum would be five percent. Rs. 160 million would be invested in this regard, said Deputy Minister Indika Bandaranayake.
“We are in the process of selecting needy families,” Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and Housing and Construction Deputy Minister Indika Bandaranayake told the Daily News.
