World Oral Health Day

Today (Tuesday, March 20) is World Oral Health Day. The day will be celebrated under the theme of
Say Ahh - Think mouth - Think health island wide with several programmes with the contribution of the Health Ministry, Education Ministry and Sri Lanka Dental Association. Over 190 countries will celebrate this day, Dental Surgeons said.
Addressing a media seminar held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday the organisers said that according to the statistics gathered in 2003, 65 percent of Sri Lankan children at the age of six have at least four decayed teeth while 40 percent of Sri Lankan children at the age of 12 have at least one decayed tooth.
The public should check the ingredients of the toothpaste they buy and buy only toothpaste that contain fluoride. Often Ayurvedic toothpaste brands do not contain fluoride.
Fluoride is essential to protect teeth. Sweets and junk food should be avoided and health food such as fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, cheese, yogurt etc should be taken in order to protect teeth, they said.
Deputy Director General (Dental Services) Dr. Sarath Amunugama said that Rs. 400 million has been allocated this year to provide facilities for state dental surgeries in the country and 77 more dental surgeons would be recruited shortly to the service.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has planned to attach one dental surgeon for each and every MOH division (around 341) in the country. They will be given all facilities including a vehicle to upgrade the country’s oral health.
At the moment, there are 1,496 dental surgeons in the country.
