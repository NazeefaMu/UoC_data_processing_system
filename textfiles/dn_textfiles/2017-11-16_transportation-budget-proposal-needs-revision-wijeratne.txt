Transportation budget proposal needs revision - Wijeratne

Lanka Private Bus Owners Association president Gemunu Wijeratne said the budget proposal need to be revised where transportation is concerned.
“Taxes on smaller vehicles have been lessened which is in itself a huge problem. This has led to congestion on the roads. Because of this 1 billion rupees are lost to the country per day. This further complicates the matter. We feel that these budget proposals need to be revised in relations to these matters. If this is not done the public transportation system cannot be developed,” Wijeratne said.
“The public transportation system is essential for the development of a country.There is no budget proposal at all when it comes to the development of the public transportation system. This is a serious problem,” Wijeratne said.
“Like the country’s Health and Education, the Public Transportation system is vital. We cannot give it step-motherly treatment. You cannot take the country forward, if it is not given due consideration. For the development of the Public Transportation, the basic facilities have to be developed. Once the issue of basic facilities have been addressed and the budget proposals have been revised, then we can address the issue of congestion in the country,” Wijeratne added.
