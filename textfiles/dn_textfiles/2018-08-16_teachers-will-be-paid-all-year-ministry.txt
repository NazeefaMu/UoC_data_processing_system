Teachers will be paid all year - Ministry

Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi denied website reports that teachers would not be paid salaries during school vacations.
The Secretary said it is a baseless, fabricated allegation since the Education Ministry had never taken such a decision.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam issuing a statement on this issue mentioned that legal action will be taken against persons behind these fabricated stories appearing in websites. The Education Ministry will lodge a complaint with the police today seeking a thorough investigation into the case.
