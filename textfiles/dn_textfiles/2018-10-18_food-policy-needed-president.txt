Food policy needed - President

President Maithripala Sirisena said it is important to implement a state policy regarding the production, security, quality and standards of food.
The President was speaking at the World Food Day ceremony at the BMICH on Tuesday.
World Food Day is celebrated on October 16 to commemorate the establishment of the World Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) by the United Nations. It is celebrated under the theme ‘Our Actions – Our Future 2030’.
President Sirisena said with the long history of food production as an agriculture-based country, we are a nation self-sufficient in food. Yet, one-third of crops are destroyed by animals. Due to the drought resulting from severe climatic conditions and floods, crops are often destroyed.
To ensure food security, a regular programme should be implemented, said the President.
President Sirisena also said he was grateful for the contribution made by the United Nations FAO in Sri Lanka. The students who were winners of the competitions held for World Food Day were also presented awards by the President. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, Deputy Minister Faizer Kasim, FAO Director Brenda Brandon, FAO representative in Sri Lanka, Nina Brandstrup, and other local and foreign officials were present at the event.
