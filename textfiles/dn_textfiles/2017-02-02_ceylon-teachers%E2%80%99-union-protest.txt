Ceylon Teachers’ Union protest

The Ceylon Teachers’ Union yesterday expressed its objection to the appointment of an Army Colonel for the post of Director of Health, Physical Education and Sports at the Education Ministry. Its Secretary Joseph Stalin stated a joint trade union action would be organised collectively by all teachers and principals if this was not reversed. “This post belongs to Grade I in Education Administration. It was during the previous regime, Army officials were appointed to posts of civil administration via Cabinet Papers disregarding the service constitution. This Government which came to power criticizing those acts is doing the same now,” he alleged.
