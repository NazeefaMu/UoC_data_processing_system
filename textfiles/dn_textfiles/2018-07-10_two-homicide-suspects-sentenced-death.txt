Two homicide suspects sentenced to death

Galle High Court Judge Manjula Thilakarathne imposed capital punishment on two of nine suspects involved in a homicide case, in which a person had been hacked to death.
Punchihewage Sirilal and Hettiarachchige Sunil were thus sentenced to death. The other suspects were acquitted due to insufficient evidence to incriminate them of the crime.
The victim, Samaraweera Arachchige Priyantha, was killed at Hiyare in Akmeemana. State Counsel K. V. Indika prosecuted.
