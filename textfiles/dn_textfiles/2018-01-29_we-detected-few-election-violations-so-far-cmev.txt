The Centre For Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) has not have to record incidents of serious election violations as they did during the previous regime, CMEV Co-Convenor Dr. Paikiyasithy Saravanamuttu yesterday said.

He said that there have been incidents but not of the nature and extend that were recorded in the past. So far the CMEV is glad on the situation, he said.
Saravanamuttu said that though the situation was not worse there were some sad and unfortunate incidents recorded in the case of some female candidates. He added that the CMEV has observed that there are acts of intimidation of threats, insults as well as campaign against female candidates even via the social media.
He strongly urged the authorities to take appropriate measures to protect and strengthen the integrity of the electoral process.
The CMEV said a viral videos disseminated through social media, containing insults and hate speech against female candidates in the elections.
“According to the video footage a cleric known as Niyaz Maulavi is responsible for vitriolic and inflammatory criticism of women’s involvement in politics and includes his use of profanities in this regard. He has released degrading statements tarnishing the reputation of female candidates thereby indicating that his objective is their withdrawal from the elections. Female candidates from the Puttlam district, the Northern and Eastern Provinces are targets. The cleric claims to be a member of the Jamiuththowheed also known as Thowheed Jamath,” he said.
Consequent to the sentiments aroused by these videos, on January 19, an office of a female candidate in the area was set on fire. CMEV National Organiser Manjua Gajanayake said that those statements were totally against the Constitution.
He said a surprise raid was carried out on January 15 against a SLMC female candidate C A Rinuza Ilma’s office based on a baseless complaint made to 119. He added that Renuka Damayanthi, an independent candidate for Wellawaya, was hospitalised as she sustained injuries in a conflict between supporters.
