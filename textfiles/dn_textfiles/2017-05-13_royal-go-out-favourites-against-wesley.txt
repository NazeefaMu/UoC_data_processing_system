Royal go out favourites against Wesley

Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league rugby :
Royal College will go out favourites against Wesley College in their Singer ‘A’ Division inter- schools league rugby game at Royal Sports Complex at Reid Avenue today commencing 4.15pm.
The forte of the Royal side has been their power-packed forwards and they should come up with another blockbuster display through their now famous rolling maul. The Reid Avenue boys played a superb game against Zahira in their last game at Maradana, where they simply demolished their opponents winning 65-14.
Royal will have to come up with a similar performance if they hope to overcome the double blues with a bonus point victory for them to get a step closer to clinching this year’s Singer inter-schools league rugby title.
Meanwhile the unpredictable Wesley lads who turned tables on St. Peter’s last week at Longden Place and beat the defending league runners-up S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia in the first round game, will try their level best to create a shock victory against the formidable Royalists at their own den at Reid Avenue.
St.Joseph’s v S. Thomas’
The eagerly awaited second round confrontation between defending league runners-up S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia and formidable St. Joseph's College Maradana for the Lady Jayathilake Shield should turn out to be a thriller.
A mammoth crowd is expected at Mount Lavinia today at 4:15 pm to witness this grand game between these two schools in their inter-schools league rugby tournament.
Today's match should turn out to be a battle between speedy three quarters of both schools. Meanwhile St. Joseph’s has given a terrific display throughout the season in the loose and probably should maintain their supremacy in today’s game as well to pull a surprise victory.
St. Peter’s v Zahira
St.Peter’s College Bambalapitiya who scored a remarkable 15-13 win against Trinity College at Bambalapitiya will go all out to overcome unpredictable Zahira College Maradana in their Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league rugby match at Zahira grounds. Maradana today. Kick-off is at 4.15pm.
Going by the performance of both schools another terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected. Zahira will be a dejected lot as their play maker cum fly half Zaid Sinhawansa who missed the last game against Royal will once again miss his services as he is recovering from dengue.
The Peterites who lost a hard fought game 14-26 against Wesley in their last match will strive hard to turn things around and it won't be a surprise if they emerge victorious.
