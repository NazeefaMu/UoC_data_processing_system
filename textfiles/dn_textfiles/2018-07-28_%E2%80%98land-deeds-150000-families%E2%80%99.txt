‘Land deeds for 150,000 families’

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will grant 150,000 families land deeds before long and another 1.6 million families thereafter, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone to construct a housing scheme at Meenachchi Kanda, Darga Town, Beruwala recently.
Minister Senaratne said 1.3 million families had no land deeds in 2002 and then government dissolved before giving deeds. Now the number has increased up to 1.6 million, the Minister said.
Houses will be constructed within six months for 18 families. The Chinese Government had granted Rs. 48,000 million and homeless families each will get Rs. 1 million to construct a house, the Minister said.
