Pitt speaks out on his divorce

Brad Pitt graces the cover of GQ Style magazine’s latest issue. Talking to the magazine, Pitt compared his split from Angelina Jolie to “a death”, admitting that he is an emotional “retard” whose heavy drinking helped ruin his marriage. The actor said, “I hit the lottery and I still would waste my time on those hollow pursuits,” reports DailyMail.co.uk.
“I worry about it more for my kids, who are being subjected to it. It’s just very, very jarring for them to suddenly have their family ripped apart. Our focus is that everyone comes out stronger and better — there is no other outcome,” he said.
On quitting drinking, the actor said, “I was boozing too much. It’s just become a problem. And I’m really happy it’s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I’ve got my feelings in my fingertips again. Truthfully, I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional.
I was good. I don’t want to live that way anymore,” it was reported on JustJared.com.
Talking about this phase he’s in, Pitt added, “For me this period has really been about looking at my weaknesses and failures and owning my side of the street.”
