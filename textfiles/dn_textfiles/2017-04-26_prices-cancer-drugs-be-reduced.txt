Prices of cancer drugs to be reduced

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had informed the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) to make arrangements to reduce the prices of cancer drugs and heart stents, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Minister Dr. Senaratne had stated that he was not ready to manage the health service according to the requirements of the drug companies. A blacklisted drug company is spreading fabricated facts to the media to mislead the public.
The Health Ministry introduced new rules and regulations to prevent corruption and malpractices involved in tender process. Special rules and regulations have been introduced for the drug companies connected to malpractices. Some drug companies are annoyed due to the steps taken to halt corruption, the minister stated.
Consultant Oncologists had sat in the tender board and Health Ministry Additional Secretary Dr. R.R.M.R.Siyambalagoda confirmed it. Arrangements have been made to supply cancer drugs to cancer patients without any interruption, the minister had added.
