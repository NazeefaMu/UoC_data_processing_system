Govt. respects Rule of Law -Ganeshan

Minister Mano Ganesan speaking to the media at the Treasury Bond Commission said the government is acting in compliance with the Rule of Law of the country. He requested the public to compare how the previous government acted with regards to law and proper procedure unlike the present government.
“What did they do? They went ahead and fired the then Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranaike. They even went on to cut the power and water supply to her official residence,” Minister Ganesan said.
Minister Ganesan said, “That time has changed now. The appearance of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe today at the Treasury Bond Commission marks the kind of change we are introducing to this country. We want all the people to notice this change.
The rest of the matter will be taken care of by legal authorities.”
