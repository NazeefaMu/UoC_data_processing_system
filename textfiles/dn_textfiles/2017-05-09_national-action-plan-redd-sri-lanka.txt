National Action Plan for REDD+ in Sri Lanka

Climate change and loss of biodiversity are two of the main challenges facing global communities and ecosystems, today. Changes in land use resulting from deforestation and forest degradation is estimated to make a net contribution of about 12 percent to global emissions of greenhouse gases. It is a significant contributor to anthropogenic or human-induced climate change. On the other hand, land use changes through conversion of natural forests to agricultural land and built up areas also leads to loss or fragmentation of natural habitats and hence to a rapid decline in biodiversity on a global scale. .
Two global-level policy commitments have been designed in recent times to address these issues of loss of biodiversity and climate change. The first of these is the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity: it encompasses the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, for the period 2011-2020. The second, popularly known as UN-REDD+ programme, includes:
a) the emerging mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus (REDD), b) the conservation of forest carbon stocks,
c) sustainable management of forests, and
d) enhancement of forest carbon (REDD+).
These chart a new course in the global effort to combat climate change. The central aim of the UNFCCC Paris agreement of 2015 is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change. It attempts to achieve this by keeping global temperature rise in this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels (1850-1900 base line) and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further. The Agreement also aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.
Sri Lanka has already responded in 2016 to develop a national strategy for biodiversity conservation in the form of a National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan (NBSAP) for the period 2016-2022. The corresponding National REDD+ Investment Framework and Action Plan (NRIFAP) prepared with support from the Sri Lanka UN REDD programme for a period of five years (2018 – 2023) with wide stakeholder participation is to be submitted to the Government of Sri Lanka on the May 9, 2017 for acceptance.
What is REDD+ ?
The mechanism to achieve REDD+ identifies five major activities to be carried out in developing countries. Remuneration for this is a results-based payment. These five activities are as follows:
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation
Reducing emissions from forest degradation, Conservation of forest carbon stocks, Sustainable management of forests and Enhancement of forest carbon stocks.
Over the years, REDD+ has evolved as a global climate change mitigation mechanism. Its main objective is to support policies and measures that reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from forests, and increase carbon uptake by forests. The finances for this will be given as results-based payments to developing countries. REDD+ programme aims to shift particularly, the economic engines of growth in developing countries such as infrastructure development, unsustainable agriculture and natural resource exploitation towards more low-carbon and inclusive pathways. In 2013, REDD+ developed a comprehensive package of decisions (under the Warsaw Framework) to help countries implement REDD+. This package includes the following activities: development of national strategies or action plans; development of national forest monitoring systems; establishing forest reference emission levels; measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems; social and environmental safeguards; and finally, recognize the need to address the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in order to achieve emissions reduction. The National REDD+ Investment Framework and Action Plan (NRIFAP) is the Sri Lankan response to this latest global effort of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon stocks.
Globally, REDD+ activities are to be carried out in the forestry sector, which includes natural forests, forest plantations, urban and peri-urban wooded areas, tree-lined avenues, parklands and agroforests, to arrest further degradation and deforestation and restore tree cover while safeguarding social and environmental (including biodiversity) values characteristic of these ecosystems.
Nexus between climate change and tropical forests:
Climate change scientists have shown that tropical forests maintain high rates of evapo-transpiration leading to decrease in surface air temperature and increase precipitation, compared with those of pasturelands. Therefore, large scale conversion of tropical forests could influence the global water cycle and carbon cycle through their impacts on temperature and rainfall.
Most recently these scientists report that the changes in the global water cycle due to warming over the 21st century will not be uniform throughout the planet. The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions.
In Sri Lanka too, this is emerging to be similar, in spite of the fact that it is a smaller continental island.
The future actions on tropical forests which may exacerbate global warming through decreases in evaporative cooling and releases in CO2 (changing from a net sink to source of CO2) leading to forest die-back.
The interrelatedness of climate change science, climate impacts on ecosystems, and climate change mitigation policy requires that these be studied together in an interdisciplinary framework to craft strong science in the service of humankind.
Link between REDD+ and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
The SDGs, also known as Global Goals, are part of the 2030 United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development that aim to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
The SDGs are the successor to the Millennium Development Goals (2000 – 2015). There are 17 SDGs. They are intended to guide the pursuit of prosperity and human well-being, while protecting the environment, for the next 15 years.
Two of the SDGs are most compatible with REDD+ objectives of “reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries.” These include SDG 13 (related to climate change mitigation) and SDG 15 (forest conservation). Other SDGs deal with water, poverty and even responsible production and consumption, which can promote co-benefits in REDD+. In summary, REDD+ provides a viable, internationally accredited means of implementing certain SDG targets.
Forestry sector in Sri Lanka:
The current extent of natural forest cover in Sri Lanka is about 1.95 million hectares or 29.7 percent of the total land area of the island. However, the most bio diverse regions and the major watersheds of the island, viz., lowland rain forests, lower montane forests and montane forests collectively cover only 3 percent of the island’s land area. Natural forests in the seasonally dry region of the country cover nearly 17 percent of the island’s land area. In addition, there are 429,484 hectares of open and sparse forests which are mostly regenerating degraded forests covering 6.5 percent of the island distributed mostly in the dry and intermediate zones of the country.
The major drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in Sri Lanka were identified during the REDD+ programme, they are:
i) encroachments for agriculture, settlements, mining and shrimp farming,
ii) infrastructure development projects such as construction of highways, harbours, airports and development of tourism facilities,
iii) private commercial agricultural ventures and
iv) other unspecified localized small-scale activities. The forest cover change as a result of these drivers is estimated to be about 8,088 hectares per year during the period between 2000 and 2010.
The Forestry Sector Master Plan:
The last occasion a national level forestry sector management programme to address deforestation drivers prevalent at the time was during the preparation of ‘Sri Lanka Forestry Sector Master Plan’ in 1995. It was meant to provide a comprehensive long-term (1995-2020) development framework for the forestry sector guided by the National Forestry Policy of 1995. Master planning, or any other sectoral planning, should be regarded as a dynamic, rolling, and sufficiently long-term process reacting to both actual and expected changes, whether socio-economic, environmental or political. Much water has flown under the bridge since this Forestry Master Plan was prepared and the time is more than ripe to assess the current situation in the forestry sector to set new targets in implementing the Nation’s Forestry Policy of 1995 in the face of emerging threats of climate change and loss of biodiversity. Therefore, the time is opportune to update the existing forestry sector plan through NRIFAP.
Vanaropa, Punarudaya, Haritha Lanka and A Blue-Green Era:
Sri Lanka has acknowledged the role of the forestry sector as a key climate change mitigation strategy. Several national level programmes such as ‘Vana Ropa’ - to increase forest cover from the current 29.7 percent to 32 percent by planting about 150,000 hectares of new forests in three years, and programmes such as Punarudaya (Renaissance), Haritha (Green) Lanka and Sri Lanka Next – ‘A Blue-Green Era’ to create a sustainable environment are among the main national level commitments towards REDD+ activities.
The Sri Lanka UN REDD programme is supporting the Government in developing a vision for REDD+ that forms a part of the national approach to improving the overall effectiveness of the country’s forest and land management regimes. This has been achieved through a thorough consultative process involving a wide range of stakeholders.
National REDD+ Investment Framework and Action Plan (NRIFAP) in Sri Lanka
The Sri Lanka’s national REDD+ strategy and action plan (NRIFAP) documents the actions condensed from a wide range of proposals made by a broad spectrum of stakeholders in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It has identified 13 specific ‘Policies and Measures’ (PAMs) to address the identified drivers of forest cover change that detailed out the mechanisms to co-ordinate their implementation.
These PAMs have been developed through a highly consultative process among academics, researchers, technical practitioners, business leaders, civil society interest groups and policy makers. The 13 PAMs and the specific actions proposed for implementation of each PAM are categorised under three priority policy areas,
Forest, wildlife and watershed.
These PAMs are particularly focused on strengthening law enforcement, forest boundary demarcation, restoration of degraded areas, sustainable management of natural forests and forest plantations to ensure overall effectiveness in forest management, taking also in to consideration the ecosystem services they render. This group of PAMs has the potential to contribute to the highest emission reduction and removal, as well as significant opportunities to deliver a wide range of non-carbon benefits which are especially relevant in the Sri Lankan context.
Land use planning
The PAMs in this group focus on the broader aspects of sustainable land management. They are expected to provide enabling actions for implementation of other PAMs which are more directly aimed at generating emission reductions and/or removals.
Other forest lands
This group of PAMs deal with forest lands outside the purview of the Forest Department and the Department of Wildlife Conservation. They focus on both reducing the risk of conversion of these ‘other forests’ to alternative land uses and concurrently increasing the timber and fuel wood supply in them to reduce pressure on forests that are to be sustainably managed by the Forest Department.
Actions proposed under most PAMs require research inputs which open up a number of opportunities for the Academic and Research community to get involved in, preferably in a collaborative, inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional manner. For example, restoration of degraded forest areas in different climatic zones with suitable local species needs long-term engagement of the academic and research community, along with other stakeholders, in selecting a range of native species that would be suitable to match the sites available for planting. Similarly, there are many opportunities for the academic and research community with expertise and interest to be involved in sustainable forest and plantation management. The PAM on strengthening the protection of at least 4,000 ha of critical forested watersheds and riverine forests by restoring and improving their ecological service functions need involvement of scientists having different research backgrounds such as ecology, hydrology, soil science, sociology and also natural resource economics.
In Sri Lanka, the expertise of the scientific and research community need to be mobilised in addressing climate change, its negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as estimation of the economic loss due to these negative impacts. Thereby, policy makers can take decisions on verifiable scientific and economic research findings. At present, forests in general are considered as areas with no apparent economic value unless they are converted to agricultural lands, human settlements or other infrastructural developmental sites. Most of the services forests provide are not directly understood. Forests do provide a multitude of ecosystem services such as provisioning of fresh water, clean air, cultural and educational services; ameliorating the environment, regulating floods, controlling soil erosion and landslides, cycling of nutrients, providing habitats for pollinators and pest control organisms that increase agricultural yields, etc. So far these have been taken for granted or we have not been aware of them. The real monetary value of forests has been ignored in the economic decision making process. Losing these services will result in costly alternatives that can be economically valued.
Nations throughout the world are now increasingly recognizing the economic value of their natural capital and are developing methodologies to demonstrate the economic value of nature to make them more visible and appreciated, and thereby to capture their value in their national economy and policies.
Integrated Research on Ecosystem Valuation
Having realized the need for capacity building on the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity, the Academic and Research Forum of the Sri Lanka UN REDD programme organized an International Research Symposium titled “Economic valuation of forest ecosystems and their services” as a part of the International Conference on Climate Change organized by ‘Sri Lanka Next in the Blue-Green Era’ on the 18th October 2016. The main objective of the symposium was to bring the latest developments in valuing ecosystems and their services to the forefront in Sri Lanka, using the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB, 2010) methodology. A set of recommendations, including a capacity development drive across all stakeholders on recognizing and appreciating the valuable services ecosystems provide and their economic valuation has been submitted to the relevant decision makers.
Follow-up training workshops for researchers were held to demonstrate the use of one of these more recently developed research tools, viz., InVEST software for estimating the economic values of selected ecosystem services. An inter-disciplinary research group that included natural resource scientists, social anthropologists and resource economists worked together to learn from each other and share their experiences in the different disciplines. This effort is still at its infancy, but a foundation has been laid to initiate the valuation of Sri Lanka’s natural ecosystems and landscapes.
We hope that the research opportunities offered by these nationally important environmental programmes will be taken up by a wider forum of academics and researchers to provide the scientific underpinning to facilitate a level playing field in decision making, in relation to exploitation of natural resources associated with the rapid development drive in the country.
