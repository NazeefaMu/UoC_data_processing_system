Mahagastotta Festival of Speed on April 8-9

The roaring sounds of powerful engines will be heard when the best drivers and riders of the country will be seen in action during one of the most prestigious events in the Sri Lankan racing calendar, the 83rd Mahagastotta Hill Climb on April 8 and 9. The event is conducted by the Ceylon Motor Sports Club.
Adding colour to the festive season in ‘Little England’, the historic hill climb takes place on a track with a picturesque background in the Nuwara Eliya estate which is considered as the birthplace of motorsports in Sri Lanka.
The very first Mahagastotta Hill Climb was conducted back in 1934 by a group of expatriate planters and few locals and is marked in history as the first motor sport event in Sri Lanka.
This year, the hill climb will see bikers in action on April 8 from 8 am to 12 noon. A classic car parade will start from Nuwara Eliya town and will reach Mahagastotta and then each car will drive up the hill.
On the following day, a host of accomplished drivers will be in a race against the clock, under all national classes.
Popular names at this year’s Mahagastotta Hill Climb will include Rohan De Silva, Darin Weerasinghe, Nishan Weerasooriya, Dinesh Jayawardana, Ushan Perera, Ashan Silva and Shafraz Junaid who will make attempts to better the course record in their cars. Meanwhile, Ananda Sampath and Shafraz Junaid will be among the top contenders to try the same on their bikes.
Entries for the event are available at the club office at 2A, Hunupitiya Road Colombo 2 or can be received via email [email protected]
