Sri Sambuddhaloka Buddhist Centre to be developed

The Sri Sambuddhaloka Buddhist Centre located in Minuwangoda, Bulugamulla, is to be developed into an International Buddhist Centre to offer a helping hand for Buddhists monks in the region to learn and practice Buddhism and other associated disciplines.
The project is being carried out under the patronage of Ven. Nedagamuwe Wijayamithree Thera and Ven. Minuwangoda Gnawasa Thera. Currently, there are novices from Myanmar and Nepal residing and studying in the English Medium Institute of the Centre. Up to now, it has provided accommodation and education to about 10 international students from Europe, America, China, Taiwan and South Africa. They were happy that they could obtain a firsthand experience on the monastic life and Buddhist meditation at the Centre. Novices from India and Tibet have also established contacts with the Centre. The Centre opened a Dhamma Books Library recently and Sumaga and Negena Hiru youth societies played a key role in that regard.
The temple organizes a Dhamma discussion on the last Sunday of every month. The Centre has taken a special interest in reviving the Pali language and it teaches the Pali and English languages to its novices to enable them to refer and learn the books of Tripitaka.
