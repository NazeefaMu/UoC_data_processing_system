Common gardening mistakes to avoid

Every gardener who has ever planted, pruned, or watered a plant has at some time in their life done it the wrong. Making mistakes is just part of being human. The trick is learning from each mistake, so unlike our government, you don't keep doing the same dumb thing over and over again.
Overwatering Your Plant
Result: The plant turns yellow, drops leaves, rots, or simply croaks.
Giving a plant too much water kills it faster than giving it too little. Although most plants prefer moist soil, they don't like soggy, poorly drained soil. Waterlogged soil keeps roots from functioning properly. Because of this, overwatered plants may wilt on a sunny day from too much water, not too little. To lessen your chances of overwatering, keep track of what you water, so you don't water the same plant 3 times a day. Separate plants that need lots of water from those that need just a little. Before you water, stick your finger about an inch deep into the soil near the base of the base to see if the soil is moist or dry.
Planting Too Deeply
Result: The plant's roots smother and the plant slowly dies.
Roots need air to breathe. They can't get it when they're buried 6 feet under. So when you plant a tree or shrub, make sure that the top of the root ball is slightly higher than the surrounding soil. To keep air from drying out the root ball, cover the top with and inch or so of mulch.
Overfertilizing
Result: Your plant grows too fast, refuses to bloom or fruit, becomes susceptible to disease, and may suffer fertilizer burn. Excess nutrients pollute ground water and streams.
Fertilizer is not "plant food." Fertilizer contains chemicals that enable leaves to make food from sunshine. Plants growing in fertile soil that contains lots of organic matter do not need frequent fertilization. Plants that are dormant or suffering from drought need no fertilizer at all.
Buy fertilizers formulated for your types of plants and apply at the rates specified on the label. Choose organic, slow-release fertilizers that work slowly over months at a time and actually improve the soil by adding organic matter.
Not Reading the Label
Result: Impending disaster.
Yeah, reading labels is boring stuff, but it's also essential, lest you exterminate your plants, pets, and yourself. Weed-killers won't kill bugs and bug-killers won't kill leaf spot, but both products could kill you if you don't use them properly.
So read the directions carefully. They'll tell you how much product to use, how and when to apply, what plants to use it on, and what pests it controls. And don't ever think if one tablespoon works great, two tablespoons work even better. The result is usually the opposite.
Pruning Flowering Trees and Shrubs at the Wrong Time
Result: No blooms.
Some plants make flower buds on new growth. Others make buds on growth from the previous year. Pruning at the wrong time removes flower buds - hence, no blooms.
So here's a simple rule - prune trees and shrubs that bloom from winter through May (azalea, camellia, forsythia, quince, oakleaf hydrangea, spirea, redbud, flowering cherry) in late spring or early summer. This gives them time to make new flower buds for next year. Prune those that bloom after May (crepe myrtle, chaste tree, rose-of-Sharon, butterfly bush, peegee hydrangea, gardenia, pomegranate) in late winter or early spring.
Planting Shade Trees Between the Sidewalk and Curb
Result: Tree roots lift and break the sidewalk.
Growing roots have incredible power and can easily crack concrete. This is guaranteed to happen if the space between your sidewalk and curb in less than 6 feet and you plant shade trees that grow big and have roots near the surface. Examples - Southern magnolia, oaks, maples, bald cypress, sycamore, sweet gum, and tulip poplar. Plant smaller, ornamental trees instead - crepe myrtle, redbud, dogwood, flowering cherry, crabapple, and orchid tree.
Buying Plants with Bugs on Them
Result: You bring home bugs that spread to your other plants. Know how most people get bugs on their houseplants, flowers, and shrubs? When they buy the plants, they buy the bugs too. Garden centers and greenhouses are perfect places for bugs to multiply, because plants are so close together. Plus, they're sprayed so often that pests become resistant.
So thoroughly inspect any plant before you put it in your car. Pay special attention to flowers, flower buds, new foliage, and the undersides of leaves. Shake the plant to see if any bug flies off. If you find bugs, leave the plant there. -Garden.com
