Tearful Stanley ends drought with PGA National playoff win

POTOMAC, Sunday: Kyle Stanley wiped away tears while pondering five years of struggle and doubt that ended Sunday with his playoff victory over fellow American Charles Howell to win the PGA National.
After both fired four-under par 66s at TPC Potomac to stand atop the leaderboard after 72 holes on seven-under 273, Stanley parred the first extra hole to capture his second PGA crown, the first coming 135 starts ago at the 2012 Phoenix Open.
“There was some doubt there for a little bit,” Stanley said. “It’s no fun. You question whether you are ever going to make it back.” Tears trickled down his cheek. His voice cracked, then halted, as he spoke, seeking the right words to sum up his perseverance to sustain his career the past few seasons.
“I wish I didn’t cry so much,” Stanley said. “It just feels so good to put the work in and see the rewards. I think that’s where most of the emotion is coming from.” In the dramatic playoff on the par-4 18th hole, Stanley was in the right rough off the tee in the playoff but found the greenside rough, chipped to four feet and made the putt after Howell had missed his par bid. “I’m thrilled,” Stanley said. “It’s very special to get a second win... I knew it was just a matter of time.” Howell, coming off a 10-week layoff with a fractured rib, has not won in 293 PGA starts since taking a playoff over Phil Mickelson at Riviera in 2007. “I’m a bit shocked,” Howell said. “I can’t believe how well I played. I started hitting balls eight or nine days ago.
