Tsunami-Affected Areas Rebuilding Project
Norochcholai housing scheme remains desolate

Tsunami victims of the Akkaraipattu area had requested authorities to provide them with the Norachcholai housing scheme.
About 500 houses were built with the assistance of the Saudi Arabian Government for Tsunami victims at Norachcholai in the Akkaraipattu Divisional Secretariat Division in 2009, under the Tsunami-Affected Areas Rebuilding Project.
But the houses had so far not been allocated to affected persons and are currently left unattended.
