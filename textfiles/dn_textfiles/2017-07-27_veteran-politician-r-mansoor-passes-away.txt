Veteran politician  A. R. Mansoor passes away

Veteran politician of the East and former minister and Ambassador to Kuwait A. R. Mansoor passed away at a private nursing home in Colombo on Tuesday. He was 84 years old.
“The passing of former UNP Minister is an irreparable loss to the Muslim community of the East in particular and to the country in general,” City Planning and Water Supply Minister and leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Rauff Hakeem stated in a message of condolence.
Minister Hakeem added that Mansoor, in his long and unblemished political career spanning two decades, contributed greatly to the socio-economic well-being of the people of the Kalmunai electorate whom he represented. He was admired and respected not only by the Muslims but also by the Sinhalese and Tamils, the minister stated.
“Although he entered politics through a different political party to represent his people, he later supported the SLMC, fully endorsing the policies of SLMC's founder-leader M. H. M. Ashraff and worked indomitably and tirelessly for the community,” the minister added.
Mansoor was elected to the Kalmunai Electorate in 1977. He served as the District Minister for Mullaithivu. Late Mansooor was appointed as Trade and Shipping Minister. Thereafter, in 1990, he was appointed Trade and Commerce Minister by the then President R. Premadasa.
Mansoor was instrumental in the development of the South Eastern University where he managed to obtain a large sum of money from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.
He is also a renowned lawyer and was felicitated by the Kalmunai Bar Association for completing 50 years at the Bar in 2010.
He leaves behind wife Zohara Mansoor, two daughters and son.
His Janasa burial was held at Kalmunai burial grounds.
