SLTB workers donate money to Salawa Army Camp explosion victims

Employees of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) have contributed an amount exceeding Rs. 12.2 million from their salaries for the welfare of their colleagues affected by flood and explosion in the Salawa Army Camp in 2016 and 2017.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva addressing the gathering at a ceremony held in Colombo yesterday to donate the money for the workers affected by the flood and explosion in the Salawa Army camp said that workers of the SLTB who made these sacrifices are an example to others.
“We have also donated Rs.14 million for workers affected by natural disasters in 2016. So far, 1042 employees have been given a total sum of Rs. 20 million. As far as I know, this type of generosity has not been seen at any other government institution. The employees of the SLTB have a compassion on humanity and I am proud of them, “the Minister said.
