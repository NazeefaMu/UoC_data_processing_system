Former Petroleum Industries Deputy Minister Sarana Gunawardena who pleaded guilty to two corruption cases filed against him by the Bribery Commission was today ordered to pay a fine of Rs.2,000 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate. 
This is the second instance that a Sri Lankan politician was convicted over an offence that comes under the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed two corruption cases at the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against former Deputy Minister Sarana Gunawardena over the non-declaration of assets and liabilities while he was serving as the Chairman of National Lotteries Board between 2006 and 2007. 
According to Assets and Liabilities Law, the Court has jurisdiction to impose a fine of Rs.1,000 or one year jail term for a person who found guilty to the charges.
Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara  imposed a fine of Rs.1,000 each on two cases and observed that the accused will have to serve a two-month-jail term if paying the fine is defaulted. 
At a previous occasion, former Deputy Minister Sarana Gunawardena, through his lawyer Anil Silva PC, informed Chief Magistrate that he was pleading guilty in two corruption cases. 
The Bribery Commission alleged that Sarana Gunawardena had failed to declare his assets and liabilities for a period of two years since 2006 to 2007 while he was serving as the National Lotteries Board Chairman.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed charges against the former Deputy Minister at the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court under Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975.
Counsel Diana Kodituwakku appeared for the Bribery Commission.
President’s Counsel Anil Silva with Dhanaraj Samarakoon appeared for the accused.
On April 6, 2017, former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva pleaded guilty in three corruption cases filed against him by the Bribery Commission and was ordered to pay a fine of Rs.3,000 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
