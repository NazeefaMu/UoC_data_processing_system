The Boundary-breakers in the Catholic Church

Practically all the Religious Congregations in the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka emphasise the mystical dimension and are involved in charitable works in Sri Lanka. Integration of the prophetic dimension and commitment to social justice and eco-justice is not much visible publicly in these Congregations. However, there are a few individuals within these Congregations who are committed to the prophetic ministry because they possess an integrated biblical spirituality.
They reach out to the unreached, touch the untouched and try to create awareness about human dignity, promote socio-economic development, bring social esteem and facilitate social integration. In the words of Pope Blessed Paul V1, "they are enterprising and their apostolate is often marked by an originality, by a genius that demands admiration. Often they are found at the outposts of the mission, and they take the greatest of risks for their health and their lives" (E.N 69).
There are people within the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka and in the larger society who feel oppressed, victimized and helpless. They are struggling to survive as human beings with dignity due to poverty. There are groups that suffer social exclusion because they are prevented in some regions / dioceses in Sri Lanka from experiencing social equality due to caste system and poverty. Sr. Sandra Schneiders, IHM, professor of New Testament Studies and Christian Spirituality at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley, California asks: "Are Religious a general ecclesiastical "work force" to be deployed by the hierarchy according to institutional needs or are they called to respond to particular, actual challenges in a variety of particular places and settings among particular groups and people of all kinds (some of whom are rejected by the religious institution itself) whose needs cry out for ministerial attention? The theology of "charism" in relation to Religious life itself and the variety of Congregations, suggests the latter."
What is our perception? Are the Religious as Consecrated persons and Congregations as collective Bodies in Sri Lanka giving social significance and legitimation to dehumanizing systems and situations by their silence, past-oriented directives or other external factors? Or are the individual Religious as Spirit-filled persons and their Congregations in Sri Lanka very attentive and responsive to the above-mentioned painful oppressive situations not only as individuals but also inter-Congregationally? Or are
they waiting for natural and people-made disasters to happen for such collaborative efforts? Pope Francis in his Apostolic Letter on the occasion of the Year of Consecrated life says: "I also hope for a growth in communion between the members of different Institutes.....This would make for a more effective prophetic witness."
Jesus, the Boundary-breaking prophet
One of the most striking prophetic symbolic actions of Jesus was crossing social and religious boundaries by his open table fellowship with the excluded ones by subverting the purity laws of Israel. Jesus who was Spirit-filled was a boundary-breaking prophet.
He broke the Sabbath in order to help the people in need (e.g, Mk 3: 1-6 Let us remember God of Exodus through His Word and Spirit is present in a special way where life is threatened and de-humanised and asks people to choose life (Deut. 30:19).
He continues to rescue people from oppression and leads them to freedom and fuller life by the instrumentality of "new Moses" who respond to Him.
The prophetic ministry of the Religious (men and women)in the Catholic Church embodies three dimensions, namely the call to resist through non-violent means the evil of victimization of people by oppressive forces and systems, the promotion of human dignity and the empowerment of the poor so that they can experience unity, social equality and also abundant life.
