The Coca Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) to provide Rs. 150 million for environmental restoration work in Kelani River.

According to a press release sent by the CEA yesterday, the Coca Cola Company has agreed to pay Rs.50 million each for three years for the above project “considering its policy for corporate social responsibility and its commitment of contributing to environmental protection and social concerns”.
The MOU was signed between CEA Chairman Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri and Coca- Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd Chairman Mr. Asoka Wickramasinghe December last year to acquire and utilize the funds.
The CEA said in its release that it intends to utilise the funds “with the intention of controlling future disasters and damages to the Kelani river water quality”.
