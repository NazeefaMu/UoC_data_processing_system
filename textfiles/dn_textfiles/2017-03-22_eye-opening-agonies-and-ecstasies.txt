Eye-opening agonies and ecstasies

If I remember correct, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru once said that history of a country is nothing but the changing aspects of the humans who live in it. On writing his most celebrated work, The Discovery of India, Nehru depends more on his own memorable moments gone through in the understanding of the changing aspects of India, which he knew intimately and affectionately.
It was Sir Winston Churchill who said that history is nothing but a series of events and trends as jotted down by those who traced them. The American poet and biographer noted that history is a seris of human biographies. All these go to the understanding of what hisotyr means to us today. All subject areas are linked to history of a country.
The history of a particular country is as such written and studied in various points of view. The work of the writer cum poet S B Karalliyadda titled in Sinhala as ‘Man Naya Na’ (I am not indebted) reached me at a time when I was busy collecting material fo the changing nature of the man in a given context.
Karalliyedda who has written four books in Sinhala and one book in English, all dead on the aspects of history of Sri Lanka. They basically centre round the Kandyan kingdm and bout kings who ruled from time to time. In chapter 27, in varying forms of narration of reminiscences with personal experiences ranging from childhood days nad far back as 1940s, the period of first war in the country.
This reaches a climax as he traces the passage of time devoted to his multi-faceted activities culminating in late 1980s, as a dedicated public servant cum political figure who contests a seat, winning with a big majority. The writer traces initially his family background where he is being influenced by his scholarly father who was also a friend of the scholar and anthropologist Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy. With the good background of education, S B Karalliyedde gets the opportunity to be a discerning government servant who is fearless and energetic although he changes his social positions from time to time in keeping with the public services needs, he whose keen sense of integrity needed for public relationships and administration.
The narrator states that he was swayed by narrow political pressures that come as social hindrances. Instead, he via his learnings under wilful administration and scholars gain the circumstantial wisdom known to the oriental scholars as ‘stanochita pragna’. He too goes to the extent of showing how some of the trips abroad had widened his skills in public relationships. In the manner, quite a number of human episodes are laid down.
While being engaged in activities related to public administrative factions, Karaliyedd shows a keen interest in religious studies and folklore studies. Both subject areas have provided him to be a creative writer as well in his own way. As suh from time to time, he had composed several poems.
In the area f religious studies he seems to believe in the right actions which eventually lead to one’s misery or happiness. He rescues himself from the pangs of disaster at times as a result of his good actions. Then he denotes as karma or the actions, which should be understood from various perspectives.
Karalliyedda has been working in various clerical and administrative positions ranging from teaching in a provincial school, to health service, up from there to World Health Organisation and agrarian services.
Transferring from the Health Sector he he had been engaged in Defence Ministry of Rehabilitation Services. As a sensitive observer of social events, he had jotted down macabre and gruesome events of the two main uprisings in the country in 1970s and late 1980s. He rereads some of the death threats he had had received. But he had a firm belief in his interest as a spiritualist. This has paved the way for his sanctity.
While in China, once he had seen how a certain dinner table had been arranged with non-vegetarian dishes which some others relished while he had been plainly aloof from others, which had eventually added the vision of being in groups with likes and dislikes understood well, via his background learning.
Mention too is made of some significant profiles whom he associated. They include such persons as Venerable Dimbulagala THera, Minister Gamini Disanayaka, Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Denzil Kobbekadua. The work of Karalliyadda is well written and readable. Needless to say, the work as a whole is a study in positive thinking.
