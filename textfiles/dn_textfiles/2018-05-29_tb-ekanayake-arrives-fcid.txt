T.B. Ekanayake arrives at FCID

 
Former State Minister of Lands T. B. Ekanayake was summoned by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) to record a statement.
The FCID alleged him to have been involved in misusing state vehicles during his tenure as the State Minister of Cultural Affairs.
He was notified to appear before the FCID last Friday but the date was re-fixed for today after the State Minister informed that he was unable to appear before the FCID since it was a Parliamentary seating day.
