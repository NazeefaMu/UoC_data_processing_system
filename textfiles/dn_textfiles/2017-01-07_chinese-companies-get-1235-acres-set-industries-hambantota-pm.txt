Chinese companies to get 1,235 acres to set up industries in Hambantota: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that 1,235 acres is to be allocated for Chinese companies to set up industries in Hambantota under the first agreement which is in force. He said the land will be allocated for these companies under the first agreement signed by the two governments.
The Prime Minister was addressing a meeting at Walawa Jayawardenaramaya in Ambalantota yesterday night. Members of the Maha Sangha were also present.
The Premier added that second and third agreements between the two nations are in the negotiation phase while 15,000 acres are to be allocated for the setting of industries under these agreements.
He said Minister Sagala Ratnayaka and former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa will identify 15,000 acres of land in the district to be used for the proposed Industrial Zone.
“I will not get involved in this process. The lands are obtained from the area earmarked by them. If they say that the district does not have land to be allocated for the purpose, we will acquire lands from adjacent districts such as Hambantota, Ratnapura and Moneragala,” he said.
He said he can do nothing if people in Hambantota do not want to experience development.
