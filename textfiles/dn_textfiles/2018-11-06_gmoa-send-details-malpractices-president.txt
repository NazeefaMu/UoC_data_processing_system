Former Health Minister
GMOA to send details of malpractices to President

We will forward the complaint to President Maithripala Sirisena which was forwarded to the GMOA by staff of the State Pharmaceutics Corporation (SPC) in connection with Rs. 70 million loss due to malpractice in the tender procedure.
The President should arrange the funeral of the former Health Minister’s political journey to save the country and people from him, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Speaking at a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the written evidence will be forwarded to the President. Investigation should be conducted to find out who obtained the commission.
A Presidential Commission is needed to investigate all acts of corruption and malpractice of the former Health Minister. The GMOA receives a large number of complaints daily. All complaints will be forwarded to the President with written evidence.
GMOA Assistance Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said the ticks are now disturbed knowing that the dog will die soon.
This is why a male nurse and another hold press conferences and try their best to save the former Health Minister.
The vacancies of the Health Minister and Health Secretary should be filled immediately. The President can do it properly because he knows the subject very well.
Dr. De Zoysa said that according to Facebook, the former Health Minister will be added to Sri Lankan history as the first ever Sri Lankan Cabinet Minister who paid money to the government to obtain a ministerial post.
A minister who does not create factions among health staff and does not try to implement private agendas should not be appointed.
The GMOA neither makes nor breaks governments, but since 1926, has given leadership to the people during issues and will continue to do so, he said.
