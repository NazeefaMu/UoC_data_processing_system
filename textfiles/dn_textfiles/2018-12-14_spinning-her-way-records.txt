Spinning her way to the records

An indoor skydiving enthusiast in Australia set a Guinness World Record by doing splits and spinning for a full minute.
Doni Gales, 23, was named the record holder for most front split spins in a wind tunnel in one minute after she completed 55 rotations in 60 seconds at iFLY Down Under in Penrith, New South Wales.
Gales, who has been working as an iFly instructor for the past nine months, nearly doubled the number of spins required by Guinness to create the new record.
“Our Chief Instructor at the Penrith tunnel has one of the records for the most head down spins, he taught me so I thought that the fact that he had a record was awesome and it made me want to go for it,” Gales told The Western Weekender newspaper.
Gales said dancing since the age of 3 helped prepare her for the rigors of indoor skydiving.
“I really like flying because there are so many different possibilities, having that dancing and gymnastic background, you can be really creative and experimental with how you use the wind and how that pushes your body around,” she said.
“I really fell in love with it and just kept working on it, when I came home on vacation I would train in the Penrith tunnel and do as much time as possible, now as an instructor I just want to spread that love of flight,” Gales said.
