Emblem  of bliss

Sakyamuni Gautama the Sambuddha Samma
Brought into focus the priceless sublime Dhamma
Esala signifies the conception of Bosat Siddhartha
Who later became the Perfect one the Thathagatha
On Esala full moon day
Queen Mahamaya had an unusual dream
A baby elephant encircling her with no scream
On Esala full moon day
When Gods reminded, arose from Thusitha heaven
Ten months later the couple was blessed with a son
He mastered all arts and grew up as a royal prince
Married Yasodara and lived happily ever since
Despite fathers precautions, emergence of portends four
Made Bosat embark on his blissful sansaric tour
On Esala full moon day
Giving up luxury, comfort of royal life
Leaving Rahula in the warmth of his wife
At midnight he left the royal palace
The actual event of Renunciation took place
On Esala full moon day
He continued all forms of self Mortification
And achieved Buddhahood through deep meditation
Two months after his supreme enlightenment
He delivered to five ascetics his sermon first
On Esala full moon day
They were determined not to take any notice
But it was not possible, they stood up right at once
The Buddha requested listen carefully my friends
You have not yet reached the end
On Esala full moon day
He delivered his first sermon in Deer Park
Hoping to relieve the humanity from the dark
There he set the Wheel of Dhamma in motion
To put them across the Sansaric ocean
On Esala full moon day
His first sermon was at Migadaye Isipatana
It is none other than “Sutta Dhamma Chakka Pavattana”
Devas saluted and worshipped, Sadu, Sadu
Earth was amazed Budures radiated
Ven. Kodanna became the first Arahat
Buddha, Dhamma and now Sangha are the topmost
Universe now blessed with Triple Gem in Buddhist arena
Was a great historic event in Buddha Sasana
On Esala full moon day
This is of great significance for another reason
Because this marked the beginning of the Vas Season
First Vassana was observed by Buddha and his disciples
Which tradition is continued to date on principle
On Esala full moon day
In Thusitha heaven in the 7th year of Buddhahood
With Abhi Dhamma Mathru Diyaraja was honoured
To Sri Lanka this Poya bears special importance
Because a series of events connected to sasana took place
On Esala full moon day
Most precious-Lanka was blessed with Tooth Relic sacred
Brought by Dantha and Hemamala with meththa devoid of hatred
The most venerated Tooth Relic and its exposition
Was followed by the first ever Dalada procession
On Esala full moon day
To this day tradition down the years continue
That Kandy Perahera is held in this Holy venue
This tradition continues with pomp and grandeur
When Buddhists islandwide celebrate it August every year
On Esala full moon day
Yet another with alien rule, in Vinaya and discipline
In Sangha there was an alarming decline
Saranankara Ven. Thera the most erudite
Effected a great Religious Revival with far sight
On Esala full moon day
Ven. Thera not only set up pure ordination
But also we owe trim the Triple Gem and its preservation
He passed away in Kandy in 1778
On Esala full moon day
Rupa Banduwardena
