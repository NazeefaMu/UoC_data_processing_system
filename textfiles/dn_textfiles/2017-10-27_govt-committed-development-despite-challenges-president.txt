Govt committed to development despite challenges: President

Members of the Sri Lankan community in Qatar said they are pleased with the proper direction towards which Sri Lanka is marching under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, who is a simple and humble leader.
They expressed these sentiments when President Maithripala Sirisena who is on a two-day State visit to Qatar met the Sri Lankan community in Doha on October 25 afternoon.
President Sirisena was warmly received by the Sri Lankan community working in various sectors in Qatar. Addressing the gathering, President Maithripala Sirisena said the present government is committed to build a prosperous and virtuous country irrespective of the challenges and obstructions confronted by it.
Referring to the false publicity carried out in the internet and certain social media websites due to the democratic and free environment established in the country, the President said Sri Lanka is a much different place to what they see in the internet and certain social media websites.
Although new technology was invented for the betterment of humankind, certain groups misusing it were trying to distort the true image of the motherland, he said.
The President said the government had created a quality political environment in the country today and several social and economic transformations were underway under the Good Governance concept.
The President also created awareness among the Sri Lankan community on the false publicity carried out by a certain group within the country about the Constitutional Reform process.
Referring to his State visit to Qatar, the President said the new agreements signed by the two countries would further strengthen economic, trade and technological ties. The President also commended all Sri Lankans engaged in various sectors in the Middle East for the honour they have brought to their motherland.
