The essential quality  of human rights

During the course of last week, the issue of human rights became one of the most debated discourses within the country. This heated exchange of ideas about human rights arose as a result of two controversial statements made by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith at Delgoda Kaluboda Sri Saranankara Dhamma School and at the Ekala St Mathew Roman Catholic Church.
At the Delgoda Kaluboda Dhamma School, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said that “within Sri Lanka, an environment is building up where religious intolerance has come to the forefront. Buddhism has always been the backbone of this country and people have believed in the Buddhist faith from a long time in the past. By protecting the Buddhist philosophy, rights of all the people belonging to different ethnicities will be protected. Things which negatively affect religions are seeping into the social context. So we must work towards removing such negative elements and protect our religious environment. The declaration of human rights was created in the 20th Century. But we had a much more developed socio-cultural ethos in this country way prior to that. So, we do not need to think about human rights in an extraordinary way”.
During the Mass held at the Ekala St. Mathew Church, the Right Reverend Cardinal stated the following. “Today, human rights have become a religion in the West. Human rights came about in the recent past. Earlier, there was nothing called human rights. But despite that, people lived inhumane ways respecting each other. Now, people are preaching about human rights as if it is a modern fashionable invention.
In Europe, it is like wearing a coat. When they want and when it is beneficial for them they subscribe to the faith. When they feel that they have to give something, they remove it. This same situation is spreading in this country.
Some people talk about an atheistic society and state that if we have food, clothes and other perks it is enough and we do not need anything else. We could see the same situation in the early Sinhalese society. They used to say eat, drink and make merry. Even if one dies tomorrow after making merry today it will be a solace. If we properly follow a religion there is no need for human rights. Human rights are embedded in the religions we follow. What else? So, my dear brothers and sisters, we should not get caught in this fallacy and myth. We have to think intelligently (This report was taken from the report published in the Lankadeepa newspaper published on 25/09/2018, p. 10).
These two statements made by the Cardinal obviously sent shock waves among human rights activists in the country. Mangla Samaraweera, the Minister for Media and Finance responded to this quite strongly and said that these ideas expressed by the Cardinal cannot be accepted. The minister further stated that human rights became essential in order to protect the lives of those who did not subscribe to Catholicism as they were subject to various forms of torture and were even killed as a result of the crusades.
Catholic Social Doctrine
The minister by stating this tried to explain that Catholicism was one major reason as to why human rights came to the forefront in political, legal and social domains. Bertie Ranaweerage, keeping a note on Facebook stated that most of the religions were spread and promoted in the world through the use of swords, arms and bribes and therefore, those who engage in religious activities are against the notion of human rights.
One of the most logical statements made with regard to the statements made by the Cardinal was made by Wishwamithra Bandusiri in an article titled “Enough is enough, Archbishop, did you come to this world to give evidence to the truth or to go “shopping” for somebody”? In this article Bandusiri states that “the Catholic social doctrine is the main element taught by Catholicism. But that is hidden and kept away from lay Catholics like us living in this country. As long as it is hidden, it will be easy for authoritative governments to maintain their power. That is why the Church always tries to hide this very important doctrine. The base of the Catholic Social Doctrine is the teachings of the Bible.
The notion that the human being is created by God, the strong bond between humans and god as a result of this creation, the strong notion that God always takes the side of marginalized groups for their liberation and finally the notion that god eventually took the form of a human being and came to this world and re-established human dignity are the premises on which the Catholic Social Doctrine is built up. Human dignity, bringing the society and the family together for the common good, human rights and duties, sacrifice everything for the poor, workers rights and dignity in workplaces, solidarity and preserving the environment are part and partial of that doctrine. Therefore, human rights and human dignity are directly related to the teachings of Catholicism. It becomes clear that human rights are embedded in the Bible but the Church has made them be absent so that it will allow authoritarian rulers to continue their rule without a hindrance.
These arguments made against the Cardinal’s statements will be understood by different people in different ways and they can be criticized in various ways. Some people see Minister Mangala Samaraweera’s statement as one which was made against the Catholic Church and the Cardinal. Some, as usual, gave it political undertones and stated that this shows the current government’s resentment towards the Catholic Church. By stating such the obvious attempt by the anti-government factions are to sway the Catholic voter base away from the government. But eventually, these rhetorical arguments relegated the reality behind human rights to the background which is obviously wrong.
Despite various politically and religiously loaded statements made by various people, there is no way that human rights can be relegated to a secondary position as human rights showcase the importance of humanity. This essential quality was gained by the people after waging a long battle against three main inhuman forces.
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Authoritarian governments, the functioning of the Catholic Church in the middle ages and its authoritative religious rule and the exploitation unleashed by capitalism with the advent of modernism over the poor were those three inhuman things. Human rights, therefore, were not gifted to the people by the ruling elites or the high priests of the Catholic Church or by the capitalists after seeing the status of the poor. They were won by people after fiercely fought battles which shed blood.
As stated above, the basis of human rights is humanity. As Morris Cantrin shows, “human rights are a universal ethical right. This should apply equally to all women and men at all times and unless the principle of fairness seriously impinges, it should not be taken away from people and it belongs to humans as a result of being human”. So human rights are built on universal ethical principles and are essential for the humane physical existence of humankind. It applies to everybody regardless of sex and is built on humans. It is universal and it applies to everybody uniformly and it cannot be infringed and if infringed it will be a serious violation.
The United Nations assembly on December 10, 1948 brought about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights based on this. The United Nations firmly believed that this will bring about a system of rights which will be universal in application to bring about freedom, equality and peace. These rights cannot be impinged upon in any way and protect the dignity of human life and provide it with much-required security and solace.
Therefore, it becomes clear that human rights are essential in order to develop humanity and lead peaceful and complete lives. These rights apply to those who subscribe to religion and atheists alike. In a conflict-ridden world over various political, social, economic and religious reasons, the only tool which can suppress these and bring human beings to coexist peacefully are human rights. Those who stand up against human rights then are standing up against this ideology. So, ultimately, if somebody is against these universal ideas, that person should be regarded as an enemy of the human society.
