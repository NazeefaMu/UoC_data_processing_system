Only Council appointed: PM
Responding to a question by UPFA MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena regarding the establishment of the National Executive Council, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that a national executive council was not established and only a council was appointed to take decisions with regard to the implementation of the 100 days programme.
"Civil Society Organisations which worked together for the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena formed a council for the implementation of the 100 day programme and that committee was named as the National Executive Council. It was a volunteer committee and Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera was also a member of that council," the Prime Minister said.
He said there was freedom to give any name to an organisation.
Apart from the UNP working committee, the UNP also has a National Executive Council. But all these councils remain outside Parliament, the Prime Minister said.
"There is an opposition that has been accepted by the Speaker and at the same time a group of MPs claims that they are representing the joint opposition. That could happen because they have freedom to name it as a joint opposition," he added.
When Abeywardena claimed that the National Executive Council as a murderers' organisation, the Prime Minister questioned whether he accept that his party leader, President Sirisena who is the chairman of the murderers' organisation as a murderer.
"We are very well aware about who are the real murderers. We should pay our gratitude to the President for the effort taken by him to put an end to the era of murderers," the Prime Minister said.

Proposed trade agreement between India and Sri Lanka: Anura wants debate in House
Since there is a serious debate in the country about the proposed trade agreement between India and Sri Lanka, it should be submitted to Parliament for debate and approval before it is implemented, DNA MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament on Saturday.

Amendments introduced respecting public view: Wijeyadasa
Condemning the criticisms by various groups claiming that the amendments brought to the budget 2016, reflects the incompetency of the government, Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe told Parliament on Saturday that the government brought several amendments to budget 2016 by respecting public view and the democracy.
He also said that the way of holding budget debates in the Sri Lankan Parliament is an outdated tradition and emphasised the necessity of holding pre-budgetary debates to get public opinions prior to the preparation of budget proposals.
"I proposed the previous regime several times to establish an independent budgetary office and a data bank within Parliament premises, enabling Members of Parliament as well as the public to get any data in any field. The then government was not able to do that," the minister said.
"During the previous regimes what we experienced was the Finance Minister presenting the budget proposals to Parliament, then holding debates while the budgets were finally passed without any changes.
But this normal process had changed this time and various amendments were brought to the Budget 2016, by considering the proposals and criticisms of people's representatives," he said.
"Some argued whether Budget 2016 was the Prime Minister's, the President's or the Finance Minister's budget. But I must say that this is a people's budget and not anybody else's budget," he added.
