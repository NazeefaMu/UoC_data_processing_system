Galle Face Hotel hosts power breakfast with Irshad “The White Tiger” Sayed

Iconic Grande Dame, the Galle Face Hotel recently hosted a Power Breakfast event with Irshad “The White Tiger” Sayed, South African national kickboxing champion, two time Muay Thai world champion and mixed martial arts champion.
Born in Cape Town, South Africa, Irshad left his hometown when he was 17 years old and relocated to Thailand to follow his passion for kickboxing. He is currently based in New Zealand, and signed with EFC Worldwide: Extreme Fighting Championship.
Irshad addressed a gathering of fitness enthusiasts, coaches, nutritionists, and motivational speakers at the event. He spoke about his kickboxing career, the strength and commitment it took him to reach this level of success and how we can apply this learning to our daily lives, whether we are in a fighting cage, or a boardroom.
“There are parallels which can be drawn between sporting, business and reaching success. I find that sharing my experiences about following my passion, working hard, overcoming fear and making sacrifices are all relatable to the people I meet from around the world. It brings me joy to have these conversations with people and hopefully motivate them to go after their goals,” Irshad Sayed said.
Irshad’s visit is one of many events the Galle Face Hotel plans to host as it strengthens its position as a unique lifestyle brand that provides a balance of curated modernity amidst its rich culture and heritage. -CC
