Hambantota seaport employees on fast unto death

Two employees out of a large number of employees who staged a fast unto death campaign opposite the administration complex of the Hambantota seaport were hospitalized yesterday.
The seaport employees, who were discontinued from work, had been staging a fast unto death campaign for several days.
They said they made representations to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and had staged protest campaigns earlier on several occasions but the authorities turned a blind eye to their woes.
They said that it was after these protests that they staged a fast unto death campaign.
They accused the SLPA for terminating their services after the Magampura seaport was leased to a Chinese firm. They said they will continue the fast until they are reinstated.
