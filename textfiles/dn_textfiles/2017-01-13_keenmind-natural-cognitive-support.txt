KeenMind for natural cognitive support

Ceyoka, among the country’s premier conglomerates, offers KeenMind, (Bacopamonnieri extract CDRI 08), a natural nutraceutical for optimal cognitive support.
KeenMind’s ability to help improve mental performance makes it suitable for mature adults who are seeking to prevent age-related memory decline and looking to maintain a healthy memory and cognitive function. KeenMind can also assist students by supporting memory, concentration and learning retention.
Its anxiolytic and stress adaptation properties give the added advantage of calm focus. This can be particularly beneficial during times when mental clarity and performance are compromised by stress or mild anxiety, for example during exam times.
