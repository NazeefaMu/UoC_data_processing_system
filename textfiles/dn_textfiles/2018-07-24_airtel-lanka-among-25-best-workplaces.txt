Airtel Lanka among 25 Best Workplaces

Airtel Lanka was recognized as one of the 25 Best Workplaces in Sri Lanka, at Best Workplaces Awards Ceremony recently held by Great Place to Work® Institute at the Hilton Colombo.
Airtel earned this credential based on the feedback provided by its employees in an anonymous survey conducted by Great Place to Work® in Sri Lanka.
Jinesh Hegde, Airtel Lanka CEO/ MD, said, “Technology, customer requirements and markets are bound to change in a digitally transforming era; however, if we invest in our people that is something we can always count on. The Airtel team is great to work with and they are responsible as much as the management for making Airtel Lanka a great place to work.”
“We applaud Airtel for seeking employees’ feedback as well as the opportunity to certify and recognize itself,” said Kshanika Ratnayake, CEO of Great Place to Work® in Sri Lanka.
“These ratings measure its capacity to earn its own employees’ trust and create a great workplace - critical metrics that anyone considering working for or doing business with Airtel Lanka should take into account as an indicator of high performance.”
