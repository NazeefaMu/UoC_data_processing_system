GMOA informs House details of impact on new Inland Revenue Bill

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has written to all Parliamentarians educating them on the new Inland Revenue Bill to be presented in Parliament, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the letter contained all details on the impact of the new Bill. The letter described the adverse impact on doctors and all the other professionals.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the new Bill would abolish all tax reliefs granted from the previous Act and new taxes would be imposed, while increasing the existing taxes to extremely high levels, putting an adverse impact on the professionals. Passing the Bill without a wide social dialogue would create more issues.
All professionals would leave the country and obtain foreign citizenship as a result of the new Act. Strangely, there is no impact whatsoever on foreign professionals who come to Sri Lanka to work, he added.
