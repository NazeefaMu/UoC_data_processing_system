Strict disciplinary  action for prison officers’ misdeeds - Minister

Prisons officers will be interdicted for misdeeds, said Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Minister D.M. Swaminathan, at the discussion with officials at his ministry yesterday.
Minister Swaminathan directed relevant officials in this regard in order to create the necessary atmosphere to establish a proper service by decreasing the irregularities existing in the Prisons Department.
The minister directed the relevant sections to take measures to interdict prison officers following a proper investigation, if any corruption, deception or irregularity was committed by an officer, and to take legal action to punish the offending prison officers.
It was informed that if prison officers are assaulting or ill-treating any prison inmate or family member of an inmate, using official powers, anyone can visit the ministry and meet the minister or officers of the minister’s staff to make a complaint in that regard.
He further stated that under the programme of regulating and formalising a prisons system, there will be no hesitation to take legal action against anyone who commits misdeeds and a strong disciplinary system for the officers will be implemented.
Further, the ministry will be open on all five weekdays to receive complaints of injustices of prison officers.
