Govt. aims to achieve prosperous, happy citizenry: Minister Ranawaka

The aim of the government is to achieve a happy citizenry of an economically prosperous and socially equitable nation, living with perfect harmony with the natural environment, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, yesterday.
He said the government is working towards this dream that can be realized in the foreseeable future. He added that the Western Megapolis is simply a grand plan to develop the entire Western Province as a single Megapolis to achieve the status of a high income, developed nation by 2030.
He made these observations yesterday, delivering the keynote address at the opening ceremony of the four-day FIDIC-ASPAC Conference 2018, held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
The minister said leading American scholar Robert D. Kaplan in his book titled “The Monsoon” said that the world stage is well-set for the re-emergence of the ‘Monsoon Asia’ as the global economic powerhouse as well as the geopolitical theatre of action.
The minister said as Sri Lanka is in the middle of the region, it has a potential for a Megapolis in South Asia. The government has a vision to make the Western Megapolis one of the top 10 most livable cities in Asia.
The minister said the guiding philosophy of development is holistic and inclusive and based on economic growth and prosperity, social equity, environmental sustainability and individual happiness.
“To reach this level of development, we have to achieve 10 key objectives nationally,” Minister Ranawaka said. “They include, achieving a Per Capita GDP level of High Income, Developed Country by 2030, to establish and institutionalize the digital infrastructure necessary for a well-interconnected, well instrumented and intelligent smart city, enabling the transformation of the national economy into a predominantly knowledge-based, innovation-driven economy, to achieve self sufficiency in energy food and pharmaceuticals by 2030 and to achieve 100 percent green energy beyond 2030,” he said
