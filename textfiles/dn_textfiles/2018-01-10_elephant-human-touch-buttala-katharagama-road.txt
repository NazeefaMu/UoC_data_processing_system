Elephant - human touch on Buttala Katharagama road

The human touch is an important part of the life of elephants that infest on either sides of Buttala Katharagama road.
Since the road users feed them frequently, the elephants seek eatables from the moving vehicles sometimes causing panic in certain passengers. However, due to the tame nature of these elephants most passengers in moving vehicles stop by to offer eatables to them.
Picture shows a Safari driver offering some eatables to a herd of elephants.
