President to Ministry Secretaries:
‘Work must go on’

President Maithripala Sirisena directed heads of government departments and institutions to continue public services efficiently according to plans and projected targets without allowing it to get weakened at any time.
The President issued this directive at a special discussion attended by Ministry Sectaries, Chief Secretaries and other heads of department held at the Presidential Secretariat on November 17 morning.
The President who noted that the current political problems would be settled in due course said it was the duty of all public servants to carry out public services with strength until then.
The President who expressed the hope that all public servants would carry out their duties in a fair, just and impartial manner, said he was happy to note that no complaint had been received in this respect against any public official so far.
When several Ministry Secretaries informed the President about certain problems which had cropped up with regard to Ministry duties, he asked them to carry out their duties in future as per instructions given by him.
The President who stressed the importance of carrying out essential services including that of ports, petroleum, health and food supplies without disruption, said unless proper decisions are taken today the country would face problems in another three to four months.
The President who requested public servants to pay attention towards implementing major public sector development programmes including the Gramashakthi people’s movement added that he had instructed governors to supervise those matters.
The President said the country was today receiving adequate rainfall after a four-year drought and requested public servants to dedicate their efforts to ensuring the success of agricultural programmes including the national food production drive by considering the rains as a blessing.
The progress of financial matters in respect of Miniseries and district development programmes were also reviewed at this meeting and the President said problems highlighted would be discussed at length and instructions would be issued to Ministry Secretaries thereafter.
