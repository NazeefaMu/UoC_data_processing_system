Murray edges clear at PGA Tour’s Texas Open

Grayson Murray fired a five-under-par 67 to claim a one-shot lead after the first round of the Valero Texas Open in San Antonio on Thursday.
The 24-year-old from North Carolina, chasing only his second career win on the PGA Tour, edged clear of the field thanks to some long putting and solid iron play on the par-72 TPC San Antonio Oaks course.
The American got off to a dream start, opening with back-to-back birdies on his first two holes before a superb chip from the fairway gave him a birdie tap-in on the fifth to move to three under. His round threatened to come apart on the par-three seventh, when he needed three shots to get onto the green before two-putting for a double-bogey five.
However Murray came storming back on the back nine, draining a 28-foot putt on the 11th for a birdie and then sinking another long putt on the 13th to move back to three under. AFP
