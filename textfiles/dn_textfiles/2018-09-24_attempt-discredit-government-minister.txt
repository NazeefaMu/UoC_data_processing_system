News of couple consuming only Murunga leaves
Attempt to discredit Government - Minister

Women's Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said the news that circulated a few days ago about a couple who lived for some days consuming only Murunga leaves as they did not have anything to eat, is a fabricated news aiming to discredit the Government.
Minister Bandara said so while addressing the media after visiting the couple's house.
It has now been revealed that the couple had received all welfare benefits including the Samudhi given by the government and that the story was an attempt to discredit the government.
The minister visited the couple on the advice of President Maithripala Sirisena, who paid special attention to this issue.
She told the media that measures will be taken to construct a new house for the couple by the Government.
