Hong Kong rejects asylum for Lankan refugees who sheltered Edward Snowden

The Hong Kong lawyer for a group of refugees who sheltered former NSA contractor Edward Snowden four years ago says the southern Chinese city’s immigration department has rejected their asylum requests.
Robert Tibbo on Monday said immigration officials denied applications by the four adults and three children, in what he said is “retaliation for helping Snowden”.
The applicants are from the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Snowden hid in Hong Kong for two weeks in June, 2013, after he leaked documents revealing extensive US government surveillance. His whereabouts were a mystery during the time.
