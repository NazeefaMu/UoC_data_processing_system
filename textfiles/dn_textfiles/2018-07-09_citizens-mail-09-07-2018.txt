Take action for Vijayakala
Former Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran’s political speech is vehemently rejected by all democratic politicians and all citizens of our country.
As a state minister she should have paid her attention for the sake of future generation. Prabhakaran for the past 30 years had ruined this country, making communal struggle.
Therefore take immediate legal action against this former minister. All the members of this parliament have been sworn in the presence of President of this country for the people on their solidarity. Therefore Vijayakala’s remark should legally be solved not by politicians.
