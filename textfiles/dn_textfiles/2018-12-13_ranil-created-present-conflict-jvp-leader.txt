Ranil created present conflict - JVP leader

The present political conflict was triggered by the Wickremesinghe led government that shifted away from the people without addressing their common aspirations, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.  He also said that the way Ranil Wickremesinghe acted in the post of Prime Minister contributed much for this alienation.
While claiming JVP’s fullest support to defeat the present political coup, Dissanayake observed that whoever takes over the position of the Prime Minister is not relevant to them. “The Prime Minister post will be held by a person from either of the main camps. Whoever that person would be, we are sure that person cannot do much for the betterment of this country. That person will not be able to come up with a plan to initiate a good political culture or a good economic policy for this country. We do not have faith in any person from either of these camps. When it comes to Ranil Wickremesinghe, we hold the same position that we held in last April when a No Confidence Motion was brought against him,” Dissanayake said.
“When a new government was formed in 2015, there was a specialty in it. The power was not centered upon one particular party. Several fractions held the power. But unfortunately, one fraction, a group of persons and a single authority started to claim power. A governing party is responsible for doing the right thing. They are also responsible to make sure not to do the wrong thing as well. Wickremesinghe is responsible for doing such things that a government is not supposed to be doing,” Dissanayake also said.
Dissanayake made these observations as a motion expressing confidence in Ranil Wickremesinghe was moved in Parliament yesterday. Dissanayake said the motion expressing confidence in Wickremesinghe is totally irrelevant to the JVP. “Friendliness or hostility shown to us by some parties in this given situation does not matter to us in anyway.” he added.
Further speaking Dissanayake said, “We hold President Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa responsible for this whole drama of a coup. But who created this situation? Let me assure that we are in no way justifying this political coup. It is wrong and we are against it and we will do everything in our power to defeat it. That does not mean we are ready to help Ranil Wickremesinghe to reclaim his position. For the last three years, Yahapalana government failed to win the trust of the general public. Wickremesinghe is responsible for that scenario.”
