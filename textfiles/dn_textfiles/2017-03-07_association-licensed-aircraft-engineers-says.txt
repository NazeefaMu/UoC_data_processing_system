Association of Licensed Aircraft Engineers  says...

This refers to the article under the title “SriLankan wastes millions on lease aircraft seats” in the Daily News of May 6, 2017.
The article quotes about a statement made by an Engineer’s Union official. The Association of Licensed Aircraft Engineers (ALAE), the only group authorised to release aircraft after maintenance, has confirmed that neither any official from their Association had made such comment nor had any contact with media, as such involvement is against the company media policy.
The Engineers Union categorically denies that a member of their association (ALAE) made any statement to the Daily News regarding the article published on Monday.
Further to this there are Separate Production Lines handling different aircraft types/checks and Indigo aircraft are handled by one of them, the ALAE said.
