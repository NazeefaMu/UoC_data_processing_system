4th Battle of the Thomians hockey encounter today

The 4th Battle of the Thomians encounter between two leading hockey playing schools S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia and St. Thomas’ College, Matale will be played at the Astro turf hockey grounds, Reid Avenue today commencing 4.15 pm. The match which is sponsored by Nations Trust Bank will be played for the Eric Hulangamuwa Challenge trophy.
Prior to this big event the Junior under 15 and the Old Boys hockey matches will be played at 2.00 pm and at 3.00 pm respectively.
The Matale Thomians known for their prowess in hockey should have the edge but the Mount Lavinia Thomians are famous for their Thomian grit and will fight every inch of the way.
Hockey is the forte of Matale Thomians while the boys from the school by the sea are reputed for cricket, rugby and other games like badminton, table tennis, water polo, swimming and fencing.
Both leading hockey playing schools have produced top hockey players who have represented their alma mater and country with distinction.
Sri Lanka has produced only nine international umpires so far and four of them are from St. Thomas’ College, Matale - Jayampathy Perera, R. S. Somasekeram, Indrawansa Herath and D.R.B. Dissanayake. Mount Lavinia Thomians have produced top national players of the calibre of Chandra Schaffter, Dr. Sarath Seneviratne, Anura Tennekoon, Ishak Shahabdeen, D. Bandaranayake, Orville Abeynaike and his sons Ranil, Ajith and Amitha, Lakshman Watawala, Michael Tissera, K. Abeysekera, Gamini and Navin Marapona (father and son), Avindra de Silva, Suren Wijeratne, Dinesh Wickramasinghe, Thivanka Wijeratne and Pujitha Walpitagama to mention a few.
