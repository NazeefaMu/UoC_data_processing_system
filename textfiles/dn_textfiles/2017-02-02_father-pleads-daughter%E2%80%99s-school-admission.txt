Father pleads for daughter’s school admission

 
A father in Kalpitiya has launched a fast-unto-death campaign to protest his daughter’s in-admission to the Al Aqsha National School.
He says that while he has submitted all relevant documents, officials at the school have not admitted his daughter, for reasons undisclosed.
