Dhananjaya de Silva ready for the challenge

DELHI, Friday – Dhananjaya de Silva said that he was ready for the challenge to take up the number three position or to open the batting for his country after being named as replacement to Lahiru Thirimanne for the third and final Test against India starting at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium here on Saturday.
“I have opened in international matches in T20s and ODIs. In Tests I have not opened so far. First time it could happen in a Test,” said De Silva.
“I played as an opener for Sri Lanka Under-19 and I am opening the innings for Tamil Union in domestic cricket. It will be a big challenge opening in a Test match, but I am looking forward to the challenge.”
If Sri Lanka opts for seven batsmen De Silva could be asked to turn his arm around bowling his off-breaks but he doesn’t mind that.
“I will be playing like an all-rounder doing lots of bowling as well. My role will be as a batsman. Mostly I will have to bowl about ten overs or so and I will have to focus more on my batting,” said De Silva.
De Silva began his Test career on a high note with his first two Test series against Australia and Zimbabwe producing 550 runs at an average of 61 with two centuries and two fifties before he suffered a slump in South Africa that continued into the series against Bangladesh and India.
De Silva was sent to West Indies in October to lead the Sri Lanka A side and regain his batting form. He returned on a high with an average of 52 inclusive of one century and two fifties in the three-match unofficial test series against West Indies A that Sri Lanka A won 2-1. This performance won him a place in the Sri Lanka Test side to India where he is now on the verge of making a comeback to the Test team.
“There’s a time you score runs and then you go through a tough period. I didn’t do anything special. Wanted to score some runs and just keep to the basics and things started going my way during the West Indies tour,” said De Silva.
“Avishka Gunawardene the coach with the ‘A’ team gave advice to do simple things like watch the ball closely and play. That has been helpful for me. I have done that and I am glad to be back among the runs. I have worked hard to get back into the side and I am looking forward to make the most of the opportunity. I have got my rhythm back and I will try to continue it here,” he said.
