Insufficient staff at Kurunegala PS for dengue eradication

Secretary to the Kurunegala Pradeshiya Sabha Durga Wickramasinghe said there are not enough employees with the Kurunegala PS to deploy in eradicating dengue mosquitoes at present. There are 30 health employees and 13 out of them have been deployed as drivers.
Only 7 drivers are available at present although the PS owns 20 vehicles. Consequently, the NWP-PC Chief Minister instructed her to recruit more employees to deploy for controlling mosquitoes in the Kurunegala urban area as many positive dengue patients have already been reported at the Kurunegala General Hospital.
The Secretary pointed out this plight at a meeting that was convened to discuss how best to eradicate dengue mosquitoes in the Municipal Council area of Kurunegala. NWP-PC Governor Amara Piyaseeli Rathnayake and Minister of Health of the NWP-PC Lakshman Wedaruwa were present on this occasion.
