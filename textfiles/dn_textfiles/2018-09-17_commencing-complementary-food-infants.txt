Commencing complementary food for infants

Breastfeeding has important psychological benefits for both mothers and babies. Babies tend to cry less if they are breastfed and are more emotionally secure. Some studies suggest that breastfeeding may help a child to develop intellectually. Low birth weight babies fed in the first weeks of life perform better on intelligence tests than children who are artificially fed (infant formula).
This week Consultant Community Physician Dr. Hiranya Jayawickrama MBBS, MSc, MD (Community Medicine) attached to the Child Nutrition Unit of the Family Health Bureau of the Health Ministry speaks about the importance breastfeeding after commencement of complementary food for infants.
According to Dr. Jayawickrama, exclusive breastfeeding (only breast milk without any other liquids or food) until the completion of six months is very important. It will facilitate the optimal growth and development of infants. Immediately on completion of the six9th month, complementary food should be commenced in addition to breast milk. Breastfeeding should be continued for two years or more. This will promote the better growth and the development of the infant. Complementary food should be introduced in a thick form which is enough to stay on the spoon. This gives more energy and nutrients to the baby thereby facilitating growth. Adding oil, thick coconut milk, butter etc to prepare food will increase the energy density of the food.
After one week from the introduction of complementary food, food of animal origin can be introduced. Food such as sprats, fish, chicken, meat, liver etc can be introduced. This is essential for healthy growth and brain development. Those food provide easily bio available nutrients such as iron, Zinc, Calcium, Proteins etc, Dr. Jayawickrama said.
Adding legumes such as Dhal, Beans, Chicken peas, Cowpea, Green grams etc and nuts such as Cashew nuts, Pea nuts, Kottamba and seeds such as jack seeds. Those varieties of food contain important nutrients required for the child's growth and therefore should be introduced into the baby's daily diet gradually, she said.
Dark green leaves and orange / yellow coloured fruits and vegetables, egg yolk, liver, milk products etc should be included in the baby's daily diet. Such food will provide vitamin A and other essential nutrients for healthy eyes and good health. Frequency of meals should be gradually increased and variety of food should be included in meals, she added.
****
* Gradually the amount of food given should be increased as the baby is growing rapidly while changing consistency.
* Six plus up to eight months :- Start with 2 - 3 teaspoonfuls per feed increasing gradually to a bit more than half a cup of a 200 ml tea cup at each meal.
* Nine to 11 months :- Four third of a 200 ml tea cup.
* 12 to 23 months :- A bit more than one full 200 ml tea cup at each meal.
* Changing in consistency :- From well mashed food at the beginning to five particles ---> coarse particles ---> finger foods and by the age of one year to adult food.
* Avoid force feeding.
* Increase feeding during an illness and after recovery. This will lead to an early recovery and to maintain normal growth.
