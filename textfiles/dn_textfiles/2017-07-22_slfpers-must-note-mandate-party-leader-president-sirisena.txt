SLFPers must note mandate of Party leader, President Sirisena

What appears to be the emerging divisions within the SLFP, possibly posing a threat to the coalition of National Unity that comprises the present government, is a key aspect in the politics of today. The talk is of a group of SLFP members crossing over to function as an independent group in the Opposition, while there is also considerable speculation about a group of MPs from the Joint Opposition (JO) moving over to the government, without the UNP.
These likely manoevres are being heated up due to the approach of next month, which completes two years after the General Election of August 2015, which led to the forming of the Grand Coalition of National Unity which remains today without its grandeur, but as a functioning and necessary coalition.
Those talking much of a possible shift of SLFP members from the government to the Opposition, and even to the JO, point to the disagreements with the UNP, and especially to the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, remaining in this key position in government. No doubt there are issues regarding the powers that SLFP members holding Deputy and State ministerial positions under UNP Ministers, and even aspects of their office premises.
These are inevitable disputes within a coalition, made worse by the fact that most SLFP members came to the government only after the UNP won the larger number of seats in the August 2015 General Election. They are not members who moved to support the Presidency of the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena after the Presidential Poll of January 2015.
In the August General Election the UNP, led by Ranil Wickremesinghe, emerged as the largest or first party with 93 electoral seats with 45.66% votes, and 106 parliamentary seats with the National List members. The SLFP, within the UPFA, led by President Maithripala Sirisena emerged next or second with 83 electoral seats with 42.33% votes, and 95 parliamentary seats with National List members.
What those from the SLFP within the government who are now leading the call for a break from the UNP-SLFP coalition, do not realize is that the present National Unity government they are in, as a coalition, is mainly due to the national mandate given by the people to President Maithripala Sirisena to be President in January 2015. He remains the head of any government that is to function under his term of office, which he has reduced to five years.
The government of National Unity emerged under his leadership, and the position of Prime Minister, also follows the January 2015 mandate of the people, which did not get the support of these SLFP members.
It is good to recall that in his manifesto for the January 2015 Presidential Poll, Maithripala Sirisena clearly stated who would be the Prime Minister under his presidency. As he states in the first chapter – My Vision – in the manifesto: “… to carrying on this programme by a National Government comprising members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the United National Party and the Jatika Hela Urumaya. The present Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, shall be appointed Prime Minister of this National Government.” The people’s mandate did come for that position.
Not much strength
This does not give much strength to the SLFP members in government to make a major push to call for a government without the UNP, although they may have good political and populist reasons for doing so. They must also remember that President Sirisena, as the head of the SLFP, clearly refused to endorse Mahinda Rajapaksa as a Prime Ministerial candidate of the UPFA in August 2015, and even said that if MR comes to a situation of claiming that position, he would appoint someone else. While the cheap politicking of many who did not win election by votes, but came in through the back way of the National List, may give a good public show off when the government is facing many issues causing public concern, it will be good for them to be aware of their own personal weaknesses, and dependence on President Sirisena for the positions they hold in politics and governance today.
While making public statements about jumping from the Government to the Opposition – Joint or Independent – they should also take note of the weaknesses the JO is facing today. While the JO leader Mahinda Rajapaksa keeps postponing the Full Moon when the government will be overthrown, there is considerable uncertainty within the JO on its functioning. It cannot meet the call by a section of the Sangha to move away from Constitution drafting, it is definitely on the back foot on the SAITM issue, and is faced with a new image problem over Uma Oya.
The JO is a shaky political outfit. This is seen with Wimal Weerawansa’s National Freedom Front (NFF) moving out of it to function independently. This is a leader and a group that has different political goals, than the JO can commit itself to. And, there is also that single MP, Roshan Ranasinghe moving out to be independent of the UPFA. In such situations, the anti-government and anti-UNP voices of the SLFPers within the government, who do not criticize President Sirisena, had better give ear, first to the call by the President to be patient till December 31, and next to the mandate that President Sirisena received to form the National Government in January 2015.
The twirl of politics may give them many tempting possibilities. Yet, despite considerable public dissatisfaction, and even anger, at the policies of the government, especially the delay in fighting corruption, there are no signs of a readiness to accept those whom the people rejected twice in 2015.
There is more time under this Presidency and Government, for a new public campaign and organisation to emerge with the necessary political thinking to change the government, and possibly, the political system in Sri Lanka.
SAITM – the real issue
The government has got over a part of the SAITM issue with the transfer of ownership of the Neville Fernando Hospital to the State. The GMOA will no doubt keep shouting its objections about this, as it tries to continually confuse the people over what the real SAITM issue is. What is necessary is for the government to come to grips with the issue of how students who have passed the GCE ‘O’ and ‘A’ levels, with the requirements to enter the state medical faculties, but fail to enter these institutions due to lack of space, will be given the opportunity of medical education.
The question of extending private education facilities to medicine is the key issue that calls for quick and clear action by the government. Hardly any government voice commenting on the SAITM issue goes into this matter. Very little is asked as to how the GMOA accepts foreign private education for those who cannot enter local state medical training facilities.
There is hardly anything said about the District Quota system on the selection of students for medical education, which echoes the hardships that Tamil students from the North had in seeking higher education, not so long ago. Such restrictive district quota systems have no place in a democratic society, and should not hamper growth of the medical profession. These matters need a free and clear public discussion, which will push the GMOA much more back, than a “Graded Medical Officers’ Association” (a rival GMOA). The need is not to divide the medical profession, but resolve the issue of all students seeking medical education.
The government will also have to address the situation caused by the strike by medical students for the past five months, which is now being raised by the GMOA, which encouraged them to boycott lectures. While a sympathetic approach could be useful, there is also the necessity to remind these students of the consequences of being absent from lectures and practicals for such a long period.
The disciplinary approach to this should not be excluded, while leaving room for sympathetic consideration. It is good to remember that very soon there will be another intake of students to the medical faculties, and the current boycott of classes by students could lead to a major delay in the new admissions.
It is good to underscore the biggest shame for the GMOA was how it made Prof Carlo Fonseka, such a senior medical professional, at 84 plus years, and a teacher to most doctors today, having to worship the GMOA leaders (possibly his students, too), in asking them not to strike over his role in the SLMC, in the midst of the current Dengue epidemic.
Prison visitors
It is interesting to see the moves to have new conditions to restrict foreign professionals, who are officially on investigative visits to this country, from visiting the prisons and prisoners. The national prisons are kept out of the Defence institutions for very good democratic reasons. Whatever action the government may take on future prison visitors, what is important is to understand that having persons in prison detention, in remand or as suspected terrorists, for many years without any charge or trial, is certainly unacceptable in a democratic society, and especially in a society that claims to give importance to Human Rights.
