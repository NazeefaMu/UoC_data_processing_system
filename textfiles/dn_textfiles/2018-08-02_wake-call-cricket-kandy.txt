Wake up call for cricket in Kandy

There's good news for cricket enthusiasts in Kandy because there is a possibility of a Division III tournament and the annual six-a side tournament which was not played for many years being conducted. These tournaments were to be played this month but has been postponed due to the Esala Perehera. There will also be tournaments for State Services, Doctors, Banks, Finance Companies worked out separately on six-a-side basis.
Sri Lanka Cricket it is learnt will give a big hand for the game if it is conducted in a proper way. Kandy at one time was the second largest city for cricket next to Colombo, today it is right at the bottom in club cricket, Kandy does not have a single club playing in the Premier League, there is only one playing in the P. Sara Trophy Tournament and another club in the Division II tournament.
After Sri Lanka gained Test status, people like late Dr.C.D.L. Fernando, late M.S. Uduwella,Dr. S. Uduwella, Harindra Dunuwille and Roy de Silva, who were past presidents of Kandy CA made cricket flourish at club level, where there were several tournaments, limited over, six a-side, double wicket, and triangulars. One should not forget the yeoman services rendered by late Z.M. Jauffer and Aubrey Kuruppu when they were secretaries. And before and after test, there were people like M.B. Samarakoon, E.W. Balasuriya, Col. S. Baha, D.H. de Silva, Malcolm Perera, H. Marikar, Shaw Wilson, V. Vartharaja, Deva Amunugama, Jayantha Weerasekara, Raja Abeyanayake, M.B. Samarakoon, Dr. Deva Athureliya, M.E. Marikar, Malcolm Berenger, Bertie Gomes, R. Karunaratne and Y. Thiyakaran.
At that time there were tournaments for schools, all Island tournament for juniors, limited over for inter club, triangular, six a side, double wicket. All these tournaments have been now dumped in the Kandy Lake today. When Mahinda Aluthgamage was the Sports Minister, he gave a big hand by donating cricketing gear but it was not distributed properly.
Cricket in Kandy at club level has hit rock bottom, Kandy officials only come alive when there is an international game in Kandy. The South Africans have two ODIs this month and these officials are highly excited and on the ball to have another carnival atmosphere for their benefit.
Another reason why cricket in Kandy is at a low ebb is when it comes to matches especially schools in all age groups, only three schools have their own grounds. Most of the schools go out of town to play cricket. It is the duty of the officials who hold office to make arrangements, promote the game of cricket which has a long history in Kandy. Why did they move from Asgiriya to Pallekelle, that was to keep the school grounds free to promote cricket at Palalekelle Stadium, it was not built to play only International matches, but also to promote Kandy district cricket too. What Kandy official’s talk is only about the past cricketers, Mahesh Gunatillake, Muthiah Maralitharan and Kumar Sangakkara.
They only played their school cricket in Kandy, and moved to Colombo clubs where they improved their cricketing skills. If they had remained in Kandy it would have been a different story.
