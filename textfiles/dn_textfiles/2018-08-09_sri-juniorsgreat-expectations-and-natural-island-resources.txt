Sri juniors....great expectations and natural island resources

Traditions and accepted norms apart, Sri Lanka has always been a dependable and most amiable Asian rugby member. All told, a much anticipated high performance status platform, looming larger and within striking distance for our Torrington administration.
Given our 7s stats and ranking...for all our rep teams...men, women, and juniors, the step up fairly sensible and long overdue.
There needs to be fundamental thinking by chief Bonsa and his brains trust about the pace and direction for 7s.
It certainly needs max priority and absolute belief in our natural born talent beyond all doubt.
We need central contracts, insurance and performance clauses to motivate and enhance our current player environment.
So much for my soap box narrative as a fitting intro to this week’s hard yards.
It is vital that sane counsel will guide our competition pathway for 7s Asia wide...better still if we adopt an Asia Pacific touring footprint.
In turn assuring our development teams the best and toughest learning anywhere on planet rugby.
Dispatch rugby ambassadors to the islands...we have friends in Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea, etc who will welcome our teams with much pomp and pure joy....aloha and bula bula Sri Lanka new competitive history and almost genetic 7s transfusion.
I anticipate 3 to 5 years grow and nurture process that will breed the skills and oxygenate our blood.
All hail Augustus for its reputation for change and as Caesar imagined the consequences far reaching and way beyond conventional expectations.
The same future for this Olympic discipline stares Sri Lanka rugby in the proverbial face....it’s time methinks...and such fantastic possibilities.
It’s an adrenaline charged endorphins for all of us who wore the shirt with absolute pride and fierce belief.
In my case ...that runs close to 14 years touring all over the 7s globe with the biggest heart worn safely under our elephant.
As Naveen Heenakan lands his U20 team ...we are all there in spirit and remember the anticipated breathing skills that need a quick system re-set.
Naveen has experienced these conditions and perfect to share that playing intelligence as captain.
Proud moment for H.K. Sisira...his sharp skilled all-rounder Dad.
We toured many years with his steel frame and uncanny pace for the Navy and for Sri Lanka. Wonderful for his parents and good genetics to see the lad graduating the S. Thomas’ stable with staggering ability.
This is the clean warrior example to be meticulously followed and religiously emulated.
Let’s wish our boys solid focus for the entire tournament and more island heart to top both days in the middle.
Hong Kong...Japan...and Korea likely contenders on day 2...the business end for coach Nilufer’s depth and recycling plan.
Boys certainly ready for the abundance of love to be shared in the middle?
The excitement about this units performance is hard to contain...so give the lads our best positives...
Naveen, Ganidu, Gemunu, Lee, Muthalib and squad...
Combination and job to never give up...empty the tank for Sri.
Blessings young proud islanders, expect to hear good things and that we gave it our max at all times.
Bula bula the Sri rugby heart that beats at the Asian U20 championship in Hong Kong this Augustus weekend.
Cheers indeed!
