BCCI may suffer financial loss of Rs 1600 crore

NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to suffer a financial loss to the tune of Rs 1600 crore if Lodha Panel's recommendations on curtailing the advertisement breaks during the matches is implemented.
It is feared that in the wake of loss of revenue not only the smooth functioning of country's richest sporting body will be hit but also the development of junior cricket in the country.
According to BCCI balance sheet, the operative revenue currently is approximately Rs 2000 crore, a large chunk of which comes from broadcasting rights and advertisement revenues.
But if Lodha Panel recommendation, which wants the advertisements only during "lunch, tea or drinks break", then it would come down to Rs 400 crore.
According to a reliable source in the board, the Star Sports, which has the broadcasting rights of BCCI's matches, currently gives Rs 43 crore per match and such a rule could see BCCI earning as less as Rs 8-10 crore per match.
"Yes, it is true that we are facing a situation which could lead to a revenue loss of Rs 1600 crore. Star Sports will renegotiate their deal and may be pay us only 20-25 percent of the amount that we get currently per match. Ditto for IPL broadcasters," a source in the know of things told PTI on conditions of anonymity.
The far-reaching implication of this could mean that during India's away tours, the hosts countries such as England, New Zealand or Australia will earn more than India out of the broadcast deals. - PTI
