Present rice prices would go down by next week: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that rice prices would go down by next week, as the government had taken steps to import 51,000 metric tons of rice and another hundred thousand metric tons are to be released to the local market soon.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said that the Rs. 15 special commodity levy upon a kilo of rice, was reduced to a Rs.5.00 as an incentive to reduce the rice prices in the market. He further pointed out that within the next three months, two hundred and fifty thousand metric tons of rice is to be imported due to drought conditions currently prevailing in the country.
PM Wickremesinghe was replying to a question forwarded by MP C.B. Ratnayake on the increased rice prices in the market.
"In 2014, the previous government did not purchase any paddy in the Yala season. We brought three hundred and thirty five thousand metric tons of paddy in 2015. With the current drought condition, we only hope for a 30% - 40% of paddy production for this season," PM Wickremesinghe said.
Minister of Special Assignments Sarath Amunugama, on the same issue said, by today one kilo of Nadu rice would be Rs.72 and one kilo of Samba will be Rs.80.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake confirmed that a gazette regarding this decision was issued yesterday.
Replying to a question raised by MP Dinesh Gunawardane, PM Wickremesinghe said the government had no problem regarding the issuance of necessary fertilizer to the farmers.
"The current problem at hand is the shortage of water. You should conduct a 'poojawa' for quick rain fall as a support for the people and the government," PM Wickremesinghe added.
PM Wickremesinghe also said the Public Utilities Commission is to raid sales outlets that sell rice for higher prices disregarding the controlled price.

Country has lost nearly Rs. 110 billion from 15 public enterprises: COPE
The country has suffered a loss of about Rs 110 billion from 15 public enterprises of which the latest is on the Committee report on Public Enterprises (COPE) deals with Committee, Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said.
Handunnetti made this observation in Parliament yesterday, while tabling the third COPE report of the Eighth Parliament that contained findings and recommendations on 15 institutions which was summoned before the Committee from May 1 to August 31, 2016.
The 15 institutions include the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment, the Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd., State Engineering Corporation, Telecommunication Regulation Commission, Sri Lanka Cricket, Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation, National Lotteries Board, Ceylon Electricity Board and Sustainable Energy Authority, Sri Lanka Football Federation, Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Medicine Corporation, four Maga Neguma Institutions under the Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Kurunegala Plantations and the Employees Trust Fund Board.
Handunnetti highlighted the colossal waste and unfeasible and non-economical projects of these institutions which had made a huge negative impact on the country’s economy. Quoting the report, he said the accumulated loss of the Hambantota Port as of now is Rs 37 billion.
“No party is willing to shoulder the burden concerning the loss making Sooriyawewa Cricket Stadium. Is it the State Engineering Corporation or the Ports Authority that has to pay the Rs 5.3 billion due for its construction? The Road Development Authority had made many payments for projects not coming under its purview. The cost of the Lotus Tower project is another burden. The spending of millions of Euros and dollars received to the Sri Lanka Football Federation was not done transparently. The State Engineering Corporation has also suffered a loss of Rs 2,918 million,” the COPE Chairman said.
He urged the relevant ministers to consider the report’s recommendations seriously and implement them as soon as possible.
The COPE report says that the State Engineering Corporation had recruited 602 employees without the approval of the Department of Management Services. The Corporation had paid Rs 1,353,000 as salaries and Rs 626,000 as overtime allowances to employees who had been released for election work during the run-up to the 2015 elections. In the years 2013 and 2014, vehicles and drivers of the Corporation had been released to the Housing and Construction Ministry without the approval and Rs 37 million and Rs 42 million had been paid respectively as rental, fuel expenses and drivers’ salaries for the vehicles thus released.
The COPE had found that the Sri Lanka Rupvahini Corporation had telecast all the advertisements with a value of Rs 34,719,750 of one presidential candidate free of charge during the last Presidential election.
The National Lotteries Board has paid Rs 64,680,000 for displaying hoardings in November 2014 without properly depicting advertising purposes through the photographs depicted in them.
The COPE has also identified that there were irregularities in utilizing 100,400 Euros and 10.2 million US dollars which had been received by the Sri Lanka Football Federation.
The COPE has observed that the Employees Trust Fund had failed to work as a primary dealer though Rs 200 million had been invested in Treasury bonds through other institutions without calling for bids.
Bimal detours on SAITM issue
MP Bimal Ratnayake while querying as to when the University of Ruhuna would be opened from the Leader of the House Lakshman Kirella, made a detour when he question on the much controversial SAITM issue.
MP Ratnayake questioned Kiriella if he was aware that SAITM students are reluctant to produce their Advance Level Examination results.
Replying to Ratnayake, Kiriella swiftly replied that what mattered was really not the SAITM students' reluctance to produce their A/L results, but the reluctance displayed by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) members to reveal their A/L results.
Kiriella alleged that some GMOA members only had scored three 'S' passes in their A/L exams. They have been able to enter the universities because they had sat for their A/L examinations from rural districts, Kiriella alleged.
So why not the students who had received ordinary passes in their A/L examination get themselves enrolled in a degree they prefer, Kiriella questioned.
MP Ratnayake then questioned the Minister of Higher Education and Highways, as to who set the standards on road development in Sri Lanka.
Ratnayake was pointed out that the question was irrelevant. However, Kiriella later was compelled to reply that the Road Development Authority (RDA), which is under his ministry, was responsible for road development activities in Sri Lanka.
The reply was then followed by MP Ratnayake as to who was responsible to set standards to medical education in Sri Lanka.
"Is it the RDA that is also responsible in setting standards to the medical education in Sri Lanka?" Ratnayake questioned.
Kiriella pointed out that since the SAITM issue had received a Court order, there is no point in questioning on the issue. MP Sunil Handunnetti, in his question to Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, also took time to again question as to who exactly was responsible to rule out the standards to the medical education in Sri Lanka.
When pointed out the question was irrelevant, Handunnetti was quick to reply that the question was indeed relevant, since the government university students who protested against the SAITM are now imprisoned.
MP Ramesh Pathirana, posing a supplementary question, repeated the question for the third time.
"Does any minister in the government know who is responsible in setting standards to medical education in Sri Lanka?" Pathirana asked.
The question however was left unanswered.
Defence Minister to discuss resettlement issues of Keppapiluv with PM today
Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardane yesterday, said a meeting was due today with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to discuss issues related to the resettlement of Keppapiluv in Mullaitive area.
The State Minister was replying to an adjournment motion forwarded by TNA MP Sumanthiran, regarding the protest carried out by the first owners of the lands in Keppapiluv which was now being used by the Sri Lanka Air Force.
State Minister Ruwan Wijewardane said he could arrange a meeting with the Air Force Commander-in-Chief, along with other Military commanders an the Vanni District Secretary to further discuss the issue concerned.
He also pointed out that the Sri Lanka Air Force was unaware that lands they occupied were private property, since they were assigned with these lands by the Wildlife Department during the times of war.
"The Air Force established an Air strip during the war time in this area as a national security measure. Now, the air strip is used not only for military purposes, but also for civil affairs." Wijewardane pointed out.
All parties concerned, would be able to come to an amicable solution after several rounds of discussions, Wijewardane pointed out.

PM declines release of Iranathivu Islands for resettlement
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday in Parliament, declined a request from TNA MP S. Sritharan to release Iranathivu Islands in Kilinochchi for resettlement.
Wickremesinghe said the Navy had informed that the Iranathivu Island could not be released for resettlement at present as it was a strategic location to control Indian fishermen from poaching and drug smuggling. The Premier was replying to a question by MP Sritharan during the Prime Minister’s Question round. “About 437 people belonging to 190 families left this island in 1990-1992 due to security threats during the war. However, the Navy is operating from this Island to prevent Tamil Nadu fishermen poaching into Sri Lankan waters and raid drug trafficking. Despite that, the people have been allowed to use the island for their agricultural, religious and fishing purposes. If these activities are obstructed, I would ask Minister D M Swaminathan, State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena and Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi to look into it and you could discuss the problem with them,” he told the MP.
