Mobitel’s mCash partners with JustPay

Mobitel, the National Mobile Service Provider, has partnered with JustPay, a secure, real-time payment service, to enable Mobitel mCash customers to top up their wallet directly from their preferred Bank Account for the first time in Sri Lanka.
Making it even more convenient to top up the mCash balance, Mobitel customers can now make frequent, real-time, direct payments from their bank account using a mobile phone. And this service is provided to all mCash customers at no cost and as an integrated aspect of the mCash system.
JustPay is a brainchild of LankaClear, an initiative that is aptly supported by the Central Bank and all the member banks of LankaPay Common Electronic Fund Transfer (CEFTS) to facilitate secure real-time retail payments below Rs. 10,000 under an extremely low tariff scheme.
In committing towards taking banking to the masses by being inclusive and accessible, Cargills Bank as the Just Pay Acquiring Bank has supported this initiative of the partnership with Mobitel.
Mobitel’s mCash has transformed the mobile money concept in Sri Lanka by introducing innovative features, and constantly creating ways in which mCash can be more inclusive and adapted to customer lifestyles.
The mCash enables a whole new method of carrying out financial transactions, through the mobile money account. Users of mCash can deposit, withdraw, transfer funds as well as purchase goods and services. And now with the Just pay integration, you can top up your mobile money account whenever you want, through a secure and real-time payment service.
mCash is available for both Android and iOS phone systems and is approved by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as a mobile money service. Its ease of use has made it widely popular with Mobitel and Etisalat customers.
mCash has an extensive Retailer network of 16,000+ touch points Islandwide including Mobitel Branches, SLT Teleshops and Singer Mega outlets, Supermarkets, Leading Banks, 650+ Commercial Bank ATM’s for cardless withdrawals and 300+ Pay & Go kiosks located in central areas for mCash services.
