Anuradhapura farmers face fertilizer subsidy issue

Farmers in Anuradhapura district are facing a scarcity of subsidised fertilizer in the open market.
Farmers organisations in Galenbindunwewa, Wilachciya, Kahatagasdigiliya, Horowpothana, Rathmalgahawewa, Medawachchiya, Rambewa, and Seeppukulama have complained to the authorities that some fertilizer dealers are demanding that farmers buy six bags of urea for issuing a bag of MOP or TSP at the subsidised rate of Rs. 1,000 (earlier Rs. 1,500) per 50kg bag.
Referring to the issue, Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Development Commissioner Asanka Somawansa told the Daily News that there was no shortage of subsidised fertilizer in the district. Farmers could buy fertilizer such as urea, MOP and TSP from the 41 agrarian development centres at the subsidised rate of Rs. 500 per 50kg bag for paddy. “We have made arrangements to distribute 40,000mt of fertilizer for cultivating a minimum of 125,000 hectares. The problem pertains to the fertilizer sold at Rs. 1,000 per 50 kg bag (earlier Rs. 1,500) in the open market, without any restriction.”
It is reported that in some instances fertilizer traders maintain that MOP and TSP fertilizer could be issued only to farmers who buy more urea fertilizer. Also, there are complaints that some fertilizer dealers are still continuing to sell the subsidised fertilizer at the old rate of Rs. 1,500 per 50kg bag ignoring the present rate of Rs. 1,000.
Somawansa has directed fertilizer secretariat officials and the 675 agriculture research and production assistants to probe the matter and take action against offenders.
Meanwhile, Fertilizer Secretariat Director Ajith Pushpakumara discussed the matter with farmer organisation representatives, representatives of the authorised fertilizer distribution companies such as Baurs, CIC, Dimo, and Haleys, and fertilizer traders at the Kahatagasdigiliya agrarian development centre recently. Farmers urged the director to make immediate arrangements to distribute subsidised Rs. 1,000 fertilizer through the 41 agrarian development centres, in addition to the open market. At present, only paddy farmers are issued fertilizer at the rate of Rs. 500 per 50kg bag through the agrarian centres. Also, farmers asked that LakPohora and other companies too be authorised to deal in marketing the subsidised Rs. 1,000 fertilizer.
