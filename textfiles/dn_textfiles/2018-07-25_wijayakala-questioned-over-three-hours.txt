Wijayakala questioned for over three hours

A special Police team yesterday questioned former State Minister Wijayakala Maheswaran for over three hours over the statement made by her at an event held in Jaffna recently.
Her statement on the need of reorganising the LTTE, earned widespread condemnation from all quarters in the country. A special branch of Police headquarters is conducting investigations under the direct supervision of Deputy Inspector General M.R.Latheef. The Attorney General had instructed the IGP to conduct an immediate investigation into the statement made by Wijayakala Maheshwaran.
It was reported that Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya has given the instruction following a request made to him by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya regarding the actions to be taken against Maheshwaran.
