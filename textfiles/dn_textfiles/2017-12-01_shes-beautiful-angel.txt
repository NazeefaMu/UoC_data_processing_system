'She's beautiful, like an angel!'

US First lady Melania Trump hosted children to the White House Monday as she walked through a fully-decorated executive mansion, unveiling her vision of a Trump Christmas – simple, yet elegant, with elements of Americana and nature.
'She's beautiful, like an angel!' one young boy remarked, as the first lady – whose cream-colored belted dress with bell sleeves could have been worn by a tree topper – walked into the East Room to help a group of kids make garland. 'Are you the first lady?' another youngster asked. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made sure to note that Melania Trump 'personally selected and was involved in every detail' of the decorations unveiled today.
Melania Trump entered the holiday festivities by taking the grand staircase, into the foyer, as three ballerinas danced to 'The Nutcracker Suite,' in a room filled with faux fur trees glistening with snow.
The dancers and the song were symbolic as 'The Nutracker Suite' was the first theme used at a White House Christmas. This year's theme, 'Time-Honored Traditions,' piggybacked on that, which each room paying homage to a tradition, including a Gold Star tree, a way to respect fallen troops,and a gallery of silhouettes of past presidents in the Green Room, acknowledging an early craft.
As the first lady entered the various rooms, she made small talk with the young kids, all students locally at Joint Base Andrews, in Prince George's County, Maryland, right outside of Washington, D.C.
'What are your plans for Christmas?' she asked. 'Did you write your letter yet? Do you have any pets at home?'
Before the first lady arrived in the East Room, decorated with several large trees and the White House creche, the children's chaperone told them to 'act natural,' as they grinned for the cameras.
When FLOTUS arrived they all went in for the group hug. 'So how is it going? This is so cool right?' the first lady later asked when walking into the Red Room, which was decorated with gingerbreads and candies. Singing a similar tune to her predecessor, Melania Trump warned, 'A lot of sugar right?' as she helped the group assemble gumdrop Christmas trees. In the Green Room, a quartet of kids cut out their own silhouettes to go along with the presidential ones hanging on the nearby mantel, which was also decorated with a large 'Merry Christmas' banner. In the Blue Room, the first lady didn't host guests Monday, because the size of the Endeavor-Wisconsin based Christmas tree.
The tree, which she and 11-year-old Barron greeted last week in front of the White House, is so large at 18 feet, 6 inches, it takes up nearly the whole room. The Trumps decorated the tree with ornaments from all the states and territories, along with blue bulbs and large gold and blue bows.
The downstairs of the East Wing was fully decorated too, with reporters allowed into the Library, the Vermeil Room and the China Room before the first lady's guests were let in. In the Dining Room, a table was set for Christmas dinner, featuring a table purchased for the White House by President James Monroe.
Being good Republicans, the Trumps chose to adorn the table with President Ronald Reagan's red and gold china.
In the Library, the Trumps put out an 1866 edition of Charles Dickens' a Christmas Carol, protected by glass. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had read the the story at the White House each year he was in office, the White House noted.
Melania Trump continued her tour by sitting down with another group of children in what's called the 'Bookseller's Area' downstairs.
There, they colored White House Christmas cards underneath a display of Christmas cards sent out by the president and first lady going back to the Dwight D. Eisenhower years.
