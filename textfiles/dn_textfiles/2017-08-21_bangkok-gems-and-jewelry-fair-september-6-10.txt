Bangkok Gems and Jewelry Fair from September 6 to 10

The Department of International Trade Promotion (DITP), Ministry of Commerce, guarantees the quality and craftsmanship of Thai jewelry brands with the Thailand Trust Mark or T Mark, a symbol of trusted quality and excellence, while preparing to host the 60th edition of the Bangkok Gems and Jewelry Fair which will take place from September 6 to 10 at Challenger Hall 1-3, IMPACT Muang Thong Thani, Bangkok.
With the gems and jewelry industry in Thailand on the rise, the country is now the world’s 10th largest gems and jewelry exporting country, and exports of gems and jewelry, excluding gold, are forecast to rise 5% this year to US$7.32 billion according to the Ministry of Commerce.
Though the gems and jewelry industry in Thailand have greatly expanded, manufacturers are designing and producing jewelry with more care than ever to cater to the styles of international buyers and to keep up the world-renowned reputation of Thai jewelry. “Thailand is a hub for exquisite, high quality jewelry designs at affordable prices,” said Thanyaporn Chiewhatpong, marketing manager of Grace of Art, a jewelry brand that received T Mark in 2015.
To reassure the quality and craftsmanship of jewelry made in Thailand, buyers can look for the Thailand Trust Mark or T Mark, established by the DITP in 2012 to strengthen and promote Thai products and services with trusted quality in every dimension from the highest standard of production, fair labor, giving consideration to environmental concerns and social responsibility with the most important factor as the “Heartmade Quality”.
Many Thai jewelry brands have received T Mark such as Dhanu, de facto Asia, Beauty Gems, Pranda Jewelry, The Premier and Maya Trade, all of which are leading jewelry brands that are exported worldwide and are well-known for being handcrafted in Thailand.
Currently, 738 Thai companies in eight industries have received T Mark, including companies producing jewelry, fashion products, lifestyle products, food and agricultural products, to companies in the service industry.
To see the world-famous gems and jewelry from Thailand, visit the Bangkok Gems and Jewelry Fair where suppliers and designers will showcase their products in more than 2,100 booths during the 5-day fair.
