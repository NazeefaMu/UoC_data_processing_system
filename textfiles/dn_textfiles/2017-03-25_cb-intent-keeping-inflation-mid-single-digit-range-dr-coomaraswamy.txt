CB intent on keeping inflation at mid-single digit range: Dr. Coomaraswamy

As the Central Bank yesterday tightened its monetary policy and raised its key policy rates by 25 basis points, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said the increase was to send a strong signal that the Central Bank was intent on making sure inflation remained at the mid-single digit range.
It thus raised the policy rates effective as of yesterday (24) with Standing Deposit Facility
Rate (SDFR) being increased to 7.25 percent and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) raised to 8.75 percent. The Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) at 7.50 percent remains unchanged.
“This is a precautionary measure to contain the build-up of adverse inflation expectations and the possible acceleration of demand side inflationary pressures through excessive monetary and credit expansion”, stated the Central Bank.
These increases, according to the Governor, was also a proactive measure put forward by the Monetary Board which met on Thursday, the second time this year and signals a change in the way the Board manages inflation.
“The best way to manage inflation is to manage inflationary expectations. Inflation expectations could disrupt inflation stabilising in the single digit mid-range,” Dr. Coomaraswamy said and added that these interest rate increases would not have much impact on ordinary loan interests but was only a measure to curb inflation. In addition, the Governor pointed out that the tightening of monetary policy was also due to the Central Bank having to accommodate “bunching up of government borrowings in the first half of this year”. The rate hike, according to Dr.Coomaraswamy also remains in line with the US Federal Reserve hike in March,
“We wanted to maintain the same differential to discourage any outflows and to encourage inflows,”explained the Governor.
“There have been considerable outflows from the government securities market in early 2017 but that trend, according to the Governor has subsided, and in March 2017, there were some marginal inflows.The Sri Lankan Rupee however has depreciated by 1.2 percent against US dollar as well as other international currencies.
By the end of 2017, the Central Bank expects GDP growth to be at 5-5.5 percent.
Central Bank, Economic Research, Additional Director Dr.Chandranath Amarasekara explained that the reasons behind the tightening of the monetary policy and recent increase in market inflation rates was due to the prevailing drought conditions as well as adjustments to the existing tax structure. “There was a significant increase in imports at the start of this year due to imports of refined petroleum products given the energy requirements during the drought,”the Governor said. In addition, a widening trade deficit has also been observed, in 2016, it was USD 9.1 billion compared to USD 8.4 billion in 2015. In 2017 the trend is expected to continue as expenditure on imports increased by 13.2 percent in January 2017 with earnings through exports contracting by 1.1 percent.
Tourist arrivals which did well at the end of last year, has dropped by 0.1 percent, bringing earnings through it in February 2017 to USD 338.9 million, compared to January-February 2017 where it was at USD 715.2 million.
‘Worker remittances on the other hand have seen a marginal improvement with January 2017 reporting an increase by 1.4 percent to USD 571.6 million. In addition the Monetary Board had also taken into account the “notable achievements in fiscal operations which have resulted in overall budget deficit in 2016 declining,”Dr.Amarasekara added.
“We are not happy with the current growth of the economy so we don’t want to choke the economy too much”, said the Governor as he hoped that interest rates would remain steady in the immediate future, along with hope for the rains to arrive by at least April-May and a more positive global economy.
