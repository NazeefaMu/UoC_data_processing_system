Candidates cannot enter polling centres with armed security: EC Chariman

Election Commission (EC) Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya has issued instructions to all concerned returning officers, countrywide, that all Ministers and Members of Parliament (MPs) should not be allowed to enter polling centres on February 10, with armed security personnel.
Accordingly, ministers and other politicians have to keep their security guards outside of the polling centres and thereafter only, should they be allowed to enter polling centres for supervising or other official matters, without security guards.
Meanwhile, two police officers would be deployed at each polling centre with guns and the IGP has instructed that those police officers on duty can fire their weapons, if anyone tries to loot or plunder ballot papers. These facts have been confirmed by the Police Department and the Election Commission, said Kurunegala Senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake, while addressing a meeting of public servants who were selected to be deployed on election duty in Kurunegala, yesterday.
