‘Abishekam’ to bless Army marking anniversary

An ‘Abishekam’ pooja was held at Shri Ponnambalawaneswaram Kovil in Colombo on Thursday to bless the Sri Lanka Army, which is marking its 69th anniversary on October 10.
Organised by the Sri Lanka Army Hindu Association, the 'Abishekam' pooja invoked blessings on the Army Flag, after taking it to the inner chamber of the Kovil, amid the recital of mantras and other religious rites.
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake was welcomed to the kovil by Major General Shantha Thirunavukarasu, Chairman, Army Hindu Association and Senior Officers.
Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake handed over the Army Flag to the Kurukkal (priests) for blessings. The chief priest led the offerings and bestowed blessings on the Army and prayed for its well-being and longevity. A 10-member group of Hindu priests, led by Chief Kurukkal Siva Sri Sureshwara performed the pooja.
The ‘Abishekam’ pooja, comprised the offering of fruits, ghee and other items, is regarded as one of the most divine rituals in Hinduism where statues of deities are bathed with water or fragrant substances. Lieutenant General Senanayake made a symbolic cash donation to the temple. Chief of Staff Major General Dampath Fernando, Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Ajith Kariyakarawana, Adjutant General Major General Shavendra Silva, Senior Officers and Other Rankers participated.
