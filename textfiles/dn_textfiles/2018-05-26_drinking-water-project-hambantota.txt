Drinking water project in Hambantota

The Ruhunupura water supply project provides drinking water to 112,000 people in the Hambantota district in addition to the commercial and industrial demands.
The Ridiyagama tank at Ambalantota and Kachchigalara provides water to this project with the approval of the Irrigation and Water Resources Management Ministry.
The project director Kahaduwa said the provision of drinking water had received high priority under the greater Hambantota development plan.
