Rain, a spoiler at Royal grounds
Only 32.3 overs of play was possible in the under 19 division one cricket encounter between Thurstan College and Royal College which commenced at the Royal College grounds yesterday.
The start was delayed until 2pm due to dampness of the wicket and play had to be called off due to bad light at 4.48pm.
Royal invited to bat first were 84/1 at tea but lost two quick wickets in the deteriorating light and were 99/3 at sumps. Openers Madara Thqlduwa (34) and Ronuka Jayawardena (33) shared an opening stand of 62 while Naveen Jayawardena was rewarded with two wickets.
Royal 99/3 in 32.3 overs - Madara Thalduwa 34, Ronuka Jayawardena 33, Naveen Gunawardena 2/40, Janushka Fernando 1/09
