Regained GSP Plus: Great Victory for Sri Lanka

Regained GSP Plus is a great victory for Sri Lanka, the country receives 500 million US dollars in foreign exports by regaining GSP. It was lost because of the short-sighted policies of the previous regime.The country will receive a new lease of life through this victory, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at the opening of the Samasaranagama Housing Complex. The opening ceremony was held marking the UNP 70th anniversary and Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa’s 50th birthday.
The Prime Minister said the GSP facility is awarded to countries where democracy reigns and where democratic rights, law and order is maintained. A transition period will dawn to Hambantota when the industrial zone is implemented. Hambantota needs about 2000 industrial ventures, he said.
The Prime Minister said 95 percent of state land will be used for these ventures.The country was greatly indebted due to the the Hambantota seaport construction and other similar haphazard projects carried out by the previous regime.
The government has to pay 1,900 million US dollars to settle the loans, but country has no funds. “If we do not follow this, we have to burden people with all sorts of taxes,” the Prime Minister said.
When the industrial zone project was launched last week, many protested. The country’s other parts can have industrial ventures if Hambantota does not want them, he said. Ministers of other districts request for industrial ventures, but a highest number of poor people live in Hambantota, the Prime Minister said. “Therefore, it was our bounden duty to set up the industrial ventures in Hambbantota and provide job opportunities to the educated jobless youth, he said.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa are dead against the provision of jobs to the underprivileged youth in the region, he said. “Why Mahinda Rajapaksa is against this, he queried. “We will not confine industrial zones only to Hambantota. We will expand them to other regions as well,” the Prime Minister said.
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said 2.5 million of families in Sri Lanka, 1,90,000 of them do not have houses to live and 79 percent in Hambantota remain homeless. Rs. 2.2 million was spent on providing electricity and Rs. 1.6 million to provide water and Rs. 3.20 million to construct roads for the housing scheme. 264 udagammanas are being set up now. In 2010, the GSP facility was taken and garment factories were closed, the minister recalled
Every minister was told by the Prime Minister to carry out something valuable to mark the 70th anniversary of the party. Housing complexes were built and are being built, the Prime Minister said.
The Fisheries State Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi, Hema Premadasa, Jalani Premadasa, Hambantota District Secretary W.H. Karunaratna, Housing and Construction Ministry Secretary W.K.K.Athrukorala, Lunugamwehera DS I.R.K.Vitharana were present.
