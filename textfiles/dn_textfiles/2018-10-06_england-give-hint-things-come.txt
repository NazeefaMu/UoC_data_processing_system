Win tour opener with conviction
England give hint of things to come

The touring England side gave a hint of what to expect in the upcoming five-match ODI series when they made a winning start to their tour with a 43-run win under the Duckworth/Lewis rain rule over Sri Lanka Board XI at the P Sara Oval yesterday.
England were well ahead in their chase for a target of 288 scoring an impressive 215-2 off 35.3 overs when bad light and rain put an end to the match.
England were set on course for their win by Joe Root and one-day captain Eoin Morgan who figured in an unbroken third wicket partnership of 174.
Both batsmen were going neck and neck towards their centuries when the game ended. Root’s knock of 90 not out came off 92 balls with eight fours and Morgan struck nine fours and three sixes in his unbeaten innings of 91 off 84 balls.
England lost openers Jason Roy (27) and Jonny Bairstow (3) cheaply to be 41-2 before Root and Morgan took control.
Earlier Board XI skipper Dinesh Chandimal and Sri Lanka under 19 world cup captain Kamindu Mendis struck impressive half centuries to enable their team to reach a competitive score of 287-9 after deciding to bat first.
Chandimal who will lead Sri Lanka in the one-day series against England starting at Dambulla on October 10 hit seven fours and one six in his innings of 77 off 85 balls. Mendis coming to the wicket with the score at 128-4 hit an aggressive 61 off 72 balls (5 fours) to lead the late charge with Isuru Udana who played a cameo innings of 40 off 26 balls with three sixes and three fours.
England will take on the Board XI in another 50-over warm-up game at the same venue today. AFP
