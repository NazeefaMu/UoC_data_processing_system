Team XYZ emerge champions at Virtusa LAN Challenge 2018

Team XYZ from General Sir John Kotelawala Defense University (KDU) beat team In Toxic from Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) to emerge as the champions of Virtusa LAN Challenge 2018. Team XYZ were the winners of the prize money worth Rs.100,000, at the finals held at Virtusa’s Colombo Advanced Technology Centre (ATC) recently.
Team MBK from Virtusa were the winners in the Inter Virtusa category.
Congratulating teamXYZ, Chandika Mendis, Executive Vice President – Technology at Virtusa said, “Competitive gaming has grown in to an international professional sport. It helps develop vital skills such as strategic thinking, collaboration and team work. Having realized its potential, we launched Virtusa LAN Challenge in 2011and we are delighted to engage undergraduate tech students from our universitiesacross the country.”
Organized by the Virtusa Game Development Special Interest Group (GDSIG) and the Virtusa Campus Reach Initiative with the support of the company’s technology leadership, the gaming tournament has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a low key internal team building initiative in 2011.
This year’s event was kicked off in December 2017. Eighty teams participated at the Internal University games while thirty of them were invited to Virtusa to play at the quarter finals at the inter- University games.
Virtusa LAN Challenge 2018 was based on the award-winning multi player video game ‘Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.’
