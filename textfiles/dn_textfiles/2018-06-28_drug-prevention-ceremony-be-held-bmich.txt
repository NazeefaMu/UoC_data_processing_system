Drug-prevention ceremony to be held at BMICH

A National ceremony to mark the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (which fell on June 22), will be held on July 2 at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
During the ceremony, vocational training opportunities would be provided for 10 persons who underwent treatment and rehabilitation successfully. Ten children who are in schooling age but do not attend schools due to drug-addiction, would be admitted to schools again. Certificates would be awarded to Non-Governmental Treatment Centres that offer treatment for drug addicts. Several island-wide programmes are to be held from June 22 to June 26 as well.
The official Facebook page of the National Dangerous Drug Control Board (NDDCB) would be launched during the week. A drug-prevention and training programme will be held on July 1 at the Sri Lanka Navy camp located in Boossa, Galle. A mobile drug-prevention campaign will be held on June 30 at Magolla in Galle, in order to educate people on the negative impacts of drug abuse.
Programmes will be held island-wide on June 29 to educate schoolchildren and public servants on the impact of drug abuse. A mobile drug-prevention campaign will be held at Thotalanga in Colombo. The last programme (a mobile drug-prevention campaign) of the series, will be held in Monaragala on July 16.
