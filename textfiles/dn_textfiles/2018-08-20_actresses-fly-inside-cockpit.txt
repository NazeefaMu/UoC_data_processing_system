Actresses fly inside cockpit?

Two Sri Lankan actresses had reportedly flown in the cockpit of a SriLankan flight thanks to the the connection they had with a first officer.
The two actresses had travelled in the cockpit of the flight with a first officer who was travelling as a passenger .
It was reported that the two actresses had travelled in the cockpit till the end of their travel and the two actresses had had their snacks and beverages inside the cockpit. Some passengers travelling in the same flight in the Business Class had objected the conduct of the first officer and the two actresses.
Aviation regulations prohibit passengers entering the pilot’s cabin for security reasons and the safety of other passengers.
One of the actresses had released some photographs to her Instagram account which she had taken in Singapore.
