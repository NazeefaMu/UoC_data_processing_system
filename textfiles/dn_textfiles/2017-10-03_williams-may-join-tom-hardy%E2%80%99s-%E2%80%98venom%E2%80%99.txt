Williams may join Tom Hardy’s ‘Venom’

Rumor has it that Michelle Williams has been enlisted to play the female lead in ‘Venom’ that stars Tom Hardy as the Spider-Man supervillain-turned-antihero.
Williams, four-time Oscar nominee for films such as ‘Manchester by the Sea’, ‘My Week With Marilyn,’ ‘Blue Valentine’ and ‘Brokeback Mountain,’ might possibly play Hardy’s love interest in the Spider-Man spin-off, reports suggest.
The film also stars Emmy-winning actor Riz Ahmed and will be directed by ‘Zombieland’ director Ruben Fleischer, which Sony hopes will be the first in a series of films based on ‘Spider-Man’ characters. However, the character details of the movie are not revealed yet. Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner will write the script, with Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach producing the movie, along with Amy Pascal.
