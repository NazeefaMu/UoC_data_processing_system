More people interested in donating organs: Consultant

More people are donating their organs in Sri Lanka now and there is a significant increase in the donation of body organs of the deceased during the recent past, Consultant in Medical Administration and CEO/ Director of the National Institute for Nephrology Dialysis and Transplantation Dr. Rathnasiri A. Hewage said.
According to Dr. Hewage only six kidneys of brain dead persons were received last year but during the last nine months this year, a total of 19 kidneys of brain dead persons were received for transplantation. This is a significant increase of donations.
Meanwhile, Health Ministry sources said now, any Sri Lankan can simply fill a form and declare his/her willingness to donate kidneys if he/she dies suddenly. A special membership card will be issued after filling the relevant form to be handed over to health authorities.
The next of kin can also give the consent on behalf of a person who is declared `brain dead’ after an accident etc. The brain dead condition is to be confirmed by two doctors including one specialist.
One donor can save two lives. Any Sri Lankan who is above the age of 18 and who does not have any obvious kidney problem and who does not have infectious diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis B or C, can give prior consent to donate kidneys after death, the sources added.
