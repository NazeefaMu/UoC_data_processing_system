Paper fashion

Russian artist Asya Kozina unveiled her Baroque Paper Wigs series, with new paper creations titled ‘Skyscraper on the Head’. Between paper sculpture and paper cut, this new series of paper art imagines the improbable encounter between baroque wigs and modern elements, giving birth to light and delicate creations. An impressive work to follow on her Behance portfolio. Ufunk
