Nominations only for loyal candidates: Duminda

Nominations will not be given from the SLFP ticket for those who acted in a detrimental manner to the party's unity and dignity, SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake said. He said only the honest and loyal candidates would be given nominations during interviews to select candidates for local government elections.
Dissanayake expressed his confidence that the SLFP would win the majority of local government bodies.
He said the selection of candidates has started now for the upcoming local government elections.
