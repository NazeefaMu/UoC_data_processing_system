Sampanthan writes to President on land issue

Opposition and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan has written to President Maithripala Sirisena on the land issues in several areas of the North.
Sampanthan in his letter thanked the President for meeting him and a TNA delegation recently to discuss the issue.
The Opposition Leader said 54 blocks of land have been handed over to their owners.
“There are 30 other persons who owned lands earlier, but do not have permits. They are entitled to be given the lands they possessed earlier. They had not obtained permits due to the prevalent situation at the time," the letter reads.
The Government Agent in the area should be able to obtain the necessary information. These 30 persons owned lands earlier, and therefore, they should be issued permits. The houses on these blocks of lands were destroyed. The people should be provided with housing and other facilities,” the Opposition leader said.
The persons who were demonstrating against being kept out of their lands, have called off their demonstration. The Opposition leader thanks the President and other authorities for the expeditious action taken to hand back these lands.
Sampanthan stated in his letter that following his discussion with the President, action is being taken to return 142 perches of land to the Killinochchi Maha Vidyalayam.
Sampanthan said the Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalayam has around 2500 students. The school is short of accommodation, particularly for the primary section. It urgently needs more accommodation and a playground. The opposition leader said he visited the school and saw the difficult position the students face.
“The balance land should be released soon. I shall be grateful if action is taken to release the balance land also to the Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalayam authorities at the earliest,” Sampanthan said.
