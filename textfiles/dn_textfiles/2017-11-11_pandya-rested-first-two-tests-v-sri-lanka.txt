Pandya rested for first two Tests v Sri Lanka

Hardik Pandya has been pulled out of the squad for the first two Tests against Sri Lanka due to begin on November 16. A media release from the BCCI said the selection committee had taken the call in consultation with the team management so as to lessen the allrounder's chances of injury.
“Considering Mr Pandya's heavy recent workload, the decision was made to negate any possibility of a major injury concern. Mr Pandya will undergo a period of strength at conditioning at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru.”
There is a likelihood as well that Virat Kohli might be rested for the third Test against Sri Lanka, and perhaps even the limited-overs matches that follow, with an eye towards keeping the India captain fit and refreshed for the tour of South Africa at the start of 2018.
India Test squad for the first two Tests: Virat Kohli (captain), KL Rahul, M Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane (vice-capt), Rohit Sharma, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ishant Sharma.
