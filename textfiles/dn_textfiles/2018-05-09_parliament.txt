It is too late for Govt. to fulfill promises made to people: Minister Fonseka
With the government having completed three years of their term and less than two years to go, it is already to late to fulfil the promises made to the people prior to the next election, said Minister Sarath Fonseka.
“We are already too late. It should have been done before and now we are running out of time. Unless there is some dedicated system, especially without any interference, we could not achieve our target,” he said, speaking to the Daily News during the tea party held at Parliament yesterday, subsequent to the ceremonial opening of the second session of the 8th Parliament.
He noted that while the people had expected the government to bring in the large scale fraudsters and criminals of the previous regime to book, the government had failed to fulfil this task during the past three years, due to various issues. “There are a few hiccups and drawbacks, but we have to overcome all that and achieve our target because we have promised the people to fulfil their expectations. We are unable make excuses and it is now up to those who have been entrusted with this task, to rise up to the challenge and fulfill their responsibility.”
When asked if said target of the government in bringing those responsible for large scale fraud and crimes to book is achievable given the short span of time left for the government, he said, “Now there is no choice and those who have been entrusted with this responsibility, will have to carry out their responsibility and deliver the results expected by the people. There is a very short time left, but if the right strategy is implemented, this task is achievable,” he said.
Based on President’s policy statement, strong programme needed to take country forward: Patali
Based on the Policy statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, the Government needs to come up with a strong programme to take the country forward, said Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
Speaking to the Daily News during the tea party held at the Parliament complex yesterday, he noted that in order to regain the faith of the people, the government needed to formulate a mechanism that would fast track development, while taking special efforts to fulfill the promises made to the people.
“I too have presented such a programme to the Cabinet, including 47 special points that would enable the government to achieve this target. By next year, we would be facing another election and in order to retain the current votes and gain victory, we need a comprehensive programme that would promote economic and social progress,” he added.
Nothing constructive had resulted from ceremonial opening of Eighth Parliament: Bimal
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said nothing constructive or new had resulted from yesterday’s Ceremonial Opening of the Second Session of the Eighth Parliament.
“In fact, I have made a request to Parliament to disclose to the people how much was spent for yesterday’s ceremony with all its pomp and pageantry. There was nothing new that was mentioned by the President in his speech yesterday either. The President prorogued Parliament with the aim of resolving the internal crisis within the government. Due to it, over 1,000 issues that is affecting the country, had to be postponed and delayed. Similarly, over thousands of petitions have also been delayed,” he noted.
MP Ratnayake said that by the suspension of Parliament, the country had not gained anything and there had not been any political advantage either. “Hence, I don’t see this move as a useful exercise.”
Commenting on the 16 SLFP members who crossed over to the Opposition yesterday, Ratnayake said it was politically ethical for them to have taken up seats in the Opposition as they had supported the No Confidence Motion and voted against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe at the recent No Confidence motion that was brought against him by the Joint Opposition. “President Maithripala Sirisena made an effort to defeat Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, which was the result of a power struggle. However, I don’t feel that it would be of great advantage to the country, no matter what side they are on, but it is a good move as it reduces the number of ministers within the government,” he said.
When asked if the crossing over of the 16 members onto the Opposition was acceptable, while the Maze was on the podium, he said that the maze being there is a mere legal formality and it had no effect on the crossing over of Government MPs to the Opposition. “The maze is a mere ornament, which has no bearing on any member deciding to cross over. It is a right of Parliament members to cross over to any side they desire which could be done any time,” he explained.

Two amended Bills to empower CIABOC to be presented in House
The Government will present two amendment Bills in Parliament today, to empower the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) and file cases based on facts revealed by Commissions of Inquiry.
The Bills to amend the Commissions of Inquiry Act (Chapter 393) and the Bribery Act (Chapter 26), will be presented at the commencement of sittings today.
