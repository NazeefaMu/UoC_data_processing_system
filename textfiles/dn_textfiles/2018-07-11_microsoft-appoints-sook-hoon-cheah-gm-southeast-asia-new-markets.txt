Microsoft has appointed Sook Hoon Cheah as the General Manager for the Southeast Asia New Markets within Asia Pacific.
She is responsible for accelerating customers’ digital transformation in the region and scaling the partner ecosystem across Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
“I’m excited about this role, given the significant untapped opportunities in the Southeast Asia New Markets, their eagerness to go to cloud and become digital economies. My experiences in emerging markets, emerging technologies and small and medium enterprises across Asia Pacific gives me a unique view on how we, as a community, can work together.
I’m looking forward to work with the teams to increase the skills capabilities, the technological infrastructure and drive national growth in the Southeast Asia New Markets. With digital transformation expected to bolster the Asia Pacific GDP with more than USD 1 trillion by 2021, I’m focused on growing a sustainable partner eco system in the region, and I know that my experiences working on channel enablement programs and small and medium enterprises will be key to move the economic needle in these markets,” said Sook Hoon.
Sook Hoon brings 25 years of technology leadership experience and is a 21-year veteran of Microsoft. She has extensive experience in leading scale business across corporate and SMEs and building partner ecosystem across Asia Pacific. Prior to this role, she was the Director for Small-Medium Businesses in APAC and before joining Microsoft, Sook Hoon worked for Sybase in a regional capacity.
Sook Hoon reports to Andrea Della Mattea, President, Microsoft Asia Pacific. “I’m thrilled to have Sook Hoon lead the Southeast Asia New Markets, one of the most dynamic regions in Asia Pacific. Her commitment to building digital communities and relationships across the small and medium enterprise markets as well as the partner ecosystems in other countries makes her ideal to lead the Southeast Asia New Markets.
I’m also appreciative of her continued passion in coaching and mentoring women as she paves the way for talent and future leaders in Asia Pacific.”
She takes over from Michelle Simmons, who is moving from Asia to Europe, taking up the role of General Manager - Marketing & Operations for Central Eastern Europe.
