Police investigate death of DS official

Anguruwatota Police yesterday launched an investigation into the death of 39-year-old Nandasiri Devage Upul Ranjan, who was attached to the Dodangoda Divisional Secretariat (DS) in Kalutara. The victim, a father of three, had been carrying on a liaison with a Grama Niladhari (GN) in the area, who is currently pregnant.
He had been staying at a guest house with the said GN at the Yalagala junction in Anguruwatota during the past few months. The victim was attacked at the guest house yesterday, at 3.30 am, by two assailants. However, the suspects as well as the GN, had fled the scene, the guest house manager said. Horana Acting Magistrate Chandana Wijesuriya had ordered a magisterial inquiry into the matter, along with an autopsy. A mobile phone and a pair of shoes were discovered at the scene of the crime.
The GN had been apprehended and interrogated. Investigations are continuing.
