Iceland heroics bring England to their knees

Nice, Monday: Iceland's football Vikings fought back from a goal down to beat England 2-1 at Euro 2016 in one of the biggest shocks in the sport's history that forced the immediate resignation of England manager Roy Hodgson.
Wayne Rooney put England ahead from the penalty spot inside five minutes in Nice. Within another 75 seconds Ragnar Sigurdsson had equalised and in the 18th minute Kolbeinn Sigthorsson set England on the way to humiliation.
England never looked like getting back into the game and virtually the whole team slumped to the ground when the final whistle went. Iceland's players and fans erupted with joy at the country's greatest sporting moment.
Hodgson, 68, came out after the game to announce his resignation in a statement.
"I'm extremely disappointed of course about tonight's result and ultimately our exit from the competition. We haven't progressed as far as I thought we were capable of, and that's obviously not acceptable," he said.
"We are in the results business," he added. "Now is the time for someone else to oversee the progress of this young, hungry and extremely talented group of players."
Amid wild celebrations, Iceland took the last quarter-final place and will now face host nation France in Paris on Sunday.
Earlier, Italy dumped defending champions Spain out of the contest, winning 2-0 to end a 22-year run without a win over their rivals. Italy must next face world champions Germany.
England's performance ranks alongside some of the most dismal at major tournaments. England already feature on the list of shame with their 1-0 defeat to an amateur United States side at the 1950 World Cup.
Iceland's man of the match Ragnar Sigurdsson, who scored Iceland's opener, said England's over-confidence was behind their humiliating defeat.
"They thought this would be a walk in the park," said Sigurdsson. "But we had faith in our ability."
England, ranked 11th in the world, were left cursing a blunder by goalkeeper Joe Hart that led to the second goal by the world 34th-ranked Icelanders, the smallest nation to appear at a major tournament. Sigthorsson's tame shot squirmed past Hart for the winner.
Raheem Sterling was fouled by Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Halldorsson to lay on Rooney's penalty into the left corner to crown his 115th England appearance, which tied David Beckham's record for an outfield player.
But barely 75 seconds later, Iceland were level. A trademark Aron Gunnarsson long throw-in reached Kari Arnason who headed on and Sigurdsson volleyed the ball in from close range. Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jon Dadi Bodvarsson worked the ball to Sigthorsson and with England's defenders standing off, the Nantes striker rolled a shot goalwards that Hart did not get close to.
Former England captain Gary Linker called the result "the worst defeat in our history". He added on Twitter: "England beaten by a country with more volcanoes than professional footballers. Well played Iceland."
Another ex-captain Alan Shearer said the England performance was "pathetic."
Spain's coach Vicente del Bosque was also forced to fend off questions about his future after his defending champions lost 2-0 to Italy in Paris.
Giorgio Chiellini and Graziano Pelle scored as Italy exacted revenge for their 4-0 hammering by Spain in the Euro 2012 final.
The landmark victory set up an epic Italy-Germany quarter-final.
Chiellini forced home the first goal from close range after goalkeeper David de Gea could only parry Eder's fiercely struck free-kick. Pelle volleyed in a deflected cross in injury time to complete Spain's heartbreak.
"It has been and is a great era for Spanish football," said del Bosque.
"We have Italy ahead of us for the World Cup qualifiers in Russia and we have to prepare for that," he added.
"I don't think an era has ended. Spanish football is very well structured -- there are good academies, very good players and very good clubs."
Italy manager Antonio Conte said team work and a united spirit that England could not muster had inspired their win.
"Right from the outset since I took over I have said that the only route forward to achieve a semblance of success is to try and be a like a club team," said Conte, who will take over Chelsea at the end of the tournament. "We have to be a collective." AFP
