Expelling irresponsible party organisers: SP Chief Minister lauds President's action

President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to expel party organisers who did not comply with party obligations and responsibilities and live up to the expectations of party leadership was timely and fitting, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said.
The Chief Minister was speaking at a convention of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Women’s Organisation of the Ambalangoda electorate recently.
He said President Sirisena led the party democratically. He provided opportunities for all to work independently rendering the party's vision and mission. However, some organisers acted against party policies and decisions. He was not in a hurry to initiate action against nonconformists. The President gave them enough time to be self-corrected. But they acted on their wrong political assumptions. The President had to take action against such wayward party men for the benefit of the party, the Chief Minister said.
He said some persons preferred to engage in politics depending on individuals. But a political party does not exist on a single person’s political charisma. Such illogical political exercises are not enduring, he said.
Chief Minister de Silva said the duty and obligation of an organiser is to act according to the party's decisions, upholding the party vision and mission. He should carry the party message to the public. If an organiser advocates any political doctrine that is against the party ideology, it is not a genuine political exercise. Such political moves are unethical and indecorous. If certain persons want to act according to their personal political whims, they should resign from responsibilities without betraying the party and party leadership. The party leadership has the right take a decision on such persons, the Chief Minister said.
