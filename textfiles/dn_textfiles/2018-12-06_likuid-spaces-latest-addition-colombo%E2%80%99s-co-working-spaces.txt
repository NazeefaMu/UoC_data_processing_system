Likuid Spaces - The latest addition to Colombo’s co-working spaces

The world of freelancers and entrepreneurs is not what it was ten years ago. The advent of the gig economy and ultra-competitive start-ups have given rise to a considerable independent self-employed workforce, and along with it has risen the need to accommodate this growing sector. The exigencies of the self-employed are not what it used to be either. The need for networking, growth, healthy workspaces and social needs of the self-employed are better understood now than it was a decade ago. The way we work is changing, and so are the spaces we work in.
Enter co-working spaces, a novel and ingenious concept revolutionising the way freelancers and entrepreneurs work. What started as a financially prudent alternative to working in seclusion at home or in coffee shops in Silicon Valley has now become a global trend combining independence with the structure and community of a traditional office space.
Beginning in the mid 2000s in San Francisco, co-working spaces were incepted in order to foster the needs of the growing freelance workforce in Silicon Valley’s expeditiously growing start-up community. Since then the trend has proliferated to Europe, where it caters to 35 percent of the world’s freelancers, and Asia with 28 percent. The popularity of co-working spaces in Asia is considerably noteworthy, the trend taking hold in India, China, Singapore, Hong-Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines. Tech capitals in particular, with its legions of self-employed freelancers and entrepreneurs and lack of accommodations, find co-working spaces essential. The demand for co-working spaces in India is growing too. Over the last year the country has seen a swell of co-working spaces popping up, with as many as 200 spaces already in the country.
Likuid Spaces is a new, innovative and exciting start-up venture that embodies the ideals of co-working spaces. Making a splash in Sri Lanka’s co-working market, Likuid Spaces flourishingly outcompetes the rest. Embellished with themed rooms for gaming, *board meetings or workshops (other themes)* it is ideal for freelancers, entrepreneurs and start-ups to exercise their creativity, network and grow, all the while maintaining a healthy and fun atmosphere sure to ensure one’s wellbeing. Providing digital marketing solutions, Likuid Spaces rents spaces for events and classes, along with handling all marketing related aspects of events conducted in their spaces.
The demand for co-working spaces can be understood better given the alternative of working in seclusion. Beyond the convenience of space, co-working spaces bring a host of other benefits to the table. It allows freelancers and entrepreneurs to be part of a community, which they could use to network and grow. With people of multiple disciplines, backgrounds and perspectives collaborating in one space, it fosters creativity and innovation. Co-working spaces have been proven to improve wellbeing too. Along with doing away with feelings of isolation that comes with self-employment, the constant interaction with like minded individuals gives us motivation, which in turn enhances creativity.
Recently, Likuid Spaces hosted their open day. A cheerful day full of events, gaming, workshops, as well as, popcorn, candy floss, yoga, and a deck with a delicious BBQ on the roast. It was open for all interested to discover an exciting and valuable co-working space and a day filled with festivities. It was the perfect occasion to check out Likuid Spaces for those looking for a workspace, and for those seeking to attend different classes and experience something new. It was a day of music, fun and laughter, so join the Likuid team to change the way you work.
Likuid Spaces was also joined by their partners Prana Lounge Colombo, Isso, Workout.lk, Raffles Colombo, Bandwagon, Surge Global, LoveBoxx, Pendi, Igniter Space, 3D Concepts, Yakoob MMA & Fitness, Mindful Travels, Bakes by Bella and Paan Paan for their open day. A panel discussion with the Director of Growth from coworker.com, Loshini Selvarajah, and other co-working space proprietors, was also conducted later in the evening.
No longer do we see workspaces as drab and mechanical. Traditional offices don’t exist anymore, and co-working spaces are the future of freelancing and entrepreneurship. The way we work is changing.
