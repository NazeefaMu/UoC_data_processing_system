AIA Insurance Lanka secures Listing Exemption from Insurance Regulatory Commission of SL

AIA Insurance Lanka PLC (“AIA Insurance Lanka” or the “Company”), a public listed company, announced its intention to delist from the Colombo Stock Exchange (“CSE”), subject to obtaining requisite approvals.
AIA Insurance Lanka Director & Chief Officer Legal, Chathuri Munaweera said, “The Regulation of Insurance Industry (Amendment) Act No.23 of 2017 enables local subsidiary insurance companies of foreign companies listed on a stock exchange outside Sri Lanka to be exempted from their obligation to be listed, if the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka is satisfied that such subsidiary meets specified statutory criteria. As already disclosed to the CSE on 20 July 2018, AIA Insurance Lanka’s application for exemption from being listed on a licensed stock exchange, (based on the strength of its ultimate holding / parent company AIA Group Limited (“AIA Group”), which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Limited), has been approved by the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka”.
Pankaj Banerjee, CEO of AIA Insurance Lanka added, “As disclosed by AIA Group in its Voluntary Offer during 2013, it has been AIA Group’s ultimate objective, subject to legal and regulatory requirements and having obtained all necessary regulatory approvals, to delist AIA Insurance Lanka from the CSE. This is consistent with the target operating model followed by AIA Group, where its insurance operating units are held as wholly owned subsidiaries wherever possible and permissible, with the parent company being the only publicly listed entity.”
“AIA Company Limited, the principal operating company of AIA Group and an existing shareholder of AIA Insurance Lanka, will make an offer to purchase all other existing shares at a price of LKR 1,000 per share for purposes of the proposed delisting of AIA Insurance Lanka. The Company will convene an Extraordinary General Meeting in relation to this matter shortly”, he added.
William Lisle, Chairman of AIA Insurance Lanka, reiterated AIA Group’s commitment to Sri Lanka, saying “AIA is fully committed to continued growth and investment in Sri Lanka for the benefit of our customers, as well as for the local community and economy. Our intent to delist is a reaffirmation of our commitment to the Sri Lankan market which has very good growth potential. We have invested heavily to provide our customers with leading products and services and we will continue to help many more people here live healthier, longer, better lives.”
