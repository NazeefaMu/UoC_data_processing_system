JVP urges govt to set up Truth Commission soon

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday urged the government to step up action to set up the proposed Truth Commission, pointing out that the recently passed Bill on establishing an Office of Missing Persons will be meaningless without a Truth Commission.
JVP National Organiser MP Bimal Ratnayaka said at a press conference at the JVP headquarters in Pelawatta, Battaramulla, a Truth Commission is needed to prevent the resurgence of past abuses and violence committed by one group on another.
“A Truth Commission is needed to restore civic trust and to induce peaceful-co-existence between different groups of society,” said Ratnayaka. “The country has long been in need for a Commission to look into those grievances and suffering of the people relevant to the final phase of the war,” he said. “The government has come up with an office which will find and analyse information on the people who have disappeared during the conflict. There is no Commission to find truth. The government must establish it,” he said.
