National Sangha Council berates Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya

Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya has distorted the vision and mission of late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera to fulfill NGO requirements, National Sangha Council President Ven. Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera said.
Addressing a press conference held at International Vipassana Meditation Centre in Colombo yesterday he said that Prof. Wijesuriya tried his best to cover up the Central Bank Bond issue while delivering his speech at late Sobitha Thera’s second commemoration held recently.
The President never promised to abolish the Executive Presidency but he promised to cut down unnecessary powers. He did it as promised in his ‘Maithree Paalanayak - Sthaawara Ratak’ policy (election manifesto) when the 19th Amendment was passed. Late Ven. Sobhitha Thera also endorsed the same stand after realizing the dangers of abolishing the Executive Presidency,the thera said.
The Chief Incumbent of International Vipassana Meditation Centre Ven.Ududumbara Kaashyapa Thera said Sri Lanka is heading towards destruction today because the truth cannot be told as it is. “The truth should be truth even when it is told by the persons we hate. The right cannot be wrong when it is done by our opponents.Tamils do not get harassed because they are Tamils and Sinhalese do not get huge benefits because they are Sinhalese.Power should not be given to provinces and ethnicities.Power should be given to the people who do not have a house to live, water to drink, food to eat, he said.
