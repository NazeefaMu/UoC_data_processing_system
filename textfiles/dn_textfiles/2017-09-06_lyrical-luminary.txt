Lyrical luminary

… blossom with kindness and blooms every day
In the mid-nineties I met a close friend who willingly helped me without any hesitation when he heard my plight. It was a blessing for my problem, which I was trying to overcome for days. Bandara went out of bounds to help me which was a difficult decision for him too.
Thus from there onwards I knew he was very understanding, caring, kind human being!
“A friend in need surpasses any other friends!”
****
It knows no divisions, nor borders nor creeds. But thrive among thoughtfulness, Sowing fresh seeds.
Unseeking, unselfish and eager to share,
Love triumphs in trouble and shines / through despair
Zris Hesselden
In the meantime I saw him grow step by step in the field of art; actor, assistant director (I guess), lyrics writer – (which I felt his medium of expression) and up to the peak of ‘events director’. He excelled in lyrics writing which brought him fame in the one act tele drama of (late veteran) Wijaya Dharmasri’s “Bhagya”; It was created for the “Mahapola Scholarship Promotion” within a night Bandara’s theme song lyrics were murmuring in our lips.
“Maha merak lesata – Sithe upan barata
Hada doda velapena hinda//
[a giant of a rock – weighing is within mind]
His lyrics are derived from the classical prose of the Sinhala Literature, the words, the rhythm and rhyme is always visible in his lyric writing.
He belongs to the school of “Yovun Pahan Veta” (a youth creative programme of the – late Dharmasiri Gamage. Though a graduate of Peradeniya University, he has roots in the soil of the village. He is down hearted as a human being, who is always with his colleague’s reasonable needs. The mutual trust is his motto.
Beginning from tele dramas he graduated in film lyric writing with the most successful film maker for entertainment in Sri Lanka, Udayakantha Warnasuriya’s “Rajya Sevaya Pinisai”(on public service) theme song; it bagged his Award for Best Lyrics Writer in films.
Apart from that, Bandara has not lost his links with the theatre where he began his first rehearsal in Dr Jayalath Manoratna’s musical Andarela for which he wrote lyrics based on folk tradition.
Bandara since then has worked with many filmmakers. He has written lyrics always with a difference grown into a fully-fledged artist. Bandara was one of the producers of Serenity Productions, which last year (2016) won majority of the prominent Raigam Tele Awards.
As an events director he is in charge of the “Swarna Pusthala” Award Ceremony (Golden Book Award for the Best Sinhala Novel of the year) for several years from the beginning of the ceremony.
He had the knack for building himself. With a long way of ups and downs, he has risen to the pinnacle of success. Actually it’s an exploration, of himself. In 1994 he had some links with politics, but slowly and steadily he has faded away from the unruly political arena.
Bandara is now grown up as an independent artiste in Sri Lanka. It is a hard task with the blessing of his admirers.
A faithful husband and father of three children Bandara is a man of courage with a vision. He enjoys through creations and writings. One of his songs, written on the occasion of his daughter’s wedding, is now an added feature in all wedding ceremonies.
Most of all other beautiful things. In life comes by twos and threes! By dozens and hundreds… plenty of Roses, Stars, Sunsets, Rainbows…” but, the creation of an artist is a song of life. Bandara Eheliyagoda has created something unique for his admirers and to all Sinhala song lovers. As a friend and admirer I wish him good health and pray for more adorable creations too.
Blow – Blow thou winter wind,
Thuo art not so unkind
As man’s ingratitude
(As you like it)
