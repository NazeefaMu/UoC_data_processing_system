Hotel owners in Tangalle blamed of polluting sea

Several hotels in Tangalle pollute the sea to great extent, residents said.
They release contaminated water and garbage to the sea jeopardizing fish varieties and fisher folk lose their livelihood as result.
The residents allege that hotel owners continue releasing polluted water to the sea and dump garbage recklessly since many officers in the law enforcement section in the area are in favour of them.
