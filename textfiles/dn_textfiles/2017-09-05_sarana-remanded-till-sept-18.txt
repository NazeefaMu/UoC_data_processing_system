This is for alleged misuse of a state vehicle valued over Rs.8 million, while he was serving as the Chairman of Development Lotteries Board during the previous regime. Former Deputy Minister was arrested by Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) over offences he is alleged to have committed under Public Property Act.

The Magistrate ordered to remand the suspect till September 18 citing that there is no exceptional circumstances to release him on bail. President’s Counsel Anil Silva with Jayantha Dias Nanayakkara appeared for the suspect. On July 20, former Petroleum Industries Deputy Minister Sarana Gunawardena who pleaded guilty in two corruption cases filed against him by Bribery Commission had been ordered to pay a fine of Rs.2000 by Colombo Chief Magistrate.
