‘Western Provincial Council to blame for Meethotamulla’: Patali

 
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has said the Western Provincial Council was responsible for the Meethotamulla disaster.
“Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya complains that the Megapolis and Western Development Minister is sole responsibility for the Meethotamulla dumpsite collapse. The responsibility to manage the dumpsite falls under the responsibility of the Colombo Municipal Council and the Municipal Councils fall under the control of the Provincial Council. Therefore it is the Western Provincial Council that is responsible,” the Minister said.
The Minister further challenged Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya to an open dialogue, saying however that with or without a dialogue, the Western Provincial Council was to blame for the Meethotamulla tragedy.
