Environmental issues raised

Construction will commence in March on the Indola Dusit Thani complex in Balapitiya, a 20-storey mega-development project that will sit directly on the coastline.
The development, costing Rs. 3 billion, includes two residential towers, eight pools, 15 restaurants, and an art convention and exhibition centre. One-bedroom units will sell for just under $250,000 and three-bedroom apartments will cost around $750,000.A promotional video for the project notes that the buildings are the “one and only beachfront development available to foreign investors,” and that they will sit on “450 metres of pristine, absolute beach front.” This is in violation of a law that states hotels must be built a minimum 300 metres from the sea.
However, the Coastal Conservation Department has approved the project.
When queried about the project’s environmental impact, Coastal Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Acting Director General B. K. Prabath Chandrakeerthi said: “I do not want to answer that. All I will say is that the development was approved by relevant authorities.”He also did not respond to queries regarding the future of Sri Lanka’s coastline, as high-rise buildings such as the Dusit Thani and 11-storey Weligama Marriot set the precedence for further coastal development.
“There are high-risers on the coast already. Just have a look at Colombo,” Chandrakeerthi added.
An environmental engineer expressed his concern regarding the project on the condition of anonymity.
“This project is a clear violation of the country’s environmental laws and will negatively impact coastal ecosystems,” the engineer said.
