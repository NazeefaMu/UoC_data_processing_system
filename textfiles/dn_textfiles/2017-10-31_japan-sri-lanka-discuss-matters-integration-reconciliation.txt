Japan-Sri Lanka discuss matters of integration, reconciliation

As part of the Japanese Government’s initiative to assist the Sri Lankan Government to implement its reconciliation agenda, Japanese Prosecutor Dr. Motoo Noguchi visited the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry on October 27.
His objectives were to share knowledge, expertise and experiences on reconciliation efforts of the other countries and to obtain firsthand information on the national integration and reconciliation programmes of the Government.
Dr. Noguchi shared the experiences of Congo, Uganda, South Africa and other countries and shared the best international practices. He explained that the conflict-affected areas need to be provided with basic economic and social infrastructure including resettlement and rehabilitation, livelihood and economic empowerment to address disparities and need reparation support. The priority is also to provide physical rehabilitation for the disabled persons and extend psycho-social support to affected persons including families of missing persons, to overcome trauma.
Further, sustainable social reintegration of ex-combatants into communities and providing economic opportunities to prevent future recurrences is vital.
Dr. Noguchi also said the peace education programme for children has tremendous potential for success in terms of establishing sustainable peace.
In the African region, a concept of ‘Peace Caravan’ was launched to get active involvement of children in the peace-building process. The war widows and those who underwent gender-based violence were supported with psycho-social support programmes and small businesses, livelihood and entrepreneurship programmes.
The transitional justice mechanisms of truth seeking, Office on Missing Persons (OMP), reparation, justice and accountability and non-recurrence are not only important for a particular group of affected people, but should widely benefit the entire population, Dr. Motoo Noguchi added.
National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy presented the national reconciliation and integration strategy which included an integration-friendly schools programme, reconciliation-friendly media, integration-friendly university and Youth Corps, inculcating integration concepts into Sunday religious school teachings, curriculum development in school education incorporating ethics, values, virtues, and comparative religious studies.
Further, the Reconciliation Focused Economic Empowerment Project (REEP), 50,000 housing programme, roads project, social and economic infrastructure projects will help to reduce economic disparities and enhance trust.
The Ministry Secretary also said that the District Reconciliation Committees (DRC) has been established to address ethnic and religious tensions in pockets and hotspots.
Considerable progress has now been made in operationalization of the OMP, which comes under the purview of the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation. Dr. Noguchi commended the national integration and reconciliation initiatives undertaken by the Ministry as appropriate and relevant in the peacebuilding context.
