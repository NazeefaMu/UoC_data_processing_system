Estate hospitals to be developed

All estate hospitals located countrywide are to be developed. The development work will end within this year under the direction of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Health Ministry sources said.
According to sources, last year (in 2016) the ministry had spent Rs. 410 million to develop 20 estate hospitals. Each estate hospital is to be provided with Out Patient Departments, two treatment wards and an ambulance. The Health Ministry will buy 250 ambulances and 150 cabs. They will be given to Provincial Hospitals.
All herbal gardens located countrywide will also be developed and the production will be given to the Ayurvedic Department to produce Ayurvedic drugs. The 100 acre herbal garden located at Haldummulla will also be developed under the programme, the sources said.
