At least 90 people were killed in a huge landslide as they picked across mountains of waste rubble searching for precious jade in a remote mining area of northern Myanmar, state media reported Sunday.
 
The Global New Light of Myanmar reported that "at least 90 dead bodies were retrieved from a landslide site and more are missing" after the massive collapse in Hpakant, Kachin State on Saturday, quoting local officials and media reports.
