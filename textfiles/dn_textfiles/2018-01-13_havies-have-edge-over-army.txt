Havies have the edge over Army

The second placed Havelock Sports Club will have a slight edge over Army Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division League return game at Havies grounds in Havelock Park, Colombo today. The Match will commence under lights at 6:30 pm.
The Army played a somewhat of a dejected game against Navy Sports Club in their last game at Havelock Park thus losing the game by 10-28 after a close fight in the first half where the score read 14 points to 10 in favour of Navy SC.
Hence they will have to carry out an improved performance if they hope to beat the Havelock's outfit.
The forte of the Havies side have been their power-packed forwards along with their speedy three quarter line and they should come up with much better display with skipper Jason Melder, Prasath Madusanka, Sharo Fernando, lanky Shehan Dias, Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Sudam Sooriarachchi and Niroshan Fernando, Chamara Dabare, Hirantha Perera, Sadun Herath ,
Reeza Mubarak along with their ever green national centre Nishon Perera are
likely to give of their best as they lost to CH and FC last week by 25-27 after a close encounter.
Meanwhile the Havelock's side who turned tables on Army SC side in their first round outing by 29 points to 19 at Police Park will go all out to get an all important victory in this game, since the match will be played at their own den at Havelock Park.

Navy firm favourites
Navy SC who scored a thumping 28-10 win at the hands of Army SC at Havelock Park last week will be the firm favourites and go all out to give a repeat performance when they take on Police SC in their Dialog ‘A’ Division
League rugby second round match at Police home grounds in Police Park today. Kickoff will be at 4.00pm. Police who went down fighting to CR & FC by 31 points to 33 at their home grounds in Police Park last week and nearly turned tables but unfortunately went down by a whisker. So the Cops will have to come up with a much better performance if they hope to overcome the formidable Navy lads who have notched up victories over top sides like CH and FC, CR & FC and Havelock’s.
Hence the cops will have to really rally around and strive hard to pull off this game in their favour.
