Rs. 32.1 m road project launched

A road construction project to develop a 3 km road in the Ratnapura district at a cost of Rs. 32.1 million was launched by Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne recently, a Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the project will be carried out in two phases. The National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry will fund the project.
Addressing the gathering after launching the project, Minister Seneviratne stated that a lot of efforts had been made in the past to construct the road but it did not become a reality due to various reasons. About 40 schoolchildren do not go to school because of the hardships they have to face without a proper road to travel to school.
The government has taken a decision that all children up to the age of 16 should go to school. Developing infrastructure facilities will help to implement this decision, he said.
Sri Lanka is first in Asia when it comes to eliminating child labour and it is education which helped the country reach this position, the Minister stated.
