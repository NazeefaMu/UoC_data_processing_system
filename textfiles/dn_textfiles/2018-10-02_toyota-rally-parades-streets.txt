TOYOTA RALLY PARADES THE STREETS

The fourth rally of the Toyota Corolla KE 55 to 85 Owners Club paraded the streets to meet at Wevita from the Bandaragama town recently.
Over 60 car owners from across the country gathered at the Maithri School grounds in Wevita, Bandaragama.
These cars have been made in Japan during the period from 1966 to 1981.
