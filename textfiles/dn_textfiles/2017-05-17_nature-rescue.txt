Nature to rescue

John Keats is one of the supreme poets of all time in the tapestry of English literature. In other words, he is a poet genius who made an everlasting influence on poetry. His father was an ostler. He was born at Moorfield in Lodon and schooled at Entfield. John Keats became a surgeon but threw down his scalpels to take to full time poetry. It is said that he had hated the scalpels, the reason is not known. The literati owe a great debt to him for that and endowing us a vast literature in the genre of poetry.
His sonnet written in 1817 ‘On My First Looking Into Capman’s Hormer’ is regarded as a gem of inspiration to his followers. ‘A thing of beauty is a joy forever’ is another line from his quill that has passed into language which is in evergreen memory of literary lovers. By the time he was able to appear on the literary landscape of the period as a budding poetic icon, he was a mere boy.
Bursting energy
His unhappy married life to Fanny Browne put him on the rack. The pain changed into bursting energy and the literary world was benefited greatly. Feather –headed Fanny was hated by many. The five odes to his credit are still admired by literary enthusiasts as the finest poems ever given to the world by a single poet.
How humble and creative these poets are! Once John Keats, Ley Hunt and another literary figure of the same calibre had had a friendly sonnets writing competition and he had written the best impromptu sonnet. We read and enjoy the real value of the Nile in ‘To the Nile’ because of this little competition. The spirit of Greek mythology is often reflected in his oeuvre. Greek stories gave much colour to his poetry. All in all, John Keats was above all things the poet of romance. If William Wordsworth is considered the high priest of the romantic school of poetry, Keats plays the second fiddle only to him.
If a poet-painters list is arrayed, is there any objection to place Keats at the head of the list? In this seasonable month of May of fruits and flowers, a profound discussion on Keats’ contribution to poetry seems justifiable.
The sense of beauty and the sense of colour are two remarkable gifts of a great artiste. Keats had it to the brimful. In a nutshell, Keats was the greatest colourist in English poetry. His glut of passion on beauty of nature put him on a good stead in nature poetry. His love for lustrous bubbling of red-wine made ‘Ode to a Nightingale’ rich in value. Imagination is the wellspring of genuine creativity. Keats never lacked this poetic element.
Thinking in imageries was child play for him. It seems a bounden duty of the genuine Keats followers to empower the prodigy with his ultra-active poetic imagination for the progress of a literary Sri Lanka.
‘The owl, for all his feathers, was a cold;
The hare limped trembling through the frozen grass;
And silence was the flock in wooly fold’
Environmental tranquility
His graphic power was also significant as imagination. The miscellany of poetic capabilities made him a true poetic icon for us to enjoy life in tranquility. My authentic experience in enjoying his poetry, especially his odes, lies in the fact that it should essentially be in mental, physical and environmental tranquility. It’s a recommendable meditation to the weary mind of the city dwellers, a soothing balm to his tired mind. Thus, the trudge of life could be made a pleasurable journey through poetry. Let’s give a try. My concern here is to drive home the concept,
‘Contemplation of the timeless beauty of nature can inspire a dreamlike enchantment that temporarily transcends mortal cares or pain’
Keats sets images before us to ponder on, gives food for thoughts. His lines are full of glamour and poetic charm. They intoxicate us beyond our control. The ode chosen by the writer for this literary discussion is ‘Ode to a Nightingale’. This piece of poetry is regarded as one of the supreme wonders of the poetic art in the world, so far. The perfume of poetry is conveyed to the reader by embalming him in the intoxicating fragrance of the wild flowers. Keats emerges as the colossus of the blend of poetry and music.
Lo and behold, he died at the age of twenty –five in Rome. He rests in peace beneath the pyramid of Caius Cestius. It is said to be a serene spot going with the spirit of Keats and Shelly wrote that his wish was to sleep beside him.
‘It makes one in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place.;’
Literary colleagues
Before his death Keats had earnestly requested his literary friends to write on his epitaph,
‘Here Lies One Whose Name Is Writ In Water’ but the lovely words were made idle by the ever grateful literary colleagues by writing his epitaph, ‘Here Lies One Whose Name Is Writ On The Rockface Of Time.’
Visiting such a place is bliss to a literary lover. It is a sweet pilgrimage. Financial restrictions annul my desire, yet if a generous sponsor or any charitable organization would come forward to lend me a helping hand I would bring greater wealth to commensurate with the undertaking.
Keats’ poetry became more popular posthumously. It is the nature in the human world.
