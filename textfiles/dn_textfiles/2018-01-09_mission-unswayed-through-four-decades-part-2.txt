A mission unswayed through four decades - Part 2

“We hadn’t the foggiest notion on how to get the money”, J.R. informed De Silva and Wriggins in 1979. But the government under J.R., despite much
scepticism had managed to inspire everyone around it and they were determined to get it done, added de Silva and Wriggins
Finding the money
The matter of finding funding for the project fell squarely on the shoulders of Dissanayake who was 35 at the time, he had barely seven years of political experience and never had held a cabinet portfolio before.
De Silva and Wriggins in their political biography on J.R. noted that Dissanayake invited all ambassadors and local heads of aid missions in Colombo for detailed discussions. The most positive came from the British High Commissioner, David Aires and the most negative from the US and Japan. The US had stated that on principle they had stopped supporting dam works and the Japanese Ambassador Ochi did not believe that the headworks would be completed on time. They vaguely promised to help with the downstream work if the headworks were complete on time. Funding thus was the biggest obstacle to the project.
“We hadn’t the foggiest notion on how to get the money”, J.R. informed De Silva and Wriggins in 1979. But the government under J.R., despite much scepticism had managed to inspire everyone around it and they were determined to get it done, added de Silva and Wriggins.
The World Bank however was reluctant to support the project which they perceived as futile and impossible to do. By mid 1978, the government was very worried whether the World Bank would support the project and it was then that Dissanayake proposed that he be allowed to embark on a visit to all potential donors so that he could make a personal appeal to them.
This extraordinary diplomatic mission was so successful that by the end of it, Britain had agreed to build Victoria, Kotmale would be done by Sweden, Randenigala/Rantambe by the Germans and Maduru Oya by the Canadians. Thus the Mahaweli programme began with rapid progress from 1978 onwards and was complete in record time. J R Jayawardena declared open all the projects undertaken during his presidency though minor works continued into the 90s.
Massive expansion
CECB, General Manager, K.L.S. Sahabandu recalled that J.R. and Dissanayake selected the CECB to handle the headworks of the projects whilst downstream activities were given to the Mahaweli Development Board (MDB).
Dr A.N.S. Kulasinghe was chosen to lead the CECB they were asked to get involved in Kotmale, Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe and Maduru Oya.
At the time we increased the department from eight or ten engineers to over 100, said Sahabandu. Complete batches of engineers from the University of Peradeniya and Moratuwa were hired to the CECB and MDB.
“Earlier civil engineers did not have much demand in the country, but with the Mahaweli there was a great demand for civil engineers. In my batch, everyone wanted to be a civil engineer, but then there was some pressure and they convinced at least 10 percent to pursue other fields of engineering”, said Sahabandu.
Sahabandu joined the CECB in 1980 and was sent to work in Bowatenne,
“When I got there, there was no room for me to stay. I had to occupy a temporary room and a camp bed. I spent one year there and later transferred to Randenigala. There were two quarters built by the Irrigation Department during D. S.’s time and we stayed there. Water was a big problem, we had to get it from the Minipe canal and in the monsoons, it all turned brown. I was also infected with Malaria twice during the construction phase”, he recalled.
Later however, as the foreign consultants and engineers came in, living conditions vastly improved for all, “We had to give them accommodation which met international standards, and so nice houses were built, tennis courts, swimming pools, supermarkets, clubhouses, an international school in Digana - whole enclaves came up around these dams”, said Wickremaratne.
Through an engineering perspective, the combination of the foreign consultants and engineers with local engineers allowed many in Sri Lanka to learn and perfect their art, “But today that doesn’t happen. Everything is given to a foreign consultant and contractor but they don’t have much knowledge but large amounts of foreign exchange goes out of the country for them. Their cost estimations are quite high and our people are not properly trained. And even when trained, because of the dissatisfaction they want to leave the country. This was not so during the Mahaweli”, noted Sahabandu.
Moragahakanda
The Accelerated Mahaweli program had to prioritize the Mahaweli projects planned in the Master Plan in order to be able to finish in time. Thus Moragahakanda, the fifth and last of the major reservoirs was not taken up in the accelerated phase, “The initial design was huge, not the same as what we have built now and when it was analysed at the time, there was not much power there. So returns were not great”, said Sahabandu.
There were three studies undertaken for Moragahakanda alone. First was in 1979, other in 1989, and the next was in 1999. We used to call it the 10 year cycle. People take it up, then issue of funds come up and then they abandon it. It was a big reservoir and it was not a priority, explained Wickremaratne.
In 1999, incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena took it up (he was the deputy minister of Irrigation) and was instrumental in putting the CECB into the project team, he added. The study was funded by the Kuwaiti government and a German company came in to undertake it but then the issue of funds limited its implementation.
“Then we thought that we would do what we can, so the government did some smaller sections with the funds available”, said Wickremaratne further.
The project then was commenced in 2007 (when the President was Minister of Mahaweli) and was expected to be completed in 2012 but after some time, it was abandoned due to a lack of interest by the government of that time. The project was estimated to cost Rs 100 billion at the time.
Finally however, the Chinese stepped in to finish the project this year.
Moragahakanda’s importance lies in its potential to stabilize the irrigation system of the Mahaweli,
“The availability of water in a river varies over the year but we were only using a small structure to divert – it cannot hold much water. So whatever water that comes to Polgolla, Bowatenne, has to be stored somewhere. But thus far we have had our storages in the most downstream of places, like Rajanganaya and Kala Wewa - very far. By that time, the water has evaporated and lessened. But when you have a tank closer to the source, you have the option to decide what to do with it and how much to send downstream. Moragahakanda allows us to take those decisions”, explained Wickremaratne.
Moragahakanda which will supply 25MW to the grid will provide irrigation water to about 87,000 farmers in the Matale, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee districts, during both, the Yala and Maha seasons.
The project will irrigate 82,000 hectares of existing dry land and another 5,000 hectares of new land. Annual inland fishing will rise by another 4,500 metric tons. The project will also feed the Iranamadu Jaffna-Kilinochchi Water Supply scheme to provide drinking water to 300,000 people in Jaffna and 50,000 people in Kilinochchi.
The Settlements
One of the biggest challenges of the Mahaweli project was that of evacuation and resettlement. A total of 144,000 families were resettled in the Mahaweli system. This was mainly due to a number of villages being inundated by the reservoirs of Kotmale and Victoria.
A survey conducted in 1979 revealed that a total of 590 ha of paddy lands and 1560 ha of upcountry highlands were inundated by Kotmale (displacing 3200 families) and a total of 1250 ha and 850 ha of rich fruits and cocoa and other mixed crops were destroyed by Victoria (displacing 8000 families).
These farmer families from the upcountry thus were resettled in the dry zone, an area completely alien to them. In the early days, they also had to contend with not having drinking water, houses, roads and hospitals. In addition, farmer families took time to adapt to the new, harsher environments with many falling victim to wild animal attacks or malaria.
One of the main criticisms levelled at the Mahaweli resettlements was that it was colonizing many Tamil lands with Sinhalese settlements, especially through the Maduru Oya scheme. Ladduwahetty recalled that the then Director General and Chairman of the Mahaweli Development Authority, N.G.P. Panditaratna was accused of using the project for such purposes, “But it is a difficult question to answer whether the government as a whole did that intentionally”, he said.
Displaced farmer families however received 0.2 hectare of home garden land and 1 hectare of irrigated land.
“We had huge implementation challenges in mobilizing thousands of people, construction, evacuation and resettlement. It was very complex and people had to be looked after in the early days very closely. The right kind of seed, planting material had to be distributed. The channels which exist in an established area does not exist in new areas. So the bureaucracy had to step in often”, recalled Senior Economist at the Ministry of Plantation Industries at the time, Dr Anura Ekanayake.
Looking back at the cost-benefit analysis of the project, Dr Ekanayake noted that the project all in all had saved the country from major economic crisis, “Today the Mahaweli contributes, depending on rainfall between 20-25 percent of the total national electricity requirement and 25 percent of rice output of the country. You can imagine the plight we would be in without it”, he said.
“When the government decided to accelerate the project, the Sri Lankan economy was virtually at a standstill, one million people unemployed, so the government liberalized the economy and started the Mahaweli project. It is hard to say we shouldn’t have done it, because if we didn’t we should have had other alternatives for the energy and food deficits”, added Dr Ekanayake.
The downsides he noted however were in; environmental damage, deforestation and the human-elephant conflict.
It was a period of intensive studies going parallel with project implementation. They could not be done sequential, because it would have taken time. Many of the irrigation and cropping trials were tried out in parallel. They were also closely monitored to see if farmers were doing it. Some things were not hundred percent translated, but done to a great extent, he explained further.
Agriculture
Over 160,000 hectares of agricultural land came under the Mahaweli over the years and it helped the country reach self-sufficiency in rice (rice paddy production rose from about 450,000 tons in 1953 to 3.13 million tons in 2007 (FAO 2009)), until 2015; the year the present drought took over. Dr Ekanayake who is a member of the Presidential Expert Committee on Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision, observed that the one problem the Mahaweli never managed to do was to change water consumption behaviour of farmers in the country.
“We wanted farmers to grow rice in the wet season (Maha) and other crops in Yala. The latter needed intensive labour and was harder to do but profits were larger, and this would have ensured a better use of water overall – but this never happened”, said Dr Ekanayake.
The main reasons for this was; inability to change ingrained habits of growing rice and not wanting to shift to better water use strategies.
“We irrigated all these lands but now we have to use the water more efficiently - this is the future. We are using more than double the amount of water we thought we would be using per unit of land, when we initially planned it”, he noted.
With global studies on climate change suggesting that the dry zone would simply get drier and the wet zone, wetter in Sri Lanka, Dr Ekanayake stressed for a radical change in the way farmers practiced agriculture. Better water use thus would have helped us sustain agriculture even during prolonged droughts such as these.
The Mahaweli areas over the years have also had other external factors limiting its farmers from reaching their full potential. Whilst farmer incomes grew initially, they have done as well as expected mainly due to a lack of rural value chains, said Dr Ekanayake.
“For decades we made the mistake of having government authorities go and purchase products and give good terms. This never works because bureaucrats are not business people and are not market savvy. We need to open it up to the private sector to build those value chains, so farmers get better terms than what they now get”, he said.
Social factors such as few youth wanting to stay in farms and incomes not being sufficient to sustain them has also led to lower agricultural productivity in the Mahaweli.
Rural communities are conservative and tradition bound, it is not easy to change their ways. But we have also gone and locked them into certain situations. For example, labour shortage in the absence of other solutions, makes them prefer rice which uses less labour - other crops at times use 10 times the labour, he said.
This is an unfinished journey and now it is about opportunity cost, noted Dr Ekanayake and explained we needed to implement strategies to best utilize the resources the Mahaweli project brought in.
“These things, you cannot finish, there is always an extension”, echoed Ladduwahetty further, when asked what he thought of his scheme, 40 years later.
To be continued tomorrow…
