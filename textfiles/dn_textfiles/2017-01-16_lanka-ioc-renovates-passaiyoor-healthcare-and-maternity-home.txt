Lanka IOC renovates Passaiyoor  healthcare and maternity home

Lanka IOC renovated the Passaiyoor Health Care and Maternity Home and handed it over to the Jaffna Municipal Council on December 28.
The Northern Province of Sri Lanka suffered severe damages due to the civil war that prevailed in the country and as a result the buildings like hospitals, schools, bridges etc were heavily damaged - not in a condition to function.
On a request made by the Medical Officers of Health (MOH) of Municipal Council Jaffna, seeking assistance to renovate the Medical Service Centers that were in a dilapidated state, and considering the numerous challenges and insurmountable difficulties the people of that area had faced due to no fault of theirs, Lanka IOC, offered to provide support to renovate two Primary Health Care Centers within the Jaffna Municipal Council area.
The first Primary Health Care Center by the name of “Jubilee Health Care Centre” that facilitates maternal and childcare was renovated and handed over for the use of public in 2015.
Lanka IOC renovated the two “Primary Health & Maternity Home” at Passaiyoor and the “Jubilee Health Care Centre” at a cost of Rs.12 million. Over 7000 to 8000 people will benefit from these Primary Health Care Centres. Lanka IOC also facilitated a children’s park in the vicinity of the Health Care Centre, facilitating the mothers to keep their children to play in the park while they take treatment.
