False bomb threat: Schoolgirl arrested, warned and released on bail

 
The Colombo Fort Magistrate today released on bail an eighteen- year-old schoolgirl, arrested for allegedly making a false threat that there was a bomb at the Colombo Fort railway station on December 26.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne ordered the schoolgirl released on two sureties of Rs.200, 000 and a severe warning not to repeat such offences, leading to disturbances to the public.
A tense situation occurred at the Colombo Fort railway station on December 26, 2016 after the passengers of the Colombo - Badulla train were evacuated following a telephone call to the 119 police emergency unit about a bomb.
The Fort police arrested the schoolgirl who dialed 119 emergency hotline on the charges of providing false information to the law enforcement officers and causing disturbances to the general public.
Further magisterial inquiry against the suspect is fixed for February 17.
