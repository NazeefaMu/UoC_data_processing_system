Cricket, the new battleground for protests

Cricket fans were treated to an unusual spectacle at the first T-20 between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at the R. Premadasa Stadium when a group of university students took occasion to stage a peaceful protest. The students—from the Moratuwa University’s Students Union, as evinced by posts on their Facebook page—decided to use the occasion to protest against the SAITM.
This is not the first time the country has witnessed protests against SAITM these past months. Trade unions, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), the Inter University Student Federation (IUSF), and the Inter University Bhikku Front (IUBF) were among those who organised protests against the private university.
Law enforcement authorities had just the one standard response to these protestors. They used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them, causing havoc and mayhem on the streets, and students ran amok in escape.
It is against this backdrop of regular protests that the protest at the Sri Lanka-Bangladesh T-20 match comes. The students attached to the Moratuwa University Students’ Union had come to enjoy the match and cheer the country on. But even while cheering Sri Lanka on, they wore t-shirts and carried placards that read ‘Abolish SAITM’. They had even worn uniform ‘Anonymous’ masks. ‘Anonymous’ is a loosely associated Internet hacktivist organisation—which may be why the more tech-savvy Moratuwa University students were inclined to wear them.
Their innovative use of the international platform to bring the issue surrounding SAITM to the attention of the common public, however, drew mixed reactions.
The likes of cricket commentator Roshan Abeysinghe were not amused, and tweeted “Stupidity has no boundaries. Hence no point commenting. Only sympathise with these kids used as pawns by unscrupulous elements.”
Others chimed in, echoing Abeysinghe’s opinion that a cricket match was not the place to protest. They argued cricket was a sport untouched by bitter national politics and should remain that way—a game to be enjoyed, not politicised.
Cricket is one of the country’s greatest uniting factors, when the nation, irrespective of political, ideological, religious, and ethnic differences come together to cheer the country on. It is why the use of a cricket match as a platform to raise awareness on a political issue has come under criticism.
There were those that argued that this kind of action ‘fractured’ Sri Lanka’s society. There were those that argued that the anti-SAITM protest sent out a negative message to the international community. They said protests, such as these, tarnished Sri Lanka’s image in the international arena, giving the impression that ours is a nation riddled with serious socio-economic problems.
But, there’s always the flip-side to an argument. Despite the views criticizing the action of university students, many of the comments on Facebook and Twitter were congratulatory: they felt that students, with their uniform ‘Anonymous’ masks, had used the platform effectively to draw attention to an issue close to heart.
Anti-SAITM protests have typically taken up the streets. Students would enter the streets in hordes, aided and enabled by trade unions and political parties with vested interests. Roads would be blocked, traffic congested, and tear gas canisters and water cannons would be used by law enforcement authorities.
The protest at the R. Premadasa Stadium did none of that: it did not waste the time and money of the public nor the resources of the state.
The Police did not have to use batton charge or other forms of ‘minimum force,’ nor were the public forced to waste time in traffic during rush hours. This is also, not the first time the cricket arena has been used to make a political statement.
During the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2003, Zimbabwean cricketers Andy Flower and Henry Olonga, wore black armbands to ‘mourn the death of democracy in Zimbabwe,’ under the presidency of Robert Mugabe.
The black armband protest came under severe criticism from senior Zimbabwean political figures, but was praised by sections of the international media that despised Mugabe’s presidency.
The International Cricket Council deemed that Flower and Olonga had taken a political action, but refused to charge the pair with an offence. Following the protest, Flower and Olonga were forced to leave Zimbabwe, and they later settled in England.
In 2010, an LTTE supporter carrying an LTTE flag invaded the pitch, while Sri Lanka was playing in England. Similarly, pro-LTTE groups in London have used the occasion of Sri Lanka matches to protest their political cause.
This is not to say cricket—or any other sport—must be tainted by politics or that it should become the newest arena for political protests. But using sports events to make political statements is not unprecedented.
Irrespective of the ethics of the protest, one thing is certain: this new form of protest is certainly less taxing than the protests that take up the street.
With all it’s ills and all the accusations against it, it is a still a form of protest that saves the time and energy of commuters, law enforcement officers, and even protestors themselves, who no longer have to give themselves up to tear gas and water cannons.
