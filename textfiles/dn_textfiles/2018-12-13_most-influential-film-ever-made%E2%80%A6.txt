Most  influential film  ever made…

According to a group of Italian researchers who analyzed 47,000 films across 26 genres, the most influential movie ever made is ‘The Wizard of Oz’!
No surprise there, as the fantasy blockbuster starring Judy Garland as Dorothy, a girl who gets whisked away to a magical realm, has long been considered a game changer in Hollywood.
According to The Guardian, the other films that join the ‘Wizard of Oz’ in the top five are ‘Star Wars’, ‘Psycho’, ‘King Kong’ (1933), and ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’. The rest of the top 20 is peppered with the usual suspects, including ‘Casablanca’, ‘Citizen Kane’, ‘Metropolis’, ‘Dr. Strangelove’, and ‘The Godfather’.
The study also ranked the influence of certain directors and actors. Alfred Hitchcock topped the directors list, followed by Steven Spielberg, while Samuel L. Jackson topped the actors list, followed by Tom Cruise. The actress list was slightly less predictable: Carrie Fisher was named the most influential, while Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny in 14 ‘James Bond’ films, was named second most influential.
