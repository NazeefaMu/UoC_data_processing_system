India reduces visa fees for Lankans

The Indian government yesterday announced a reduction in visa fees for Sri Lankan nationals applying for e-Tourist Visa (e-TV), which was introduced from April 14, 2015.
The new visa fee is only US$ 25 (plus bank charges of 2.5%), instead of US$ 60 (plus US$2 bank fee) charged earlier. The High Commission of India in a press release hoped that more Sri Lankan nationals will avail of the opportunity to visit India using the e-Tourist Visa.
However, there is no change in the fee for other visas.
