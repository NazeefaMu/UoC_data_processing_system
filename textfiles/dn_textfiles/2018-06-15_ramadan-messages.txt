[Ramadan MESSAGES]

Season to give priority to peace: President
The most important thing in our life should be the purification of mind for the betterment as well as the protection of human beings. Any act, which is harmful to society, first germinates in a human mind. Consequently, the salvation and betterment of human beings could only be attained in an environment of good thoughts where moral values are strengthened, stated President Maithripala Sirisena, in his message marking Ramadan.
The message added: “It is the noble message of giving priority to peace with honour conveyed to humanity by the Islam devotees when they celebrate Ramadan or Eid-ul-Fitr after observing a fast for a month, and making sacrifices. It is a message common to the entire universe. The betterment of all human beings depend on an environment where each and everyone understands the real meaning of such a message.
“The Ramadan rituals show us we can create a peaceful living environment while promoting peace and reconciliation in the present day complex world, only through being sensitive to the others’ sentiments, while being honest to oneself.
“I extend my best wishes to all Islam devotees who celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr, which has such meaningful vision that addresses the common humanity transcending religious limitations,” the message stated.
Marks equality, purity, devotion: PM
The festival of Eid ul-Fitr, falls on the first day of the month after the holy month of Ramadan, and marks the sighting of the new moon at the end of the month of fasting. This is an important religious festival celebrated by Muslims across the globe to mark equality, purity and devotion, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his Ramazan message.
The message adds: “Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam - along with faith, prayer, charity and pilgrimage. Muslims also celebrate the revelation of their holy book, the Quran, during the same month, giving Muslims an opportunity to reflect on their spiritual life in honour of the Quran.
“This period of fasting functions as a means of reassessment for Muslims, as they strive to lead a life of cooperation and compassion with spiritual purity. Through the practice of “Zakat” and other charitable donations during the period, Muslims demonstrate their generosity and set an example for humanity by acknowledging the importance of selflessness in their lives.
“I hope that our Sri Lankan Muslim community, together with Muslims across the world, have a prosperous and a peaceful Eid ul- Fitr, having gifted the world with both the social and spiritual virtues instilled in this festival.
“May the blessings light up the path and lead to happiness, Eid Mubarak!”
‘Month of reflection, sacrifice’
As the holy month of Ramadan comes to an end, Muslims all over the world are celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr. Eid is an Arabic word meaning festivity. The month of Ramadan is a month of reflection and sacrifice, said National Unity and Co-existence State Minister A. H. M. Fowzie in his message marking Ramazan.
The message added: “Muslims fast to learn self-discipline and to feel the pain of those less fortunate so that they find the kindness in their heart to do more for society. This month is not only for fasting but for giving and caring as well.
“On the morning of Eid, special prayers are held to spread goodwill and seek blessings. Prayers are made for everyone including our country and the world for peace and harmony.
“After special prayers, friends and family gather together to have meals and to exchange gifts and greetings.
“Sri Lanka is a multi-cultural and multi-religious country where Muslims have lived side by side with other communities for many centuries. The joy is spread to everyone with Eid greetings and food that is shared with neighbours and friends regardless of their faith or ethnicity. It is with great pleasure that this day is shared with everyone.”
‘Ramadan: a symbol of hope’
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and is observed by Muslims the world over as a period of fasting to commemorate the first revelation of the Quran to the Holy Prophet Mohammed according to Islamic belief. This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam, stated Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga in his message marking Ramadan.
The message added: "Muslims in Sri Lanka are known to devoutly follow the teachings of the Holy Prophet and the fasting and celebration of Ramadan is deeply entranced in the fabric of Sri Lankan society.
"This is illustrated by the fact that Ramadan is a much anticipated celebration not only among the Muslim community but also among the other communities in Sri Lanka, which have peacefully coexisted for centuries in this beautiful island.
"My sincere wish is that in an era where religious extremism is causing divisions across the globe, unity, fellowship and adherence to the true values of Ramadan displayed by the Muslim community in Sri Lanka, will be a symbol of hope for the whole world," the message stated.
‘Resolve to live a peaceful life’
Eid-ul-Fitr is an important day in the Islamic calendar where Muslims around the world celebrates on two great feasts. This festival, celebrated after the completion of a month-long fast, has been described as a reward by Holy Prophet Mohammed and as a day of thanksgiving to Almighty Allah for having us to perform our obligations as per the commands of the Almighty, stated Moors’ Islamic Cultural Home President Omara Kamil, in his message marking Ramadan.
The message added: “On this sacred day in the Islamic calendar, let us all pray to Almighty Allah to grant permanent peace amongst all communities in our dear motherland.
“Let us resolve on this great day to live a peaceful and an exemplary life, according to the great teachings of the Holy Quran and the message of Holy Prophet Mohammed,” the message stated.
‘Season to help others’
The Ramadan festival season is highly valuable because the good deeds performed during this season are considered more meritorious than those performed during the rest of the year, stated Colombo's Deputy Mayor M. T. M. Iqbal in a Ramadan message.
The message added that Ramadan can also be identified as a season which emphasised the need for helping others. Prophet Mohammed had stated that even the removal of an obstruction on a high road was also an act of merit. As such, the time had come for urban dwellers especially to perform their duty as regards garbage clearance in the city and assist that endeavour in whatever possible manner, the message said.
