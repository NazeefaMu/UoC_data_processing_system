Beyond Independence celebrations

We have an elected President and a Prime Minister whose party requires a few votes to muster a simple majority in Parliament. There are no elections to either the Office of President or the Parliament anytime soon. However every day much of news is dominated by reports on who is opposed to whom, charges and counter charges on corruption or actions of a Joint Opposition.
A CPA publication highlights several features of the 19th Amendment including the removal of the President’s immunity for official acts, reducing the President’s power in relation to Parliament, reintroducing term limits for the office of the President, taking away the sole power of the President to make appointments to key independent institution and improving transparency in the law making process whilst the President retains power over other aspects of Cabinet appointments, the President is required to act on the advice of the Prime Minister in identifying specific MPs for appointment as Cabinet and other Ministers.
A total of 174 amendments had been submitted for consideration during the committee stage of the Bill (63 amendments by the Government and 111 by the Opposition). Clearly the amendment is an expression of many ideas for the Office of the President and Parliament to govern the country.
A time to govern
If no elections other than the Local Government elections have to be held, is it not time for Government at all levels to govern? While politicians have a right to election in between polls if they want to, it does expose their limitations on governing the country.
For example we are faced with unprecedented challenges caused by climate change. Considerable knowledgeable and literature on what needs to be done is available. A subject Minister during a recent conversation with an expert who had 42 years University teaching experience with a huge volume of published knowledge had asked his key officials five times during the conversation to consult the expert and draft a Cabinet paper. The requests remains ignored for now!
Across the board Officials have become comfortable and govern less and less. Some argue Ministers are involved in the domain of the public officials. There is truth to the argument. Intent to review, KPI’s on performances by line agencies have been mentioned. We have heard of Secretaries Meetings in the past. Somewhere between the Secretaries to the President and or Prime Minister would it be difficult to review performances?
Optimizing resources
We have enough human resources from Government on the ground. The national Budget is full of opportunities to leave no one behind and to use powers and functions of devolved units such as the Provinces.
Fish and related industry is an example of where we can do a great deal more. The country is surrounded by fishing grounds, our fish is stolen by others and we have inland fishing also at our disposal. However until 2015 our Fisheries Cooperation had never made profits. A next to impossible feat. They are now on track to realize their actual potential.
The 2016 -17 budget provides the following provisions.
Potential to increase the export proceeds at least by five fold in the next three - five years, through the export of not only raw crabs, lobsters, prawns oysters, etc. but also through value addition, including canning and processing. Aquaculture Industry Zones in Hambanthota, Mannar and Batticaloa, allocation -Rs. 500 million. Development of the inland fishery industry will yield multiple benefits, including addressing the nutritional deficiencies, promotion of industries and creation of employment by establishing 100 Integrated Inland Fishery Villages, allocation Rs. 300 million. Ornamental fish industry, which has a significant potential for expansion where the utilization of the out grower system will bring in more synergies, allocation Rs. 25 million.
I would add ensuring all those engaged in fishing are given opportunities to acquire NVQ 2 qualifications graduating upwards including in to deep sea fishing.
In a context in which more fish is harvested than meat globally we can thrive locally and in overseas markets.
Global examples
Solaiman Sheik shows off the harvest from his father’s small pond near Khulna, Bangladesh: freshwater prawns, a profitable export. The family also raises fish in the pond and, in the dry season, rice fertilized by fish waste—a polyculture that has tripled output with little environmental downside.
Nature’s own water filters, giant Japanese scallops thrive on fish waste at an experimental farm off Canada’s Vancouver Island. The farm also uses sea cucumbers and help to consume excretions from nearby pens of native sablefish.
At dawn on China’s Fujian coast, seaweed farmers head out to tend their aquatic fields. Such farms help China grow 12 million tons of food a year with no soil or fresh water and no fertilizer except runoff from the land.
These are examples which are replicable in our fisheries industry yielding considerable benefit to the country and sector as a whole.
This country has ample opportunities to prosper. In the absence of a war to blame all our troubles our political spectrum and public service remain exposed for their inadequacies. Our populace is not ignorant and uninformed. They cannot be fooled all the time.
