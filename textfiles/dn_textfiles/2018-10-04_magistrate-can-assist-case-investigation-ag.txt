Gang rape in Korea
Magistrate can assist case investigation - AG

The Attorney General observed that the Magistrate’s Court has jurisdiction to assist in investigations into the gang rape of an 18-year-old Korean girl in 1998 in South Korea, CID officials told the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court yesterday. Three Sri Lankan youth are believed to be involved in the incident.
According to the ‘B’ report filed by the CID, the Korean government had requested Sri Lanka on August 28, 2017, to conduct investigations into this case. Earlier this year, a Korean delegation also visited Sri Lanka and met the Attorney General, officials of the Justice Ministry and CID officials regarding the case.
The Magistrate fixed the inquiry for October 05.
