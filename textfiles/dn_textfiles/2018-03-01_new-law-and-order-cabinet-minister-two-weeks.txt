New Law and Order Cabinet Minister in two weeks

Co-Cabinet Spokesman Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said a new Cabinet Minister for Law and Order will be appointed in two weeks and the decision to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka has not yet been finalized.
The Minister said the Prime Minister was sworn in as the Law and Order Minister for only two weeks. Proposals were brought to appoint Field Marshal Fonseka as the Law and Order Minister but he was abroad when the Cabinet reshuffle took place, the Minister said.
The Minister was responding to a question from a journalist at the weekly Cabinet media briefing held at the Government Information Department, yesterday.
“There is nothing strange in appointing Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Law and Order Minister and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also took the same Ministry under his purview for a period of nearly two years,” said the Minister.
