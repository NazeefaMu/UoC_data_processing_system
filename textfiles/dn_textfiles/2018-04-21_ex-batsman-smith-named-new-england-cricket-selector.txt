Ex-batsman Smith named as new England cricket selector

London,Friday: Former Test batsman Ed Smith has been appointed as England's new national selector, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced Friday.
The ECB said Smith, who succeeds James Whitaker, would be part of a "new approach to scouting, assessing and selecting players for the senior men's Test, T20 and one-day sides, ensuring greater connection right through the international pathway".
Smith, who had been a cricket writer and broadcaster, said: "I'm delighted to take on the role of national selector. I was very happy with what I was doing previously but the chance to be at the forefront of this development in English cricket was too good an opportunity to turn down."
The 40-year-old Smith, who has a first-class history degree from Cambridge University, has written approvingly of the 'Moneyball' approach to recruitment that has revolutionised the process of talent identification in major North American sports. AFP
