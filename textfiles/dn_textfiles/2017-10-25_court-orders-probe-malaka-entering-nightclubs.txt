Court orders probe into Malaka entering nightclubs

The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court issued an order directing the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) to carry out an investigation over an allegation that Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva, had violated a Court order by entering nightclubs, yesterday.
At a previous occasion, the Court had issued an order preventing Malaka Silva from entering nightclubs as a bail condition regarding an assault case.
The Counsel who appeared on behalf of the aggrieved party complained to Colombo Additional Magistrate Daminda Weligodapitiya that they have received information that Malaka Silva had entered nightclubs contrary to the Court order.
Accordingly, the case involving an incident where Malaka Silva had allegedly assaulted a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Colombo was fixed for March 6 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court, yesterday.
The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) conducting investigations into the incident, had informed the Court that they have sought the Attorney General’s advice regarding two counter cases.
At a previous occasion, the Court decided to name Scotsman James Francis Casserly as a suspect in a case where he had allegedly punched Malaka Silva in the face during the scuffle at a nightclub in Colombo 3, in 2014.
Seven suspects including Malaka Silva were arrested over an alleged assault on a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Duplication Road, Colombo 3 on October 31, 2014. Police complaints were subsequently lodged by both parties claiming they had been assaulted.
As a part of the investigation regarding the Scotsman’s complaint, Police had arrested and produced in Court seven suspects including Malaka Silva. They are currently out on bail.
However, the lawyers appeared on behalf of Malaka Silva alleged that police had failed to take legal action regarding their complaint that Malaka Silva was severely assaulted by the Scotsman and even had a scratch on Malaka’s nose.
Taking into consideration the evidence placed before Court, the Additional Magistrate decided to name James Francis Casserly as a suspect. The magisterial inquiry into two counter cases was fixed for March 6. Jayantha Weerasinghe PC, with Counsels Asela Rekawa and Maithri Gunaratne, appeared for Malaka and other suspects. Counsel Avendra Rodrigo appeared for the Scotsman.
