Action called for against other ‘weaknesses’ too of Mahendran

Legal action has to be taken against former Central Bank governor Arjuna Mahendren pertaining to administrative and other weaknesses identified through the Central Bank-Internal Audit Department review, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena.
The review of the procedures adopted on foreign travel and other expenses by the Internal Audit Department had allegedly identified many administrative weaknesses of the former governor. The minister said legal action has to be taken pertaining to the deficiencies by the former governor in relation to foreign travel, credit card payments, incurring other governor’s entertainment expenses, incurring general office expenses and administrative and other weaknesses identified through the review, apart from the ongoing bond scam issue. Addressing the media at the Finance Ministry yesterday, he said the review is clear evidence of serious mismanagement and corruption.
Referring to the press release issued recently under the name of former Governor Arjuna Mahendren, the minister questioned whether it was released with his signature. “If the letter does not have his signature, he can easily say that he did not issue it. It is a problem, if he is not willing to take the responsibility,” he said. Minsiter Abeywardena added that the Auditor General has performed his duties in a satisfactory manner and he is obliged to answer only to Parliament. “I request the Former Governor to reply to the facts mentioned in the review issued by the Central Bank Internal Audit Department. That has to be done very clearly and not through press releases that divert the people’s attention,” Minister Abeywardena added.
