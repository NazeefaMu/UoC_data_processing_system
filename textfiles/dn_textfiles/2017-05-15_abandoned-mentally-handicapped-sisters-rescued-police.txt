Abandoned mentally handicapped sisters rescued by police

Two mentally handicapped sisters aged six and nine years, left under the guardianship of their 80-year-old grandfather by their parents who had gone for employment abroad, had been left abandoned in their house when the grandfather who suddenly took seriously ill was admitted to hospital by some relatives who arrived from Colombo, recently.
Neighbours who witnessed the predicament of the two under-aged girls had reported their plight to Meegahawatte Police.
Officers from the police station arrived at the scene and took the children away and handed them over to the ‘Isura’ children’s home at Siyambalape to be kept under its care temporarily.
The children were due to be produced before the Mahara Magistrate to obtain a Court order for handing them over to a proper guardian.
