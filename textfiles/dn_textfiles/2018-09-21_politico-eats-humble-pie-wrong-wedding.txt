Politico eats humble pie at wrong wedding

A politician had to spent on two wedding gifts, after he had mistakenly stepped in to the wrong venue in a reputed five star hotel.
The politician had arrived at the hotel on an invitation he received from a voter in his home town for their daughter's wedding.He had forgotten to bring the wedding invitation and had mistakenly entered another wedding hall in the said hotel and wished the couple handing over his gift to them.
However he had realised that this was not his friends daughter's wedding when he had noticed that the guests and the couple were amused by his presence.
The politician upset that he cannot take the gift back from the couple, had disappeared from the function and had gone to the correct wedding hall in the same hotel two hours later after ordering another wedding gift from the shop which he had purchased the previous gift.
