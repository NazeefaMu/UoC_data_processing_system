Twenty thousand new jobs before January 8: PM

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government would initiate several projects around the country by January 8, which would create over 20,000 jobs.
He was speaking at the ceremony to lay the foundation stone for an automobile assembly factory in Kuliyapitiya yesterday.
The Premier said however that neither he nor the President were satisfied with just those 20, 000 jobs, but would create more.
He said, both the President and he would travel the world to find the necessary investments to start new projects that would benefit the country: “We need to increase our revenue.
Our export foreign exchange is not enough. So we need to bring many foreign exchange generating projects into the country, for that we have to encourage industries and tourism,” the Prime Minister explained.
Responding to criticism about the Kuliyapitiya automobile assembly factory the Premier asked if developing this country is wrong and said he was hopeful that the younger generation would buy motor cars manufactured at the Kuliyapitiya factory.
He also took the occasion to assure the public that the remaining debt burden would not be passed to the future generation and that the foundation to fulfill the people’s aspirations would be laid by 2020.
The new factory in Kuliyapitiya was established fulfilling one of the election promises of the national unity government, appointed with a mandate in 2015 to generate about 2,500 new job opportunities in the area.
