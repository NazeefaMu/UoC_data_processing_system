Leading companies operating in the country including Singer Sri Lanka, John Keells, Metropolitan, Banks, BOI companies and over400 companies supply electronic waste to Green Links Lanka.
Commissioned in 2005, Green Links Lanka has been recognized with awards as the foremost electronic waste management company in the country. The ‘e-Waste Management Workshop’held in 2016 in Beijing, China, organized by the United Nations Development Program featured electronic waste management experts from 14 countries and it is significant that Green Links Managing Director NalinGunaratne was amongst them.
NalinGunaratne said, “We commissioned Green Links Company by collecting old silencers in my car’s boot. We are more than happy that currently some of the world’s leading e-waste management companies have recognized our company as a trustworthy supplier and have tied up with us.”
He added, “In recent times, in the Colombo vicinity a huge dumping yard erupted causing great unpleasantness. A future threat to our country is, accumulation of electronic waste. Thus I humbly request people to give us all their e-waste and become environment friendly citizens. We have made things easy for them by allocating a mobile vehicle, so they can call the hotline 011 566 0 300 or personally bring their e-waste to No. 848/3A, Mabola, Wattala where our main warehouse is situated.”
He further said, “We look forward to facilitate people living outstation too, if they could call us. However I must stress, when e-waste is provided to us, not to remove their inner parts as we could export e-waste if they have parts that could only be recycled.”
