Seine net fishermen allowed to use winch machines

The Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development has granted permission to use winch machines to pull out seine nets under several terms and conditions, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He made this observation at the 40th anniversary celebrations of seine net fishermen, held recently in Udappuwa Beach, Chilaw.
According to the Minister, the decision was taken following requests made by seine net fishermen during discussions held at the ministry in the past few months.
Minister Amaraweera said fishermen who engage in seine net fishing used winch machines earlier to pull seine nets due to the labour shortage. However, a ban on the usage of winch machines to pull out seine nets was imposed recently considering the environmental damage caused.
Following a research conducted by the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) which revealed that the beach and seabed were badly affected due to illegal seine net fishing practices, such as the use of four-wheel tractors equipped with a winch to pull out seine nets, relevant authorities proposed to ban seine net fishing in Sri Lanka. Around 18,000 fishermen currently engage in seine net fishing in Sri Lanka under 400 seine net owners. Livelihoods of the families would be badly affected due to the ban imposed on winch machines. Considering this situation, the Minister instructed relevant authorities to lift the ban and grant permission to use winch machines without damaging the coastal environment.
The Minister further instructed authorities to take strict legal action against fishermen who damage the marine environment by using these machines.
