Dullas hails proposal to grant land to the deprived
PM praised for always being in Parliament:
The proposal to grant plots of land to deprived people is a commendable move in the budget proposals, opposition member Dullas Alahapperuma said.

Political party supporters' attitude should be changed - Lakshman
Badulla district Parliamentarian Lakshman Seneviratne told Parliament on Saturday that the attitude of grassroots level supporters of political parties should be changed to avoid conflicts among them.
He made these comments participating in the Second Reading Debate on the Budget Proposals for the sixth allotted day.
“All parliamentarians of the present National Unity government work in a friendly manner. We should send that message to the village level to avoid political conflicts among our supporters,” Seneviratne said.
He said the government cannot present a budget that satisfies each and every citizen of the country.
"There could be some shortcomings in the budget," the MP said.
“The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime could not introduce a pension scheme for the private sector. The majority of the people in this country wanted to find state sector jobs mainly because of the pension. This attitude of the people will change with the introduction of a pension scheme for the private sector,” he said.
Seneviratne added that the introduction of the school uniform material voucher will enable to avoid financial corruption.

Masses benefit under national government - Amaraweera
The people in the country have benefitted due to the national government, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.

Minister Amaraweera said this government as well as the budget is a novel experience. "We accept that is not the perfect proposal but it has more constructive features," he said. "But the opposition never sees the constructive features."

New laws should be drafted to eradicate wastage, corruption - Opp Leader
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said in Parliament Friday, that Budget 2016 presented by the Finance Minister aimed at addressing the economic crisis of the country, but new laws should be drafted to eradicate wastage and corruption.
“Corruption needs to be eliminated with a firm hand and need special laws to deal with this menace,” the Opposition Leader said.
He made this observation at the commencement of the Second Reading Debate on the Budget Proposals for the fifth allotted day.
“This country was ruled by one family for a period of time and a family member of that family took all the decisions. But today, both the UNP and the SLFP has formed a strong government," he said.
The Opposition Leader also said the country’s exports should be enhanced.
Ceylon tea was the best in the world and Ceylon tea had a wide market in Europe and Arab countries.
“Sri Lankan Missions abroad should play a pivotal role in finding market opportunities. We should not find market opportunities in the European market only, but should also address market opportunities in nearby countries, specially in India. India has a 300 million population and local production in India was not enough to fulfill the country’s requirements.
Market opportunities available in India would be helpful to attract investments to our country,” he said.
He also said that the Rajapaksa regime was not interested in enhancing the living conditions of people in the North and East. So they expect the present government to fulfill their needs.
The attitudes and thinking of the preset government is different from the previous government. But there has been no change in the lives of the people. They continuously suffer severe hardships even after six years after the ending of the war. They want to live with dignity and self respect in a united and undivided country. They like to contribute to the development of the country.
“So there is a comprehensive need for an urgent action to uplift the living standards of people in the North and the East by giving them opportunities to made their contribution towards the development of the country.” He said.
Paying his condolence to the family, relatives and friends of the 17 year-old-boy from Jaffna who committed suicide by jumping in front of a moving train, he said that this act demonstrated the frustration of the people in the North and the East undergo.
The government should think deeply about the message of this young boy.
