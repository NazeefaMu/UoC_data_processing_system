Governed by poverty

‘More than 30 percent of Lanka’s population lives in absolute poverty and private-public partnerships could help reduce this number to a great extent,’ one official said recently. Apparently, Sri Lanka has initiated several poverty eradication projects since independence. Though those projects have done a lot to reduce poverty levels, it is necessary to do a lot more to reduce the poverty level overall; because more than 30 percent of the total population lives in absolute poverty.
This government, with the help of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Sri Lanka, announced the initiation of a strategic Public Private Partnership (PPP), around the country's key priorities related to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
Even in Sri Lanka in the past, some commentators have claimed that due to economic liberalisation, poverty in the world is rising rather than declining, and that was confirmed in the country. They also argue that extending property rights, giving land to the poor peasant and boats to fishermen with protection to the poor, is one of the most important poverty reduction strategies a nation can implement. Securing property rights to land, the largest asset for most societies, is vital to their economic freedom.
The World Bank too concludes that increasing land rights is ‘the key to reducing poverty’ citing that land rights greatly increase poor people’s wealth, in some cases doubling it. It is estimated that state recognition of the property of the poor would give them assets worth 40 times all the foreign aid since 1945. Although approaches varied, the World Bank said the key issues were the security of tenure and ensuring land transactions were low cost. In China and India, noted reductions in poverty in recent decades have occurred, mostly as a result of the abandonment of undemocratic forced collective farming in China and the cutting of government red tape in India. In addition, new enterprises and foreign investment can be driven away by the results of inefficient institutions, corruption, the weak rule of law and excessive bureaucratic burdens.
However, ending government sponsorship of social programmes is sometimes advocated as a free market principle, with tragic consequences. For example, the World Bank presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for the fertilizer that many farmers cannot afford at market prices. In Lanka in the past period, civil wars in the south as well as in the north created poverty and misery. Masses wasted time and wealth seeking a solution; thus increasing poverty.
Tamil national problem
They sat in the baking sun. Sometimes through the cold of night facing dangers, amid the dust and pollution of the roadside. For approximately 20 years, family members of those who disappeared during and after Lanka’s civil war in the south have been protesting continuously at various locations across the country. Now, less and fewer people come. Maybe parents have died or they are satisfied with compensations.
At the same time, the civil war in the north and the same suffering or more, spread into the Tamil homeland too. In the first case, Sinhala youth under the guidance of Sinhala chauvinist political parties attacked everybody who wanted to resolve the Tamil national problem. Of course, they did not attack Tamil politicians but went against pro devolution Sinhala activists including popular politicians such as Vijaya Kumaranatunge and Deva Bandara Senaratne. Mass repression followed and over- forty thousand – disappeared and families of the disappeared organised protests as described above. There were petitions in support of them, taken to HR Commissions in Geneva.
In the meantime, Tamil freedom fighters were able to capture power in many parts of the Tamil homeland.
Even the Indian army failed to arrest their progress. They assassinated many Sinhala and Tamil politicians; some who supported Tamil freedom. They had the power to assassinate Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Then with the support of world powers including of course India, Lankan armed forces were able to repress the Tamil insurrection. That was a disaster with many disappearances. Families of the disappeared in the Tamil areas too were organised by the human rights organisations and they claim around - hundred and fifty thousand- are missing.
The protestors on both sides are seeking answers as to the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones, many of whom were disappeared during the repressive wars, including after being taken into the custody of the Lankan state authorities in its final stages and immediate aftermaths (from 1988 to1989 and from 2008 to 2009).
In order to obtain those answers, they are calling for the release of information that could provide vital clues. In particular, they want the Lankan Government to release a list, known to have been kept by the authorities, of all those who surrendered or were detained by the security forces during and after the wars.
This demand, along with four others, was issued by Tamil protestors at a meeting with President Sirisena in June this year. Apparently, it was met by a pledge from the President that he would take immediate action to secure the release of the records. He has made similar promises to Sinhala protesters too. Meanwhile, the protesters – mostly Tamil mothers – still continue their fight. Organisers have produced a series of infographics detailing the locations of the protests and the number of days occupied at each. They claim that already the longest running of these would have surpassed the half-year mark. These figures speak to the extraordinary resilience and determination of the families.
Sinhala and Tamil insurrections
The time has come to say enough is enough. Promises and pledges from the government of Sri Lanka must now give way to concrete action. The release of the list of detainees, un-doctored and in full would be a crucial first step in the right direction.
It is correct to emphasise that getting distracted by arguments about the numbers that were killed or went missing, during or in the immediate aftermath of the end of nearly three-decade wars, between the state security forces and both Sinhala and Tamil insurrections could easily distort the truth.
In any conflict, while a single death is a tragedy, a large number of deaths are a statistic. If people allow themselves to lose sight of the tragedy of what happened, reconciliation and the guarantee of future peace will become more elusive.
It is necessary to be careful not to allow one to get distracted by arguments about numbers because figures can too easily get in the way of the truth.
Time has come to understand reality as it is, without prejudice and hate. We have to learn to look at the other with meththa, karuna, upekka and muditha. Private and public cooperation, unless based on such firm ethical foundation, results in the increase of exploitation and poverty.
