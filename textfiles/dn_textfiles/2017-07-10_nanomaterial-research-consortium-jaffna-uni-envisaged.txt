Nanomaterial Research consortium at Jaffna Uni envisaged

The Western Norway University of Applied Sciences on Friday signed a collaboration agreement with the University of Jaffna on capacity building and establishing of a research consortium in nanomaterials for clean energy in the presence of Norwegian Ambassador Thorbjørn Gaustadsæther.
Under the agreement, the Norwegian Embassy will provide 6.2 million Norwegian Kroners (112 mn LKR) over a period of three years for the programme.
“I hope this partnership on clean energy technology brings new ideas and advances in sustainable energy solutions for Sri Lanka,” Ambassador Gaustadsæther said.
Part of the funding will be used to upgrade the laboratory facilities and for technical assistance and capacity building at the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Technology at the Kilinochchi campus and at the Faculty of Science at the Jaffna campus of the University of Jaffna.
Establishing a consortium on clean energy technologies, which includes the partners and private enterprises in Sri Lanka and Norway is a main objective of the programme. Clean energy technology is a priority sector for Norway. Therefore, promoting the technologies and building linkages between research and business is encouraged leading to further investments in innovation.
Enterprises in Norway and in Sri Lanka will contribute to the project by providing technical assistance, placements for the students, involvement in research projects, and offering mentors and external supervisors for the research projects. They will offer opportunities for visits and exchange of knowledge through discussions as well.
The Norwegian Embassy through this collaboration is further strengthening the support of 4,7 million Norwegian Kroners (85mn LKR) received from NORPART (Norwegian Partnership Programme for Global Academic Cooperation) for the period starting from 2017 to 2021.
In March of this year, the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences and the University of Jaffna signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on educational and research cooperation at Masters and PhD level.
Under the NORPART programme, the two institutions collaborate on higher education and research in nanomaterials for clean energy technologies (HRCNET). The University of Bergen and the University of Agder from Norway, the University of Peradeniya from Sri Lanka, and the Coimbatore Institute of Technology from India are included as partners in the project.
