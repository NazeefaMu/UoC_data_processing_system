Gammanpila challenges Police Media Spokesman

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila yesterday said he could prove who should be arrested for levelling false allegation against ex-Navy officer Commodore D.K.P. Dassanayake.
“I challenge the Police Media Spokesman to an open debate in this regard,” he said.
Gammanpila said, “We will see that justice is carried around him and we will provide evidence against those paved the way for his arrest from behind the curtain.”
Police on Wednesday arrested ex-Navy officer Dassanayaka over allegations that he was involved in the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth during 2008 - 2009.
Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera said Police arrested Commodore Dassanayaka in connection with allegations leveled against him that he abducted 11 civilians for money during 2008.
