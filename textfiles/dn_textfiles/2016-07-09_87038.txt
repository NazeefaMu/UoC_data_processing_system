Education Minister gives directive to play final before July 12

In a bid to resolve the ongoing crisis involving the Milo President’s Trophy knockout final between Royal College Colombo and Isipathana College Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has given a directive to the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA) to play the final on or before July 12.
The Minister had spoken to both the Royal College and Isipathana College committees and instructed the principals of the respective schools that the match should be played on or before July 12.
The Minister cited the reason for the deadline of July 12 because some of Isipathana’s players are scheduled to leave for Hong Kong with the Sri Lanka under 18 team and hence their practices will start immediately.
However it is learnt that Royal College want to play the final on July 16 and not earlier than that.
Isipathana College rugby committee Media Manager told the Daily News: “We have requested SLSRFA only for a venue change and not a date change. Hence as Isipathana had informed early we are definitely not willing to play the final on June 16.”
Meanwhile the Daily News reliably learns that the SLSRFA which has been unable to resolve the matter amicably over the past five days has to-date not booked a venue for the final other than the Royal Sports Complex.
