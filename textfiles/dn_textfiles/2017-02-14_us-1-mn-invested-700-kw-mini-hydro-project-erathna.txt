US$ 1 mn invested in 700 kw mini hydro project in Erathna

 
A million dollar investment by a renowned Japanese investor paves the way for 700 kw mini hydro project at Erathna in Ratnapura. The project which is nearing completion is due to be commissioned in August 2017.
Zero Plus Co., Ltd, a reputed corporate with high stakes in cosmetic production, mail order business and fitness is the sole investor in this valuable project which paves the way for more productive ventures in the near future. “This investment is our foremost penetration into hydro-power related projects. Despite its electricity generation being primarily run by hydro-power, Sri Lanka still has vast untapped potential in the capacity of utilising hydro energy due to its abundance of lakes, rivers, and streams.
This is the primary main reason behind our focus. This initial project paves the way for more investments to be channeled towards the development of hydro power,” Zero Plus Director and CEO Keiichiro Yatomi said.
“TAD Lanka Investments is proud to be a part of this vital hydro-power project which is an indispensable requirement due to the power crisis faced by us as Sri Lankans. This investment, which is an introductory venture, opens more avenues for the promotion of sustainable energy projects by a host of other Japanese Investors of TAD,” TAD Lanka Investments Director and CEO Atheeq Ansar said.
