Patients not receiving advantage of lense price reduction

The people are not receiving the benefit of the price reduction of lenses done through a special gazette notification.
An investigation has been initiated pertaining to this issue, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, prices of eye lenses imported to Sri Lanka by 38 companies had been reduced through the special gazette notification but it seems the profit is now distributed among doctors and companies.
"The patient only gets a price reduction of Rs. 2,000. But, this amount should be much higher than this. The prices of some eye lenses have been reduced from Rs. 26,900 to Rs. 17,000," he said.
The prices of eye lenses have been reduced from Rs. 25,900 to Rs. 16,400, Rs. 28,000 to Rs. 16,200, 25,900 to Rs. 15,500, Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 15,500 and Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 12,100 etc. The full price reduction list is available in the gazette notification, he added.
