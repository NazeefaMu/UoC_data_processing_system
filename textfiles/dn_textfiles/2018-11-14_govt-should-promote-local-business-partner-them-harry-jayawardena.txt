Govt should promote local business,  partner with them - Harry Jayawardena

The new government should promote local business entrepreneurs and look at entering into joint venture partnerships with local companies rather than offering 100% of projects to foreign companies, said Sri Lankan business magnate and investor Harry Jayawardena.
He was speaking at the Business Today Top 30 awards ceremony on Monday night at Shangri- La Hotel Colombo. “Sri Lanka should not go with the Begging bowl to countries seeking loans. “What I am saying is not to discourage foreign projects but give more support to encourage and egg on local enterprises which has all the resources and talent to match any foreign projects,” he said.
Jayawardena also disclosed that his company, Melstacorp PLC, paid over Rs. 65 billion as taxes last year. “Future governments must ensure that relief be granted to people who are struggling for life. Unfortunately there seem to be little or no time to address their issues.”
Having introduced the Business Today Passionate segment in 2017, the organizers also honored four enterprising business leaders for their continued investment in the country’s future and confidence in the economy.
The Business Today TOP 30, 2017-2018 and Business Today Special Recognition award ceremony was held under the patronage of Chief Guest, Maithripala Sirisena, President of Sri Lanka. The event was also graced by Venerable Galboda Gnanissara Thero, Chief Incumbent of the Gangaramaya Temple.
