GMOA wishes to overlook Committee on SLSFTA

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) would hold discussions with all relevant parties on August 30 at 10.00 am, at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo, to set up an organisation to overlook the Committee on the Sri Lanka – Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo, yesterday evening, he said that they would build a public campaign against the International Trade Ministry Secretary’s operation to formulate more FTAs. According to Dr. Aluthge, President Maithripala Sirisena had already appointed economic expert Prof. W.D. Lakshman the committee chairman.
International Trade Ministry Secretary Ms. Chandani Wijewardana was ignoring the committee and was attempting to sign similar FTAs. Sri Lanka did not have a National Policy on Signing FTAs and a system to appoint a mandate, he added.
