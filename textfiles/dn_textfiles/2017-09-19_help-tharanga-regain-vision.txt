Help Tharanga regain vision

D. G. Chtthra Ranjani Tharanga (45), mother of one, of 'Saman Niwasa', Maragahahena, Malimbada, Palatuwa is suffering from bilateral corneal blindness since 2004.
She had undergone several surgical and medical treatments but had not gained any improvement so far.
Consultant Eye Surgeon Dr. Kusum Ratnayake has recommended to implant a device called Boston Keratoprosthesis to help her regain vision.
Two such devices to be imported from the Massachusetts Eue and Ear Infirmary in Boston, USA are estimated to cost Rs. 330,000.
Ranjani says she has to attend the Cornea Clinic of the National Eye Hospital regularly and all this involved an unbearable expenditure.
She requests philanthropists and the public to assist her cause by sending whatever financial contributions possible to help raise the money and enable her to regain her vision. All contributions should be remitted to Account No. 77843161 at the Bank of Ceylon, Malimbada branch. Contact No. 0716143503.
