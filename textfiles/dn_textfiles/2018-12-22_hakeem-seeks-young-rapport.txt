Hakeem seeks young rapport

Town Planning Water Supply and Higher Education Minister Rauff Hakeem said he will build a rapport with the youth to address the issues of the higher education sector.
The Minister was addressing the gathering at the Higher Education Ministry yesterday after he assumed duties.
Minister Hakeem said the outcome of the recent political turmoil can be considered as a victory for democracy.
He said everyone should keep in mind that political posts are temporary. He said a few elections will be held next year.
“But it is doubtful which election comes first. A few persons decide which election to be held first.
These persons should not exercise political agendas when calling an election. They should think of the future of the country when they decide to hold an election,” he said.
He said he believed that all these political issues could be resolved if the President called for a Presidential Election after January 8. A general election will be held next September. Struggles for power may arise after the next general election also, it is sad, he said.
He said he will intervene to resolve those political struggles after the next election.
The Minister said that the country has an educated younger generation and it is a credit. “The higher Education sector should be reformed. We have to design our university system to make our degrees livelihood oriented,” he said.
He said he cannot do much in a short period but he would take every possible measure to set up a hassle free environment for higher education. “We do not have high expectations but we will do our best,” the Minister said.
