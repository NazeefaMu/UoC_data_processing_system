Wonder Woman has a home in Bethel

Moulton “Pete” Marston grew up with Wonder Woman. A super heroine created by his father in the early 1940s, she first appeared in a comic book when Marston was entering his teens. She made such an impression on him that he began collecting Wonder Woman items. He’s been collecting ever since.
Fourteen years ago, when he was 70, he decided to gather all that he had accumulated and house his collection, a gift to his three children, in his Bethel home.
Marston has what he calls his “museum,” a wonderland of Wonder Woman memorabilia, in a special, secure area there. Comic books, however, are in a bank vault.
With many of the items purchased online, and gifts from fans around the world, the collection ranges from toys to shirts and hats, to household items. There are games, maps, sunglasses and just about everything else that falls into the you-name-it, he’s-got-it category.
Of course, there’s a full-size mannequin of Wonder Woman and her mother, Hippolyta, too. And there’s a section devoted to actress Lynda Carter, who played Wonder Woman on television. She is, to several generations of people in the U.S. and abroad, Wonder Woman come to life.
Carter visited Marston not long ago. “She had a ball,” he said. “I hear from her frequently. She’s a terrific lady. She’s a beautiful 62-year-old who looks like a 40-something. She’s a marvelous girl.”
Where, Marston was asked, did Wonder Woman, a 6-foot, dark-haired, beautiful Amazon princess, originate and what is the allure she has for so many people?
His father, William Moulton Marston, - a lawyer, writer, psychologist and inventor - was asked to create a hero when he worked as an educational consultant for DC Comics on the eve of World War II, he said. However, Marston’s mother, Elizabeth - a psychologist and lawyer - objected to yet another comic book “hero.” She wanted a female heroine.
Marston’s father, with his wife’s input, came up with the idea of Wonder Woman. Cartoonist Harry G. Peter was given the task of drawing her.
“Wonder Woman represented a new type of woman, a woman who controls her force with love,” said Marston.
“She made the world aware of how much women were capable of. ... She was also a transition from the housewifery of the time to the possibilities of accomplishment in the outside world.”
Once Wonder Woman entered the world, Marston’s father used her to teach Marston and his three siblings lessons in behavior. He did that during what was dubbed “The Sunday Club” in their Rye, N.Y., home.
“He directed our thinking with stories about what she did and why,” Marston said. “While she was a powerful lady, she didn’t hurt people. We learned that you can convince people about what you’re thinking, but you don’t have to be a bully to do it.”
Were the Marston kids interested in those life lessons taught using Wonder Woman?
“Yes,” said Marston.
“My sister was especially interested because Wonder Woman was a female action figure whose tools included her ethical and moral standards, physical strength, Lasso of Truth, invisible airplane and bulletproof bracelets.
“We were also shown the original art and saw what was happening every step of the way,” recalled Marston, owner of Marston Real Estate. “I was fascinated by it. She was a unique figure that took off.”
Over seven decades after she made her debut, Wonder Woman is still an iconic figure in the world.
“She is highly recognized,” said Marston, “especially in South America and the Orient. She’s like a female Superman and girls still want to be recognized as strong. They’re her biggest fans.”
Marston’s daughter, Christine Holland, who oversees, collates and catalogs the collection as well as a Wonder Woman website, had a slightly different take on Wonder Woman’s continued popularity.
“She’s an inspiration to the world,” Holland said. “She’s taken on a life of her own ... She’s become a totally real person because she’s impacted real people. She has evolved from a comic book heroine to a real person.”
