Matara DS conducts career guidance programmes

The Matara District Secretariat (DS) Career Guidance Unit has commenced programmes in order to direct job aspirants and school leavers to employment avenues.
According to Unit Head Janitha Thilanath, the programmes are currently underway at a Divisional Secretariat Division-level in the Matara district. In this regard, measures have also been initiated to conduct job markets with the participation of leading businessmen, entrepreneurs, and non- governmental organisation heads in the district. Job aspirants and school leavers would also be called for interviews, and applicants would be selected for vacancies available with the concurrence of the business community.
These awareness workshops are held so as to enable such individuals to reach their goals in finding employment. Theoretical and a practical training would be given to them on how to prepare bio-data applications as well.
In addition, separate awareness programmes and workshops are being carried out for G.C.E. (O.L./A.L.) students, unemployed graduates, teachers-in-charge of counselling and guidance, parents, and job aspirants.
Programmes on overcoming career challenges, career guidance, training on priority basis, and garden-management would also be conducted by the Matara DS Career Guidance Unit.
Matara DS statistical data revealed that at present, the number of unemployed persons in the district has exceeded 23,000. On the instructions and supervision of Matara District Secretary Pradeep Rathnayake, officials attached to the Matara District Secretariat Career Guidance Unit led by Janitha Thilanath, are conducting the workshops.
The Manpower and Employment Department is also involved in these programmes.
