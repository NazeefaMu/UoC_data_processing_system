Illicit sand-mining increases environmental pollution

Illicit sand-mining along the Karaiwahu river in the Sainthamaruthu Divisional Secretariat area has increased environmental pollution and created many problems.
The public alleged that certain officials are supporting this illegal action. Thereby, the river bunds are damaged and some lands along the river bunds have washed away. The condition is very evident between the Mawadippali and Karaivahu bridge. The public requests authorities to act and halt this activity.
