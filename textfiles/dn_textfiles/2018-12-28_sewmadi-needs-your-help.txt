Sewmadi needs your help

Tasheena Sewmadi Badiwattage, 4-year-old daughter of retired army officer B.N. Tillakaratne of Pahalawatta, Hiriliyadda Road, Wawwa, Modarawana, is suffering from transfusion dependent thalassaemia.
Consultant Haematologist Dr. Lalindra Gooneratne, who is treating her, has recommended a bone marrow transplant to cure her. The girl is now undergoing pre-transplant work-up at a private hospital in Colombo.
The cost of the surgery including provision of donor cells from overseas is nearly Rs. 8 million.
Tillakaratne says his eldest son died of thalassaemia at 14 in 2013. Two other younger children are attending school. Since they would not find local donors, it was planned to obtain donor cells from abroad. His family cannot afford the expenditure and therefore, he requests the public to assist his child’s cause by sending whatever financial contributions they can to help expedite the surgery. He is making this appeal as a war hero, who had rendered 22 years of service to protect the motherland. All contributions should be remitted to the Account No. 80191279, Bank of Ceylon Walasmulla Branch. Contact Number 0718604270.
