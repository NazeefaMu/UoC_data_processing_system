Ministry to cut on waiting lists over heart, eye surgeries

Private hospitals to get the load:
The <U+200B>Health<U+200B> Ministry will make arrangements to carry out heart and eye surgeries at private hospitals to cut down the number of patients on waiting lists at State hospitals, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, the ministry will pay the costs to private hospitals on behalf of state sector patients.
The private hospital authorities handed over a report on charges and the times allocated to perform surgeries in their hospitals to Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne recently. The Private Hospitals Regulatory Council will study the report and make recommendations to the minister, the sources said. The private hospital authorities told Minister Senaratne that they make losses due to Rs. 1,000 charge for dengue tests, the sources said.
