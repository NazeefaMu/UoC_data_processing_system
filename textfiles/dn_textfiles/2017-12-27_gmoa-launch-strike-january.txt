GMOA to launch strike in January

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will launch an island-wide strike in January if the Health Ministry does not respond positively in two weeks to the proposals handed over by the GMOA one year ago regarding the allowance paid to doctors for additional duties, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the strike will be launched in January if the Health Ministry does not respond in two weeks.
Dr. Aluthge said they would not accept non-payment of the allowance to doctors for additional duties on any grounds since the Government pumps Rs. 300 million every month for the SAITM owner even though the Government still not taken over his hospital. From 2017 budget the Government abolished the tax relief available for doctors' allowance for additional duties. The doctors completely oppose this move. The allowance was revised for the last time in 2013. All the other state departments have already increased all their allowances in parallel to the salary increase granted in January 1, 2016, he said.
