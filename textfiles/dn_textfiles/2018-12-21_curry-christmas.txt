Curry for Christmas!

 Juliet Coombe tests her haggling skills and learns to cook in the sand dunes on the borders of Yala National Park, one of Sri Lanka’s most beautiful national parks.
Christmas in the freezing cold might be some people’s idea of fun if you like snow and cooking turkey for hours. However for those who want a wild Christmas in the tropical sun nothing beats a holiday at Jetwing Yala, where you can go on lots of different amazing experiences ranging from the naturalist bat man tour to cooking in the dunes being watched over by the passing wildlife.
If you are serious about cooking curry then you have to get up at the crack of dawn as fresh ingredients are key to making a great curry dish. It’s 5am in the morning and unlike everyone else I am not about to jump into a safari jeep and go to the islands national wildlife park, Yala, in search of the much prized leopard or sloth bears ‘walaha’ that love to eat berries and play as they cross the road. I am in contrast heading off with the hotel’s Executive Chef, to buy myself a cat fish from the local fisherman and learn to cook over an open bush fire in traditional clay pots, or even buy a mini shark, if we get lucky and the catch proves to be a good one, at Kirinda fishing harbour.
As we drove into Kirinda harbour the place was abuzz with whirling fishing boat engines and wooden crates, dripping with ice and sea water, being unloaded as dealers in brightly coloured sarongs gathered in a circle. Each one had old school notebooks, with well-chewed pencils hanging from pieces of string, recording today’s prices based on what the boats were hauling in. I am reminded, by an old man sewing up his net with a giant needle that this is one of the oldest professions in the world and the only place social media does not yet have a hold. The dealers opened and shut their books while they haggled, even walking away at times waving their hands in the air, all part of the theatre of making a deal over the cost of a catch of the day and once decided various sizes of scales are then hung up in a row to weigh in the different boats’ hauls, which consist of, sadly, owing to the bad weather, a rather large amount of Eratavalla, which is a tough chewy tuna-like fish.
In the background gold amulet necklaces were being sold from a trader’s arm, alongside rather discoloured ice keeping the fish cool and a lotto guy, on a Singer bike, creating a frenzy after buying the winning ticket, as more door-to-door salesmen turned up from surrounding villages, on the equivalent of Honda MD 90 motorbikes with only a slab of wood tied onto the top to keep the fish from popping out on the bumpy entrance way into the harbour, where you now have to pay a car and person’s entrance fee.
Boats keep coming in as the sun rises over the harbour and the price seems to rise with it with each successive lot brought in. I decide to cook Thalapath, better known as Blue Marlin, as it is good with tamarind and the spices grown on the Jetwing Hena Farm back at the Jetwing Yala tented glamping experience. Of course, we must pick up a few curd-cooking pots on our return and this was a wonderful excuse to see how they are made either by machine or hand thrown from the mud that is dredged up from the lake. Here you see the women of the pottery village slap mud onto a turning wheel and keep it moving with their feet as they throw one pot after another.
They are then dried in the sunshine and fired in home built kilns and the more artistic among them make elephant cups with the handle as the trunk to sell to passing tourists. Except for the dogs that darted in an and out of these home run businesses the experience of being with the community and talking about indigenous cooking was as interesting as being part of the daily ritual of haggling for fish.
I am excited to learn more about the health benefits of the island spices and herbs and working out which ones best suit fish or vegetable curries. We go to the Hena Farm, next to the solar panels that give the hotel natural energy, and pick pumpkin, wild gringos and small red chillis with dynamite flavour that in truth could easily blow your head off. We enjoy a refreshing coconut in the palakotya, a small open cottage resting place in the centre of the farm, where more than six vegetables are available to cook Southern style rice and curry.
We head off in a buggy across the dunes to the glamping cooking site, which, for those who are not familiar, is glamorous camping under the stars, and nothing could be more fun with a bar restaurant built into sand dunes surrounded by bushes creating a natural canopy and seats created out of old tree trunks, surprisingly comfortable to sit on during lessons.
We start the course by cutting up all the ingredients and rubbing two sticks together to create fire and when we fail Nalin is not averse to throwing paraffin on it, giving you the most exciting campfire as it blazes in all directions. Once under control we cut up the fish and for those who really want to go back to the good old days Nalin will even show you how to make your own curry powder with a stone grinder, but only if you have managed not to spend the entire budget on fish.
To make Yala style fish curry we first heat up the terracotta pot with the coconut oil, and add curry leaves, red onions, garlic, green and red chilli, and pandam. We then marinate the fish with curry powder, chilli and crushed pepper. As the mix of spices turn a golden brown and fill the air with the real smell of spices, we toss the cut up cubes of fish into the pot adding coconut milk and a touch of tamarind.
Minutes later we have a great Southern fish dish served on a banana leaf and start to cook the other vegetable curry dishes to go with it and enjoy a much more spicy festive season than the more traditional roast joint and veg.
If you are a slow chopper you may find yourself eating the food under the stars and not for lunch.
This is no bad thing as you get a 360-degree clear view of the constellation on the dunes and being on the border of the park you may even see the elephants that come past daily at sunset to watch the staff playing football and you cook. Monkeys play in the trees as I prepared each dish, a monitor stopped for a minute to watch how I was doing and birds darted in and out of the simple dune open air kitchen. After my gourmet bush tucker meal I headed back to the Yala tented camp site for a nice siesta in an Aladdin style luxury tents and fell asleep listening to nature’s orchestra of birds.
