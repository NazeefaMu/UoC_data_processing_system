Djokovic cruises into Rome quarters

Rome: Second seed Novak Djokovic reached the Rome Masters quarter-finals on Thursday after a 6-4, 6-4 third round win over Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut.
Djokovic, beaten in the final by Britain's Andy Murray last year, will now face either Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro or Japanese seventh seed Kei Nishikori.
Rafael Nadal, enjoying his best season on clay in two years, will look to book his place in the last eight later when he meets American Jack Sock, seeded 13th, on centre court.
The Spaniard, a seven-time champion in Rome, swept Djokovic aside in the semi-finals of the Madrid Masters last week before going on to secure the title. AFP
