Dry rations to farmers in drought-affected areas

The programme initiated under President Maithripala Sirisena to provide dry rations to farmers in drought-affected areas is now being implemented.
Packs of dry rations consists flour, dhal, sugar, gram, canned fish and other food items are being distributed under this programme in 13 districts.
The dry rations are issued by the district and provincial secretaries, and delivered among selected farmers through cooperative unions.
President Sirisena visited Kebithigollewa on July 30 to find out the issues faced by farmers in drought-affected areas. He noticed that farmers are facing financial difficulties as they have been unable to harvest three seasons due to the drought.
He directed officials to provide dry rations to such farmers.
Providing drinking water to the areas affected by the drought is also carried out in an organized way. Officers of the Tri Forces are deployed to assist district secretaries and provincial secretaries to manage the task. Accordingly, the drinking water project fulfills the needs of 250,000 people of 20 drought-affected districts.
Meanwhile, a discussion to further formalize these activities was held on August 21 at the Presidential Secretariat. It was presided over by Secretary to the President Austin Fernando.
Representatives of the Presidential Secretariat, Ministry of Disaster Management, Ministry of Town Planning and Water Resources, Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Finance participated in this discussion.
The discussion was also focused on providing drinking water facilities for affected people during night time, in addition to day time supplies. It was also discussed in detail about obtaining new water bowsers.
Similarly, attention was drawn regarding implementing a method to provide water for other needs of the affected people as well as regarding the provision of water for wildlife and a decision was taken to carry out the works continuously. Meanwhile, under the first phase of the programme to distribute dry food rations to families affected by the drought in the Sravasthipura, Anuradhapura District, dry rations were distributed among 1,000 families at the premises of the Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society in Sravasthipura, on August 21.
A total of 4,500 families were qualified for this programme. Dry food rations will be issued shortly for the remaining families too. Dry food rations were issued at the Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society in the city of Anuradhapura. Through the Cooperative Society, dry rations will be distributed among the affected farming community in the Nuwaragam Palatha in the Eastern Province. Currently, dry rations were distributed among 3,000 families out of the qualified 4,616 families.
The affected people expressed their gratitude to the President for providing the relief at a time when they are faced with a severe economic crisis due to the damage caused to their agricultural lands due to the drought.
