Kandy SC causing heartburn for all coaches

Greetings island rugby hearts and all who have taken to our much talked about union code.
Sri Lanka’s history and ever increasing fan base are really justifying rugby’s self styled .reputation as the island’s most popular sport by a long touch kick?
This is clearly seen by the interest already generated for the upcoming Singer schools season, and the packed Nittawela cauldron for the Saturday skirmish between a step up CH and the high riding Lions...
It was a huge task for our Maitland marauding warriors to outthink and outshine Kandy’s vastly experienced glam side..especially up there.
The team list if carefully observed can cause heartburn for all coaches planning to beat Kandy or at least some pride in theory ....from a vastly one sided encounter. 50 points have been rattling the manual scoreboard with alarming consistency.
Captain Gayan W a visibly inspired leader with plenty to smile about this season, much praise about their professionalism and performance in the middle, a bonus of sorts.
CH&FC this season has been a team with the biggest hearts and most generous thoughts ...gifting four games in round 1...Army, Havies, Police and Navy were an open door policy much to coach Lagga’s surprise and despite clear definition of the job in hand.
However, they have stamped their class and mind to fight back, in more terms than any team this season.
I am in awe of those experts who subsequent to leaving their comfy all knowing deck chairs...would have not seen how much strike venom is in the CH tank...what an enthralling 80mins of intense skill and strike power on both sides ..Mandy dominating and punishing all mistakes to lead at half time.
Maximum credit to the likes of Sasanka, Satya, Rohita and a Yoshita who has been fierce both in attack and defence.
Kandys 8 holding their own in the sets...But not allowed to settle and dominate with significance. Udangamuwa, Lema, Soyuru, punching holes but stopped in their tracks...especially Dimitri who didn’t stop trying.
Had it not been for the combined finishing by Ratwatte, Sooriyabandara and Marija...mustering all their experience ...Kandy were almost beaten and saved face in the last 2mins with a Pereira twin try to wrap it up and massive relief ....then raucous celebration by the faithful.
Contemplate the knockouts and wet your impact drunk lips with considerable delight ..its going to be bruising and relentless rugby for us to enjoy each weekend.
Kandy, Havelocks, Navy and CH have shown that nothing is impossible...and will look to grab all they can ...watch out for Police and Air Force who have found belief and points last two weekends.
It’s too compulsive not to claim some expertise etc....plenty of rugby surf options to beef your deck chair social media soapbox?
Opinions are everything these days of rapid sharing ...glad Sri rugby finally decided to have regular TMOs at all games ...But vital to have those big screens and attached emotions or physical emogies as part of the island game.
Seems difficult if facilities, especially for decision making, aren’t the same at each ground.....standard basics at all venues is fundamental to the quality of rugby and the process of fair play....and essential to the final results.
Big hand to Muthuthanthri, currently in NZ and making the cut to play for Auckland in their provincial 7s tournament...it is fabulous news and a logical step up for the Sri 7s captain ...who has shown huge commitment and dedication over the last 5 seasons..
Muthu opens that door and is a classic statement of the 7s class available here in paradise.
I am looking at more Sri islanders like Ranjan Danuska, Jason D, and Srinath Sooriya B ....we certainly have good Sri rugby friends in Auckland and also in Wellington...which simply means that it is more than a one off trip.
Let’s look forward to more regional interest from Japan and Hong Kong ...especially after our U18, and U20 7s came home as Asian champions in 2016...
Glad to see that Kevin Kutty Dixon has recovered from his jaw injury and very much back in stride for round 2 and the rest of this domestic season. He will be listed for the Asian 7s starting in March with the Borneo 7s and much pressure to change last year’s fortunes. Danushka Ranjan most likely to retain his Sri captaincy ...given his scintillating form and try accumulator...
It’s all to anticipate and glow knowingly...Sri rugby is getting stronger Asia wide and it’s a matter of high priority that we get it absolutely on the button for our 7s ambitions.
Waiting for that day when we dominate rankings, put pressure on teams and are feared for our skill to finish.
Blessings to all Sri islanders who make the grade.
Asian games and Commonwealth games...here we go.
Bula bula the Sri heart for more!
