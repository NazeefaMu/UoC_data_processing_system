SLIIT organizes ‘Shoot for the Stars’ student conference

The Faculty of Business students’ society of SLIIT recently organized the Business Management Student Conference for the 11th consecutive year.
Aimed at guiding the students in the business management faculty to become future leaders in today’s dynamic business world, the theme for this year’s conference was ‘Shoot for the Stars’.
With the focus on ‘Reshaping your journey towards success’, the conference served as the ideal platform for students to interact with industry professionals, gain insight into employer expectations and listen to inspiring speeches made by many eminent personalities.
Keeping in line with the objective of motivating students to pursue their career aspirations, well renowned Sri Lankan Musician and Director of BNS Productions Bathiya Jayakody in his motivational speech said, “I started my music production house in a small room. It is fine to start small. We can then rise higher. What you need are commitment and dedication. You must also move with the times. When technology changes we must keep up with the change. Don’t think the way most people think; think differently. Strive to do something different. Dream big. This is the right time and the best period of your life so therefore choose correctly”.
Whilst improving leadership, communication, team work, problem solving and analytical skills, this event is seen as an opportunity for students to learn how to adapt to the dynamic business environment. Students were also given insights on the current job market and the recent economic developments of the country.
In a thought provoking address, Laksiri Wickramage Deputy Chairman and CEO at Derana said, “In the past we learned that our country is a developing nation. Even now we learn that our country is still developing. When will this change? Where have we gone wrong? If you go to Australia, they show tourists sights that are 200 years old. But they market them very well. In our country we have sights that are more than 2000 years old."
