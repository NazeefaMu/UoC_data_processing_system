Addalaichenai Weaving Centre road in disrepair

Residents of Addalaichenai DS division are faced with great difficulties in reaching the Addalaichenai division No: 12, for the weaving centre concrete road is in disrepair.
Schoolchildren attend Addalaichenai Central College (National School), Al-Muneera Ladies High School and Iqrah Vidyalaya with much difficulty. They have to cross the road by removing their shoes.
Although residents have brought this matter to the notice of the authorities on several occasions, no action had yet been taken to repair the road.
Residents urge the authorities to provide a quick solution to this matter.
