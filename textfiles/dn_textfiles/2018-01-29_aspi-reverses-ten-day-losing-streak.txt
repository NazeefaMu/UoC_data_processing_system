Point of view
Equity markets turned positive this week as markets reversed a 10-day losing streak to close the week on a positive note.
Since hitting an eight week high of 6540.5 during the 2nd week of trading in 2018, markets have recorded two consecutive weeks of profit-taking; this week’s positive momentum however, helped push the YTD gain on the Index up to 0.7% (cf. 0.5% last week and 2% in the 1st week of trading in 2018).
Market activity continued to be driven by stronger institutional and HNI activity for the 3rd consecutive week, with off-market crossings amounting to Rs. 2.6Bn or 65% of total market turnover.
Institutional and HNI participation so far this year has ranged at a high 60-65%, notably higher than the Q4’17 average of ~45%. Relative to last week, when significant interest in Banking counters drove investor appetite, this week’s crossings were driven largely by blue-chips and Banks, with JKH accounting for 45% of total crossings while COMB accounted for 14% of total crossings and HNB accounted for 19% of crossings.

Foreign inflows to the domestic equities meanwhile, rebounded sharply this week, reversing the slowing pace of foreign flows over the last two weeks.
Net inflows to the CSE rose to a notable Rs.1.4Bn this week, higher than the net inflows of Rs. 344Mn and Rs. 359Mn in the last two weeks but lower than the Rs. 1.9Bn inflow in the first week of trading.
Markets in the holiday-shortened trading week ahead are likely to move side-ways as further profit taking is likely to be off-set by continued buying interest.
Base effect pushes December inflation lower
NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation levels in the economy, continued to follow the declining trajectory exhibited since the early months of 2017.
NCPI Core inflation consequently fell to 2.7% Y-o-Y in Dec’17, down from 2.8% Y-o-Y in Nov’17 and 7% Y-o-Y at the end of Q1’17, and 4.1% Y-o-Y at the end of Q2’17.
Headline inflation levels during December meanwhile fell to 7.3% Y-o-Y down from 8.4% Y-o-Y in Nov’17 due the high base that prevailed in December 2016.
The CPC import price of Crude oil during Q4’17 meanwhile, largely tracked the increasing trend in the global price of the commodity, with price increases primarily due to the weaker dollar, healthy world economic growth forecasts, OPEC-led production cuts and U.S. crude inventories declining for the 10th consecutive week.
Unexpected supply disruptions at the end of December meanwhile pushed Brent crude oil prices to new two-year highs and this uptrend has continued in Jan’2018.
Mid-month Crude oil prices rose to a near 3-year high of $70 a barrel as the OPEC-led coalition’s decision in November to extend their production limitation agreement beyond its previous deadline of March, generated further space for the end of the supply glut which caused a major dip in prices since 20141.
Global oil Analyst estimates expect Brent crude prices to remain within a range of $60 – $66 a barrel in 2018 and the impact of these relatively higher global oil prices is likely to impact supply-side inflation levels in Sri Lanka.
