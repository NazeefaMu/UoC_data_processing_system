Joint Opposition bring No-Confidence motion against Ravi

 
Thirty-four members of the Joint Opposition have brought a No-Confidence motion against Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The motion was handed over to the Speaker’s Office this evening.
Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake is currently embroiled in the Central Bank Treasury bond issue where it has been established he has a ‘close’ friendship with former Perpetual Treasuries Director Arjun Aloysius.
