Moneragala District Judge’s wife complaints to HRC over school admission

The wife of the Monaragala District Judge, Dinithi Kariyawasam lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission (HRC) on Monday about the failure of the education authorities to provide a suitable school for her child, due to her husband’s transfer.
Speaking to the Daily News she said her husband, the Monaragala District Judge had been transferred from Monaragala to Balapitiya effective from January 01, 2018. However, despite having applied for school admission to Dharmashoka College, she had still not received a response with regard to the admission of her child.
“Its been a month since schools have commenced for the year and my child is still at home without a school. Judges are also transferred periodically, but there is no proper mechanism to ensure proper schooling for our children. My Husband was transferred to the Balapitiya Magistrate’s Court from January 1. We appealed to the Director, Education and applied for the school in November, but have still not received even an acknowledgement of my appeal,” she said.
Therefore,she had lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on Monday and said further measures are being taken regarding the predicament of their child.
