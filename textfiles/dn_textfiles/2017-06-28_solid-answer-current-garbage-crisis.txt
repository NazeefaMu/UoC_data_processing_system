A solid answer to current garbage crisis

Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill:
Following the Meethotamulla garbage dump tragedy which claimed 40 lives, the need for a substantial waste management policy was much spoken of. The Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill in Puttalam would become a solid answer to the current waste management crisis that Sri Lanka is now at, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka believes. The project would be carried out under the directions of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development.
The project expects to collect and manage 1,200 tons of waste on a daily basis. According to statistics of the daily waste generated in the Western Province, only half of it is properly collected. In the Colombo district alone, nearly 2,100 MT of waste is daily generated of which only 1,600MT is collected. In Gampaha district, 750 MT of waste is generated and only 350 MT is properly collected. In Kalutara district, the daily waste generation is around 550 MT of which only 250 MT is collected.
Project Scope
The project is to develop the worked-out limestone quarries in Aruwakkalu, Puttalam, into a sanitary landfill for disposal of solid waste generated in Metro Colombo region with waste transfer using the rail transportation from Colombo to the proposed sanitary landfill. This would include a transfer operation from the Kelaniya site, rail transport and operation of a sanitary landfill at Aruwakkalu in Puttalam.
The Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill falls under the Metro Colombo Solid Waste Management Projects. As its initiative step, the project is to use waste disposed in Puttalam area and following the first stage, the project is to manage waste disposed in Colombo, Dehiwala, Kolonnawa and Sri Jayewardenapura Kotte Municipal Councils as well.
The Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill would be an exemplary project which shall subdue the commonly shared ‘fear’ against ‘waste dumping sites,’ Minister of Megapolis Patali Chamipaka Ranawaka assured.
“The Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill in Puttalama would not be just a location we deposit waste. It would become what we call a ‘waste park.’ The project would generate a number of income opportunities for the youth of Puttalam area as well.” Minister Ranawaka explained.
Difference to dumping sites
The Project Director of Solid Waste Management Project, Jayavilal Fernando pointed out the importance of not using technical terms used in waste management loosely. He explained how the Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill differs from an open garbage dumping site or a land fill.
“At an open garbage site, waste was merely dumped and done away with. Meethotamulla was a waste dump. At a Sanitary Land Fill, we do not ‘dump’ waste. We ‘deposit’ waste and manage it according to scientific methods,” Fernando explained. Fernando further explained that the compacted waste would not be deposited directly into quarries.
Waste transported by rail
“The earth will be covered by several artificial layers upon which the waste would be deposited,” he said.
Fernando said that artificial layers would include a Geo Textile layer, a Benthonite layer and a 1.5 mm HDPE (High-density polyethylene) layer. “The thick platform made by these layers would ensure that the deposited waste will not affect ground water sources. Fernando highlighted that the Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill project will incorporate with Sri Lanka technical guidelines on solid waste and comply with all international standards followed when constructing a waste deposit site. The deposition mechanism of waste would be a layer-by-layer formation, it was also explained. Thus, only an area about 800 metres in height would be visible to an onlooker, Fernando said. Explaining how waste will be transported by rail, Project Director Jayavilal Fernando explained that the collected municipal solid waste would be transferred firstly to a station in Kelaniya. The daily waste expected to be collected by this project is 1,200 tons. “This location would not be a dump site. It would only be a transitional location at which the waste is transferred to a train. The waste would then be transferred from Kelaniya to Aruwakkalu via train,” Fernando said.
“The collected solid waste would be tipped to a dump pad and then pushed into a compactor. Then, the waste would be compressed into transport containers. The containers will be loaded into trains for transportation,” Fernando said, explaining the operations that would be taking place at the Kelaniya transfer operation site.
Fernando pointed out that the project expected to utilize 2 locomotives to make two trips daily (2 up and 2 down) carrying 600 Tons of compacted solid waste. One train will consist of 13 rail wagons and 26 containers (20ft.).
Since the necessary railway lines are already in use, the project would only have to develop a railway line about 500 metres in length. Fernando explained the uniqueness of the site proposed for the Sanitary Land Fill in Aruwakkalu. He said that there were worked-out lime stone quarries which could be used as natural basins to deposit waste.
Importance of proposed site
“There is no use of these worked-out quarries. These quarries have been used since 1979. They are freely available. The best we could do is to deposit waste into these quarries and then grow man made forests or turn these sites in to nature parks,” Fernando pointed out. The other speciality Fernando pointed out is the absence of human settlements within a radius of 3 km. The closest village to the landfill which is a fishing community, is situated 3 km away from the site, Fernando said. There are no animal activities reported in the area as well, Fernando said.
Fernando also said the land fill is situated about 300 metres away from the coastal area. He assured that the coast or the ocean will not be affected by the land fill. He also explained that the soil quarried from live mining sites could easily be utilized for soil covers which are finally laid upon each waste deposit.
The Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill project is expected to provide a long term sustainable solid waste management system which is socially acceptable, environmentally friendly and economically feasible for the Metro Colombo Region (MCR).
