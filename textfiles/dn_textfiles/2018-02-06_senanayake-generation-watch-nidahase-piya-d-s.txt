Senanayake generation watch Nidahase Piya D S

A special screening of Suneth Malinga Lokuhewa’s latest film ‘Nuidahase Piya D S’ was held for D S Senanayake and F R Senanayake’s generation. D S Senanayake’s nephew Rukman Senanayake, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Vasantha Senanayake and former Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapaksa attended the event.
Commenting on the film State Minister for Foreign Affairs Vasantha Senanayake said that the film fills a timely need of making a biography of the great politician.
“Many countries have made biographical movies about political heroes. ‘Nidahase Piya D S’ is the first film of this nature to be made in Sri Lanka. Many of today’s generation talk about freedom but they do not know the hard work, dedication, the sweat and blood which was shed while winning freedom.
The film brings these aspects to the fore.
It sets him as an example to many youth and politicians,” he said.
