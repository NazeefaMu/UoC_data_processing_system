Head over heels for dames on two wheels!

The motorcycle is a machismo machine foremost. The older ones have chunks of devices sticking out all over the place, bits of motor showing there, tubes here, wires there, an unmistakable gas tank bloating out like a pot-bellied male slob exposing himself on the beach.
There is a great ‘barroom-barroom’ bellow emitted from the engine reminiscent of the fictional bogeyman Bull McCorby’s infuriated roar when a hammer hits his thumb. The motorcycle is decidedly a muscular masculine machine built essentially for motorcycle guys. The motorcycle guys will always ride motorcycles. Then there are the rest of us. We are not motorcycle guys.
The point I am trying to make is that when compared with motorbikes the motor scooter is much more about the humans astride it - the rider and passenger - and particularly so when they are women. In the case of both scooters and mopeds controls are simple and easy to use. The noise output is subdued, and the engine, fluids, fuel tank and wiring are all obscured behind designer panels. It is essentially designed to both suit and resemble the feminine form.
Besides, the noisy, oily, hot, smelly, metallic power of the machine is not a part of the scooter riding experience. Instead, the scooter is more on the lines of an elegant, curvaceous woman whose looks, sound and feel is dictated not by the machine below but by the aesthetics and ergonomics of the human interface above. And they come in colourful shades of feminine pink, lemon, mauve and yellow.
It is nothing short of a transportation revolution in Sri Lanka’s conservative middle class society, where many women don’t have to depend on husbands or brothers to shepherd them around. Thanks to the scooter they have realised that the convenient and most elegant way to commute is to scoot.
Where the motor scooter is the dominant form of transportation, it becomes the equaliser, the emancipator, the symbol of women’s liberation. The image and flexibility of the motor scooter frees them from the stereotypical role played by vehicles in a male-dominated society. While a lady on a motorcycle tends to be at least anomalous, the motor scooter steps up to the plate with elegance and grace.
At present, scooters for girls are increasingly becoming the most viable option to commute. This is in direct relation to the financial capabilities within our country. A car may not be a luxury item, but it sure is treated as such here because of the high cost of owning one. On the other hand owning a two-wheeler is much more cost effective. Vroom... and they are off zigzagging through traffic. Middle class women all over the country are no longer willing to submit to the rigours and constraints of suburban or city bus rides. They are increasingly taking to mopeds and scooters and enjoying the new-found feeling of freedom and convenience.
With a motorcycle, you have to swing your leg over the seat, not very becoming for a demure dame. But on a scooter, you can sit on it like a chair. It's very convenient and dignified for women, especially for those who wear skirts, dresses or even saris and use the machine to commute to and from work. Scooters are looking pretty sharp these days. The newer models look like something from out of The Jetsons.
The ones I know have formed the ‘Women on Wheels’ club characterised by a certain rebellious flavour. But the problem is that they are often stalked and ridiculed by ‘Highway Casanovas.’ Behind their feminine charms and demure looks, some of these scooter women are as tough as the brawny men on big bikes. And they are no pushovers when it comes to bandying words with incurable skirt-chasers.
Take the case of Brenda confronted by the old guy at the wheel of a swank BMW. He lowered his power shutter, poked his head out much like a leering tortoise in search of a suitable mate. He then shot the hackneyed line: “Why, hello! So we meet again! Long time no see, no? Brenda fired back: “I never forget a face, but in your case I'll be glad to make an exception.” The light turned green and so did the guy’s eyes as she shot through a narrow opening leaving the old lecher stranded.
But the man appeared persistent. He came alongside her at the next traffic light ogled her with unmitigated lechery and exclaimed: “Hey beautiful, how about a hot date with a real tiger?” Brenda shot him a contemptuous stare and quipped: “So you think you are a big cat with nine lives. Mess with me and you’ll have none!” Quite undeterred the man followed her to the next traffic light. He asked quite boldly: “How about you and I hitting the hot spots.”
Brenda answered with cool composure: “Sorry I don’t date outside my species.” But the old reprobate was relentless in his pursuit and at the final stop made a bold pitch: “Hey cutie. How about it? If you have the time I have the money and the inclination.” Brenda by now had come to the end of her tether.
She back-pedalled her scooter to the rear of his gleaming luxury vehicle and announced loudly: “ I may be a cutie, but mess with me and I’ll kick your bootie!” With that she edged closer to his vehicle and gave its boot a hefty kick with the heel of her shoe. The old road Romeo took off like greased lightning.
Twin sisters Mali and Lali were on their mauve scooter when another old greying leering wolf parked alongside and shot his line: ”Where have you girls been all my life?” Pillion rider Lali took one glance at him and said, “For your first half of it, we probably weren’t born yet, grandpa.”
In another instance two young bucks sidled up to them in their souped up racer saying: “Hi girls! Haven’t we met before?” Lali smiled sweetly before responding acerbically: “Yes we are both doctors at the VD clinic!”
Then there were the two motorcyclists with pillion riders who sandwiched Brenda at a traffic light and made their teasing remarks. They followed her. She stopped, parked her scooter. It was quite revealing when she divested herself of the helmet. They realised instantly that as in her case most women are not always as young or pretty as they are painted. The bikers mysteriously scooted.
Recounting the incident Brenda laughed uproariously saying. “Only when I took off my helmet did they realise I possessed a body like Baywatch, and a face like Crimewatch!”
