Health Ministry will strive to prevent doctors’ strike

Maximum efforts will be made to prevent any doctors’ strike that could be planned in connection with the SAITM issue, Health Services Acting Director General Dr.Jayasundara Bandara said.
“Unlike other professionals,
doctors cannot be imported or produced instantly. A few retired doctors is insufficient to provide services to the large number of patients,”Dr.Bandara said.
Addressing a media seminar at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Bandara said although the Government Medical Officers’ Association warned about taking trade union action, they have not launched a strike. Therefore,we are hopeful that no strike will take place.
Dr.Bandara said a doctors’ service cannot be done by anyone else. A labourer can be replaced but a doctor is irreplaceable. Nobody else can fulfill the role of a doctor. Even if retired doctors are recalled to serve, they cannot treat all patients in all hospitals.
Therefore, we will work to prevent any possible strike.The Pet scanner ordered for the Maharagama Cancer Hospital will be brought soon. The technical evaluations have already been completed.But, before that the Pet Scanner installed in the Colombo General Hospital must commence operations,” he added.
