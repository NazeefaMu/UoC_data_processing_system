‘No positive relief for prevailing drought conditions’

The distribution of dry food ration and the drinking water to the drought-hit farmer families in the Anuradhapura District has been in progress. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that although there were some intermittent rains in certain areas in the district, there was no positive relief for the prevailing drought conditions. He said that there were 157,500 farmer families victimized as a result of the existing severe drought.
"I believe that the first phase of the dry food ration distribution programme could be completed within next few days up to now out of the 694 Grama Niladhari Divisions, drought-hit families amounting to 100,160 families in nearly 500 Grama Niladhari Divisions have been offered dry food rations worth Rs. 2,500 each.
The Government agent said that those who had been overlooked during the distribution food rations shall be brought to his notice or to the notice of the Divisional Secretaries or the Grama Niladharis.
The government agent said further that for the completion of the first phase of the food distribution, the Government had allocated Rs. 200 million. For the implementation of the second phase, where the other half of the dry food rations worth Rs. 2,500 is to be distributed, an additional sum of Rs. 363 million would be allocated. He further said that for the one month's dry food ration worth Rs. 5,000 per family, a sum of Rs. 560 million is required.
In the meantime, the distribution of drinking water through the water bowsers where drinking water is scarce has been continuing, according to the Government agent. He said that due to the recent rainfall, the distribution of water to certain areas had been suspended temporarily.
At present, 25,000 families in 15 Divisional Secretary Divisions in the district are being provided with drinking water. It was learnt that the water level of the Nuwarawewa reservoir, which is the main drinking water supply source in Anuradhapura, has been coming down rapidly. The present capacity of the Nuwarawewa is limited to 5,800 acre feet, whereas the general capacity of the tank is 36,050 acre feet. The requests by the Anuradhapura Government agent, Water Supply Board and irrigation authorities, for releasing a Mahaweli water turn of 5,000 acre feet via Nachchaduwa tank, has not been positively responded to so far by the Mahaweli Authority.
