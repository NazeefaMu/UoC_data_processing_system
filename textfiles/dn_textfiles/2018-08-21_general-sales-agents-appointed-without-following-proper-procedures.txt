Presidential Commission probing alleged fraud at SriLankan
General Sales Agents appointed without following proper procedures

It was disclosed at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the alleged frauds at SriLankan Airlines that the airline had appointed General Sales Agents in foreign countries without following proper procedures.
SriLankan Airlines Technical Services Manager Shiromi Cooray giving evidence before the Presidential Commission yesterday said that these sales agents were granted large amounts of money as commissions above the approved rates.
She added that the sales agents were appointed in contravention of the company’s handbook.
Shiromi Cooray when queried by State Counsel Chatura Gunathilake on the appointment of General Sales Agents to the Seychelles, Dubai, Thailand and Singapore said these agents were appointed to foreign countries to issue air tickets for the passengers who are using direct flights. She added that the company called for applications from qualified candidates to recruit General Sales Agents by publishing paper advertisement and ads on the Airline’s official website.
She informed the Commission this recruitment process was never in practice after 2009. Cooray added that this system was again in force after 2015.
