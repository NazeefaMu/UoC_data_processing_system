Improved, efficient train transport system: A distant reality?

As the new budget slaps on even more taxes on vehicle imports, especially the smaller, economical vehicles, serious questions have been raised about the alternative transport options available for the public.
The two incidents connected to railway employees was a rude awakening for the authorities. For years regular commuters have been complaining about overcrowded trains, delays and the necessity to improve standards in bus and train services.
An improved and efficient transport system however seems a distant reality. Short staffed and underfunded, the railway system has a long way to go before many voluntarily opt to travel by train. It was only this year the Railway Department recruited 30 engine drivers, a much-needed addition.
It’s a chicken an egg situation, if the Department is to improve, revenue has to go up, claims Transport Ministry Secretary, Nihal Samaraweera. But to increase revenue, more people have to use the service.

To attract more people, facilities need to be upgraded. Many are not willing to use the railway system because of the dilapidated condition of the service.
The government needs to improve the public transport system said Harsha Rodrigo, a regular train commuter.
Rodrigo, a government servant travels to Colombo for work from Polgahawela every day.
One frustrated commuter asked the government, which is proposing monorails to ease City traffic, “to dream on.”
After taking 26 train rides on two different lines in the last two and a half months, Akhry Ameer has experienced train delays on all his train rides. “Twelve have been at least 20 minutes to 80 minutes behind schedule at the point of boarding, while arrival at final destinations on all train rides have been at least 10 minutes late. "I could write a PhD thesis based on common sense as to what ails our bus and train services, and why we avoid them,” a rather annoyed Ameer claimed. “We travel in overcrowded trains with hardly any air to breathe,” he complained pointing out that commuters have been demanding for a long time, necessary changes to improve the standard of the transport services.
According to Samaraweera, increase in the tax imposed on vehicles is one of the initiatives taken by the government to control the vehicle congestion. That has no relation to the public transport system, he claims.

Often delays in the railway lines are caused by signal failure and technical issues, at times causing accidents. The spate of accidents last year, including the Pothuhera incident, which was widely believed to have been caused by signal failure, set off alarm bells regarding lack of safety measures and the need to upgrade the current system set up during the colonial period.
Samaraweera was quick to admit that there are issues pertaining to signal and engine failures. “These are technical defects,” he claimed. He said the ministry has recently submitted a Cabinet paper to upgrade facilities. The Railway Department needs nearly 15 locomotives to improve the system and added that it will take another one or two years to complete the process.
The initiatives taken by the Transport Ministry to improve services will take at least another two years to materialize. Several attempts to talk to Chief Controller, Ceylon Government Railways failed.
Samaraweera further said the government has allocated Rs. 1,500 million to improve the Kelani Valley Railway Line next year.
The ministry will focus on improving train facilities in the urban area. However, Samaraweera said the ministry has worked out a plan for a park and ride project in Colombo. Where the people can come in their private vehicles, park them and travel in luxurious buses within the city, he said. “It will control congestion,” stating it will be done with the participation of the private sector as well, adding that the government has allocated Rs. 1,000 million for the project.
“It can be completed within a year,” he said. “It is with the mutual cooperation of the administrators and the public, that the optimum use of services and development of the country can be achieved,” emphasized Samaraweera.

Govt's Duty To Provide alternate transport
If the government is imposing a tax on private vehicles, it is their responsibility to provide an alternative solution to the people, claimed Harsha Rodrigo, a government servant from Polgahawala.

Measures should be taken to meet the demands of the people who face various issues in trains. People will choose to travel in their private vehicles rather than getting sandwiched in a huge crowd, he said. Stating that the inefficiency and irregularities of the public transport system have become an accepted norm. He claimed the government should increase the number of trains and train lines.
"The government must show some concern over the facilities provided to the people through public transport system. Trains are very convenient for the people to travel every day therefore it should be improved," claimed K. A. Ajith, a train commuter travelling from Matara. The trains always overcrowded and there is not enough space even to stand, he laments.
There are no signs allocating seats for clergy, pregnant women or disabled people, he claims. “I had to get up and give a seat to a pregnant mother as I did not see any seats allocated separately for them. I was standing for more than one hour,” he said.
Many blame the authorities for not taking proper action. The relevant authorities who are responsible to maintain the quality of the transport system do not come to check it. Sometimes, people smoke and play cards inside the trains causing inconvenience to the fellow passengers, claimed Nadeesha Ranasinghe, a private sector employee from Panadura.
Poor maintenance record of the train carriages and lethargic attitude of the train station employees inconvenience the passengers every day. “Windows are broken, some cannot be opened and some others cannot be closed properly. When the crowd in the train increases, there is hardly any air to breath,” said Ranasinghe.
Pointing out the defects in the railways, she said the toilets are dirty and the doors never lock. When the train jerks the doors automatically opens. Slow trains scheduled before express trains, Ranasinghe highlighted that lack of a proper system often results in chaos in the Fort Railway station. “People run here and there pushing each other when the officials fail to announce the particular platform on time creating confusion.
There are access issues also, not all can climb staircases - specially elders, the sick and pregnant mothers are inconvenienced,” Ranasinghe observed.
Beggars in the trains is another problem passengers face. “They shout in filth at the passengers if they fail to give them money. A person who is traveling in a train will be mentally disturbed when facing similar incidents”, she claimed adding that previous government promised to speed up coastal line but the speed was increased only by few minutes.
Samanmalee Senanayake, a private sector employee, is often forced to stand for over two hours on her daily train ride from Ambalangoda to Colombo. She takes the train to work every day in an overcrowded train, she claims.
“If I don't get one I will have to stand for more than two hours,” Senanayake claimed. She added that there are no toilet facilities in the long distance trains with power sets. Senanayake said women are sometimes harassed by men when traveling in the overcrowded trains adding that it is a serious problem for women travelling daily in trains.

'Assaulted driver not under influence of liquor but sick'
W. N. Gunawardene
A passenger has been arrested in connection with the assault of an engine driver at the Ragama railway station recently.
The Police Department revealed that a court order will also be taken to obtain the unedited video clips of the incident from private television channels. According to Police, the passengers on board a train bound for Rambukkana staged a protest after the engine driver refused to proceed beyond the Ragama station. They alleged that the driver was under the influence of liquor. However, Ragama Police and Transport Ministry confirmed that the driver was not under the influence of liquor.
Train services on the main line were restored after the train in question was taken back to the Fort Railway station by another driver who came from the Dematagoda yard. Passengers of other trains bound to Kandy and Anuradhapura were also stranded for over three hours due to the protest.
Police sources said the passengers dispersed after they assured the passengers that the driver in question had not been under the influence of liquor. Transport Ministry Secretary Nihal Samaraweera said he had called for a report from the Railways General Manager regarding the tense situation which erupted at the Ragama Railway station. However, Railways General Manager Vijaya Amaratunga denied that a separate report was to be submitted. Amaratunga said commuters had assaulted the train driver under the impression that he was under the influence of liquor. The doctor who examined the driver, had reported that the driver was incapacitated due to high blood pressure.
He emphasized that commuters had acted in a violent and provocative manner assaulting the driver. In addition, a spokesman for the Engine Drivers' Association, K. A. U. Kothasinghe also said the driver was sick and not under the influence of liquor and condemned the commuters for assaulting a railway employee.
The situation further deteriorated when the train was stopped, without moving from the station, said Samaraweera.
Emphasizing that halting the train at Ragama was timely, engine driver W. N. Gunawardene said if the driver had halted the train in some other station before Ragama, there would have been a huge block.
The Ragama Railway station is a large one and alternative solutions could be taken to avoid inconvenience, Samaraweera said. Stating that he was not fully aware of the incident and added that decisions will be taken after the report is submitted in two days.
An engine driver who wished to remain anonymous said the driver had informed the control office from Kelaniya about his condition.
“Driving a train is not a one-man show, it is a chain and several people are involved in it. One person cannot be blamed for inconvenience caused to the people,” he said condemning the action of the commuters who assaulted the driver. According to Kothasinghe the driver had retired and was now employed on a contract basis. When Samaraweera was questioned why a retired driver was employed on contract, he said the railways authority faced a shortage of drivers.
Samaraweera said nearly 30 drivers were recently recruited after 10 years and more people will be recruited in the near future, adding that the newly recruited drivers have to be given a minimum of a year's training.
Responding as to why train drivers were not recruited for the past 10 years, he said the Railways union expressed displeasure over recruiting new drivers demanding that they should undergo a minimum training of five years.
He pointed out that nowhere in the world a train driver trained for five years and said even pilots are trained only for one year.
Gunawardene explained that drivers were taken on contract as there was a shortage of train drivers.
As they have to undergo five years training, which is a long process, has necessitated the need to recruit drivers who were still able to drive. Samaraweera assured that delays were not common occurrences.
