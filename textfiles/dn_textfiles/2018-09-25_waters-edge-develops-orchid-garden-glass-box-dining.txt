Waters Edge will accommodate a nursery and an experienced team for the development of orchids, where it will also cater to the general public by facilitating the purchase of home-grown orchids.
A walkway filled with the everlasting aroma and picturesque scenery of flowers, an orchid trail will be developed on the 60 perch land which is the former deer park at Waters Edge, complemented by a pond with ducks and other animals feasting on nature’s harmony, making way for a tranquil and pleasant experience.
The garden will also bear glass cubes, which will cater the silver service fine dining experience with a custom menu suitable for the opulent atmosphere and experience.
The Orchid Garden is also the perfect destination for photo shoots, which may be for engagements, wedding shoots, or even other photo opportunities.
The lush horticulture and attention to nature’s requirements alongside exemplary maintenance definitely accompanies a photogenic environment and ideal location for photography.
