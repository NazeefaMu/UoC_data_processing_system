Organic manure usage in Thihagoda increased

The Thihagoda Pradeshiya Sabha division has progressed significantly in producing organic manure.
The project initiators use a land off the Thihagoda Pradeshiya Sabha office for the purpose.
Garbage and hard waste collected in the Thihagoda and Yatiyana towns, Naduala, Naimbala and Polatugoda sub towns and other Grama Niladari divisions are brought to the land, recycled and converted into compost manure, project officials said.
Residents in the Thihagoda Pradeshiya Sabha mainly depend on cultivating paddy and other agricultural crops and they prefer compost manure to chemical fertilser for their cultivation, the officials said.
The new project help safeguard environment, the residents said.
The project has provided several direct and indirect employments.
The Southern Provincial Council funds the project.
