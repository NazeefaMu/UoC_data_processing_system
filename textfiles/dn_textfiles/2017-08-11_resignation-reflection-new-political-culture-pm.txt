Resignation, a reflection of new political culture: PM

The resignation of Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake reflects the new political culture which was brought about with the good governance government, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that he was proud of ushering in that tradition and culture in the country, making history.
The Premier made these observations addressing Parliament soon after the statement made by Minister Karunanayake on his resignation. The PM also said that the Deputy Leader of his party told him that he needed to resign from the ministerial portfolio.
“I told him to take that decision after discussing it with the President,” the Premier revealed . “He met with the President on Wednesday and later he went to meet the President with me and Minister Rajitha Senaratne. He handed over his letter of resignation. Some were demanding his resignation this morning too but he had already submitted his resignation.”
The Prime Minister said that Ravi Karunanayake’s resignation also signifies that the government would not interfere with the probe by the Presidential Commission on Treasury Bonds. “There is no similar example in the political history,” Premier Wickramasinghe said. “This is an unprecedented instance. The incumbent government has realized its good governance goals”.
“Where in this country had a minister been summoned before a commission?,” questioned the Premier. “Where had a minister resigned for making a speech or two? We are introducing a new political culture. If anyone in the UNP is accused of stealing we would remove him or her. We will not harbour thieves”.
At this occasion the Joint Opposition members were heard shouting.
Responding to them the Premier further said that he did not accuse anyone of anything. “I just explained the party’s position on thieves. Then why only a section there (pointing towards joint opposition) got upset and reacted? (pointing towards the JVP and TNA) None here was disturbed by what I said.”
He also said that the reaction indicates where the thieves are. “If there are no sand thieves, sil-redi thieves, drug dealers, tsunami thieves, carom board thieves, cement thieves among you why do you get upset,” questioned Premier. “You could not investigate any theft for 10 years. You killed Lasantha Wickramatunge, you abducted and killed Eknaligoda.”
Premier Wickremesinghe said that Minister Karunanayke did not go before the Supreme Court to obtain stay orders to avoid the commission. “He went before the commission, made his statement, came here and resigned to take a seat back there,”he said . “We saw what happened to Priyasath Dep under the previous government. When Dep was acting independent and criticized then government, he was transferred to the Supreme Court to prevent him becoming Attorney General. But Dep was lucky and became Chief justice.”
He also said that media freedom has been guaranteed. “I remember there was a time when the media called us traitors. They even called for my resignation. Today everyone is called a thief. We are called thieves,” the Premier said. “The person who writes that we are thieves is also a thief. Today media has the freedom to write anything. When I read papers in the morning, I am happy to see media exercising their freedom. I am proud to see the change.”
