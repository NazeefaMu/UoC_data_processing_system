NCHS holds third graduation ceremony

“Private tertiary education has a vital role to play in educating Sri Lanka's youth. A variety of qualifications and exposure it provides would otherwise be unavailable to many Sri Lankans. Higher education is no longer optional for young people and meeting its growing demand is a challenge”, said State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne, who was the chief guest at the Nawaloka College of Higher Studies aka (NCHS), third graduation held at Waters Edge.
The minister congratulated NCHS for making a good quality education available to more young people in the country.

High performing students were awarded 18 scholarships to attend Swinburne University of Technology, Australia aka SUT. They will commence their second year of studies at SUT campuses in Australia or Malaysia, by February 2018.

Acting Australian High Commissioner Tim Huggins as the special guest and the Deputy Vice Chancellor of Swinburne University of Science and Technology David Coltman too graced the occasion.
David Coltman stated, “At Swinburne we encourage our students to embrace the notion that we are all learners for life. Your graduation will not represent an end-point to your educational adventures.”
