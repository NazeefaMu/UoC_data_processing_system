Cigarette smuggling at BIA foiled

Customs officials at the Bandaranaike International Airport arrested two Chinese nationals for attempting to smuggle 318 cartons of foreign cigarettes containing 63,000 sticks recently.
The value of the consignment has been estimated at Rs. 3.5 million.
The cigarettes were concealed in the false bottom of their travelling bags, said Customs spokesman Sunil Jayaratne.
The suspects had arrived at BIA on a Cathay Pacific flight.
Investigations were carried out under the guidance of Customs Additional Director General Stanley Senarathne and Customs Director (Airport) M.A. Karunarathne, Deputy Director E.M.J. Nawaratne, Superintendents M.M.P. Rohana D. Ajith and R.K.M. Dayananda and Assistant Superintendents T.N.D.T. Samaranayake, Aruna Samarasinghe, Y.B.L. Indika and J.G. Pathirana.
