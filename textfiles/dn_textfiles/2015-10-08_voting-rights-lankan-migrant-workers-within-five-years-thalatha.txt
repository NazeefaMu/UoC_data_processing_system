Voting rights for Lankan migrant workers within five years -Thalatha

Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala yesterday expressed confidence that she will be able to grant voting rights to Sri Lankan migrant workers within the next five years.
She made this observation while addressing the media after a ceremony to introduce the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment new Chairman Rajpal Kumar Obeysekera.
"Requests have been made by various institutions to pay our attention on this issue and discussions are currently on among the authorities to find-out a proper method of doing it such as the introduction of e-mail voting," she said.
Athukorala also said that illegal migration is one of the major issues faced by the SLBFE and the recent Kuwait incident proves that illegal migrants have no chance to enter any country.
Eleven Sri Lankan women sent to Kuwait on tourist visas were deported recently.
The minister promised to take strict action against SLBFE officers linked to the racket.
Four officers have already been interdicted.
