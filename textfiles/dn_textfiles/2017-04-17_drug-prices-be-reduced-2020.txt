Drug prices to be reduced by 2020

The price of all drugs will be reduced by 2020, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, arrangements have been made to reduce the price of 48 commonly-used drugs.
Steps will also be taken to reduce the price of heart stents as well. He was addressing a meeting of pharmacy owners in the North, recently.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said issues faced by private pharmacy owners will be resolved after reducing the price of 48 commonly-used drugs. The profit of pharmacies has been reduced due to the price reduction of commonly-used 48 drugs.
Pharmacies can sell State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) drugs as a solution to their loss. The possibility of offering them a commission of 18 percent is being studied by the SPC Chairman, the minister added.
