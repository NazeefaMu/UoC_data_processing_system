The Fine Art of Falling to Pieces

Once upon a time I was falling in love, But now I’m only falling apart. –Bonnie Tyler, “Total Eclipse of the Heart”
What happens to a woman alone? This question, though in theory settled by experience—they muddle on much like anybody else—is one we can’t seem to quite let go of. Books are written in defense of the single woman’s experience (against whom, it’s not quite clear), in praise of their revolutionary potential (for whom, it’s not quite clear). Even if in the real world, such a person no longer raises anyone’s eyebrow, that woman, in literary terms, is question.
Anyway, the answer is—she falls apart. Going entirely to pieces is an option available to anyone, but in fiction it’s usually the prerogative of women. Men might run into grand existential dilemmas, but they resolve it by, for instance, killing their pawnbroker. If, on the other hand, you do little but sleep and drink, you are likely to be a woman. “How far one can let oneself go, when one is entirely alone and shut in!” wonders the wife in Simone de Beauvoir’s “The Woman Destroyed” after her husband has left her to vacation with his mistress. Later, when she realizes he has truly left her, she writes:
Utterly paralyzed
Now I am a dead woman. A dead woman who still has years to drag out—how many? Even a single day, when I open my eyes in the morning, seems to me something whose end I can never possibly reach. In my bath yesterday the mere act of lifting my arm faced me with a problem—why lift an arm: why put one foot in front of another? When I am by myself I stand there motionless for minutes on end at the edge of the pavement, utterly paralyzed.
At the end of the story, the woman prepares to re-enter her empty house with dread. She has nothing but the empty and unstructured prospect of her future before her, from which she cannot be saved, and which she cannot bear. Her life was supposed to be over—she had moved through courtship, marriage, and children—but in destroying her, her husband has given her life again. The trouble is, she doesn’t want it.
“Courtship, marriage, and children” is a story. But a solitary person—what kind of story can she have? She’s shapeless; her life is a problem for her. She has to keep on putting one foot in front of the other. Other people get bored of hearing how her husband left her, and even she gets bored. Though the woman’s been destroyed, she’ll have to go on living in the ashes of her feeling. Her life is a problem for her. But why women? In real life, to be undone by romantic loss is not peculiarly female. “Women who do nothing cannot bear those who work,” the husband in de Beauvoir’s story tells his wife, and perhaps work is part of the answer. For his wife, work was merely the prelude to the actual story of her life, which began and ended with him. Her life exists to support his. Without that, she’s nothing—and nothing is what she becomes.
Boiling water
“But a solitary person—what kind of story can she have? She’s shapeless; her life is a problem for her.”
The premiere artist of the crack-up isn’t Simone de Beauvoir, however. It’s Jean Rhys, a woman who herself was almost incapable of boiling water, whose posthumous reputation has languished in the foyer of the canon without ever being admitted all the way inside. Too admired to be underrated, too consistently remembered to be forgotten, but with a reputation too slim to be firmly and solidly recognized, she lingers and will continue to linger at the threshold of respectability, talented and beautiful and yet curiously helpless. She’d like you to rescue her, but enjoys knowing she can’t be saved.
Rhys’s women were never specimens of health in the first place, but by the time we meet them, they’ve lost their men, so they might as well be dead. To be so abandoned is a failure of being; their role is essentially parasitical—they need to be cared for by a man. So they disintegrate, exquisitely, falling to lower and lower depths, shabbier and shabbier hotels. Rhys and her novels inspire two reactions. One is over-identification. In Flaneuse, Lauren Elkin recalls teaching Rhys’s Good Morning, Midnight to her students, only to be confronted by the school psychologist:
“You’re the culprit!” she said. “You’re the one who taught Jean Rhys last week.” “Yes,” I said warily. “Why?” “I had four of your students come to see me, totally shattered by that book!” A couple of those students came to my office hours. One was the most dynamic person in the class, a Gallatin student who had so identified with the book that he waved it in the air and declared: “I am Jean Rhys!” He was having a tough time romantically, and was worried that there was nothing he could do to be happy again.
