Darkest Hour
Old man’s success vehicle

‘Never, never, never give up’ – Winston Churchill
Popular Hollywood actor Gary Oldman gives a surreal portrayal of the late Prime Minister, Winston Churchill in ‘Darkest Hour’. Director Joe Wright narrates the essences of determination and delivers a pretty interesting story altogether in the film which is a strong contender for this year’s Oscars.
It is not just only Oldman playing a historical role that we are all aware of but the actor literary disappears into the role of Winston Churchill. Oldman voices his character magnificently. For that role, the actor had to undergo hours of make up to pull off his transformation into the former Prime Minister. Oldman brings the man to life embodying habits like constant cigar smoking, habitual drinking, and unique way of speaking. ‘Darkest Hour’ is clearly Oldman’s vehicle and he uses the film as a means to give what may be his best performance to date. He brings equal parts of warmth and gravitas to a historical figure known for being intimidating.
Oldman’s Drama
In one particularly memorable scene, Oldman also offers a great deal of vulnerability to Churchill. This brings the whole character together.
As predictable as the Golden Globes, it is (at most times) with the Academy, receiving six nominations including best actor. Oldman won at the 75th Golden Globes for his performance and might probably sweep off the boards for the same at the Oscars.
His performance made me want to learn more about Churchill because though knowing he had done great things I am not sure to what extent he had gone through to become the Prime Minister and how much support he had in his path to victory.
The supporting cast makes a good portrayal of those real people who had displayed a negative as well as a incentive approach towards Churchills’ perspective place as Prime Minister. They play necessary adversaries to Churchill displaying depth in their own conflicting ideas on how to lead Great Britain through the war and its outcome.
His interactions with Mendelsohn as King George VI are rife with tense politeness that translates into a truly compelling drama. Thomas, as Churchill’s wife Clementine, also works to bring out the Prime Minister’s heart and humor, though her character isn’t given much else to do beyond showcasing those qualities in her husband.
The most enjoyable foil for Oldman’s Churchill is Lilly James’ portrayal of his secretary Elizabeth Layton.
Like Clementine, Elizabeth’s main role in the story of ‘Darkest Hour’ is to highlight Churchill’s heart, humor and vulnerability – essentially, the human side of the popular historical figure. However, Elizabeth is given a bit more development, and James’ performance brings the young secretary to life with charisma and charm.
The elevator pitch is how Winston Churchill went from being a contempt outsider to saving all of Great Britain. Britain wanted a peace deal with Hitler at the time and if they did, the world would have definitely seen a different picture now. It was one man, Churchill, who said, “No, We shall fight them on the beaches.” Churchill’s famous radio speech went down in history and it changed the course of the European society on either side of the English Channel.
The second plot
Coincidentally, the second plot to ‘Darkest Hour’ is disclosed in the movie ‘Dunkirk’ by Christopher Nolan. The ‘Darkest Hour’ plot is not about ‘Dunkirk’ story or about principally the planning of the Dunkirk evacuation. It is about whether or not Great Britain should do a peace deal. Dunkirk is a small element in this movie, and so the big point of difference is that as a comparison. The audience, in a way can get details from ‘Darkest Hour’ that they don’t get from ‘Dunkirk’ and vice versa. Ironically, both films will be competing against each other for the awards this season.
