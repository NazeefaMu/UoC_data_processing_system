Some are trying to upset the apple cart: Ravi

A few members among the group who joined in the unity government after the formation of the good governance by the President and the Prime Minister are attempting to create problems while enjoying ministerial portfolios. They should realise that the President and the Prime Minister have engaged in one integrated journey, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
Those who worked full time to prevent the happening of good governance rule, later joined the same administration and their current attempt to put the government in trouble is clear evidence to their malice, the minister said.
The minister made these remarks after paying homage to the Temple of the Tooth Relic on Sunday. Later, the minister paid courtesy calls on Chief Prelates of the Malwathu and Asgiri Chapters an, received the blessings of the two Nayake Theras.
Karunanayake who met the media outside the temple said that he is taking directives only from the President and the Prime Minister.
He said he was not ready to be dictated by individual ministers.
The minister said the duty and responsibility of the government is to implement the mandate given by the people of this country on January 8 and criticism by certain individuals who seized ministerial positions through bargains was futile.
Karunanayake said budget allocations for some of inactive ministries have been curtailed and the relevant ministers were complaining.
"I am not going to answer such calls," he said.
The minister said the government was leading a people-friendly journey by curtailing tax and minimising waste and corruption.
Karunanayake said the country would fall into a crisis if the government was going to work according to the statements issued by some provincial governors and chief ministers.
"The President and the Prime Minister have been doing enough according to the Constitution thereby protecting the sovereignty of the country while maintaining harmony among all communities," he said.
The good governance has walked and extra mile to restore not only five-star democracy but seven-star democracy in the island. Neither white-van culture nor abductions are reported today. No incident of assault is reported either. However the process of bringing the perpetrators to book for their irregularities committed during the previous regime is delayed because such process is being done according to the rule of law, Karunanayake said.
The minister told the two Mahanayakes that the proposals by them to be considered for Budget 2017 have been included accordingly.
He said the Mahanayakes proposed to grant a monthly stipend for student monks and necessary allocation to implement the grant has been made in the budget.
The minister said a mechanism to pay the grant will be launched on the advice of the Chief Prelates.
The Malwathu Chief Prelate said that a country cannot move without revenue.
The Nayake Thera said that it is the responsibility of the government to maintain reasonable prices on essential commodities despite various public tariffs.
Karunanayake said the current government has taken measures to bring down the prices of 24 essential items out of 25 after the presidential election.
