[CITIZENS' Mail - (24-07-2017)]

Long journey home
It has to be admitted that long distance bus services have improved tremendously. This results in exploitation as well.
Buses are stopped at regular intervals in front of hotels/ restaurants etc which offer special concessions to the bus crew. Food is served at exorbitant prices, also under unhygienic conditions. No proper toilet facilities are offered and unclean drinking water is served which compels the customers to buy water at high price.
The health authorities should look into this matter early and grant approval only to hotels/restaurants which comply with health requirements. All others should be closed. Once this step is taken, food supplied will be charged at reasonable prices as a healthy competition would be maintained.
