Interest mounts for NDB Private Wealth Junior Masters Golf 2017

“There has been significant interest expressed by Asian-region junior golfers for this year’s NDB Private Wealth Management Junior Masters Golf Championships. A notable fact is that several players from overseas, as well as 80 Sri Lankans, took part in the 2016 tournament, a major accomplishment for junior golf locally,” said veteran golfer Chandana Weerasinghe, the tournament’s organizer.
This increasingly popular event, now in its third consecutive year, is hosted by expert financial planner NDB Wealth.
“NDB Wealth looks forward to welcoming large numbers of junior golfers to the NDB PWM Junior Masters Golf Championships 2017, as it did in 2016. We are particularly pleased that they will be empowered with the exciting opportunity of competing against some of the best young talent in Sri Lanka and abroad. I’m sure a thrilling morning of golf awaits them on August 18, at the historic RCGC course,” commented Prabodha Samarasekera, CEO of NDB Wealth.
The tournament’s registration desk at RCGC is currently signing up players daily from 7.00 am onward. Entries will be closing on August 14 and the tournament will be worked off on August 18 at RCGC. Applications can also be facilitated by contacting Shehani Dharmakirti of NDB Wealth on [email protected] or 0714308017.
Categories at the NDB PWM Junior Masters Golf Championships 2017 mirror those at the National Junior Golf Rankings, which is an initiative of the Sri Lanka Golf Union in partnership with NDB Wealth.
In 2016, the NDB Private Wealth Management (PWM) Junior Masters Golf Championships saw Januka Dilshan winning in the Gold category (aged 15 to 17 years); Taniya Minel in the Silver (aged 12 to 14 years); Yannik Kumara in the Bronze (aged of 10 to 11 years) and Shanal Binushka in the Copper (aged nine years and below).
