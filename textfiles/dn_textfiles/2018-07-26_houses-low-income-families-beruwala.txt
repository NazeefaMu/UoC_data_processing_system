Houses for low-income families in Beruwala

Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne laid the foundation stone for a housing project for 18 low-income families in the Minichchikanda area in Dharga Town, Beruwala, recently.
The Health Minister said, "Udagam has been initiated under the concept of ‘Samata Sevana’ under the present government’s housing policy. The Chinese government has provided the President with Rs.48,000 million. We have decided to donate Rs.1 million for a house for each family.”
