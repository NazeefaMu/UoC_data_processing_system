PMB loses paddy as farmers turn to private buyers

The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) had been expecting to purchase about 10,000 metric tonnes of paddy from the Kurunegala district and 6,000 tonnes from the Puttalam district during this year’s Maha season. However, Kurunegala and Puttalam farmers had sold all their paddy to private paddy mill owners, who had bought their harvests at higher rates.
The Paddy Marketing Board currently buys the samba paddy variety at Rs. 41 per kilogram and the nadu variety at Rs. 38 per kilogram, while private buyers pay Rs. 56 per kilogram of samaba and Rs. 42 per kilogram of nadu, Kurunegla PMB Regional Manager R. M. A. Rathnayake said.
At present, there are about 19 paddy stores belonging to the PMB in both the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts of the North Western Province.
All Paddy Marketing Board stores are currently undergoing renovations, Rathnayake added.
