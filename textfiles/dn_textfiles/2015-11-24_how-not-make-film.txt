How not to make a film

Ajasat (Ajatasatru) was the second encumvent of the throne of Magadha, which he secured by killing his father Bimbisara. Initially he was a follower of Devadatta. Ajasat was at first hostile to the Buddha and conspired with Devadatta to kill the Buddha. Devadatta was instrumental in misleading Ajasat to murder his father. Ultimately, like Devadatta, Ajasat too repented for his evil deeds. Although Devadatta was devoured by a hell fire, Ajasat became a devout follower of the Buddha. When the Buddha passed away in the eighth year of his reign, Ajasat was very disconsolate. Ajasat reigned for 32 years and was himself deposed and killed by his son Uda:yin. An encounter between Devadatta and Ajasat is narrated at length in Samannaphala Sutta of the Dhiga Nikaya. In the Milindapanna there is a discourse on the theme of admitting Devadatta to the Order by the Buddha. Devadatta was the son of a maternal uncle of the Buddha who had been coverted by the Buddha himself. After becoming a respected member of the Sangha, Devadatta started a series of plots including three attempted murders in order to take control of the Sangha. The enmity between the Buddha and Devadatta was not limited to this life. Each of Devadatta’s efforts to overthrow the Buddha failed.
The film Maharaja Ajasat is like an audiovisual flow chart based on the established context of religious texts. Finding good texts has not been difficult for the producer (Sunil T) as well as the director (Sanath Abeysekara) of this film and these texts have given what they wanted to make a flow chart like film. A flow chart is a way to map the sequence of procedures and processes with which we make even the most simple things happen. But a flow chart is like a skeleton that has to be fleshed out by the texts. The concepts are linear, rigid, conventional and traditional. The spectra are generalisable and convey conventional historic meanings. As such, there is no fresh communicative power. Where lies the range or depth of this monotonous film? The restricted range of events impede a greater understanding and appreciation of the producer’s work. Unfortunately the pragmatic effectiveness of successful communication is very low because fluency, confidence, imagination and accuracy have been surprisingly sacrificed for lucrative realities. Why should the key characters talk so much? Why is the film full of action? Where lies the creator’s viewpoint or vision? Superfine new technology, verbosity and overaction are sterile attempts to generate fluidity, novelty and imagination. Contrary to the basic view that meaning is non linear and multi-dimensional, this film forcefully encourages and promotes the establishment of a linear uni-directional meaning profile. Are coincidences casually dependent? Are Devadatta and Ajasat notorious despots? Are Bimbisara and his queen sacred divine ones? There are brutal and horrible scenes in addition to unbelievable queer episodes which an enlightened intelligent audience would not accept to digest easily without questioning.
As in any other ordinary film there are well chosen characters, themes and issues of conflict, events, a beginning, a middle and an end. Messages are transmitted. There is an extensive waste of human, technical and temporal resources. But what is lacking is creativity. The director and the producer had nothing to discover or invent other than the extensive application of technical knowhow. The intelligent audience would cast a sympathetic eye on the submerged talents of Sabita Perera and Jeevan Kumaratunga. This adverse comment applies to other central actors too. If the focus of attention has been on the Queen Mother instead of on Ajasat, the film could have taken a metaphorical patterning, non-linear design and multi-dimensionally meaningful.
