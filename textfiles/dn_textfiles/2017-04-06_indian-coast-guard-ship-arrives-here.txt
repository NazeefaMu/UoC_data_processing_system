Indian Coast Guard Ship arrives here

Indian Coast Guard Ship CGS Shoor called on Colombo port on Tuesday. It will leave on April 8 . The ship’s visit is aimed at furthering cooperation and interoperability between the Coast Guards of both the nations and to assist in capacity building of Sri Lanka Coast Guard.
Interaction between both the services has seen a steady increase over the years with three ship visits undertaken by Indian Coast Guard to Sri Lanka last year. The operational exchange that takes place between both the Coast Guards has also served to build mutual trust and provide an opportunity to learn from each other.
CGS Shoor will undertake a day long sea training exercise for Sri Lanka Coast Guard officers and sailors today.
