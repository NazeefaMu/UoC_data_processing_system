Presidential Commission investigating SriLankan
Senior Security Manager gives evidence

The SriLankan Airlines has not taken any steps to procure explosive detectors despite a directive to this effect by the European Commission on August 18, 2011.
This was revealed at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into alleged losses and corruption at the State-run SriLankan Airlines. SriLankan Airlines Limited Senior Manager (Security and Investigations) Lal Titus Kannangara was giving evidence before the Commission yesterday. The witness answering questions by Additional Solicitor General Shanaka Wijesinghe said tenders had been called for the procurement of explosive detectors in October 2014, while the tenders were closed on December 18 in the same year.
However, the particular detectors had been procured in 2016 after calling for tenders.
