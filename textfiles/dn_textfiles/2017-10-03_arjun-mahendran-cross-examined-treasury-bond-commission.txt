Arjun Mahendran cross-examined by Treasury Bond Commission

The former Central Bank Governor, Arjuna Mahendran yesterday revealed that the decision to stop issuing Treasury bonds through private placements came in a backdrop where the newly elected government has to pay Rs. 1.4 trillion unpaid bills of 2014.
He also explained that there was an urgent requirement of Rs. 15 billion to pay arrears due for already completed road development projects. Mahendran pointed out to the Treasury Bond Commission that Private Placement method was not raising enough funds but the fund requirements were urgent and crucial.
According to Mahendran, the Secretary to the Treasury “was facing the crunch” on massive payments including the unpaid bills of the year 2014 which were amounting to a large sum of Rs. 1.4 trillion. So we had to reach the International Monetary Fund to request emergency funding.
The Acting Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, who was cross-examining the witness, then asked how Mahendran dealt with the matter.
“I spoke with the Secretary to the Treasury both in person and over the phone very extensively. The Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe personally spoke with the IMF head and discussed the matter of urgent fund requirement as well. I met the Secretary to the Treasury after every Cabinet sub-committee meeting. We discussed about this matter with the PM, FM and several other ministers as well throughout January, February 2015 and further.” Mahendran said.
“Then the secretary to the Treasury went to the IMF and did an elaborated presentation regarding the matter to the IMF. This was such a serious issue for both public and private sector. Even the IMF wrote a report on this matter, elaborating the magnitude.” Mahendran explained. According to Mahendran, the presentation to the IMF was done on 10 February 2015 in New York.
De Livera then asked Mahendran as to who instructed him to do away with the direct placement method. Mahendran told the Treasury Bond Commission that it was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who gave the directive to stop direct placement method. The Commissioner, Supreme Court Judge P.S. Jayawardena requested Mahendran to elaborate his answer in keeping with the answer given by him on a previous occasion to the same question.
Mahendran then explained that, following the first Cabinet meeting held on late January 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told him to conduct all Central Bank procurement and other activities in a transparent manner. “I interpreted it as stopping the direct placement method.” Mahendran said.
Further explaining, Mahendran said, on 24 February 2017 at the Economic Sub Committee meeting, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told him that the issuance of Treasury bonds should only be done by public auction.
Justice Jayawardena asked Mahendran if he had discussions with PM Wickremesinghe with regards to fund raising methods. Mahendran, in answering to Justice Jayawardena said, that he explained to PM Wickremesinghe that private placement does not raise enough funds and that there are other matters concerning the private placement method. Mahendran also told that he explained to PM Wickremesinghe that the manual of the Public Debt Department clearly states that fund raising should be done via public auction as much as possible. Thus, any instruction given by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe may have been based on the information you gave, Justice Jayawardena questioned, to which Mahendran answered in affirmative.
Mahendran denied ASG de Livera’s suggestion that the Monetary Board disagreed with the decision to do away with the direct placement method. Mahendran pointed out, the Public Debt Department requested at a later stage, somewhere in late June 2015, to re-introduce a private placement dominant method, which was not accepted by the Monetary Board. If the MB disagreed with the initial decision to stop direct placement method, the MB could have accepted the PDD’s proposal, Mahendran said.
De Livera also questioned Mahendran on Cabinet Sub-committee meetings and Economic Sub-committee meetings he participated. De Livera suggested that there were no decisions taken regarding urgent fund requirements for road development projects at these meetings.
Marking the minutes of 24 February 2015 Economic Sub-committee meeting, De Livera pointed out to the Commission that the decision taken at the said meeting was to finance all the road development projects with available funds.
According to Mahendran, the said meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Ministers Kabir Hasheem, Rauff Hakeem, Swaminadan, Dr. Harsha de Silva, Secretary to the Finance Ministry Dr. Samaratunga and senior officers of many ministries.
Mahendran denied that the available funds were enough to pay the arrears payments of Rs. 15 billion and observed that the minutes of the said meeting to be “sketchy.” De Livera asked if Mahendran is disputing the minutes of the meeting, to which Mahendran said that he is. “My recollection is that there was a serious issue of funding requirement.” he added.
Meanwhile the Chairman of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury Bond Issue, Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chitrasiri yesterday informed that the proceedings of the Commission need to be over by the end of next week, so that it will have sufficient time to write the Commission’s report.
Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena on the same subject observed that there would be no point in conducting extensive investigations and receiving series of evidence from relevant parties, if they have a limited time to write a comprehensive report on the inquiry.
The Treasury Bond Commission commenced its probe on 21 February 2015. The Commission has heard evidence from about 50 witnesses from its commencement. These witnesses include around 20 witnesses from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The other witnesses include officials of the Employee’s Provident Fund, the Chief Dealer/Treasury Manager of Pan Asia Banking Corporation, the Chief Dealer/Treasury Manager of Bank of Ceylon, witnesses from companies which functioned as primary Dealers, officials from the Treasury and three officers of the Perpetual treasuries Limited.
Chairman Justice Chitrasiri requested the Attorney General’s panel to complete the cross-examination of Central Bank former Governor Arjun Mahendran in the earliest possible time.
Acting Solicitor General Dappula de Livera informed the tribunal that he can complete his cross-examination within the next day, and Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake and Senior State Council Shaheeda Barrie are to cross-examine Mahendran next.
The cross examination will continue today as well.
