Around 10 students arrested: Court orders protesters not to obstruct public

Colombo Additional Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday issued an absolute order preventing protest organisers being a nuisance to the public, during a street protest that was to be held in Colombo city yesterday against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM).
Issuing this order in terms of section 106 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the Additional Magistrate observed that this absolute order would not hamper any attempts by the protesters to engage in a peaceful protest without causing any disturbance to the public.
The Magistrate observed that organisers of the Inter University Student’s Federation and the Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee can engage in a peaceful protest at the Soyza Roundabout, University Grants Commission (UGC) around the Colombo National Hospital, Ceramic Junction, Galle Face Main Road, Kollupitiya Junction, Temple Trees, Presidential Secretariat, Lipton Roundabout, Olcott Mawatha and Maradana, without creating any obstruction and annoyance to the public or traffic flow.
The Additional Magistrate made this direction pursuant to a request made by the Borella Police. Meanwhile, around 10 students were arrested following the protest in Colombo yesterday.
