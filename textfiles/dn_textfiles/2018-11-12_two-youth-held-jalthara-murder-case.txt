Two youth held in Jalthara murder case

Two youths were nabbed by police in Ratnapura on Saturday night in connection with a murder in Jalthara.
The suspects were held in connection with the murder of Seelawansa Mudalige Tharaka Madushanka, allegedly over a dispute relating to the sand business in Kelani River. The suspects were arrested on a tip-off while hiding in a thick jungle known as Pompakale.
Three swords and a three-wheeler in the possession of the suspects at the time of their arrest were also being taken into police custody.
The suspects were handed over to the Mirihana Police for legal proceedings in connection with the murder.
According to police, the suspects are 19 and 25.
Police had also arrested other suspects in connection with the same incident previously.
The murder was planned by an underworld criminal Melan Maabulage, alias ‘Uooru Juwa’ who had been arrested on an earlier occasion in connection with the incident.
Mirihana Police were scheduled to produce all the suspects before the Homagama Magistrate yesterday.
Police investigations are continuing.
