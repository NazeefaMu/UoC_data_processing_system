State hospitals to issue E-Health card for patients soon

A card (E-Health card) which contains all health reports of the patient will be issued to patients soon now that the Accident Ward of the National Hospital included in the E-Health Project.
Addressing the gathering during the launching ceremony, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said that the E-Health Project has been implemented with the assistance of National Information and Communication Technology Agency. All state hospitals will be included in the e-health project. They hope to provide a doctor for every 5,000 people.
“The Accident Ward of the National Hospital provided an excellent service during the war. The staff of the unit faced many obstacles during that time,”the Minister added.
Over 200 state hospitals are to be added to the E-Health Programme this year (2017) while 40 state hospitals were added to the programme last year (2016). It is expected to include all state hospitals to the network under the programme. Under the E-Health Programme, patients admitted to state hospitals will be registered in a computerised system and all medical reports would also be computerised. The Health Ministry has set up a National eHealth Steering Committee supported by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for this purpose.
