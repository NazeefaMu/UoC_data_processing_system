Minister orders investigations into two incidents at A’pura Teaching Hospital

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has ordered officials to conduct investigations into two incidents that have taken place at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the incidents are in connection with a man protesting opposite the hospital, stating that the hospital authorities and doctors do not treat patients properly and missing the opportunity to conduct two kidney transplants due to a picnic organised by the hospital staff, leaving their official duties behind.
According to media reports, the person who was waiting to donate his two kidneys had died later at the ICU at Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, he said.
