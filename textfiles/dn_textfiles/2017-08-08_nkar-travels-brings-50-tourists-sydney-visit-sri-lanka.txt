NKAR Travels brings 50 tourists from Sydney to visit Sri Lanka

NKAR Travels and Tours Pvt Ltd in partnership with Cruise and Travel Centre Springwood in Queensland, a member of helloworld - American Express group, welcomed 50 tourists who touched down for a 21-day tour in the paradise isle. The group is set to witness the highlight of Asia, the Kandy Esala Perahera, flanked by top destinations covering Negombo, Anuradhapura, Sigiriya, Dambulla, Trincomalee, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya and Yala. Moreover, a much anticipated beach stay and a glimpse of the commercial capital are expected to draw the curtains on a well-spent vacation before the group departs the island by mid-August.
