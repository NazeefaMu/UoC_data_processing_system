Bourse’s secondary market yield curve stays unchanged

Secondary market saw yield curve remaining mostly unchanged with ultra-thin volumes as market participants continued to remain on the sideline at the Colombo Bourse yesterday.
Market witnessed the fourth highest turnover for the Year and MTD recording the second highest volume. ASPI experienced a downward shift throughout the day and closed at 6,519, losing 35 points. Although a high foreign participation was witnessed it led to a net foreign out flow from the market.
Price depreciation in 91 counters led by CTC weighted heavily on the index surpassing the effect of positive contribution made by 69 counters led by big cap HNB.
