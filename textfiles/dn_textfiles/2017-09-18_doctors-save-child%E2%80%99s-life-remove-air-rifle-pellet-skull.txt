Doctors save child’s life: Remove air rifle pellet from skull

A team of doctors attached to the Peradeniya Sirimavo Bandaranaike Children’s hospital have saved the life of a child, aged three years nine months, by removing an air rifle pellet stuck in the skull after a four hour successful surgery.
The pellet which had pierced the child’s head from near the left ear had passed through the head and got stuck on the right side. They were able to save the child’s life because the pellet had not damaged any of the arteries in his head or brain, said ENT Specialist Dr. Sisira Bandara Athulgama who lead the team of doctors who performed the operation.
The mother said the child had been at play with her sister’s child in the house at around 9 a.m on September 11. When her child suddenly started crying aloud she observed that our rifle had misfired and a pellet had pierced the child’s head and they rushed him to the Kegalle hospital.
After initial treatment, the child was transferred to the Peradeniya hospital where surgery was performed to save the child’s life.
The medical team which conducted the surgery also included Paediatic Cardiologist Dr. (Mrs) Sunethra Ilugalbandara and anaesthetist Dr. Kapila Hettiarachchi.
“The child who was in the ICU after the surgery is now recovering well after being disengaged from the machines,” said Dr. D.R.K. Herath.
