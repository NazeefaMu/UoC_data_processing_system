Wayamba Ela project first stage to be completed in 2020

The first stage of the Wayamba Ela project, built to carry Mahaweli waters to the areas in the Kurunegala district suffering from a severe shortage of water, is due to be completed by the end of 2020, Wayamba Ela Development Project Director Asoka Peiris said.
Eight large-scale tanks and 300 small-tanks would be developed under this project, which would facilitate irrigation for cultivation of 12,000 farm lands in both seasons without any shortage. The project will provide direct dividends to 13,000 farmer families and indirect benefits to another 80,000 farmer families, Peiris said.
This will also help resolve the acute drinking water shortage leading to the proliferation of kidney diseases in the region and also bring new employment avenues for the people.
The project will be completed in two stages. The first stage involved the distribution of excess water of the Nalanda reservoir received by the Wemedilla reservoir to the Wemedilla scheme and Devahuwa reservoir through proper canal ways and other development work, and to take Nalanda and Mahaweli waters to the Kurunegala district for storage by building canal ways and development of tanks.
The second stage involved the distribution of water diverted to the Kurunegala district up to Polpithigama, Ehetuwewa, Galagamuwa, Ambalanpola and Mahawa by building canals and also build canals and other development work needed to direct the Mahaweli waters received from the Bowatenna reservoir to the Dambulu Oya to the canals built under the first stage from the vicinity of the Wemedilla reservoir.
The project is implemented under a Rs. 110 million fund from ADB.
Meanwhile, work on the Ihala Elahera Ela project, implemented under the Mahaweli water safety investment programme, is also being carried out successfully.
The investment in this project involved 450 million US dollars or Rs. 65,000 million. This will augment irrigation supplies to 30,000 acres or 12,000 hectares of cultivated lands.
In addition, it is hoped to provide 25 million cubic metres of water to supply drinking water to 25,000 families.
This project will also supply water to other tanks in the Anuradhapura district including Nachchaduwa, Tissa Wewa, Nuwara Wewa and Mahakanadarawa. Apart from this, work on the Kalu Ganga project is proceeding successfully while Laggala Pallegama town is being developed as a fully-equipped town.
