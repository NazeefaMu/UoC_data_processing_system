Prison inmate in death row sits for Master’s degree

Former Sub Inspector of Police B.A.L. Indika Bamunusinghe, a prisoner under death sentence, sat for his Master's Degree first examination yesterday, at the Welikada Prison under the inspection of representatives from the University of Kelaniya and Prisons Commissioner T.N. Upuldeniya said.
Bamunusinghe received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Jayewardenapura last January and enrolled in a Master’s Degree in Social Science at the University of Kelaniya.
"The Prisons Department will facilitate every prisoner who wants to improve his level of education while being flexible within the legal limitations," Upuldeniya said.
Speaking of Bamunusinghe’s achievement, Upuldeniya said it was exemplary for not only prisoners but also for everyone. “This prisoner, achieved a degree while in the prison. This was a first. He was not allowed to participate in lectures. But we allowed him the access of lecture notes. There were several inmates who already had degrees when they came into prison. They helped Bamunusinghe very much. We should applaud him for having hope and thriving for goals despite the death sentence.” Upuldeniya pointed out.
Commissioner Upuldeniya pointed out that the rehabilitation programme for prisoners was manifolds. It targets on prisoners’ education, spirituality, professional skills and religious attributes.
“When it comes to education, we are dedicated to provide basic literacy to inmates. 80 percent of the inmates have not completed secondary education. To have inmates with a high level of education, complements our effort.” Upuldeniya said.
Bamunusinghe was sentenced to death for the murder of Bambalapitiya businessman Mohamed Shiyam. He was found guilty of the murder along with four more persons, including former DIG Vass Gunawardena, who was charged with aiding, abetting and giving authority to commit the crime.
