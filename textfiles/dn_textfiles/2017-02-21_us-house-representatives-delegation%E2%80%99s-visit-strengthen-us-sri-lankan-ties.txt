US House of Representatives  delegation’s visit to strengthen  US-Sri Lankan ties

Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike yesterday said negative views expressed by some quarters about the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) was unfounded.
The former President addressing an event in Colombo said views expressed by some elements that the OMP will betray the armed forces and force them to face charges in the International Criminal Court was misleading.
She said an effort to establish the OMP which intends to help the relatives of those who have gone missing was in its final stages. The former President said she hoped this would help solve long standing issues related to missing persons.
