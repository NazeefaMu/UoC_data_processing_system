Two modern radars for weather forecast

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that two modern radars more sophisticated than the much spoken Doppler Radar for weather forecast will be established soon. He was addressing media at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
When asked why the Disaster Management Ministry failed to established the Doppler radar imported from United States in 2007 at a cost of Rs 200 million for weather forecast until today, the Minister said that the infrastructure requirements had not been fulfilled once the country received the Doppler radar from World Meteorological Organisation.
The Minister said that a committee was appointed by him to look into the incident under the chairmanship of an individual by the name of Wijithamulla.
The committee report has been submitted to the Presidential Secretariat. Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organisation undertook repairing the radar at their own cost and therefore it has been sent to United States again. The country will receive the radar in a few months after the repair.
