Amorous ex-Major deported from US

A retired Major who was sent to Hawaii by the Disaster Management Ministry for a special training had been deported to Sri Lanka on Saturday night by the US authorities for allegedly sexually harassing a girl.
Disaster Management Ministry Secretary S S Miyanawala told the Daily News yesterday that the work of the above officer has been temporarily suspended and an institutional level disciplinary inquiry would be held over the incident.
He said the US Ambassador in Sri Lanka had written to him last week informing about this incident which had taken place on February 9.
Disaster Management Centre Director General L S Senadheera said two DMC officers and three military officers had been sent for this training programme on Disaster Management, adding that other officers were still continuing training.“The retired Major had been arrested by the US Police and produced before the court.
Then he had been ordered to be deported.
The US Ambassador had said that if legal action is to be filed against the officer, then the Ministry would be informed in due course,” he said.
The Ministry has been sending officers to this foreign training programme that extends to about one and half months every year.
