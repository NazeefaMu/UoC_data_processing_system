Permanent solution to waste disposal needed: Archbishop tells President

Archibishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith yesterday, stressed the importance of having introduced eco-friendly alternative solutions rather than re-locating garbage dumping sites in Ekala.
Speaking at a press conference at the Archibishop’s House yesterday, Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith said that the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) declared that the lands identified in Ekala for this project were not viable.
“The Colombo Municipal Council in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Army had engaged in carrying out a feasibility study even after the CEA confirmed that it is not viable,” he added.
The Archbishop of Colombo said, “Ja-Ela is a densely populated area. Dumping garbage collections over 800 MT in this area per day, could lead to very serious matters. It would adversely affect the residents, creating many health hazards, while creating a favourable environment for mosquito breeding . The vulnerability to negative impacts from natural disasters such as floods too would increase, while the fish population in the Negombo lagoon would also be threatened.”
He requested President Maithripala Sirisena to look into the matter and present a permanent solution to this continuous issue of waste disposal. “The Government presents alternative solutions such as dumping garbage at the cement manufacturing plant sites in Puttalam or permitting to the requests made by foreign companies to engage in the recycling process of the waste,” Cardinal Ranjith added.
He pointed out that the objective of acting against the re-location of waste disposal lands was not to create a controversy with the Government, but solely to become a voice for the residents in Ja-Ela and to act for their benefit.
The Cardinal also said, “Megapolis projects need to be implemented in order to develop a country. But priority has to be given to the establishment and continuous maintenance of the infrastructure facilities, such as proper waste disposal which are the base for the development of the country. Also, State Minister of City Planning and Water Supply Sudarshani Fernandopulle and Gampaha District Parliamentarian Kavinda Jayawardena signed the petition against this project of locating garbage dumps in Ekala.”
Secretary to the Ekala Preservation Movement Chaminda Preethiviraj, Ven. Balagalle Dhammaseeha Thero and Ven. Kimbulapitiya Wimalananda Thero also participated.
