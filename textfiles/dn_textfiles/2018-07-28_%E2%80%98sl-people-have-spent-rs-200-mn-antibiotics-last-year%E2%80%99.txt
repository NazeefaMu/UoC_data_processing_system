‘SL people have spent Rs. 200 MN  on antibiotics last year’

Antibiotics to the value of Rs. 200 million were sold in Sri Lanka last year, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after launching the Primary Healthcare Strengthening Project at BMICH in Colombo recently. Minister Senaratne said 46 agreements were signed to produce drugs in Sri Lanka. Patients can now buy high quality drugs at low prices since the prices of 48 drugs were reduced. More drugs could be purchased at low rate soon and expensive drugs for cancer are among them, he said.
The five-year project launched assisted by the World Bank facilitates every 20,000 people with a health centre, the Minister said.
“All citizens will be screened for Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and other health issues. They will be categorised by the level of risk they have to get NCDs. They will be provided a personal health record.
They could obtain treatment from any hospital in the country by presenting the record,” the Minister said.
