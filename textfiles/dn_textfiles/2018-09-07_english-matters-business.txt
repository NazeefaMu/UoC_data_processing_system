English matters in business

In this modern technological world communication plays a massive role in successful business. English is widely used for business communication. The English language used for business communication is different from the General or Regular English which is used for our day to day communication. As we all know, the business men mostly use the professional English that is distinctly different from the ordinary language.
In that case a business man should possess the capacity to take General English and upgrade it to business English and on certain occasions the business man should handle the language more creatively in order to make a powerful impression among their clients.
We can manifest that particular difference by looking at different verbs, adjectives and nouns and so on. Let us have a look at these eight verbs and weigh the differences in the normal and professional situations and also how it is used in different collocation or combination of words. (see table 1)
It is very easy to note the differences between the General English and Business English from the above chart. The first sentence in General English “I need to find out what’s wrong” it is in the Business English “I need to identify the problem” so the key verb used in the professional English is ‘identify’ likewise we can compare and contrast the differences of other rest of the sentences, moreover in certain occasions 

the business man supposed to use higher or quality words so as to keep the standard communication or maintain high profile business culture. So the following sentences will give us clear picture about the standard and higher uses of words in the pure business or professional atmosphere. (see table 2)
The above examples of sentences of general and Business English have distinctly explained how English is used in an ordinary situation and business environment. It is always beneficial if we can use the language categorically to suit the different situations.
