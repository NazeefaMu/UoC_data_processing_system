Pioneers’ Expo youth festival on June 3 and 4

Pioneers’ Expo, Sri Lanka’s first-ever youth festival, organised by the United Nations Clubs of Visakha Vidyalaya and D. S. Senanayake College, will be held at Ape Gama, Colombo on June 3 and 4.
The theme of the Expo will be the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The event, held for the first time in the island, will provide a platform for youths to convey their ideas, expectations and solutions through different forms of expression.
It will also demonstrate how they wish the sustainable future to be created and shaped by working towards achieving the 17 SDGs.
It’s vital for youths to be integrated in to the planning and implementation of the SDGs as it’s the youths who will be leading the remodelled sustainable world in the future.
