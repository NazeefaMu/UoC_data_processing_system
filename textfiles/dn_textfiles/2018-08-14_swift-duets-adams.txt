Swift duets with Adams

Taylor Swift surprised fans at a gig in Toronto, Canada on August 4 by performing a duet with Bryan Adams.
During the second night of her Reputation World Tour shows held at the Rogers Centre, fans went wild after the 58-year-old joined Taylor onstage to sing his classic hit, Summer of 69.
“Sang with the gorgeous @taylorswift tonight in #toronto... what a treat. Thanks Taylor!” the Canadian crooner posted on Twitter shortly after the sell-out concert.
The 28-year-old singer uploaded videos and photos of her and Bryan in rehearsals too.
“I didn’t even know Bryan was gonna be in town until last night and I asked him completely last minute if he wanted to come sing!!” she wrote alongside a series of clips and snaps on Instagram. “Pretty evident from the videos (um yes I’m posting another one) that I’m FULLY LOSING IT with excitement, and I can’t thank Bryan Adams enough.”
She later shared exclusive footage of the pair rehearsing, and wrote: “Behind the scenes of our secret rehearsal today before @bryanadams surprised Toronto with ‘Summer of 69’!!!! SO MUCH FUN TONIGHT TORONTO!!”
Her duet with Bryan comes just one day after she treated fans at the Rogers Centre on Friday to an appearance from Shawn Mendes, who hails from Toronto. The 19-year-old spent time backstage with Taylor and opening act Camila Cabello, before ending up in the make-up chair where the ‘Shake It Off’ hitmaker covered his face in white glittery eyeshadow.
“This is pretty much the exact same show look (we do),” she told him in a video posted to her Instagram Story. “Shawn’s back and he’s glittery.” Music News
