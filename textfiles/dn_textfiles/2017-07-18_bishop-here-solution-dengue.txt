Bishop here with  solution to dengue

Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop, slated to visit Sri Lanka this week, will announce Australian assistance to combat dengue fever in Sri Lanka.
“President Sirisena and I will announce Australian assistance to combat dengue fever in Sri Lanka and discuss progress on the implementation of Sri Lanka’s reconciliation process, which is critical to its long-term security and prosperity,” Bishop said in a statement published in the Australian Foreign Ministry website.
Bishop said she will meet President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake and other ministers to discuss security cooperation and explore new economic opportunities in science, resources and energy.
Bishop is also slated to visit India. “I will visit India and Sri Lanka from 18-20 July to strengthen our bilateral, economic and security relations with two important partners in our region,” her statement added.
