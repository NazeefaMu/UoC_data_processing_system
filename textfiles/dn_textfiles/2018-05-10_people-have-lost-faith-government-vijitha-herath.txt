People have lost faith in Government : Vijitha Herath

When the present Government came into power, one of its first promises to the people was to put a stop to corruption and fraud. The government made this pledge on every political platform and assured that corruption and fraud would be prevented in every institution in the country. However, three years down the line, this government has still not been able to win the trust and confidence of the people and practically honour their promise by punishing the fraudsters, stop corruption and fraud and implement the law, said JVP MP Vijitha Herath.
Joining the debate on the Judicature Amendment Bill in Parliament yesterday, he said, “Now the country is at a stage where they are finding it difficult to carry on. Due to the government’s inefficiency, the people have lost faith in the them. Under such a situation where the people’s trust in the government has diminished, the government has brought in this Judicature Amendment Bill.”
He noted that at the time the government won the people’s mandate in 2015, Civil Society Organisations and the public made a strong appeal to the government to set up special courts to try cases of corruption and fraud. He said at the time, there was a question whether a special court or a separate court should be established. “However, there was a legal issue in amending the Constitution in order to set up special courts. As such, discussions were initiated with regard to setting up of separate courts to expedite these special cases. After a long lapse of three years, finally it has been done.”
He said the country had been plagued by corruption and fraud, wasting public funds and as such, people were at a stage where they had enough of these crimes and demanded the government that the rogues be brought to book and punished. He said that although the government came into power on the promise that it would stop corruption and bring the previous culprits before law, it did not take long before members of this regime too resorted to large scale frauds running into billions of rupees.
Hence, he said although the government had brought in these laws now, the trust placed on the government by the people, have already been lost and the people have no faith in the government. “It is now too late as the government did not take the necessary action at the right time. The government had allowed this issues to fester without taking action initially and now it seems that these laws are brought in for political revenge,” he said, adding that the issue of corruption cannot be addressed simply by bringing in these laws without the government’s committed mediation.
