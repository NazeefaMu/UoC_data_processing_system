New Sony digital imaging showroom opens in Sri Lanka

Sony International (Singapore) Ltd opened a new digital imaging showroom in collaboration with renowned Sri Lanka distributor CameraLK Pvt. Ltd.
The company, just three years old, hopes to open one of their franchise stores in the Maldives by the end of the year, said Anushka Gunasinghe, Managing Director of CameraLK Pvt. Ltd.
“We will also open our third store in Colombo soon.”
He said that one of the keys to their success is their dedicated staff and the unmatched service they offer both at the point of sale and thereafter. “While giving a comprehensive guarantee, we also offer a free photography training course for all our customers by famous Sri Lankan photographers.
The new store with large space called Sony Camera Flagship Store and located at High Level Road, Colombo 05, will house the full range of Alpha digital cameras and accessories including Sony camera bags, flash units and battery grips and other camera accessories in a one-stop, convenient location for photography enthusiasts.
Besides photographic equipment, the new store will also retail Sony headphones, Bluetooth speakers and the Playstation 4 gaming console, games and supporting accessories.
“The opening of our new store represents a wonderful opportunity for CameraLK and Sony to collaborate on an exciting venture which can only benefit our customers in Sri Lanka.”
He added: “Given our expertise in distributing and retailing digital imaging products plus Sony’s long, rich history of technological innovation, I’m confident that photography enthusiasts in Sri Lanka will find all they require here to satisfy their photography needs.”
Masaki Matsumae, President of Regional Market Development Center - Sony South East Asia (a division company of Sony Electronics (Singapore) Pte Ltd) said, “I’m really excited about this collaboration with CameraLK as it aptly personifies the Sony spirit of 'Kando', which essentially means 'an emotional involvement or the power to simulate an emotional response'. We do this by creating wonderful products that make you go 'wow' and through having a unified experience.”
Customers will also have the opportunity to test the quality of the cameras and lenses through a special shooting area filled with colorful props. And for those seeking to expand their photography skills, a Sony digital workshop will be set up to conduct classes from basic to advanced photography techniques.
The new Sony Camera Flagship Store will be open daily from 9.00 am to 7.00 pm on weekdays and from 9.00 am to 3.00 pm on weekends.
