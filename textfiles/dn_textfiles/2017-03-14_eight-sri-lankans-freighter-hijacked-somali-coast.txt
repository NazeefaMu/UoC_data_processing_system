Eight Sri Lankans on freighter hijacked off Somali coast

Eight Sri Lankans are on board a ship that is believed to have been hijacked by Somali pirates. 
Navy Spokesman Lieutenant Commander Chaminda Walakulage confirmed that eight Sri Lankans were onboard, but said the Sri Lanka Navy was still in the process of clarifying details.
“We have lost all communication with the ship,” he said. “So there is no way of knowing what exactly has happened. We are still in process of verifying details.
He said he didn't know if the ship had been hijacked by pirates, of if some other incident had occured. 
He said Sri Lanka had only been notified that the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in France had registered a distress call from the ship, which said it was being chased by two speedboats.
“This ship belongs to Comoros, “ he further clarified. “It is not a Sri Lankan vessel. Eight of the crew members are Sri Lankans.”
He added that Sri Lanka had informed the appropriate channels on the incident:
“This had occurred in the Gulf of Aden. This area is frequently patrolled by maritime security patrols and anti-piracy operations patrols conducted by the Combined Maritime Patrol Force – the Combined Task Force, which comes under the Combined Maritime Patrol Force – CTF 151 – is responsible for counter piracy actions – we have informed these organisations and they are on high alert.
“In addition we have notified the UN Drugs and Traffic Control - we have asked each of these agencies to enable us to rescue the eight Sri Lankans onboard this vessel,” he said.
‘The Ministry continues to remain touch with shipping agents, concerned authorities as well as relevant Sri Lankan Missions overseas to ascertain further information on the matter in order to ensure the safety and welfare of the Sri Lankan crew.’ 
It said it would share information on the incident, as when received, in a manner not prejudicial to the safety of the crew.
