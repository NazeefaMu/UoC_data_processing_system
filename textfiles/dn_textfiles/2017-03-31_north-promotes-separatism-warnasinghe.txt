North promotes separatism: Warnasinghe

Separatism is promoted by the Northern Province and its Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran due to the powers given to it by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa despite objections by the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), said the JHU National Organizer and Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe. He said the previous government gave land and police powers to the Provincial Council although the JHU objected. He added that the former President believed he could handle the matter on his personal contacts but failed.
He made this observation yesterday at a press conference held at the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) office in Battaramulla.
"MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara was a good friend of Former President Rajapaksa. So he thought he could handle Wigneswaran as he was his brother-in-law. But, when Wigneswaran went to the North he became a racist and promoted racism and separatism," Warnasinghe said.
"Now they are using separatism and racist economic policies. They say that they don't need toddy produced in the South. They also say that the fishermen from the South cannot fish in the Northern sea, but they have no problem with the Southern Indian fishermen fishing in the North, he said. He questioned as to what would happen if the Southern Provincial Councils passed a motion banning onions and potatoes from the North."
JHU Central Committee Member Ven. Budugala Jinawansa Thera and Legal Adviser Tudor Perera also participated.
