Lady  Luminary

A sage was born over two millennia ago and walked over the lotus to inspire a whole world. On the same day, a lady lotus was born too and trod the path behind him.
He was Siddhartha. She was Yasodhara. Everybody in this land knows their tale.
Historical figures never cease to animate and invigorate the entertainment industry. In Sri Lanka, films with Buddhist themes are still a trend, on the verge of being trite. Professor Sunil Ariyaratne maintains his academic credentials elsewhere. Yet he has earned a household signature in the local movie enterprise with more than twenty works under his belt. He dwells in themes of varied interests. He reaches the familiar trend with a historical figure least spoken about: Yasodhara. The movie muhurat was held a few months ago.
Scenes from Yasodhara
The initial challenge before Professor Ariyaratne and his producer, H D Premasiri, was casting the lead characters of the movie: Siddhartha and Yasodhara.
“Our aim to find two suitable artistes from India to play the roles of Siddhartha and Yasodhara finally succeeded. Siddhartha’s role is played by A Chaudhary who was born in Uttar Pradesh. Pallavi Subhash, born in Maharashtra, plays the role of Yasodhara,” said H D Premasiri.
Added he: “We all believed that it is better to avoid well known local actors and actresses. The audience’s preconceived notions about the actors will damage the image of these noble personalities. Our criterion was that whoever acts these prominent figures should maintain their decorum.”
The Indian pair was subject to a strict audition.
Pallavi Subash who hails from Maharashtra province made her debut as a model.
Later on, she switched to teledramas where she played several leading roles. Pallavi has performed in more than 12 Marathi films but came into limelight with her role of Dharma in Chakrawarthi Asoka tele-series. Rukmini, the character she played in mythological series Mahabharat was also highly acclaimed by the TV audience. Her contribution to the commercial advertising field as a model has also been highlighted. She holds a degree in B Com.
“We were like a family for the 45 days. I would never forget that period in my life. It’s like being with my family. I have performed in various historical movies, but this is my first time playing the title role. It is one beautiful opportunity,” Pallavi remarked.
She went on to explain how hard it is to approach a producer or a director in the Indian cinema. The Sri Lankan experience was quite the opposite. They could work in close relationship with both director and producer.
A Chaudri entered the scene as a happy accident following a series of fruitless auditions. Both Professor Ariyaratne and Premasiri were not satisfied with the actors they had auditioned in India. But then they ran into Chaudri who was finally tasked with the job.
Chaudhary has won many public accolades for his acting and modelling in Indian cinema. His enthusiasm for academic studies in performing arts helped broaden his horizons following several courses conducted by Western acting schools. Two years experience with Lancaster Grand Theatre as an actor and specialising in acting techniques at the Actors’ Temple in London added a feather to his cap. He played a leading role in British Asian feature film called The Anglistanis. His roles played in several movies and short films are proof of his talents.
Chaudhary and Pallavi
“Initially I had no idea who Sunil Ariyaratne is. I noticed that everyone respects him. Later I came to know that is because of his knowledge and humanity,” he commented.
Chaudhary made special reference to his co-actor, Devdath starred by Dineth de Silva for his courageous support.
“My passion is to perform characters of different styles. I would accept a character only if I feel I can do justice to it. I am relatively new to the Indian cinema. But you will get to see one of my Hindi films soon. I must specially mention about the support given by the production team. The cooperation from the production team is essential to make film a success,” Chaudhary added.
Due to Pallavi and Chaudhary’s hectic calendar, the film shooting had to be completed within 45 days.
Completing the shoot within such a short period was a challenge, though accomplished as everyone can see now. Professor Ariyaratne made special reference to his art director Bimal Dushmantha who had to work on the sets in areas such as Ranmihithenna to create a vintage effect on the movie.
Scripting about Yasodhara was a challenge, owing to the dearth of information. As far back as in 1975, William Edmund Barrett authored Lady of the Lotus, partly a hagiographical account of the much-revered lady of Buddhism.
The book is interesting because Barrett was a Roman Catholic born in New York in 1900. With the Lady of the Lotus, Barrett took the reader back into many centuries even before the Christ was born. There Barrette narrates the story in almost lyrical prose on a lady who discovers that the man she loves is destined for a path which will lead him away from her, toward a great destiny. The lady will find the courage to find the path of her own. Barrett infuses love as well as the spiritual quest with a rich description of an ancient world. In the Sinhalese literature, Venerable Ganegama Saranankara Thera has authored an informative account on Yasodhara.
Yet Professor Sunil Ariyaratne does not refer to any of these sources. He banks on Pujavaliya, a Sinhalese classic, which portrays some aspects of Yasodhara’s life to work on the screenplay.
“Although many films have been made about Buddhist themes and figures, this will be the first ever film on Yasodhara,” Professor Ariyaratne said.
Yasodhara is a cinematic creation based on Bimbadevi, popularly known as Yasodhara. Many films have already been produced in the countries of both east and west on the life of the Buddha or Prince Siddhartha. Films based on the life of Princess Yasodhara are yet to be produced. They are almost non-existent.
This is where Professor Ariyaratne’s cinematic attempt can fit in.
This is where the Lady Luminary enters the motion picture to inspire many more.
