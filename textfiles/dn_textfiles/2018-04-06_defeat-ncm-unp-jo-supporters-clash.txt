Defeat of NCM: UNP, JO supporters clash

Three persons were injured and hospitalised following clashes between groups of UNP supporters and Joint Opposition (JO) supporters on April 4 night at two locations in Puttalam, after the defeat of the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister in Parliament.
The first clash occurred at Kiriyankalliya junction between UNP supporters who were celebrating the Prime Minister’s victory against the NCM by lighting crackers, and a group of Joint Opposition supporters. Mariyan Subhakaran who unsuccessfully contested the Arachchikattuwa Pradeshiya Sabha on the JO ticket alleged he was first set upon by UNP supporters. Thereafter a group of outsiders descended on their village and started attacking the villagers.
The enraged villagers then retaliated leading to a major clash. UNP member Ramanayake's son was injured and admitted to the Udappuwa Hospital. Subhakaran said he was not present during the clash.
