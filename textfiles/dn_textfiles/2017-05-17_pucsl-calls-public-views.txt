Pucsl calls for public views

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator, recently opened the path for public to comment on the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2018-2037, prepared by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
The LCLTGEP was compiled based on the results of the latest electricity expansion planning studies conducted by the CEB for the planning period of 2018-2037 and it aims to cater the forecasted demand growth by identifying the least cost plant addition sequence based on the most sustainable technology to avoid electricity shortfalls in the country.
The plan has been submitted to the PUCSL for the approval.
‘The Plan is one of the most important as it plans the electricity generation for the country for the next 20 years to ensure energy security as the least cost plant mix for each year is identified by analysing and evaluating various technology options. It serves as a guideline to facilitate the decision-makers in making decisions in line with national policy objectives, by exploring and evaluating various generation technology options in different situations,’ Public Utilities Commission Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said.
“By opening the path to the public, we hope to involve all the related and interested parties in the decision-making process through opinions, views, alternative proposals and suggestions on the LCLTGEP 2018-2037, and we hope to increase the transparency of the approval process and increase public participation in the decision-making process of Sri Lanka’s most important energy generation plan.”
The Sri Lankan power system had a total installed capacity of approximately 4018 MW by the end of the year 2016 with a total dispatchable capacity of 3538 MW, including non-dispatchable plants of capacity 516 MW owned by private sector developers.
The majority of dispatchable capacity is owned by CEB (about 82 percnt of the total dispatchable capacity), which includes 1379.25MW of hydro and 1510.7 MW of thermal generation capacity.
Balance dispatchable capacity, which is totally thermal plants, is owned by Independent Power Producers (IPPs). Sri Lanka recorded 2453MW of maximum demand in 2016 and generated a total of 14250GWh of electricity in the same year. The generation demand is expected to grow 5.9 percent per annum from 2018 -2022 while in addition the peak demand is expected to grow at 5.1 percent per annum, the data shows.
The same expected to grow 4.9 percent per annum from 2018-2037 which the peak demand is expected cross at 4.5 percent. The total investment required for implementing the 2018-2037 plan in the next 20 years is approximately USD 14.568 Billion (LKR 2,168.93 billion) without considering the projects for which funds have already been committed.
