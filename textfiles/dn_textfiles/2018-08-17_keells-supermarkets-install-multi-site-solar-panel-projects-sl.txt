Keells supermarkets install multi-site  solar panel projects in SL

John Keells’ group’s vision for a sustainable future, Keells Supermarkets launched their first two solar powered stores in Boralasgamuwa and Raththanapitiya in 2017 and later expanded to 11 stores.
Showcasing their commitment to integrate sustainability into their business operations, the company will be expanding this initiative to 43 solar powered stores by end of September 2018, setting themselves ahead as the second largest multi-site roof top solar installer in Sri Lanka.
The 11 stores that are currently installed with solar power have a solar capacity of 1.451 MW. By the end of September 2018, Keells will be running on solar power at 43 of the stores with a 5.519 MW with an expected generation of approximately 653,000 electricity units (kWh) monthly. The expected generation has the capacity to power an average of 9200 households per month and will contribute to approximately 35% of the electricity use within each store.
“As a part of Sri Lanka’s largest conglomerate, our mission towards reducing our carbon footprint and setting an example as a socially and environmentally conscious company is in line with the business’s long term vision of improving the quality of life for the nation. We are already working towards our vision and aspire towards an energy reduction target of 12% by 2020. The operation has been one of the largest multi-site solar installation projects initiated by the Group as a part of their mission for clean energy,” said Charitha Subasinghe, President, Retail John Keells Group. The future looks positive for the ongoing initiative as Keells Supermarkets hope to expand their plans for solar PV installations throughout their other stores.
For Charitha Subasinghe and the Keells team, the success of the 11 solar powered stores stands as proof for their commitment towards a sustainable future for thebrand and the community. “This is just the beginning of the journey, we are on to ensure we as a business consciously look into our impact,” Charitha Subasinghe added, reflecting the team effort that has propelled the project thus far.
