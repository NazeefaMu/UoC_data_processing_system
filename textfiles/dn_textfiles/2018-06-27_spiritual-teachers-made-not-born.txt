Spiritual teachers made, not born

Venerable Bhikkhuni Bodhicitta is a Sri Lankan Buddhist nun based in Melbourne. She was an Anagarika in 2006 for almost a year under the Ajahn Chah’s Forest tradition before she ordained as a Samaneri in 2007.
In 2010, the Venerable Bhikkhuni received her Upasampada in Sri Lanka under the tutelage of Venerable Dr M Punnaji Maha Thera, Venerable Professor Bhikkhuni Kusuma and several Senior Sangha members.
Her path of secular higher studies in medicine saw her graduate in bio medicine. Her career as a medical scientist in Australia met a surprising turn of events when the Dhamma set her view of life in a different paradigm. Thus began her homelessness – a clear and meaningful path of full-time commitment to spiritual endeavour.
The Venerable Bhikkhuni’s main focus is to practise the Buddha’s teachings. She aspires to be a practising Bodhicitta and firmly believes that it is only through the Buddha’s teachings that one will be able to overcome the emotional afflictions the world is experiencing today.
Venerable Bhikkhuni Bodhicitta is the founder and the Spiritual Director of the Nisala Arana Meditation Centre in Melbourne, a first by a Sri Lankan Theravada Bhikkhuni. She has also founded the Nisala Arana Nuns Monastery and retreat Centre in Sri Lanka. She is engaged in interfaith activities in Melbourne. She firmly believes that “by working harmoniously with each other only then can we bring peace.” Up to 2009 she was the only Theravada Bhikkhuni who was appointed as a Buddhist Chaplin at an Australian University, University RMIT, Melbourne. Encouraged by her, other nuns have since stepped up to take leadership roles at Centres of Learning.
Bhikkhuni Bodhicitta is a renowned meditation teacher with over 25 years of experience.
Senior Journalist Iroshini Deepika has compiled a concise biography of Venerable Bhikkhuni Bodhicitta titled as Sasara Kathara Tharanaya Kara. A publication of Sahitha Poth Piyasa, the book is available at leading bookshops.
