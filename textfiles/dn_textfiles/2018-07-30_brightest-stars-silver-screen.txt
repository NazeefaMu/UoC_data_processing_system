Brightest stars of silver screen

Names call to mind people, bring in associations and waft in memories. The Sarasaviya Film Awards is a familiar setting for many of the seasoned stars of the past and a dream and a vision for raising young artistes in the cinema industry. Spearheaded by Sarasaviya, The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited’s cinema weekly, the only surviving cinema tabloid in the country, the Sarasaviya Film Awards not only spell glamour and grandeur but also boasts of quality for its selections.
This year Cargills has stepped forward as the main sponsor of the 34th edition of the event. Titled as the ‘Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards’, the event will unfold at the BMICH on August 3 at 6 pm, setting the stage for a starry night.
Throughout the years many figures have born the responsibility of putting the star-filled event together. The responsibility of seeing the success of the awards ceremony till the end mostly rests on the Sarasaviya Editor’s shoulders. The glittery night that many a film fan has witnessed has been the result of tireless hours of hard work and dedication. We spoke to some of the former editors of Sarasaviya magazine on making memories in the movie scene.

Aruna Gunaratne (2010 – present)
This is the second Sarasaviya film Awards that I will be staging as the Chief Editor of the magazine. I joined the Sarasaviya editorial in 1989.
The biggest challenge that we face this year is in staging a film awards under an individual’s name. This year Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards has been dedicated to the globally renowned filmmaker and doyen of Sinhala cinema the late Dr Lester James Peries. Dileepa Abeysekara is in charge of the script of the film festival.
Since we will be presenting awards for 2018 and 2017 separately, a large number of awards will be handed over at this year’s event. We will also be presenting the Most Popular film, the Dr Lester James Peries Award for the best mainstream film, the Ranapala Bodhinagoda Award for film criticism, and two Rana Thisara Lifetime Achievement Awards.
The Sarasaviya Film Awards returned to the stage after a seven year hiatus in 2016. Due to the long break between the festivals we had to change certain aspects linked with the event to suit the present setup.
The past Sarasaviya Awards Festivals has recognized the contribution of foreign artistes who have worked to enrich our film industry. The Best Actress Award was won by the leading lady of Prasanna Vithanage’s ‘Oba Nathuwa Oba Ekka’ Anjali Patil in 2016. Mike Wilson won the Best Director award for ‘Getawarayo’ in 1966 and Dylan Okada won the award for the best cinematography for ‘Janelaya’ in 1985. India’s Shaker Prasad and Tapas Nayak have won the award for best sound design.
Film is one of the prominent media in the world which does not have any social, ethnic or regional boundaries. Even though these artistes are not Sri Lankan born, they have contributed in enriching our film industry. They have gone to win international awards later in life. In such instances they will also be recognized as recipients of the Sarasaviya awards. The Sarasaviya award will be embedded in their cinema history.
We want more young filmmakers and artistes to make their presence at the Sarasaviya Film Festival. The Sarasaviya Film Awards is already on par with international film festivals. My wish is to see it going global and making its presence in foreign soil as an international festival some day.

Gamini Samarasinghe (2006 – 2010)
I was the Chief Editor for two Sarasaviya Film Festivals. One of my main goals was to give life to the Sarasaviya Film Awards because the awards ceremony has not been functioning for many years. We also wanted to present a function par excellence.
The Sarasaviya Film Awards is considered as the peak event in the country’s art calendar. Artistes are so eager to take part in it. One of the significant events which occurred during my time was that we were able to take some of the film included in the Sarasaviya Film Week out of Colombo to areas such as Kurunegala, Matara and Kandy. The Acting Chairman during that era, Sarath Kongahage, and Deepthi Fonseka, Minoli Subasinghe and Hemali Wijeratne who were in my editorial staff helped me tremendously in organizing the 31st Sarasaviya Film Awards in 2007.
Another noteworthy fact about the Sarasaviya Film awards is that we do not have any contact with the jury after they have been named. Unlike other awards functions which host dinners for the jury, we only meet the jury again on the stage of the awards function. Therefore the decisions are made purely by them without any influence from outside.
I have many happy as well as a couple of sad memories linked with the festival. Susil Gunaratne took part in the show in Kurunegala just before his death. Nilmini Tennakoon too met with her tragic accident while she was taking part in the Sarasaviya Film Week.
I managed to lead the arrangements for the 32nd Sarasaviya Film Festival in 2010 based on my previous experience. Ashirvadini Hettiarachchi and Champa Warushapperuma supported me a lot in this task. Many prominent artistes like Malani Fonseka, Swarna Mallawarachchi, and Prof Sunil Ariyaratne called and congratulated me on holding a successful awards ceremony in such a short span. Many journalists’ dream is becoming an editor in a cinema magazine. I was privileged to turn that dream into a reality. It is a great responsibility. Artistes are particular about certain matters – even the seating arrangements. So we have to organize it in a manner to please everyone.
I took part in the 33rd Sarasaviya Awards Festival. One of the highlights of that event was when they invited the past editors of Sarasaviya to present the awards. I believe that is one of the good qualities in the present Sarasaviya editor Aruna Gunaratne.
There are two memorable moments for me linked with the Sarasaviya Film Awards. One is when Uresha Ravihari won the award for Best Female Playback Vocalist back to back for three consecutive years. Only Nanda Malini had achieved this feat before her. I can still remember the joy I witnessed in Uresha’s face when that announcement was made. Sangeetha Weeraratne won the Best Actress and the Most Popular Actress awards for ‘Uppalawanna’ in 2007. She had won both these awards before for acting in ‘Aswesuma’. Only Malini Fonseka has won both awards together twice before.
I remember meeting Padmasiri Kodikara at one of the film shows we held for Sarasaviya Week in Kandy. There was a good looking youth with him. Later when Kodikara was searching for a face to take on H R Jothipala’s character for ‘Sada Adara Jothi’ I remembered that youth and proposed him for the role. He is Kodikara’s son, Vishwanath, who has become a star today.

Deepthi Fonseka (2003 – 2005)
I have seen two Sarasaviya Film Awards being staged during my stint. I joined Lake House at the end of the 1980s as a journalist in the Sarasaviya editorial. Later I was promoted to the deputy editor post and then I became its editor.
We staged one of the most glamorous Sarasaviya Film Awards in 2003. Indian director Mani Ratnam was the guest artiste. Adoor Gopalakrishnan was the guest artiste for the event held in 2004.
I was in charge of the first Sarasaviya Film Awards which was held outstation in 2005/2006. We held a cinema discourse for school children. It was a challenge to stage the same kind of awards ceremony we have held in Colombo in Kandy. However there was a lot of hype about it and people flocked to see the artistes coming to take part in the event. Some were even brought to the venue on elephant back!
I am grateful to Sunil Horesh, Ranjith Kumara and Thilakaratne Kuruwita Bandara for all their help. I am also thankful to my husband, Upali Fonseka, who was the official photographer for Sarasaviya. He has taken pictures of the most number of Sarasaviya Film Festivals.
One of the sad memories I have linked with the festival is the untimely death of our freelancer Sunil Horesh. He was equipped with immense knowledge about the industry. Another is the death of Susil Gunaratne.
I coordinated the artistes for the 33rd Sarasaviya Film Festival. I also coordinated them for the programme on the Sarasaviya award winners that we shot. I was also the coordinator for the jury for the Sarasaviya Film Festival held in 2016 and this year as well.
I was the first female editor of a cinema tabloid in Sri Lanka. Around 20 years of my career was spent in Sarasaviya and one important thing I noted was the unity in our team. The staff organized the Sarasaviya Film Awards A to Z.

Anura Bandara Rajaguru (2000 – 2003)
I was a sub editor at Sarasaviya before I became its editor. We relauched the festival after about six year by introducing some new awards: the Ranapala Bodhinagoda Award for film criticism and an award for the best comic act. We also hosted a film festival without the participation of a single politician during my time. All the invitees were artistes. Stars performed live on the stage first time for an awards function at the event too. Sangeetha Weeraratne and Bandu Samarasinghe took part in one of the acts. This concept has become popular today as they hold shows like ‘Ridee Reyak’.
The situation of the industry was totally different then. Today at a time when the Sri Lankan cinema industry is at the brink of crisis it is encouraging to see that an awards festival of this caliber is going to be held again.

Thilakaratne Kuruwita Bandara (1994 – 2000)
I headed four Sarasaviya Film Festivals when I was the editor of Sarasaviya magazine. There was a high respect for the jury even then because the credibility of the festival rested on their shoulders. The Chairman of the first jury was Wimalasiri Perera, the founder of Sripali. M J Perera, Piyasena Nissanka, Charles Abeysekara, and Nandadeva Wijesekara comprised the rest of the judges. I wanted to introduce new faces to the jury so we brought in Punyasoma Hettiarachchi, Nandasena Ratnapala, Prof Nandadasa Kodagoda, Upeksha Chitrasena, Kusum Dissanayake etc. I also felt that some of the newer artistes have been chosen to be given the Rana Thisara Award over the veterans. So I managed to felicitate artistes like Herbie Seneviratne, G S B Rani Perera , Ruby de Mel and Titus Thotawatte during my time.
The Sarasaviya film festival is the oldest ongoing film festival in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan cinema is facing a crucial stage today and the industry needs the full backing of a tabloid like Sarasaviya.

A D Ranjith Kumara (1989 – 1994)
I joined Sarasaviya in 1969 as a senior sub editor. However I was one of those who were privileged to witness the first Sarasaviya Film awards at Asoka cinema in 1964 from the gallery. We were schooling then and we went to the film week not only to watch films but see the stars as well. All the shows were housefull. The stars would come to the venue on the red carpet. We used to reach out just to touch them because we were so enchanted by their sight.
The celebrities arrived for the awards night on an open stage constructed in the back of a truck. This was called Tharaka Yanaya (Star Vehicle). I can still remember Jeevarani, Udula Dabare, Florida Jayalath, Clarice de Silva in their glamorous attire waving at the fans. A film magazine bumper issue was handed out for free during the occasion.
I used to dream of having a job in a cinema magazine. So as soon as I have done my G C E Advanced Level examination, I went to meet Ranjith Wijewardena. I was put in the Dinamina editorial first but I made a request to be a part of Sarasaviya.
Sandya Kumari won the most popular actress award during my time and we carried her love story in one of our issues. Joe Abeywickrama used to reply to the questions posed by his fans. We had drawings on the cover of the magazine too. I wrote many middle page articles. Whenever an artiste had something new to tell the public they would tell it to Sarasaviya first.
Sarasaviya and another Lake House magazine called Janatha was in charge of organising the festival then. We carried coupons asking the fans to select which films should be screened during the film week. Gamperaliya, Sikuru Tharuwa, Ran Muthu Doova, Suhada Sohoyure and Suvineethala Vani were selected to be screened. We also played the Sarasaviya song which was penned by Chandraratne Manawasinghe and sung by Pandit Amaradewa. A special Sarasaviya Film Magazine consisting of photos from the awards was also issued after the event. Bollywood stars like Sunil Dutt, Meena Kumari, Nutan and the editor of Filmfare magazine have graced the event. Joe Abeywickrama, Irangani Serasinghe, and Sarasaviya editor Wimalasiri Perera too took part in the Filmfare Awards later.
I have taken part in 19 Sarasaviya Film Festivals in my life and had been the organizer of some of them. I feel blessed to have been a part of it.
