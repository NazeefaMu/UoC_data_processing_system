Subfertility, IUI, and In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)

Gone are the days when nature, clinical disability or gender based social misconceptions ruled a couple’s inability to rear offspring. The advancement in global medical technology and evolving processes in the field of fertility have proven that a conception is possible even for a mother who has had numerous failed attempts at getting pregnant. Here Dr. Madara Ralapanawe – Clinical Embryologist/ Head of Fertility Centre of Lanka Hospitals and Dr. Nishendra Karunaratne – Consultant Obstetrician & Gynaecologist talks in detail about IVF.
Q: “What is IVF and when and why would a couple opt for IVF?”
Dr. Madara: “In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is a laboratory controlled clinical process that helps a couple have a child of their own when the natural process of conception fails. The failure in the natural process can be due to subfertility in the couple.”
Q: “What is sub-fertility?”
Dr. Nishendra: “Sub- fertility in a female is the failure to conceive after 6 months to 1 year of unprotected sexual intercourse. This can be due various reasons including conditions such as irregular cycles due to anovulation, endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, etc. Sub- fertility in males is largely to do with sperm quality, motility, morphology of the sperm and the sperm count at ejaculation.”
Q: “What causes subfertility?”
Dr. Nishendra: “About one third of subfertility can be attributed to male factor, and about one third to female factor. The remaining one third can be due to a combination of issues concerning both partners and in about 20 percent of such cases the condition is unexplained.”
Q: “Please explain the process of natural conception.”
Dr. Nishendra: “Fertility period of a young female is between 12th and 16th days of regular menstrual cycle. Intercourse ejaculates millions of sperm into the vagina. In natural conception most of the good live sperm will swim up the cervix into the womb, from the womb, sperms swim through the fallopian tube.
A sperm fertilizes the egg in the fallopian tube if ovulation takes place during this time and an egg is released from the ovary. A couple has the option of seeking fertility treatment if the female partner do not conceive within a year through this natural process.
Q: “Is IVF the only solution for subfertility between couples?”
Dr. Madara: “Intra uterine insemination (IUI) is one of the first line treatment choices in case of mild male factor infertility or women with cervical factor and unexplained subfertility.
It’s a interventional process that involves the placing of sperm inside a woman's uterus to facilitate fertilization. Though the sperm could be deposited, even with the development of follicles or release of the egg the female partner might not yet conceive through IUI. Thus failed fertilization or failed development could yet happen as one cannot see what takes place within the fallopian tubes. But by then - especially for the female - who has gone through numerous hormone interventions by then, her hormone levels might be too high for even IVF to commence affecting quality of the eggs. More patients are seen idling themselves engaging in other procedures such as IUI; sometimes 15 – 20 IUI’s, by going to as many IUI centres as possible for years.
Q: “What is the process of IVF?”
Dr. Madara: “In vitro fertilization (IVF) is an assisted reproductive technique (ART) in which the egg and the sperm are united in the laboratory (In vitro). There are 2 methods in IVF called Standard and ICSI (Intra Cyto-Plastic Sperm Injection).
Following the extraction of matured eggs from the mother’s ovaries, In standard IVF, 2 to 3 eggs are inseminated with 80,000 to 100,000 sperms & will be kept in an incubator which mimics similar ambience of a fallopian tube - at 370 C – similar to body temperature, with 6% carbon dioxide & 5% Oxygen.
Even the culture media used is similar to content in the fallopian tube. Here, the sperm has to penetrate itself in the natural way.
In ICSI, or (Intra Cyto-Plastic Sperm Injection) where sperms are directly injected to mature eggs the sperm’s entering of the egg can be confirmed in a lab setting. Similar to the natural process the sperm will go in & the egg will be fertilized becoming two pronuclear or a zygote & subsequently, further ‘division’ of cells takes place. The success rate of fertilization is higher in ICSI as the sperms are being directly injected to the egg & fertilization is as same as that occurs in the natural process.”
