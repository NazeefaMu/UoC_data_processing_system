Pakistan, Sri Lanka agree to points system for England tour

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has agreed to a proposal forwarded by the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to apply a points system for their tour of England scheduled in July.
 
"We have received an agreement in principle from the boards of both Sri Lanka and Pakistan and will release further details of the proposal in due course," an ECB spokesman told ESPNCricinfo.
 
England will copy the format of the women’s Ashes with points awarded for winning a Test, one-dayer and Twenty20 when they play Sri Lanka and Pakistan. These will be added up and an overall winner decided. It will be the first time it has happened in men’s international cricket.
 
Pakistan will be playing four Tests, five ODIs and one T20I against the Englishmen from July to September in a two-month tour. According to the points system, four points will be awarded for winning a Test match while two points will be up for grabs for each victory in ODIs and T20Is.
 
With a total of 28 points to be played for and Tests preceding the rest of the series, a 4-0 win for any team might seal the over-all series for one side with 16 points in their tally. (CricketNext)
