We still work to a man’s timetable and a man’s agenda

When Hilary Mantel was in law school in England, she started suffering terrible internal pains. No one took a young woman’s agony particularly seriously, especially if it was situated uterus-adjacent. She went to visit a psychiatrist, who diagnosed the source of her anguish: It was stress, he said, caused by overambition. He wondered if law school was too taxing. Mightn’t a dress shop be a better outlet for her talents?
What none of the doctors knew, but Mantel suspected because she was consulting surgical textbooks, was that she was suffering from a severe and undiagnosed case of endometriosis. The drugs prescribed for her psychological and physical misery led her to a mental-health clinic. There, she began to write a short story about a changeling— that is, about a woman in rural Wales whose baby is snatched and switched for another. When she outlined the story to her psychiatrist—the one who prophesied a dress-shop career—he said “I don’t want you writing.”
Spiky memoir
I don’t want you writing! And you, Picasso, put down that stupid paintbrush. There are tomatoes to be packed. When I came across that anecdote in Mantel’s wonderful, spiky memoir Giving Up the Ghost, I almost shrieked. What if she had given up writing? A tragedy for the world of literature. A tragedy for me, personally: She is my favorite living author.
I’m firmly of the opinion that a journalist should never meet her heroes. They will invariably disappoint, not because of their own failings, but because they have been constructed out of some bright-sky material in the journalist’s brain and will necessarily be duller in real life. But, in a few cases, they do not disappoint, but leave an indelible, electric impression instead. Such was the case when I took the train one day to meet the woman whose latest novels had made her, against all expectations, a smash success.
Hilary Mantel’s little town on the Devon coast was ridiculously pretty, as pretty as a village from a BBC detective series in which the killer is the vicar or the lady who puts up the best pickles. It was prettier than it had a right to be. It actually had a café called the Cosy Teapot.
And here lived a woman with a singular gift for inhabiting dark and sinister worlds, past and present, and finding the humanity and humor in them. Most of her novels were contemporary, though it was the most recent pair, set in Tudor England, that had made her a star. They were all novels born of her body’s pain, written in spite of that pain, or perhaps because of it—how better to transcend the body than imagining a world that is different, distant, peopled with intriguing strangers?
There was no darkness in the cheery flat overlooking the sea, or the woman who answered its door. Mantel had the round, bright blue eyes of a china doll, even though her smile suggested a doll possessed by a mischievous demon.
The phone was ringing when I entered and hardly stopped (it was answered by her husband Gerald McEwan, a man she had divorced once and married twice).
The phone rang because, after a life of critical acclaim but popular obscurity, she had achieved a whacking great success with her novels about the life of Thomas Cromwell, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies (a final novel in the trilogy, The Mirror and the Light, is in the works).
“Everything that has happened since the publication of Wolf Hall has astonished me,” she said, leading me slowly over to an overstuffed sofa. “I should be shockproof, but I’m not. It’s not a world I thought I’d be in.” That world, for a woman sometimes confined by illness to an area close to her writing desk, was a huge and liberating one: two Booker Prizes for the first two novels of the trilogy, smash success stage and television adaptations, millions of copies sold. Even stranger, this popularity hadn’t arrived on the wings of vampires or wizards or S&M–loving billionaires, but through highly literary, dense novels narrated in an archaic tense called the “historic present.” The books are not for all readers, and some complain that they’re too complex, too allusive.
Compelling consigliere
Yet, there they remain, the unicorn of the publishing world: thorny masterpieces that sell like iPhones. “You can’t go wrong with Henry VIII,” Mantel said with her sly smile. We both knew that the real star of the books was Thomas Cromwell, the king’s reserved and compelling consigliere, who began a pauper and ended with his head at the mercy of an incompetent executioner. The entire narrative arrived in one swoop, she said, when she heard a voice in her head say the words “So now get up.” They are the first lines in the first novel; they will likely reappear at Cromwell’s ignominious end.
