Magical  melodies

Melantha in Concert with the little Moratuwites of the Riversheen School of Music presented a melodious evening at the Jeelan Central College Auditorium, Keselwatta, Moratuwa, recently with a box office audience. That was a passionate tribute to Trila Perera, veteran singer, pianist, teacher and an entertainer in the 1950s and 1960s.
Finance State Minister Eran Wickremaratne was the Chief Guest flanked by Cinepro Chairman Jayalath Peiris, Richard de Soysa of Elite Security Lanka, Rukshan Perera and Needra Weerasinghe. Noeline Honter flavoured the show with her voice and poise.
With the offering of prayers by Rev Fr Lakpriya de Silva, the show commenced providing an opportunity for the little voices to swing the air with music and songs. Among the guest artists were Dushyanth, Devshan Dalreen, Noeline, Ronnie and Mariazelle. There were performances by the children of the Kushinara and Panadura Girls’ schools.
The funds gathered will proceed towards an erection of a new hospital complex in Lunawa with all modern technology. Secondly, an RSM Notation System in music was launched to simplify music for the little ones. Melantha paved the way for an autistic child to sing on stage.
