Walk among miracles

“I have basically chartered my life’ says Sarath Kotagama, Emeritus Professor of Environmental Science, University of Colombo. “A lot of people consider me very unorthodox and a Maverick, because to me I had to break through” says Kotagama. Outstanding Personalities features this nature extraordinaire who feels that he is yet to achieve the Nobel Prize.
Q: Professor Kotagama, why do you love nature and care about life in all its wondrous forms?
A. It has a lot to do with where I was brought up, my childhood. It was a village background. We didn’t have the luxury of the city at all. I was basically born in Bandarawela. My upbringing was in Bibile even more remote than Bandarawela. During my formative years from a young age I was brought up with nature. I believe that that was a deciding factor. I lost the luxury of being in that habitat for 365 days. I was educated in a boarding school. So I had to go to school for three months and then come home again for one month and go back again for three months. So after five years much of my life was in a boarding. In the boarding you are with a lot of other children and in an artificial set up. So when we went back home that was real luxury for us. My father owned a lot of property so I had the opportunity to run around and do what I liked. There were a lot of streams and jungles all around.
There was no tuition and there was nothing called homework like what is happening today. So when we went home it was a real holiday. We had our village friends. The next house is 300m – 400m away. The village structure meant we were higher in the status. So we had limited friends. So I went to the boarding away from the village and my village friends went to village schools. So when I come back for the holiday we become one and we enjoy that. They were basically the wild kids and we were the refined kids. That distinction was there but that enabled us to become friendlier with them because we were free to go anywhere in the premises of our own property. There were no television or radios. All that was left to us was to venture into the wild.
That was the basis of my association with nature. I will not say I did not enjoy the city with the newness the city presented, but to compare it with what was in the wild, I preferred the wilderness to the structured surroundings of the city that was there at the time. Reflecting on today’s situation, a lot of children are not able to experience that wilderness. I was fortunate to experience the real wilderness. My schools were also sort of in a wilderness area.
Bandarawela also was in the wilderness. Today it is totally different. But that was what it was like at that time. All that was the background in which I grew up. But in my education, we were encouraged to appreciate nature and be more outwards. I will always remember the butterflies that flew over the grounds. At S.Thomas’ Gurutalawa, one weekend you have to leave the school premises on a hike. We were given bread and a can of salmon fish. Four of us were put together and we were told to hike. No guidance of a teacher or master. So it was full of outdoor adventure.
So like that we had many standard hikes at school. And when you go to a certain location you need to report to a person. So we did our own cooking and then we jumped into someone’s property and picked some vegetables.
We had real fun! So my teachers enabled us to be more nature oriented. At Gurutalawa we had to do farm. We had a roster. So at 4am in the morning, you have to get up and go to the farm and clean the chicken pens and collect the eggs, wash them and pack them off to the market. You do all of this before breakfast. You have to clean the cattle-sheds and wash them. So you enjoyed nature.
Q: When you see the destruction of nature all around you – the cutting of forests and the destruction of eco systems do you feel a sense of anguish at the senseless violence against nature? Would you like to comment on how you feel?
A. Yes I do feel a certain anguish. I have been trained in some process. I have had the opportunity of being a scientist. When you look at a problem you have to look at it in a balanced way. If someone is cutting trees you cannot jump the gun and tell him not to cut. It does not work. If someone is doing something wrong there is a reason behind that. Humans were born to do something different in nature.
When we look at the history of mankind, when we evolved and where we are today, 98 percent of our livelihood has been with nature. It is only the last 2 percent where we have been engaged in destruction. If 98 percent of our lives were with nature, how have we changed? But it is that 2 percent that have made us different from the 98 percent. The conveniences that were in the livelihood of one as a hunter gatherer, till 12,000 – 15,000 years ago, and from there onwards to this 2 percent now is far different. The conveniences for you to get water on a tap, have electricity when you want, get seated in vehicle and drive, those conveniences did not exist then.
So you have enabled oneself to achieve conveniences through the process of unfortunately changing the natural format. Today we need these conveniences, but not at the expense of nature. This destruction is mostly happening by people who don’t appreciate these times. The task is that I have personally seen the naturalness and I personally see the destruction.
Many people who have been born and bred in this modern era in the last 20 -30 years, they did not see the difference. During their formative days, they did not have a passion for what is natural. If you were born and bred in a four walled house, in the conveniences that we are loving to have, seeing the difference is a difficult task. Very unfortunately 99 percent of the destruction that is happening today is purely to achieve something that is of convenience today.
In the so called developed world there is no nature. So we are now doing what they did 10- 30 years ago. Can you find a natural forest in Europe? Just imagine if we transform ourselves into that time, when they started destroying the naturalness? They came through that phase and now they are in a situation where they tell everybody else – don’t do this! We do blame them for what has been done. But we have to blame ourselves for what we are doing ourselves!
Q: What do you consider the milestones you have achieved in your career? Are these milestones everything to do with protecting nature?
A. I did what I wanted to do in life. I chartered myself towards where I wanted to go and today I am right at the top in terms of what I can do. I had the resolve to achieve what I wanted to achieve.
I have done a lot of research and contributions to science, I have taught and theorized things for the world in different ways and aspects, so if there is anything I have to achieve it would be the Nobel Prize but that is for someone to give not for me to ask! I have done the maximum- academic work and social work. There can be more! I am exemplary and I take pride in my accomplishments. I am very content that I did it my way.
Q:What is the message you want to give to society?
A. I started becoming an environmental person in 1968, there onwards we were fighting the very thing we said we didn’t like what was happening – cutting down of forests, pollution, all that we didn’t like. But now we have a basis for why those things happened. We know the outcome of all of what has happened. The causes, background and reasons for pollution. We have all the evidence with us now. If we are to not look at that anymore and go forward, we are doing something very wrong to mankind. Because mankind is supposed to be intelligent.
The one who has the capacity to see the past and put it in perspective of the present and decide the future. So what do we have in the past? We have come a pathway which is causing all these issues. We do have the benefits and the conveniences but there is very clear evidence that we are in a mess environmentally.
So if that is the present what do you project to the future? You don’t want to project what is bad for the future? You want to project what would be better for the future. So you should change. To be more environment friendly. But how do you do that? Being human, the advantage of experiencing the past is there. Other animals don’t have that. And even if they have that, it is very short. It is not what they live for.
The smaller animals do not have it at all. They don’t have a past memory that can make them do better for the future. We are the only animal who has this capacity. And if we cannot make use of it for the future, then there is something wrong. My message is don’t forget the past, because that is very important environmentally. People are all equal but cultures, society and attitudes are not equal. Because these are all constructs that have come about over the years. The important factor is how to live with these. So, be yourself, but you have to be with everybody. You can’t be alone. Humans are a social animal, so you have to be social.
