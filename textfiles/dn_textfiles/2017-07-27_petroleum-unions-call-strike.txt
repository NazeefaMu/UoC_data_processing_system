Petroleum unions call off strike

Unions attached to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) have suspended their strike until Tuesday (August 1), after meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena this evening.
The petroleum trade unions embarked on trade union action at midnight July 24, against the proposed deal with India, to manage 99 oil tanks in Trincomalee.
