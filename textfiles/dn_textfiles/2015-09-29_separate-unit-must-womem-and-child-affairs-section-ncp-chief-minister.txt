Separate unit a must for Womem and Child Affairs section - NCP Chief Minister

North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne Bandara, said that it was a very essential requirement that a separate independent police unit be set up, instead of the present Women and Child Affairs section performing in police stations on the basis of President Maithripala Sirisena’s concept of the formation of a child society winning the world.
The Chief Minister said so explaining the formation of child protection committees in the North Central Province at village level. He said that he had convened a conference on the subject at which teachers, principals, police officers, state officials, civil society representatives and the clergy would participate for the exchange of ideas, proposals and views on the subject of child protection on September 28, at the Chief Ministry Auditorium.
“Today, in a police stations in the Women and Child Affairs Unit, it had been a requirement that a male police officer be detailed for receiving complaints, though normally the Officer in Charge (OIC) was also a male police officer. It is my view that there should be a separate mini police station under the control of a female Assistant Superintendent of Police in every police jurisdiction. There should also be female officers in charge of these proposed police stations as it has been ascertained that women and female children who are being victimized mainly in rape and abuse cases hesitate to provide details of the crimes committed to a male police officer, the Chief Minister.
He said that he would take steps to allocate more funds from the PC budget 2016 for the promotion of childcare and protection and urged that such child protection committee members should dedicate their lives to serve the purpose.
