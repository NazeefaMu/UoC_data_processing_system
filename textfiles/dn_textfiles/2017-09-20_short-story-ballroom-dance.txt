Short story: The Ballroom Dance

It was customary to celebrate the annual get-together with song and dance at the youth club with the participation of members of other district clubs. So, all members looked forward to this event with much enthusiasm. The focus was on the first year students. Their participation was vital since this event was specially organised as a camaraderie and no excuses will be entertained, said the Head of the Club.
The second-year members were not so keen since they had participated in the previous annual dance and they considered it just another event. But, it was not so for Jessie a first-year member, she had never ever danced the ballroom before. ‘Everyone should participate in the final event, prizes are galore ’ said the organizers. This would be her first dance and she pondered as to how she could compete.
Two weeks before the event, she told her mother about it. ‘Oh! mother, I am very nervous and I do not know the ballroom steps and that too dance with someone from the opposite sex, how could I do it’ she lamented. Mother hid her amusement, she knew her child was a very quiet and shy girl, naturally, she was upset. She had attended a girls school and the youth club of the area was the first place she mingled with boys. ‘Never mind child don’t take this seriously, this is only a get-together, so stop worrying, try to learn a few steps from your friend Nina, didn’t she win the last time, sure she would help you’ said she. Her friend was ever ready to help her and they practiced every evening and somehow she learned the steps fast, getting out of her jittery.
Mother altered one of her old evening gowns, a colourful yellow which she had worn for a concert in school. Everything was ready for tomorrow. With a hair-do in a different style and a flower in her hair, with slight make-up for a young girl, Jessie looked more beautiful. Moreover, the yellow colour suited her complexion. The compliments she received when she entered the hall was enough. Her mother had transformed her and her efforts were fruitful. Father only said ‘enjoy yourself, be careful, just give me a buzz, when it is over to pick you up’ he said.
The illuminations in the hall held an idyllic glow with the lights flashing at different angles with decorations of striking colours, which made the place enchanting for a perfect evening. At the far end, the orchestra was playing sweet music. Most of her friends were already on the dance floor. She looked around for Nina and there she was dancing away dressed in an olive green gown with a tiara in her hair looking very attractive. She tried to distract her attention just to say of her arrival but she paid no attention. Anyway, just as Jessie made way to join her other friends at the table, she noticed a debonair young man she had never met in the youth club before, walk towards her. ‘I marked my time looking out for a beautiful partner now I have found her, shall we dance’, he said with a smile taking her hand. She moved to the dance floor as if in a trance. Without faltering in her steps as practiced with Nina, she kept her composure and was floating away like a butterfly. The orchestra was playing non-stop beautiful music and they kept on dancing for a long time. No wonder she was able to dance with ease the man was an experienced dancer. “Hey, are you dreaming, do you know that you could dance very well, ‘I am not joking, he said. She hid her amusement and what a thrill she got, then her practices were not in vain.
When they passed Nina, she winked at her, that Jessie missed her step and accidentally stepped on her partner. ‘I think we should take a break for a while, tired isn’t it’ said he, leading her to the table. Enjoying the moment and introducing themselves to the rest of the members, they chatted for a while. The night was swiftly coming to an end, when there was an announcement for the masked dance and the best couple at the dance would be chosen. The judges were in their seats and the dancers hurriedly put on their masks and different long coats. By this, none could be recognized.
The orchestra played once again and thirty couples were on the floor. Jessie and her partner have so engrossed in their dance that at the end of the beat it was only they who remained on the floor. They were adjudged the best couple of the dance. The cheers and jeers from the gathering when they were garlanded and sashed lasted for some time and it was time for presentations. They received many gifts and bouquets. ‘Is this a dream, I just cannot believe, she thought to herself. ‘This cannot be, I am not that good, it is due to you that we won’t she told him. ‘You are mistaken, didn’t I tell you that you dance very well, glad I partnered you’ he replied. Wasn’t my first dance great she asked Nina when she was congratulated.
Now, it was time for all to leave and with a simple adieu and a smile her dance partner from nowhere left, handing her the bouquets and all the gifts he received. Oh! I wish this night had never ended thought she, what’s this dance anyway, he has stolen my heart. Jessie left with a deep sigh.
