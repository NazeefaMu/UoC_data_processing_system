JICA to provide Rs. 42,307 MN for Kalu Ganga Water Supply Expansion Project

A concessionary loan agreement for JPY 31,810 million (Rs. 42,307 million) was signed on July 7 between the Government of Sri Lanka and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for Kalu Ganga Water Supply Expansion Project.
The agreement was signed by Finance and Mass Media Ministry Secretary Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga and JICA Chief Representative of Sri Lanka Office Fusato Tanaka. The project is implemented by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board under the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry.
The project will improve access to safe water and water supply efficiency in the southern area of Western Province by expanding Kalu Ganga water supply facilities and restructuring water distribution networks.The Western Province is the center of Sri Lanka’s political and economic activities, as around 42 percent of GDP and 28.5 percent of the population is concentrated in this area.
The province has been leading economic development with industrial complexes, export processing zones, and the largest international airport in the country.
Although the infrastructure is relatively advanced and the water supply coverage is 62.7 percent, higher than the national average of 45.9 percent, communities without water supply systems remain in the province outside of the Colombo district.
It is predicted that urbanisation will further progress and that the water demand will grow, making an expansion to the water supply services necessary in the province. Deterioration of the water distribution pipes has resulted in high non-revenue water rates of 30 to 40 percent caused by leaks, illegal connections, and uninstalled metres. To address the rising demand for water, it is essential that the non-revenue water rates are reduced for a more efficient water supply.
The project will construct water supply systems, expand the water treatment plants by another 140,000m3/day capacity, and install intake facilities, transmission and storage facilities among others.
It will launch a pilot project for reducing non-revenue water and contribute to strengthening the water supply capacity in the southern areas in Western Province for a safe, stable water supply.
