PRESIDENT WANTS PEACE IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
President Maithripala Sirisena has made a request to the trade union leaders not to leave room for any untoward incidents in public institutions and maintain peace in them.
We thank the president for stressing the importance of peace.
To develop the country, we must improve our industries, improve our agriculture, improve our exports and various other things. To do all this we must have peace in the country.
During the past thirty years, we have not done enough to develop our country. The main reason for this is that we did not have peace in the country.
Peace and order is very important for the development of our economy. Peace and order affects our economic stability. Peace helps in maintaining social order and political stability.
Because all of life is interconnected, our fear, hatred and anger decrease the peace in the world, whereas our love, joy and gratitude increase the peace. Peace is important to all human beings.
Peace is not absence of conflict. It is the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means.
Forgive others because not because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace.
If you want peace, you do not talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies.
Peace cannot be achieved through violence, it can only be achieved through understanding.
Peace as we all know is very important in our lives and it is essential to our overall well-being. However this is something that has regrettably, eluded us for years in this world.
It has been hindered by war, conflicts and disagreements throughout human history, which has left our world and the many people in it in a deplorable, emotional and physical state. This should not be the case.
