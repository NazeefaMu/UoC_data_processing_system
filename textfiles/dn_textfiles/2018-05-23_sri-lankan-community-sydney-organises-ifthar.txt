Sri Lankan community in Sydney organises IFTHAR

The Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Sydney together with the Austra-Lanka Muslim Association (ALMA) organised an IFTHAR event on Saturday, May 19 at Petersham Town Hall in Sydney, with the participation of Sri Lankan community Associations in New South Wales (NSW).
Addressing the gathering, Sri Lanka’s Consul General in Sydney Lal Wickrematunge expounded on the reconciliation process undertaken by the Government of Sri Lanka to build a peaceful multi-ethnic, multi-religious society for future generations.
He remarked that Sri Lankan Community events such as IFTHAR help to create common understanding among different faiths in the country.
This was the second time that the Consulate General collaborated with the ALMA in organising a multi-religious IFTHAR event in Sydney. Representatives from other Sri Lankan Associations such as Sri Lanka Association of NSW, the Tamil Seniors’ Association, Sri Lankan -Australian Malay Association, Ceylon Society of Australia and the Sri Lankan Catholic Association of NSW, participated in the event. The Guest Speaker Dr. Zachariah Matthews, an Islamic Scholar in Australia delivered the Key-Note address. ALMA President Rafi Mubarak also spoke.
The event concluded with breaking the Ramadan fast and religious prayers. Around 400 Sri Lankans living in Australia participated in this event.
