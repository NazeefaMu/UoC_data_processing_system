IGP says prisoner torture will not be tolerated

IGP Pujith Jayasundera has thoroughly advised all high ranking Police officers that no prisoner should be subject to harassment or torture in Police custody, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
He said the IGP in a series of workshops attended by all high ranking police officers, including OICs of all Police stations, recently instructed to follow “zero tolerance approach” on torture and harassment to detainees.
He made this observation in response to a question by a journalist on the recent remarks by UN Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson over torture and harassment on former and current PTA detainees.
“If any officer was found to have done something wrong by exceeding the powers given to him, then the IGP will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against such an officer,” Gunasekara said.Asked why not the IGP responds to the charges made against Sri Lanka Police, the media spokesman said the Government would deal with the matter diplomatically, adding that the Police too have communicated its position with regard to the matters raised.
