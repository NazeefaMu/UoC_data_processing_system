Third report on 831 state institutions presented in Parliament

 
The third report on 831 state institutions compiled by the Public Accounts Committee was presented before the Parliament by State Accounts Committee Chairman and Mass Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna today.
Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said that reports on all state institutions, amounting to thirty-one reports were submitted.
He said that of the 831 public institutions, only 410 responded.
Expressing his disappointment the Deputy Minister said that the Public Accounts Committee did not carry out their responsibilities to a satisfactory standard.
However the Deputy Minister said that this task was somehow accomplished by accessing information through the Information Systems and Management Department of the Parliament.
