Practising yoga may cut health care costs

US: Practising relaxation-response techniques, such as meditation, yoga and prayer, could reduce the need for health care services by 43 per cent, according to a new study.
Previous studies have shown that eliciting the relaxation response - a physiologic state of deep rest - relieves stress and anxiety, and also affects physiologic factors such as blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen consumption.
The study, based at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)'s Institute for Technology Assessment and the Benson-Henry Institute (BHI), found that individuals in the relaxation-response programme used fewer health care services in the year after their participation than in the preceding year.
"Our study's primary finding is that programmes that train patients to elicit the relaxation response - specifically those taught at the BHI - can also dramatically reduce health care utilisation," said James E Stahl of the MGH Institute for Technology Assessment, who led the study. - DECCAN HERALD
