Sanitary Waste Disposal Center at Wilpattu: CEA rejected previous Govt’s proposal

The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) rejected the proposal made by the previous government to establish the Sanitary Waste Disposal Centre in the Wilpattu National Park premises, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said.
Megapolis and Western Development Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna was replying to a question raised in Parliament by MP Udaya Gammanpila on the current progress of the establishment of the waste disposal center.
Alagiyawanna pointed out the rejection is based on the reasons that the waste disposal center is proposed to be established in the Wilpattu conservation premises and the serious resistance displayed by area residents along with the NGOs on environmental protection.
Alagiyawanna further said, the Economic Management Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has already called for a meeting with all the responsible institutions regarding the matter.
“At the meeting,the Economic Managemment Committee took a decision to use an alternative land which is not in the Wipattu premises and is now proposed to be used for the establishment of the garbage disposal center,” Alagiyawanna said.
The Deputy Minister also said that primary surveying activities of the land has been is completed.
“We are yet to receive the Environmental Assessment Report for the proposed land from the Central Environmental Authority,” he added.
MP Gammanpila said during the time of their government, they only considered public resistance only if the resistance was based on accurate facts with a scientific basis.
“We did not give up on development projects just because people are ignorant or some people are envious of the progress made,” he said.
Replying to Gammanpila’s statement, Alagiyawanna said a government cannot just disregard public opinion and what is best for the country and should come to an amicable solution that is acceptable to all parties involved in a matter.
