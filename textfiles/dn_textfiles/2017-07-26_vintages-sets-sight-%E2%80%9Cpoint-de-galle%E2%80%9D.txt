Vintages sets sight for “point de Galle”

The Vintage Car Owners Club which is the pioneer motoring heritage club has made arrangements to hold its annual drive from Colombo to Galle in the “oldest of the old” motor cars on August 8 this year.
This is a mighty task as all cars on the drive have surpassed 75 years of age and it is not for the “faint- hearted” to take up the challenge to motor a good 72 miles in a brace of motorcars that was registered prior to the year 1940.
This is the challenge to prove the might of the Vintage motors and the Club is glad to note of the many members who are keen to bring out their vintage “delights” to participate at this unique event. The drive will be flagged off in Moratuwa and will head southwards along the Galle Road for a lunch break at Beruwela. The parade of the vintages will chug along to Hikkaduwa which would be the place of rest for both the motorcars and the participants prior to setting off on the last “lap” being the Galle Fort where heritage and vintages will come together creating an absolute ambience of nostalgia of the glory days of the past. This event is much awaited by the vintage motoring fans both local and foreign who swarm the Fort to witness the display much to their amazement to note of the long distance covered and to also note of the excellent condition of these cars that have been in existence for over 75 year.
President of the Club Neil Fernando takes great pleasure to host the participants on an overnight stay with many a fun filled events to keep the vintage toes tapping prior to setting off back to Colombo after a good night’s sleep and a hearty breakfast on the following day.
The main organizer of the event Saman Karunanayake is delighted to note of the great interest taken by his fellow members on the above event and it would be an ideal opportunity to witness the “oldest of Old” motoring Marvels to take on to the streets once again
