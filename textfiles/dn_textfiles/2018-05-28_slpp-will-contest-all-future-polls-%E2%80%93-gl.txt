SLPP will contest all future polls – G.L.

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna will contest all future elections under its lotus bud (pohottuwa) symbol, SLPP Chairman Prof G.L. Peiris said.
This will include the future Presidential, general and provincial council elections, he said, adding that anyone is welcome to contest future elections under the SLPP after a proper agreement. No one will be allowed to dilute or dissipate the SLPP under any condition. He said the door was open for anyone to join the SLPP under its current leadership after subscribing to its policies.
Prof. Peiris expressed these views when speaking to the media when he called on the Deputy Chief Sangha Nayake of the Matale District of the Asgiriya Chapter, Ven. Ambagaswewa Rahula, at the Rangiri Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya in Dambulla on yesterday.
