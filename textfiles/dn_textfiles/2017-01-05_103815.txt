Record income for CAA nabbing errant traders

Officials attached to the Southern Regional Office of the Consumer Affairs Authority have collected a record income of over Rs. 679,000 from errant traders as court fines in sudden raids and mobile inspections conducted in Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts during December last year.
According to investigation officials the total number of raids done in the Southern region during the same period was 264. Errant traders were prosecuted in Magistrates’ courts of Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts. Charges framed against them were sale and display of food items unsuitable for human consumption, sale and display of expired food items, selling food stuff which were decayed and eaten by rats and insects, altering set prices on labels and selling them at excessive rates, selling electrical appliances without issuing warranty cards, sale of rice and cement above set prices, non- display of price tags and violating rules and regulations imposed by the Consumer Affairs Authority. Complaints on frauds, malpractices and corruptions committed by unscrupulous traders are being received by the Authority daily.
The CAA has increased sudden raids and mobile inspections against fraudulent traders, investigation officials said.
Awareness programmes on consumer rights are also being conducted by the Authority for school children, members of voluntary organizations, people and also the trading community.
On the instructions of District Secretaries of Galle, Matara and Hambantota, CAA investigation officers are conducting raids and inspections throughout the Southern region.
