Coal case: SC grants leave to proceed with FR petition

The Supreme Court yesterday granted leave to proceed with a fundamental rights petition filed by a Singaporean company over alleged irregularities said to have taken place when supplying coal to Lanka Coal Company Ltd in 2015.
The petitioner Noble Resources International Pte Limited had cited 75 parties including the President, Cabinet ministers and Swiss Singapore Enterprises Pte Limited as respondents.
The petitioner stated that it has been supplying coal to Lanka Coal Company Ltd from around or about November 2010 to date.
The petitioner stated that the petitioner supplied approximately 2.5 million metric tones of coal to Lanka Coal Company Ltd.
The petitioner stated that there has never been any complaint of the quality of coal supplied and the late delivery of coal.
The petitioner stated that in fact there has been no complaint against the petitioner of any kind of nature.
The petitioner stated that the Technical Evaluation Committee evaluated the bids and arrived at a decision that the petitioner was the lowest responsive tenderer and recommended that grant of the contract to the petitioner.
The petitioner further stated that Swiss Singapore Enterprises Pte Limited whose tender was approximately US Dollars 91.55 million higher than that of the petitioner complained to the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC) about 2 of the criteria for evaluation specified in the bid document.
The SCAPC directed the TEC to remove the said 2 criteria for evaluation from the bid documents and to evaluate from the bid documents and evaluate the contract without such criteria.
The respondents maintained that as per the recommendation to issue the contract to Swiss Singapore Enterprises Pte Limited, the cost to the government would increase by Rs.1.62 billion.
The petitioner believes that the Cabinet was only informed that TEC, SCAPC had recommended that grant of the contract to the respondent company without disclosing that aforesaid criteria in the bid document had been taken out that TEC had evaluated and recommended the petitioner as the Lower Responsive bidder as per the bid documents.
The petitioner is seeking an order to set aside the decision of the Cabinet of ministers to award the concerned tender to Swiss Singapore Enterprises Pte Limited in September 22, 2015.
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Anil Goonaratne fixed the petition for hearing on December 15.
