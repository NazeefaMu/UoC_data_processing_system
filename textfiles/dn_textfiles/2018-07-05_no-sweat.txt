NO sweat


Summer is here with its scorching heat. This causes excessive sweating which leads to the nightmarish issue of body odour. While excessive sweating causes embarrassment, it also adds to the challenge of self-hygiene. So if you are someone who is struggling with this problem, here are some expert tips that might help you keep it at bay.
Deodorant and antiperspirant facts
* Deodorant controls odour but isn’t very effective at controlling sweat.
* Antiperspirant blocks sweat glands, reducing the amount of perspiration your body produces.
*Using a combination of deodorant and antiperspirant gives you the best solutions of both worlds.
* Neither deodorant nor antiperspirant cause cancer.
* Deodorant and antiperspirant together contribute more to sweat stains than sweat.
* Deodorant works by killing the bacteria on your skin. This way when you sweat, there isn’t enough bacteria sitting on your skin to create an odour. Your armpit area has thousands of hairs, these hairs hold on to bacteria and sweat, which is why when it comes to body odour, these are the most problematic areas of your body.
* Antiperspirants use aluminum salts to dissolve the moisture on the surface of your skin. As it dissolves, it forms a gel that temporarily sits on tops of your sweat glands to help prevent additional sweating. This reduces that amount of sweat your body produces.
 
The odour of sweat
Sweat itself is virtually odourless to humans. It is the rapid multiplication of bacteria in the presence of sweat and their breaking down of sweat into acids that eventually causes the unpleasant smell.
Causes of body odour
Body odour is caused by bacteria breaking down sweat and is largely linked to the apocrine glands. Most body odour comes from these. These glands are found in the breasts, genital area, eyelids, armpits, and ear. In the breasts, they secrete fat droplets into breast milk. In the ear, they help form earwax. Apocrine glands in the skin and the eyelids are sweat glands.
Most of the apocrine glands in the skin are located in the groin, armpits, and around the nipples. They are mainly responsible for body odour because the sweat they produce is high in protein, which bacteria can break down easily.
Reducing body odour
A large concentration of apocrine glands is present in the armpits, making that area susceptible to the rapid development of body odour.
The following steps may help control armpit odour:
1) Keep the armpits clean: Wash them regularly using anti-bacterial soap, and the number of bacteria will be kept low, resulting in less body odour.
2) Hair: When armpits have hair, it slows down the evaporation of sweat, giving the bacteria more time to break it down into smelly substances. Shaving the armpits regularly has been found to help body odour control in that area. Reusable razors are available to purchase online.
3) Deodorant or antiperspirant: Deodorants make the skin more acidic, making it more difficult for bacteria to thrive. An antiperspirant blocks the sweating action of the glands, resulting in less sweating.
Food that increases body odour
Avoid spicy food: Curry, garlic, and other spicy foods have the potential to make some people’s sweat more pungent. Some experts believe a diet high in red meat may also raise the risk of developing more rapid body odour.
Alcohol: (and its smell) is absorbed and metabolized into acetic acid and then released through your pores. You can thank that acetic acid for the stench. And the smell only increases with the more you gulp down, so exercise some will power and pair your brew(s) with a healthy, high-protein meal.
Cruciferous vegetables: Though high in potassium and packed with antioxidants, vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts, and cauliflower contain sulfur, which is a chemical that naturally has a bad stench, and will intensify your odor when released through sweating, breathing.
Inhibiting perspiration by using products
The thermoregulation of the body is not affected by the use of antiperspirants. The underarm areas add up to 200 cm2, which is only about 1 percent of the whole body surface. Therefore this area is much too small to interfere with thermoregulation. The safety of antiperspirants has been proven in many surveys and their use in cosmetic products is approved.
Armpit stains
Armpit stains on shirts are caused by the reaction between antiperspirant ingredients and the salts in your sweat. Most antiperspirants contain aluminum compounds to reduce wetness. It is the aluminum that causes the build-up and yellowing on fabrics. The stains don’t appear overnight, but if you do not wash the shirts properly, the stains will start to leave a yellow stain on white shirts.
Underarm deodorant stains are very evident on white shirts because the fabric turns yellow. While they may not be as apparent on dark coloured shirts, they are there. The underarm stains from deodorant and body soil trap bacteria, cause odour, stiffness, and discoloration of the fabric.
Removing armpit stains
To remove the build-up and freshen a washable shirt, fill a washing machine or large bucket with cool water and add one cup white distilled vinegar. Allow shirts to soak for at least 30 minutes. Drain vinegar water and wash as usual in cool water. If the build-up is really heavy, mix a one to one solution of white distilled vinegar and water and use an old toothbrush to scrub the area before soaking.
