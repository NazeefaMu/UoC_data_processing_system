Japanese Experts Group suggests long and short term measures for garbage

The Japanese Expert Group which presented their report on the Meethotamulla garbage dump to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, proposed both short-term and long-term measures to overcome the problem. Head of the Experts Group Mitsutake Numahata explained to the President, as a short term measure, the garbage dump should be stabilized to ensure no further collapses. Before the onset of the monsoon, the shape of the dump should be streamlined and the base should be covered with polythene, he noted, according to the President’s Media Unit. As a secondary measure, the Japanese experts suggested that the shape of the dump should be made symmetrical with a broad base to ensure proper the distribution of gravity.
The Experts Group had also proposed long-term measures to remove the dump by adopting 3-R system of reduce, reuse and recycle.
Head of the Experts Group Mitsutake Numahata handed over the report and made a power-point presentation to explain the recommendations of the group at the President’s Official Residence in Colombo.
President Sirisena thanked the Japanese Experts Group for undertaking a comprehensive study within days of the disaster and said the Japanese expertise would be useful to solve the major issue of garbage in Sri Lanka.
He pointed out that although the Meethotamulla disaster began as a human tragedy, now garbage has become a political issue. He stressed on the need for a lasting solution to the issue and sought continued support from Japan for this endeavour.
Ministers Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Patali Champika Ranawaka and Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma were also present.
