Ireland out to stun England again

London: Ireland begin their first-ever one-day international series against England in Bristol on Friday seeking to cause their hosts fresh embarrassment.
The two-match contest, which concludes with Ireland’s first ODI at Lord’s on Sunday, comes six years after their stunning World Cup win over England in Bangalore. Kevin O’Brien hit the fastest-ever World Cup hundred, off just 50 balls, as Ireland won by three wickets.
