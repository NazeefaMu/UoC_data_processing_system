SLFI begins Politics, Political Leadership Diploma course

The Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) commenced its National Diploma in Politics and Political Leadership program yesterday.
Civil activists, government officers, police officers and civilians interested in a career in politics have enrolled in the course, which chiefly aims to provide political literacy and an ethical approach to succeeding at elections.
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijedasa Rajapaksa said popular politics has had an adverse effect on Sri Lankan politics. He said communal politics have worsened the status.”When British left us, they imposed a system on us where parliamentarians elected on the basis of ethnicity. We are still suffering from this division. Sri Lanka must overcome communal politics and promote a nationalistic political approach,” he said. National Dialogue Minister Mano Ganesan said parliamentarians should at least be able to communicate verbally in both national languages. “We cannot develop this country with a gap in communication.” he said.
Minister Ganesan further said understanding different people and their mindset is important when taking political decisions.
Minister Ganesan further said devolution of power is crucial within an undivided country. “I am not talking just about North. Power should be distributed to all villages despite where they are located within the country. We do not have a monarch here” Ganesan added.
Sri Lanka Foundation Institute Chairman Sarath Kongahage said the program aims to provide sophisticated understanding of political science and the political system of Sri Lanka for producing an active political being with a better awareness and to produce political leaders with great leadership skills and political literacy.
Kongahage requested the government to release lands owned by the Sri Lanka Foundation to extend the premises.
