Habitat for Humanity, SLSA conducts ‘Scout Build’

Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka (HFHSL) in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Scouts Association (SLSA) conducted its inaugural ‘Scout Build’, in an initiative to foster volunteerism and empower Scouts to become young leaders in Sri Lanka.
More than 200 local Boy and Girl Scouts participated in the Scout Build, in the Village of Kalugala, Aranayake. The Scout Build was held as part of the Asia-Pacific Regional Campaign known as ‘Habitat Young Leaders Build’ that engages young people to volunteer, fundraise and lend their voices to the need for decent housing.
The Scout Build is an extension of the global partnership between Habitat for Humanity International and the World Scout Movement. A Memorandum of Understanding between HFHSL and SLSA was ceremoniously signed by Dr. Dinesh Kanagaratnam, National Director of HFHSL and Janaprith Fernando, Attorney-at-Law and Deputy Chief Commissioner of SLSA, in celebration of World Scout Day and founder, Lord Baden Powell’s 160th Birth Anniversary globally celebrated on February 22.
This volunteer build initiative in partnership with SLSA enabled volunteers to contribute their time and unskilled labour towards the construction of nearly 40 houses currently being constructed in Aranayake for victims of landslides - part of HFHSL’s Kegalle Housing Project. (A Disaster Response project aimed at building more than 80 houses for victims of landslides caused by Cyclone Roanu last May in Aranayake, Yatiyatota and Deraniyagala in the Kegalle District).
Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka’s National Director, Dr. Dinesh Kanagaratnam said, “The Scouts Build is one of the many initiatives we will roll out this year that will help develop and build leadership amongst the youth in Sri Lanka. Scouting Associations across Asia are seeking stronger links with Habitat for Humanity under the Messengers of Peace vision.”
Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka hopes to take this partnership with the World Scout Movement further by exploring the possibility of hosting an International Scout Build in 2018/2019 where international Scout volunteer teams will also be invited to volunteer in Sri Lanka.
