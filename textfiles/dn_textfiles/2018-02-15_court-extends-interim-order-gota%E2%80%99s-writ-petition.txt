A two-judge-bench comprising then Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Gunaratne extended this Interim Order preventing the police from acting under the Public Property Act against Rajapaksa on Galle Magistrate’s Court inquiry over a complaint that the D. A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs. 90 million.
Meanwhile, President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa informed the court that his client is ready to face charges or indictments under the Public Property Act if investigations found sufficient materials to do so. However, Silva said his client is objecting police attempt to remand him based on a report submitted by an Assistant Superintendent of Police under the Public Property Act.
Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appearing for the Attorney General told Court that he would seek Attorney General’s advice regarding these developments and the matter was fixed for February 27.
