As a principle, we adhere to strong clinical standards in a ultra-clean hospital and laboratory environment well-equipped with cutting edge technology.”
“Our medical staff remains committed to practicing excellence in pathology. Their diagnostic proficiency is well-balanced with dependability and attention to detail.”
The ISO1589 accreditation will promote consistency in complying with international and national medical laboratory laws and regulations as well as modern practices. Consequently, this will enhance Hemas Southern Hospital Laboratory’s ability to provide exceptional diagnostic investigations through adhering to modern laboratory practices.
