Strive for economic prosperity and national reconciliation – Chief Minister

What we have to do is to strive for prosperity as a unified Sri Lankan nation, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said
"Economic and social crisis we face today are not recently formed ones. They have been gradually advanced since the independence. Therefore, it is meaningless and fruitless to hold one group or party responsible for the economic and social evils of the day," he said.
He was addressing the Southern Provincial 69th Independence Day celebrations held opposite the Galle Central Bus Stand on Saturday.
"The 69th Independence Day is a paramount juncture to ponder honestly as a nation if we could genuinely be contented over our long journey of economic, social and national progress since we gained Independence. According to prominent economists our country’s economy is at a seriously risky state.
This is not a recently progressed situation. It is a gradually deteriorated economic, social and national predicament. Not a single group or party is responsible for this crisis. It is pointless to hold one section or group answerable," he said.
"By the end of 2015, our foreign debt burden had risen up to USD 44.8 billion. It will be doubled by 2019. By the time the new government came to power, we have to pay out 54.4 percent out of our total GDP to settle our foreign debts.
During the past two years, even the situation continued to be similarly aggravated, the Chief Minister said.
He said mere criticism over this situation does nothing to rectify present problems and a way should be found out to overcome the national problems.
The Chief Minister said it was also an achievement of national unity and concord.
"People of all ethnic and religious groups fought united against the imperialists. Among our national heroes there are leaders of all nations and religions. Although we strived as Sri Lankans to obtain Independence, we failed to uphold the same national unity in building our country.
We were divided over petty religious and ethnic issues. The situation aggravated day by day until it ended in a disastrous war. We could defeat the separatist war. Now we have to win the hearts of people which were wounded during the 30- year-long civil war.
The present government of President Maithripala Sirisena has launched a number of significant initiatives for national reconciliation. We all should struggle for a prosperous country where sustainable peace and harmony among all nations flourishes forever," the Chief Minister said.
Galle Distirct Secretariat under Galle District Secretary S.T. Kodokara. Southern Provincial Minister U.G.Ariaythilake, Provincial Councilors, former Local Government representatives and a large number of state officials led by Southern Province Chief Secretary R.C. De Zoysa participated.
