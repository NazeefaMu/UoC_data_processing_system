“What really opened the door for our vibrant bilateral exchanges was cooperation in construction,” Kang said. He added that Korea had actively participated in various infrastructure developments of Sri Lanka, including the Puttalam housing project, Colombo port expansion project and waterfront resort construction project.
When Sri Lanka was devastated by a wave of killer tsunamis in 2004, Korea lent a helping hand in reconstruction and rehabilitation, Kang added.

He encouraged Koreans to visit Sri Lanka and experience its Buddhist and other historic treasures, tropical natural beauties and Ceylon tea.
World recognised ‘happy marriage’ between two political parties
Abu Dhabi
The 69th Independence Day of Sri Lanka was held on Saturday at the Sri Lanka embassy in Abu Dhabi, amidst a large gathering of Sri Lankan expatriates in the capital.
The celebration began with the hoisting of the Sri Lankan national flag by the Sri Lankan ambassador to the UAE, Sulaiman J Mohideen.
Speeches of the President, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka were read out. Ambassador Sulaiman J Mohideen, speaking on the occasion, said: “For centuries our destinies were determined by and firmly controlled by foreign nations until some of our late leaders fought a relentless battle. Owing to their untiring efforts we were able to achieve freedom without shedding even a drop of blood.
"In 2015, two major political parties joined hands to set up an administration to govern for the first time in the history of Sri Lanka. Even the world at large seems to have recognised this ‘happy marriage’ between the two major political parties of Sri Lanka, which has resulted in a considerable amount of stability within the country, so much that there is a considerable amount of goodwill and respect shown towards our country by most leaders including the Western world.” “It is also refreshing to note that the UAE government has now appointed Ministers for Tolerance and Happiness, paving the way for a harmonious relationship between our countries. This will open doors for more fruitful associations in all spheres be it religious educational economic and other connected fields that can be of mutual benefit,” added Ambassador Mohideen.

"A large number of Malaysians of Sri Lankan origin and the Sri Lankan expatriate community here have been working in every sphere of activity, including public administration, plantation and industrial sectors leaving an indelible imprint in the development of Malaysia," he said.
Muzammil said this in his Independence Day message in a booklet, in conjunction with the 69th Sri Lankan Independence Day celebration organised by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Malaysia on Saturday.
