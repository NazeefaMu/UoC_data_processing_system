Unity in diversity

No Constitution has so far been introduced targeting economic development in the country. Therefore, a foundation should be laid to bridge that gab through the proposed Constitution, says Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake. He was expressing his views during the adjourning debate on the Interim Report of the Constitutional Assembly held on November 8.
Excerpts from the speech:
We should be indebted to the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera for being instrumental in opening a public dialogue on the need of a new Constitution. A clear change should be made to the current Constitution as it was introduced several decades ago.
Our downfalls outnumber our successes in the last 70 years since Independence. Therefore, we should change the system of administration and our Constitution. Various dialogues were emerged in society with regard to this issue. We have taken some initiatives with the victory of January 8, 2015 towards this new social and political order and applauds should be gone to the President, the Prime Minister and all others who supported and lobbied the move.
We have been divided in different lines. We have divisions as Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and Hindus among others. We have divided by political parties, upcountry and low country, nature of employment and class wise. We all suffered a 30 years long war. We won it but we have failed to bring about true reconciliation and peace.
Therefore, we need to build a new country, one nation where there is a favourable social order and diversity for everybody to live in peace and prosperity irrespective their religion, race, political opinion or any other ideology, a society that protects the rights of all its citizens.
We all visit our voters during elections and pledge them to fight for the country. But after entering Parliament, all 225 members in this honourable house suppress the rights of the innocent people those who voted us to power and start controlling the innocence in ruling the country.
People want us to use the power they vested in us to ensure their rights in maximum degree. Then only people feel the devolution of power or administration is worthy. No Constitution is important for people if it fails to solve the burning problems of the people. Constitutional power could be used to ensure better basic amenities such as decent food, education, health, employment, housing and transport.
Our country has 14,022 Grama Niladhari Divisions and each has five bottom level public officers such as Grama Niladhari, Development Officer, Samurdhi Officer, Agricultural officer, and Family Health officer. Five percent of the National Income of this country is spent to pay salaries for these officers. I am afraid any tangible service is performed by through these services.
We have 1.3 million public officers. Rs. 8,600 million is spent to pay them salaries. It is disputable why no foundation is laid to use them for development. One parliamentarian represent 100,000 people, one Provincial Councillor represents 45 thousand people and one Pradeshiya Sabah member represenst 2,500 people. What have been these public representatives doing for the people. Have we achieved any sufficient development?
Many of us are concerned about the unitary status of the country. The sincere aim of majority Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims is to defeat separatism and build a peaceful country. I do not think that nobody wants to divide this small island. If it happens, we will be weakened. Unity is strength, therefore we should be united. Certain factions talk about a fear of division and such talks should be labelled as narrow political propaganda. Founding leaders of our party determined to build a united nation and to unite the country irrespective of creed, race and politics.
Our aim is to introduce a new Constitution responsible to ensure the rights of all people and protect the supreme power of the people, including 6.2 million those who voted this rule of Good Governance to power and others who voted against it or were abstained from voting on diverse reasons.
Therefore, I feel that we have already built up a placid atmosphere to broaden a favourable dialogue on the proposed Constitution intending to achieve a noble goal.
