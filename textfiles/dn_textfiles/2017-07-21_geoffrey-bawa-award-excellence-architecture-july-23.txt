Deshamanya Geoffrey Bawa is recognised as having been among the greatest Asian architects of the second half of the 20th century and one of the most significant Sri Lankans of his time.
He was Sri Lanka's most influential and prolific architect and South Asia's leading guru of tropical architecture. Within a span of about 50 years, he created a wide range of architectural works, mostly in southwest Sri Lanka, which established a prototypes for buildings in newly independent Sri Lanka.
He designed about thirty hotels, twelve of them in Sri Lanka, and contributed enormously to the image that Sri Lanka projected to the rest of the world. Many guide books to the island now include his buildings as ‘must see’ places and rate his hotels as being among the best on the island. Bawa also built in many other Asian countries including India, Indonesia and Mauritius.The Geoffrey Bawa Awards for Excellence in Architecture celebrate the life and work of the renowned architect whose name they carry.
