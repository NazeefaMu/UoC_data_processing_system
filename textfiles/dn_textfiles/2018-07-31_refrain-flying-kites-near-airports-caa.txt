Refrain from flying kites near airports - CAA

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) yesterday requested the people not to fly kites within five kilometres from any airport.
A CAA Spokesman said flying kites near airports is a punishable offence.
The CAA statement said flying kites within five kilometres from an airport could damage the wings of aircraft and other parts causing even plane crashes.
