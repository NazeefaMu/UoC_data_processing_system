Pakistan overhaul urged after ‘shameful defeat’

ISLAMABAD : Pakistan faced calls for a total overhaul on Monday after slumping to a "shameful defeat" against arch-rivals India at the Champions Trophy in England.
The highly anticipated match at Edgbaston proved anti-climactic as Pakistan were thrashed by 124 runs, extending their winless streak against India to three years.
While Indian media rejoiced in the "Mother of all Mismatches", Pakistan newspapers held nothing back in their criticism.
"Pakistan suffers shameful defeat at the hands of India in Champions Trophy, Green Shirts fail in every department," said Jang, Pakistan's highest-circulation newspaper.
Former captain Shahid Afridi was among several ex-players to call for a major shake-up in the wake of the humiliating defeat.
"The gap between Indian and Pakistani teams is bigger than ever! India has evolved & we are way behind now," he said on his Twitter account. "We need to overhaul approach, mindset & work on improving our stagnating skills and play with clear minds."AFP
