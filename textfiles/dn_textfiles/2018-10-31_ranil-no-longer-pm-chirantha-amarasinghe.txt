Ranil no longer PM - Chirantha Amarasinghe

Civil activist Chirantha Amarasinghe in a statement yesterday said the moment the unity government was dissolved with the withdrawal of the majority party, the Cabinet of Ministers in which MP Ranil Wickremesinghe holds position as Prime Minister would no longer function under the provisions of the Constitution.
Excerpts from the statement:
In the context of recent media reports and statements made by former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in relation to the appointment of the new Prime Minister MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, many unbiased non-political legal experts I consulted referred to paragraph 46(2) of the Sri Lanka Constitution (including the 19th Amendment) which states, “The Prime Minister shall continue to hold office throughout the period during which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function under the provisions of the Constitution unless he –”.
Thus the moment the unity government dissolved with the withdrawal of the majority party, the Cabinet of Ministers in which MP Ranil Wickremesinghe holds position as Prime Minister would no longer function under the provisions of the Constitution.
Therefore, MP Ranil Wickremesinghe would no longer be Prime Minister.
Article 42 (4) of the Sri Lankan Constitution states, “The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament who in the President’s opinion is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament.”
The use of “most likely” means it does not have to be “certain.” As the Sri Lankan President is the Executive, the appointment is made “in the President’s opinion.”
I wish to remind you that when MP Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as the Prime Minister in January of 2015, he did not have a majority in Parliament.
In defence, it is being pointed out by MP Ranil Wickremesinghe’s side that the unity government Cabinet formed under Articles 46(4) and 46(5) of the Sri Lanka Constitution was an expansion of his existing Cabinet, and therefore, the withdrawal of the party would default it to the original.
To my understanding it is a statement which has no grounds in the Constitution.
I condemn the Constitutional Council formed by the so called “good governance” government and call it a complete fraud. It is aimed at depoliticising (meaning “remove from political activity or influence”) the public service and is tasked with maintaining independent commissions.
Seven out of ten of its members are politicians which is an utter joke which other countries and the United Nations have not uttered a word about for the past three years. I take this opportunity to condemn the United Nations for keeping silent with regard to the said matter.
