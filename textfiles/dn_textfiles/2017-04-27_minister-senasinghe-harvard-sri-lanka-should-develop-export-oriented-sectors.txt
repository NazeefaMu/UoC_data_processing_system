Minister Senasinghe at Harvard : Sri Lanka should develop export oriented sectors

Sri Lanka needs to look at new sectors which will generate higher export value. This is an area where Harvard University is collaborating with the country, International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said.
The State Minister was addressing the “GEM 2017 Forum” at Harvard University’s Kennedy School on “Sri Lanka’s experience with economic development – tailoring solutions to local problems” recently.
He said a reason for the Sri Lankan conflict was the adoption of Sinhala as the sole language of the country, which resulted in the alienation of the Tamil community, culminating in insurgency and terrorism. The 30-year conflict damaged Sri Lanka in term of economy and international image.
Senasinghe said nine leading political figures were assassinated in the conflict period including President Premadasa. However, Sri Lanka defeated the terrorist group, he said.
State Minister Senasinghe said military experts speak of the Sri Lankan model of counter insurgency.
He said the country benefits from a central position in a region which is not just emerging as an economic powerhouse, but also represents a demographic block of 5 billion people with whom Sri Lanka’s small economy can interact through trade and investment.
He said an important challenge faced by the Sri Lanka economy is its reliance on the apparel industry for exports. He said the industry though significant, has not grown as fast as, for example, that of Bangladesh.
The State Minister said another important aspect of Sri Lanka is the strengthening of democratic institutions and economic liberalisation. Senasinghe said these two are linked and Sri Lanka aims to strengthen business ranking and has set up nine commissions that will result in the strengthening of institutions and democracy.
He said there is a realisation on the part of the government of the need to strengthen global supply chains in the future as the Sri Lankan economy is tied to the global market.
He said the country’s three leading ports at Hambantota, Trincomalee and Colombo will play a vital role, being deep harbours. Sri Lanka will become a major transshipment center.
The State Minister said the country enjoys considerable goodwill on the part of regional powers such as China who are engaged in the development of an industrial zone in Hambantota, while other countries are looking at new zones in Kalutara and Kurunegala.
There is also a need to appreciate the fact that many changes are taking place in the region with Chinese Government promoting the One Belt One Road strategy initiative to link China to Asia, the Middle East and Europe in a modern day silk road.
He said Sri Lanka is looking at strengthening trade agreements with China and India which will help strengthen the government’s goal to create a trading hub in the country.
The country will need to upgrade infrastructure and will be linked by a network of modern expressways which will reduce time of travel in the Island, he said.
