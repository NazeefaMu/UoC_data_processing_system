Nations Trust Bank and hSenid partnership to streamline HR platform

Nations Trust Bank has already pursued the digital route to further enhance their customer and employee experience. As one of the leading banks in Sri Lanka, its choice to move ahead in partnership with hSenid was to further improve their automated HR process.
PeoplesHR, powered by hSenid Business Solutions, the first cloud HR solution in Sri Lanka, became the right choice to fulfill the unique requirements identified by Nations Trust Bank, a bank statement said.
Sampath Jayasundara, CEO of hSenid Business Solutions said, “With the dynamic changes taking place in terms of the business environment and technology, Nations Trust Bank’s requirements grew and the need arose to be in the forefront amongst the others in the market. The upgrade to PeoplesHR was then introduced and implemented successfully. This further strengthens the ability of the system which would increase the productivity, efficiency and accuracy within the bank”.
Nations Trust Bank now enjoys many benefits after the upgrade. Processes are centralised, streamlined and reports are standardised. Ramanika Unamboowe, EVP - Human Resources, Nations Trust Bank said, “Whoever was assigned to handle our project gave their 100%. The hSenid team and our internal IT and HR teams blended well to get the work done, which was really good. It has all the functionalities and processes in place. The mobile application has been very useful in our operations and we have been able to give a new experience to our employees.”
