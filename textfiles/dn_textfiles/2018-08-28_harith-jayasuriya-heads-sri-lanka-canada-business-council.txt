Harith Jayasuriya heads Sri Lanka - Canada Business Council

Sri Lanka – Canada Business Council (SLCBC) which functions under the aegis of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce held its 27th Annual General Meeting recently, re-electing Harith Jayasuriya, Director/Chief Marketing Officer of MAC Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. as the President of the SLCBC for 2018-2019.
David McKinnon, High Commissioner for Canada in Sri Lanka was the chief guest. This was his first meeting with the Council, after having newly been appointed as High Commissioner for Canada in Sri Lanka last September.
In his address, McKinnon said, “Our economic links have advanced considerably, and are now driven very much by the private sector. In nearly the year that I have been in this extraordinary country, I have seen the exciting opportunities that are emerging in Sri Lanka and the growing appetite of Canadian companies to do business here. We want to expand these links further, to the benefit of Canadians and Sri Lankans. Sri Lanka that is inclusive and open to the world, Sri Lanka that will be sustainably prosperous in a way that befits your human capital and other resources, including your favourable geographic position.”
President of the Council, Jayasuriya expressed his view saying, “Sri Lanka is yet to exploit its full potential to benefit from the growing economy of Canada. With the renewed development agenda between our two countries, council will have to play a pivotal role by lobbying our government to create an enabling environment to speed up Canadian Investors in Sri Lanka as well as create the required awareness of the market opportunities that exist for Sri Lankan firms. Understanding the demanding customers and adapting our products and services to exploit the opportunities, require a different mindset and your council will endeavour to facilitate this process to the best of our ability.”
Harith Jayasuriya, Director/Chief Marketing Officer of MAC Holdings (Pvt) Ltd was re-elected as the President. Ramya Weerakoon, Infotechs Limited and Lionel D C Silva, Lidechsi Group of Companies were elected as Vice presidents for the period 2018-19.
