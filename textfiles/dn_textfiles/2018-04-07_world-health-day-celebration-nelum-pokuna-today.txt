World Health Day celebration at Nelum Pokuna today

The World Health Day will be celebrated today at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre in Colombo at 9.00 am with the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, the Health Ministry Spokesman said.
WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO South-East Asia Regional Director Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Health Ministers from 12 countries, representatives from 11 countries and around 50 invitees will take part in the event. The theme of World Health Day is `Universal health coverage: everyone, everywhere'. The slogan is “Health for All”.
The gazette notification on the ban of cigarettes within a radius of 100 meters from schools will be issued during the ceremony. Several publications on the progress of the Sri Lankan health sector during past 70 years will be launched during the ceremony. A first day cover and a stamp will be issued to mark the day, the Spokesperson said.
The World Health Organization, meanwhile, says the organization was formed on the principle that all people should be able to realise their right to the highest possible level of health.
“Health for all” has been our guiding vision for more than seven decades. It’s also the impetus behind the current organization-wide drive to support countries in moving towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC).
WHO is calling on world leaders to live up to the pledges they made when they agreed the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 and commit to concrete steps to advance the health of all people ensuring that everyone, everywhere can access essential quality health services without facing financial hardship.
