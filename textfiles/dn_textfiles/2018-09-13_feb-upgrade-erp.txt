FEB to upgrade with ERP

The Foreign Employment Bureau (FEB) will implement the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to make its services and management process more efficient.
Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando told the media yesterday, that the ERP system will help to automate many back office functions related to services and human resources.
The Minister said that their intention was not to cancel the Family Background Report (FBR) but to bring in amendments. He said the FBR had paved way for more forgery.
“We are focused on finding ways to curb the raising problems pertaining to foreign employment”, he said.
A sub committee has been appointed to look into this matter and the first meeting would be held on September 27. Fernando said he was personally against sending women as housemaids for work and requested not to look everything from a political perspective.” The Ministry is planning to send semi - skilled employees to put an end to sending house maids”, he said.
Fernando made an inspection tour to the Foreign Employment Bureau and said that there were many issues that needed immediate attention. “I made several suggestions for improvement but nothing has been implemented so far. I made an unannounced visit to the Bureau to check on it”, he said.
Responding to a question about cancelling employment agencies involved in forgery, he said there were many issues concerning them and said stern action will be taken against the offenders.
