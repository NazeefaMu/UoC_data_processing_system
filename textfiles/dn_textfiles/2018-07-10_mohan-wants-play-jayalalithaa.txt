Mohan wants to  play Jayalalithaa

Actress Manjima Mohan shot to fame after acting in the romantic-thriller ‘Achcham Yenbadhu Madamaiyada’. In a recent interview, the actress was asked whether she would act in biopics.
To the question, Manjima Mohan reportedly said that she would love to play the late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa in her biopic.
