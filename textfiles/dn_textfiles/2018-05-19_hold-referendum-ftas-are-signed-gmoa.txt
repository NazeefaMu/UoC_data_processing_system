Hold referendum before FTAs are signed - GMOA

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said a referendum should be held prior to signing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to ensure maximum democracy.
GMOA Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge said this will make sure that people agree to sign such an agreement knowing all facts and figures on signing foreign trade agreements.
The GMOA stressed the need to introduce a National Policy on signing FTAs.This is because FTAs stand though Governments change time to time, he added.
He said Parliamentary approval is inadequate for FTAs because it is Sri Lanka (the state) which signs and not the ruling political party or the Government in power.
Dr.Aluthge pointed out that a referendum should be held prior to signing an FTA to ensure democracy.
