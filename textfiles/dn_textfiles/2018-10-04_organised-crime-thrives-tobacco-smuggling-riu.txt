Organised crime thrives on  tobacco smuggling: RIU

The illicit tobacco network is increasingly becoming a threat to national law and order as well as security, the Research Intelligence Unit (RIU) said.
Benefitting from access to new markets with different legal and cultural conditions, organised crime has expanded its engagement in illicit trade significantly.
In a recent report on the tobacco industry, the RIU said the trade is used extensively by organised crime groups to profit.
Given softer penalties compared to higher profits, criminals have developed sophisticated mechanisms to smuggle goods into Sri Lanka. The RIU report says a focus group comprising various stakeholders involved in prevention and policymaking agreed that the growth in the illicit trade of tobacco is serving to increase the spread of organised crime, gangs and criminal activity.
“It results in higher social cost in addition to driving the consumption of other forms of drugs.”
