MR govt ruined economy by borrowing Rs. 9,000 b: Kavinga

The Rajapaksa government which failed to establish monetary discipline, ruined the economy of the country after obtaining Rs. 9,000 billion worth of loans, UNP Parliamentarian Dr. Kavinda Jayawardena said.
He was addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday. “During their rule, individual liabilities reached up to Rs. 500,000 from Rs. 133,000. Moreover, Rs. 13 billion was needed for each week to run the country,” he said.
The MP pointed out that the then government failed to utilise state funds efficiently due to poor financial management.
He added that during the latter part of the then government, short term loans worth Rs. 50 billion had been obtained. As the general practice, short term loans should be settled promptly, but the Rajapaksa government did not stick to that norm, Dr. Jayawardena said.
“Whatever the members of the joint opposition say, all this indicate how the economy was ruined during the then government,” he said. Dr. Jayawardena said as a consequence of the better financial management of this government, the country will receive Rs. 30 billion annually through exporting fish products since this government was able to lift the fish export ban.
