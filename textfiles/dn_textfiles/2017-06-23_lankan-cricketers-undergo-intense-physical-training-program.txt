Lankan cricketers undergo intense physical training program

Ahead of tours here by Zimbabwe and India:
Sri Lanka Cricket announced on Thursday that it had established a high-profile evaluation and monitoring committee headed by Asanka Gurusinha to oversee the physical fitness and conditioning of the national performance squad ahead of their upcoming campaigns against Zimbabwe and India in Colombo.
The move comes in the wake of Sri Lanka’s unfortunate exit in the group stage of the Champions Trophy 2017, where they lost to eventual champions Pakistan in a nail-biting game on June 12.
Elaborating on the plans set in motion, team manager Asanka Gurusinha stated: “We know how much resource and effort was invested in the team ahead of the CT17, and we know how much effort each and every player made both on and off the field. But we have the face the reality that we were just not good enough on the day, and look to the reasons behind this. We have had several internal discussions with the coaches, trainers, the selectors, and the players themselves, and we all agree that there is a disparity in our fitness levels.
“We have incredibly talented cricketers, with the passion and the commitment to fly the flag on high – but they are not quite cricketing athletes, which is where we need to be. The national selectors met last Friday and have selected a provisional squad of 30 players. These players will undergo rigorous testing and evaluation this week, and will only make it into the squads for the Zimbabwe and India tours provided they meet the required grading,” said Gurusinha.
The initial testing of the 30 member provisional squad was conducted under the supervision of SLC HP Training & Rehabilitation Manager Nirmalan Thanabalasingham who commented: “Sri Lanka Cricket High Performance Sports Medicine and Sports Science Department are running a battery of fitness tests encompassing body composition, speed, power and endurance. We will provide this information to the selectors to help guide their decision making but more importantly give players a plan to improve areas of concern in a realistic time frame.”
The Committee which has formulated a strict evaluation criteria comprises chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya, team manager Asanka Gurusinha, chairman SLC Medical Panel Professor Arjuna de Silva, High Performance Manager Simon Willis, Rehabilitation Manager Nirmalan Thanabalasingham and National Trainer Nicholas Lee.
