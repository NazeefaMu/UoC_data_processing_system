JAT Holdings adds colour to Sri Lanka Australia Test

JAT Holdings, one of Sri Lanka’s premier organisations in the furnishing and finishing industry with an impressive portfolio of products has stepped in as Title Sponsor of the Sri Lanka vs. Australia Test and Co-Sponsors of both the ODI and T20 matches.
Up for grabs during the series will be the coveted JAT Paints Cup. The 10-match tournament began on July 26th with the first test match at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium. The second test match takes place at the Galle International Stadium from August 4th to 8th while the third test match is scheduled to take place at the Sinhalese Sports Club Grounds between August 13th and 17th.
“We’re very honoured to come on board and power the ongoing Sri Lanka vs Australia 2016 series. This series was also significant in that we won a test match with Australia after seventeen years. Kusal Mendis also went on to set a record as being the youngest Sri Lankan to score a century against Australia. We are deeply proud to support our cricket team and wish our boys all the best for the matches to come”, said Aelian Gunawardene, Managing Director, JAT Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.
JAT Holdings is also the Co-Sponsors for 5 ODI matches that will run from August 21 to September 4. There will be two T20 matches, also co-sponsored by JAT Holdings. The first will be at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium and the other at R Premadasa Stadium on September 9.
