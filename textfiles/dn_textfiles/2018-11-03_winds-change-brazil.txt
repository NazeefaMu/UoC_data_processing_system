Winds of change in Brazil

In yet another sign that the world is increasingly shifting to the Right, far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil’s Presidential Election on Sunday by a landslide. Official results gave Bolsonaro a 56 percent share of the vote in Sunday's runoff, comfortably ahead of Fernando Haddad, the candidate of the centre-left Workers’ Party (PT), who had 44 percent.
Bolsonaro, a former Army Captain whose campaign motto was “Brazil above Everything, God above Everyone” pledged to defend “the Constitution, democracy and freedom” after winning the polarising election, denying accusations he will turn Brazil towards authoritarianism. “This is not the promise of a party, nor the word of a man. It is an oath before God,” he said in his victory speech. Many analysts say his victory reflects the wishes of a frustrated and dispossessed electorate, besieged by economic woes.
His “Brazil First” slogan closely mirrors US President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy and his triumph follows victories in Italy and Hungary, among others, for far-right nationalist parties. Italy’s deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini, and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary have championed action against immigrants and other far-right policies. President Trump, who has already described himself as a nationalist, called Bolsonaro on Monday to offer his congratulations. Incidentally, many critics are calling Bolsonaro “Trump of the Tropics”.
Miraculous recovery
Bolsonaro made an almost miraculous recovery after suffering a near-fatal stabbing at a campaign rally a few months ago, which may have garnered him some sympathy votes as well. Regardless of the election rhetoric, he faces some tough challenges in reality in this sprawling nation of 210 million people, the world’s biggest centrally-governed (non-federal) democratic country.
His main challenge will be bringing the crime rate down. Throughout the campaign, Bolsonaro promised to crack down on Brazil's violent crime that saw nearly 64,000 homicides last year. In fact, the election campaign itself was one of the most violent in recent memory. He wants to increase gun ownership and has pledged to give police “carte blanche” to kill criminals and drug lords, in somewhat similar fashion to the Philippines.
Turning the Brazilian economy, South America’s largest, around will be another major challenge. One of Brazil’s most serious economic challenges is anaemic economic growth, which has been undermining the country’s growth potential. In a country struggling with recession and high unemployment with a rapidly deteriorating quality of life, there is vast inequality. Brazil's six richest men have as much wealth as the poorest 50 percent of the population, which stands around 100 million people, according to Oxfam.
Corruption is still rampant in Brazil, despite measures taken to curb it including the impeachment and arrests of former Presidents suspected of graft. Business leaders, multinational corporations and leading politicians have been caught up in allegations ranging from bribery and money laundering to attempting to distort the democratic process. A Pan-South American Police operation called “Lava Jato” or “Car Wash” is still netting some suspects.
Poverty is also rampant in Brazil, where many people spend their entire lives in the infamous ‘favelas’ or slums in the big cities. They have looked on with disdain after seeing civil servants retire in their 50s with a full pay pension, whereas they do not even have access to basic services. Thus alleviating poverty will remain a major challenge for the new President, who takes oaths on January 1, 2019.
But Bolsonaro’s biggest challenge will be shedding his authoritarian image and appearing as a President who works for all Brazilians. Many who voted against him have expressed fear that he would revert Brazil to a military style of Governance, as he had often been heard praising the military rule that prevailed from 1964 to 1985, which was one of the most violent periods in Brazilian history. He has also made many disparaging remarks against the LGBT community, women, and ethnic minorities. He was in fact charged earlier this year by Brazil's Attorney General with inciting hatred toward black, gay and indigenous people.
Self-styled nationalist
It remains to be seen whether he will soften or change his stance on these issues and instead strive to bring all Brazilians together regardless of their differences. He will have to keep his word to protect the country’s young constitution, drafted only in 1988. Though a self-styled nationalist, the world will be keenly watching his foreign policy, for no nation can live in isolation in today’s world. They may shun the concept of “Globalism”, but many new world leaders learn before long that good relations with the rest of the world are essential. There is a steep learning curve ahead for Bolsonaro in this respect.
Brazil and Sri Lanka have opened embassies in each other’s countries and the relationship has generally been excellent regardless of the governments in power in either country. Many affluent Sri Lankans are now touring Brazil thanks to regular flights from a few Asian cities and Sri Lanka Tourism should also tap in to the Brazilian market to get inbound tourists. The vast distance between the two nations will not be a hindrance to enhanced people-to-people contact.
