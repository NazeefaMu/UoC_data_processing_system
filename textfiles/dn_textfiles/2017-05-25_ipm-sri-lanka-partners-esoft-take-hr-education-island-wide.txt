IPM Sri Lanka the Nation’s leader in Human Resource Management signed a Memorandum of Understanding with ESOFT Metro Campus on Monday 8th May 2017. The MoU relates to the understanding between IPM and ESOFT on conducting IPM’s well recognised HR courses and programmes at over 40 ESOFT branches present in nearly every district of Sri Lanka. This partnership will help to expand the reach of IPM’s HR education programmes and courses to students in all parts of the country in the shortest possible time. The MoU signing ceremony was held at IPM’s head office, “HR House” in Colombo 5 and graced by top officials of both organisations. The MoU was signed by Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri, President, IPM Sri Lanka and Dr. Dayan Rajapakse, Group Managing Director, ESOFT Group of Companies.
“Given its importance and need in successfully managing organisations in both private and public sectors, HR is now considered a mainstream career path. The awareness of HR that has been created amongst the public at large has contributed to the rising demand for HR qualifications from all parts of the country. With its extensive island-wide branch network, classroom infrastructure and experienced panel of lecturers, we are confident that this MoU with ESOFT will help us to expeditiously take IPM’s well recognised and accepted HR curriculum, courses and programmes to all parts of the country” said Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri, President, IPM Sri Lanka.
“The ultimate beneficiaries of this MoU will be the students themselves who will be in a position to embark on their chosen HR qualifications without hassle” he added.
“We are delighted to enter into this MoU with IPM Sri Lanka who is the undisputed leader in HR. This partnership gives ESOFT the opportunity to expand our product portfolio from our well recognised IT programmes to the fast growing field of HR education. With this expanded range of education services, we will be in a position to present a stronger offering to the market with a wider range of streams to choose from” said Dr. Dayan Rajapakse, Group Managing Director, ESOFT Group of Companies.
“The synergy that will be created by this partnership will no doubt benefit the student population in the rural areas of the country who are interested in pursuing a career in HR” he added.
