Afternoon showers still on the cards

The Meteorology Department yesterday said the possibility of afternoon thundershowers over the island is still high.
Showers or thundershowers will occur in most parts of the island after 2.00 pm. Showers will occur in the Southern and Western Provinces and Puttalam and Mannar Districts during the morning too.
Fairly heavy rainfall, about 75 mm, can be expected in some places, particularly in the Central, Sabaragamuwa, Uva, and Eastern Provinces and in the Galle and Matara Districts. Misty conditions can be expected in some places in the Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces during the morning. There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers.
