Nine-year-old killed on pedestrian crossing

A nine-year-old boy named Warnitha Yasoha Jayasuriya who joined his grandmother to observe sil at the Thalakiriyagama Viharaya on Vesak Poya Day was knocked down by a speeding motorcyclist at the pedestrian crossing near the temple while he was crossing over to the viharaya from the dagoba premises to partake in his forenoon dana with other devotees observing sil.
Warnitha who received injuries was rushed to Dambulla Hospital but succumbed to his injuries after being transferred in a serious condition to Matale Hospital.
Galewela Police investigating the incident said the motorcyclist involved had sped past the pedestrian crossing ignoring the orders given by the traffic police woman on duty to stop.
Warnitha’s funeral took place at the Thalakiriyagama Cemetery on May 14.
