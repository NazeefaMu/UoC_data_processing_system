Hamilton hits back with Chinese win

Shanghai: Lewis Hamilton powered to victory in a chaotic Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai on Sunday, taking swift revenge for his defeat by Sebastian Vettel in the Formula One season-opener.
The Briton, who started on pole, steered his Mercedes to his fifth Chinese Grand Prix win, beating Vettel’s Ferrari by just over six seconds with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen finishing third after an early safety car drama.
“Get in there, Lewis!” Hamilton’s engineer said over team radio after the triple world champion took the chequered flag in China for the third time in the last four years.
“That’s a great race, mate. An absolute masterclass.”
Hamilton replied: “We’ve worked really hard for this, we’ve got to keep pushing.”
After being stung by Vettel in Melbourne two weeks ago, Hamilton predicted a fierce battle for the Formula One title this year.
“In the last 20-odd laps we were just pounding around as fast as we can, exchanging lap times,” he said after his 54th victory in F1.
“That’s what racing is all about. Ferrari have done a fantastic job -- it’s very, very close,” Hamilton added, referring to the difference in performance between the sport’s top two teams.
“There were times Sebastian put laps in and it was hard to even match the time. In the last 12 laps or so it was very, very hard to get to where he was. But then there were other times in the race where I was quicker.”
Vettel recovered from a poor start from row one. But after being stuck behind Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen early on, the German began to show the pace that swept him to victory in Melbourne two weeks ago.
First Vettel blew past Raikkonen before going wheel-to-wheel with Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo at turn seven, producing puffs of blue smoke as the cars touched tyres.
Verstappen loomed ahead but the young Dutchman, who produced an astonishing first lap after starting from 16th on the grid, suffered a lock-up going into the hairpin -- allowing Vettel, rather anti-climactically, to take second place.
