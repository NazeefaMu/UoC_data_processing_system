Sri Lanka not utilising  benefits of Buddhist  philosophy: Rajitha

Former US President Bill Clinton used `meditation’ to heal himself having a heart disease. According to Buddhism, the developed mind can heal over 75 percent of diseases in the body, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Senaratne, the same philosophy can be used to heal all diseases.
Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie had both her breasts removed due to the danger of getting breast cancer. She made her mind up to do so using Buddhism. This is what the West and Europe see and we do not see in Buddhism, he said at a ceremony at Kaldemulla recently.
Senaratne said although dialogue on Buddhist philosophy is taking place worldwide, it is not happening in Sri Lanka. Foreigners engage in meditation programmes in the evening after work to achieve mental peace. Around 12 churches in London have closed down as more Europeans convert to Buddhism, he said.
“Sri Lanka practices pure Theravada Buddhism which is a treasure. We, Sri Lankans can sell it to the world. Our Sri Lankan Buddhist Bhikkus should pay attention to this. It is much better than tourism projects.
I would have done more to promote Buddhism if I did not have bonds. I will do a complete study on Buddhist philosophy when I retire from politics,” he added.
