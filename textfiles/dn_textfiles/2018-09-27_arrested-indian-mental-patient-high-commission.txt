The Indian national who was arrested at the house of Anti-corruption Force Working Director Namal Kumara had a history of mental illness since 2000, Indian High Commission sources told the Daily News yesterday.The High Commission has alerted Indian counterparts to conduct a background check of the said individual after media reported that an Indian national had claimed to have information about a threat to lives of prominent Sri Lankan leaders including incumbent and former Presidents of the country.
“Taking a serious note of the matter and acting on limited information provided to us by Sri Lankan authorities, we immediately alerted Indian counterparts to conduct a background check of the said individual”, a High Commission official told the Daily News.
He said preliminary inputs indicate that the said individual has had a history of mental disturbance since 2000.
The High Commission has already shared the details with Sri Lankan authorities and has assured them full assistance and co-operation to conduct a thorough and professional investigation into the matter.
