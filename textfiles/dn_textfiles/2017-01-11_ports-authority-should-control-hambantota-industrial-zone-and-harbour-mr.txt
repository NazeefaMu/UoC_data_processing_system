Ports Authority should control Hambantota industrial zone and harbour - MR

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa issuing a statement yesterday said that the agreement negotiated by the government during his tenure with both China Harbour Co and China Merchant Co to manage the Hambantota container terminal for 40 years was the best deal yet.
Rajapaksa said as a matter of principle, he was against the leasing of the harbour for 99 years and giving the rights of the land in the industrial zone to a foreign private company.
“The industrial zone and the harbour should be controlled by the Ports Authority, while harbour operations may be given on management contracts to the private sector. For example, the Colombo port is run by the Ports Authority and two private operators. The Ports Authority has full control over the Colombo harbour as well as equity in the two privately run terminals.
This should be the approach to the Hambantota port as well,” he added.
Rajapaksa said the loans taken for the construction of this harbour were US $ 450 million for the first phase, US $ 70 million for the bunkering facility and US $ 802 million for the second phase bringing the total to around US $ 1,322 million.
“When complete the harbour would have four terminals and 12 berths. This was meant to be a free port covering an area of 2,000 hectares where goods could be manufactured or value added and shipped overseas. Feasibility studies were made before these loans were taken and the annual interest plus capital repayments would amount to about US $ 111 million. My government had planned to raise that money through the Ports Authority,” he added.
Rajapaksa noted that the first phase of the Hambantota harbour became partially operational in 2011 and the transhipment of vehicles began in 2012 with 70 percent of the vehicles coming into Hambantota being transhipped to other countries. In 2014, 335 vessels called at the Hambantota harbour with 295 in 2015. The port made an operating profit of Rs. 900 million in 2014 and Rs 1.2 billion in 2015. These are investments that last centuries and a new harbour cannot be expected to produce large profits in the first few years. Our plan was to break even within 10 years, he stated.
