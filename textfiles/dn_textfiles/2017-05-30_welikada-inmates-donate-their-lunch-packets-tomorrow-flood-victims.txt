Welikada inmates donate their lunch packets tomorrow to flood victims

Welikada Prison inmates provide their lunch tomorrow for the flood victims.
About 3,000 inmates supported by officials will provide 6,000 lunch packets for the displaced and will hand over them to the Ratmalana Air Force camp tomorrow (31) to deliver to the displaced by air.
The donation was made under the initiative of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan.
