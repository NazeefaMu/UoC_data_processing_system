Teenage lovers in Kurunegala town nabbed

Nearly 68 teenage couples were taken into custody during weekends by Kurunegala Police at different public places, Kurunegala District Senior Divisional Secretary W.E. Jayathilake said.
He was speaking at a conference held for parents and teachers at the Bingiriya Youth Training Centre yesterday.
Many of the students caught were from leading schools in the district who reached the town for tuition classes, he said. Several were arrested while they were in rented rooms in lodges in the town, police said.
He said a large number of student couples were taken into custody on September 23 while they were in the River Park.
Jayathilake cautioned the parents and teachers to be vigilant over their children's behaviour to arrest the situation.
He said many students in the district had been diagnosed with HIV and other sexually infected diseases (STDs).
