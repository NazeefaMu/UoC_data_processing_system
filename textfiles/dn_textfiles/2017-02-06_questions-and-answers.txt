Effects of a Caveat Notice

Dilum - Badulla
Answer
If a Caveat Notice has been filed by a third party it means that the party may have an interest to the land. If you wish to buy the land you better clarify who are the other parties and their interests to the land. Otherwise it is a risk to purchase a land with Caveat Notices filed by the third party.
If a Caveat Notice is filed by a person he/she will be informed if any deed/ document related to the land described in the schedule of the Caveat is filled in the Land Registry by any party.
