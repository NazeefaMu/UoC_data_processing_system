Lanka to wow Indian theatre

Sri Lankan theatre group Red Apple Theatre Gathering is a participant of the 14th edition of the biannualJashne-e-Bachpan festival in India which takes on several contemporary real-life issues, from digital addiction and caste discrimination to gender roles.
The non-verbal play, Puberty, by the Sri Lankan troupe tackles the theme of gender stereotyping by tracing the life cycle of two newborns of different genders with the help of music and choreography.
The festival is organised by the National School of Drama’s Theatre in Education Company, India.
The nine-day festival will be held between November 17 and 25. Out of 221 entries, the organisers selected 21 Indian theatre groups from states such as Kerala, Telangana, Gujarat, Manipur, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka, 18 of which are appearing at the festival for the first time. Apart from Sri Lanka, the other international groups are from Switzerland and Indonesia.
Besides Hindi and English, the plays will be performed in Bengali, Marathi, Assamese, Malayalam and Javanese. Abdul Latif Khatana, chief, Theatre in Education, said this year’s festival includes 13 devised plays, which are the result of collaborative work by the performing ensemble.
Several use innovative methods to introduce young audiences to complex themes. Chandigarh-based group Wings Theatre Academy’s ‘She Stood Up’ focuses on breaking gender stereotypes through the story of two schoolgirls organising a soccer match.
The satirical play, Thirsty Crow Returns, by Theatre Shine from Hooghly, West Bengal uses the allegory of animals in the jungle to talk about caste discrimination, and Smartphone by Assam’s Guwahati Sishu Natya Vidyalaya examines how growing tech addiction affects children’s mental and physical health.
Vadodara group Triveni aims to sensitise children about the displacement of Gir lions and the importance of co-habiting, with the tale of a lion who is taken to a Mumbai circus after being captured in Gir.
