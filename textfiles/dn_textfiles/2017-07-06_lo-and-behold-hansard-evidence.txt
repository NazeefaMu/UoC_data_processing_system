LO AND BEHOLD! HANSARD EVIDENCE

The Status quo of the current political situation compelled me to go through some old Hansard reports just to understand the calamity the country is going through. The unruly and unparliamentary behaviour of some MPS is quite disgusting and posing a direct challenge to democracy. It was veritably despicable in any sense and if it is not reined in the nick of time the repercussions would not be easy to tackle as the frustrations of the rotten cohorts seem grave.
The Parliament is a popular destination for the educational excursions of the students and utmost care has to be taken by both educational authorities and the parliamentary staff not to let the school children enter the premises at such times. The young children would think that Parliament is a place like ‘Mariyakade’ for any Jack, Jill and Harry could go and create any pandemonium as they wish. The dignity of the House has to be protected at any cost.
Immediately after the recent commotion in Parliament, I went through some copies of the Hansard from 1960 to 1980 to have a workable solution for this unfortunate situation. When I put the current parliamentary situation and the then situation the evidence I found drove me the idea that political frustration, lack of proper education coupled with pedigree might have created the ugly chaos.
Present legislators
Once Sir John Kotalawala diagnosed that it was the consequence when coconut pluckers and the likes come to the august assembly such things happen. The election is a necessary evil. The intelligentsia deserved to be given an opportunity to devise a strategic plan to block such hooligans coming to Parliament. The sanctity of the House should be the guiding light.
One important aspect of the past evidence I found was the level of English education of the then MPs and ministers. Their speeches have been always literary. The great sayings, proverbs, very quotable quotes, extracts from Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Sir Thomas Grey, Hardy, Milton, Mark Twain, Victor Hugo, Anthon Chekhov, Karl Marx, Lenin. Engels, Castro, Mao, Ho Chi Minh, Macbeth, Hamlet, Tempest, the list would go to pages, have always been included in their speeches. I admired Ronnie's budget speeches. NM, Colvin, SA, and JR often delivered great parliamentary speeches.
When I was perusing all these speeches for this purpose I really felt sorry about the gradual decline of the standard of our present legislators. This is a national catastrophe. We should go at least to the period of allegorical poetry in English literature. Once a minister had referred to this period in his speech. I find uneasy for not being able to make an array of some Hansard extracts for the readers to ponder on.
Public figures
John Dryden and Alexander Pope vehemently pointed out that a ruler of a country should essentially be rational. He should be guided by reasons. Public figures should be guided by reasons, they categorically said.
The present parliament could derive much from the past performances of their predecessors. The unruly elements would have to eat their very words if they simply step into their library and read some of the copies of the Hansard. It is a goldmine untouched. The Hansard of that bygone era is a storehouse of unimagined treasures for the amateur parliamentarians. The recent parliamentary debacle of these disgruntled politicians does not augur well for them because the present generation is more politically mature than them. Their hidden agenda is an open secret to the general public.
Least said soonest mended.
