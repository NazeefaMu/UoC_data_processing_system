IESL, UTE launches  Raspberry Pi Challenge 2017

It has often been stated that academic excellence and innovative spirit are necessary hallmarks to fuel Sri Lanka’s future knowledge-based economy.
With an aim to promote innovation and nurture electronics and computing, United Tractor and Equipment (Pvt) Limited (UTE), Sri Lanka’s foremost engineering solution’s company and The Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka, (IESL), the nation’s apex body for professional engineers, announce the launch of the IESL-UTE Raspberry Pi Challenge 2017.
The Raspberry Pi, launched in the UK in 2012, is a low cost, high performance microcomputer with a Linux-based operating system on a Micro SD. With its flexible capabilities and affordability, the Raspberry Pi has the potential to enable a digital revolution and foster creative, independent computing in a way that downloading the latest app does not.
Open to Undergraduates at Engineering Faculties islandwide and Young IESL Members, the IESL-UTE Raspberry Pi Challenge 2017 is being held in Sri Lanka for the very first time.
“Our goal in partnering IESL in organizing this Challenge is aimed at promoting creativity and learning in science and technology among our youth. While engineering is a focus in many of our youth programmes and professional learning efforts we want to inspire Sri Lanka’s youth to make a difference, from innovating to help the environment, to improving health and well-being; to dream big and bold for their future,” says Prasan Fernando, Chairman, UTE.
The IESL-UTE Raspberry Pi Challenge 2017 seeks to provide our students a stimulating platform of innovative creativity and risk-taking through a combination of design and coding, inspiring Lanka’s next generation of tech experts.
“Over the years our young IESL students and youth have impressed us with their inventions. We believe the Raspberry Pi Challenge will be a revolutionary platform for young people to showcase their innovativeness and the power of technology to transform lives,” said Eng. Jayavilal Meegoda, President IESL.
The IESL-UTE Challenge Trophy will be presented to the Winner. Additionally, attractive cash prizes totaling Rs One Million are also on offer.
The winners will be announced and acknowledged at the IESL Awards Ceremony, scheduled for October.
The winning models and prototypes will be showcased and given prominence at an exhibition booth, at the TECHNO 2017 Exhibition organised by IESL also in October.
