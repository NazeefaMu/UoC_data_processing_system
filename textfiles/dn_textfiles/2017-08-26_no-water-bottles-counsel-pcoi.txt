No water bottles for counsel at PCOI

The Chairman of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue yesterday informed private counsel that they will not be provided with sealed water bottles at proceedings in future.
Chairman Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chithrasiri said the Presidential Secretariat has queried about the PCoI’s expenses. “So we have to cut down the supply of water.” Chairman Chithrasiri said, answering President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa as to why they were not provided with water bottles as usual. Justice Chithrasiri said private counsels can use the drinking water filter inside the court room and requested them to use it. The public, government officials and journalists present at the PCoI were not provided with water bottles but were given access to the said drinking water filter in the past seven months of hearing.
