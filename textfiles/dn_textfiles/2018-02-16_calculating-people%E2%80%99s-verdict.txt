Calculating the people’s verdict

Local government elections are over. People have given their verdict. Hence, it would be quite appropriate to reflect upon what happened and its possible consequences.
It was a unique election for several reasons. First and foremost, it was the maiden election under a new electoral system. Overall, it was successful. It is more democratic than the infamous preferential of the manape voting system, which was a breeding ground for corruption and violence. The introduction of the Ward system of representation engendered much enthusiasm among the voters that an unprecedented voter participation was recorded.
The Election Commission, empowered by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution did a wonderful job with police assistance in strictly and impartially enforcing election law. There was no government interference in their work. That is why the election was the most peaceful one held in several decades. Of course, there were few minor incidents of breach of the law. However, considering a large number of candidates that contested and their political diversity it is insignificant. There were no murders, no abductions, and no fatal injuries. One could safely conclude that the democratic consciousness of the people have matured and the beginning has been laid for a new and higher political culture.
The most illuminating factor in the elections was, however, the people’s verdict. Whatever said and done it showed where actual sovereignty lies. In a rare moment, people once again demonstrated that they are supreme. (Experience shows that such moments do not last long!)
Sri Lanka Podu Jana Pakshaya (SLPP)
Sri Lanka Podu Jana Pakshaya (SLPP) emerged the clear winner grabbing a majority representation in 239 of 340 Councils. It is a record for a newly formed party.
What are the reasons for this landslide victory?
Though a local government election, the campaigns of all contesting parties ensured that it took a national dimension. Local government issues were kept out of the campaign and instead, the election was converted into a sort of referendum on the performance of the Government. It was further reduced to the level of a three-cornered contest between the President, Prime Minister and the former President – all of them personally taking charge of the campaign.
In addition, the contest was focused on the Sinhala Buddhist vote base and nothing much was done to attract the voters belonging to the other national communities. The former President told the media after the victory of the SLPP that it was able to even to reduce Eelam, meaning the election of a mere handful of its representatives in predominantly Tamil majority polling areas in the North. Such an assertion implies that according to him the country is already bifurcated into Sri Lanka and Tamil Eelam. This is in line with his ludicrous claim that the Government has sold the country to please the separatist Diaspora according to an international conspiracy.
Sowing dissension among one’s opponents is a long-time practice among Sri Lankan politicians. Former President was a master at it. This practice continued even under the present Government. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe’s strategy was to keep the SLFP division permanent while former President Rajapaksa’s main strategy was to create dissension within the Government and promote acrimony between the SLFP and the UNP. President Sirisena engaged himself in a bitter war of words and some unfriendly acts towards his ruling coalition partner UNP as if to compete with his predecessor in office.
Prime Minister’s strategy of dividing the SLFP boomeranged and the Government got divided as a result. Its inevitable result was the consolidation of the former President and his party-SLPP. The people’s electoral verdict is its result. It is that simple. The old mantram ‘United you in, divided you fail’ held sway.
Had the Government parties gone to the polls with a monolithic unity the result would have been probably the exact opposite.
The SLPP victory is more due to the weakness, inefficiency and divisions within the Government than to the competence of the SLPP or the popularity of its leader. Whatever progress there was initially had halted thereafter.
SAITM degrees
Both the President and the Prime Minister were engaged in a power struggle with an eye on a distant election in 2020 instead of implementing the promised reforms. President Sirisena’s time and efforts were spent on the impossible task of keeping the SLFP intact in spite of organised attempts and action by the former President to form a rival political organisation. He has now successfully done so and in the process virtually killed the SLFP and ruined its future.
The Government resorted to repressive measures to curtail mass agitation. For example, the striking petroleum workers were assaulted brutally by hired thugs and the Government has so far been unable to punish or even identify anyone. A simple issue such as the question of SAITM degrees was left unresolved for nearly a year. Even up to date a final solution has not been made with the Government intransigently holding on to its own PPP solution despite the concurrence of all parties to the dispute with the solution given by the Medical Faculty teachers and the GMOA. The Audit Commission, Charter of Ethics for MPS, anti-corruption programme and the much-promised reform are yet to see the light of day.
Interpretations of the election results are many and varied. Statistics have been employed to suit this or that hypothesis. Some remind us of Mark Twain’s famous saying that “there are three kinds of lies- lies, damn lies and statistics”.
Sometimes statistics should be read backwards to gauge the hidden truth. The basis of the conclusion about the popularity of the former President Rajapaksa is the number of votes received by the SLPP. It is rational to conclude so. However, there is another truth. He received 44.7 percent of the total polled votes. Reading backwards it would mean that there was 52.3 percent against him. That which is greater is obvious. Besides, unlike in a Referendum or a Presidential election, personal votes obtained by considerations other than political by individual local government candidates are also included in that count.
Only one thing is very clear. It is the great decline in the UNP vote base. In August 2015 it stood at its peak reaching 45.7 percent. This time it is only 32.6 percent - a grand slide down of 13.3 percent.
The President throughout the election campaign told the voters that the candidates of the SLFP/UPFA are his own (my!) candidates and they should be elected. Yet the SLFP received only 4.4 percent of the total vote, even below that of the JVP. Even when the votes received by the UPFA (8.9 percent) are added the total number of voters that answered the call of the President was 13.3 percent. It is to be recalled that the number of votes he received at the Presidential election from the Southern Sinhala Buddhist vote base, excluding UNP sympathizers and members were not much different. Hence, the quantum of erosion, if any, of his vote base, is not certain as that of the UNP.
Local government bodies
Taken individually, figures stand out prominently. It is only in comparisons they stand in bold relief. The victory of the SLPP shines in all its glory only in comparison with the defeat of the Government parties.
On the other hand, compared with the Presidential election results of 2015 the popularity of the former President Rajapaksa has not risen at all.
He received only 44.6 percent whereas in 2015 it was 47.6 percent. The future will depend on whether the ruling combine forges unity, correct its mistakes take the people into confidence shedding its intransigence and arrogance and implement the January 8th programme of action or proceed along the same lethargic and somewhat anti-people policies as it did during the three years.
Though the SLPP won marketing the image of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that image cannot contribute anything to actual governance of local government bodies. It has no programme for local government development. Its election theme of saving the country from betrayal has also nothing to do with local council governance. Hence, it will have to train its councillors to govern.
The presence of a fair number of experienced former Councillors is not a blessing but a burden on account of their tarnished character.
Election results also indicate a decline in both tradition dominant parties – the UNP and the SLFP. SLPP seems to replace both. If one concludes that both the UNP and the SLFP would be replaced in the not too distant future by new political formations, it may not be inaccurate. Already the SLFP is being replaced.
The less than expected performance of the JVP shows clearly that it has a long way to go to become a viable Third Force, leave alone forming a government of its own. Only a united Left would be able to become a Third Force.
The JVP could contribute significantly to make that possibility a reality. However, a pre-condition for such an eventuality is the elimination of the eternal animosity between the Old Left and the New Left. Such unity has to be sought among actually existing Left parties and groups and not with some ideal parties with perfect theories. There are none without sin among all of them.
Some blame the voters for the election result without trying to understand why they behaved so. Let me quote a well-known saying of Lenin; “People always have been the foolish victims of deception and self-deception in politics and they always will be, until they have learnt to seek out the interests of some class or other behind all moral, religious, political and social phrases, declarations and promises.”
