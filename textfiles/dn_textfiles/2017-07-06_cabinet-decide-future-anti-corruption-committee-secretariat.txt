Cabinet to decide future of Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat

The final decision as to whether the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat would continue its functions is to be taken up at the next Cabinet meeting, said Cabinet Spokesperson and Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
The minister made this observation at the Cabinet press conference when asked whether any decisions had been taken at the last cabinet meeting to close the Anti-Corruption Committee secretariat, yesterday. He further said that even the Prime Minister was not satisfied with the secretariat’s current method of dealing with the anti-corruption cases and added that many ministers also pointed out the need for not having such a secretariat as it does not serve any purpose.
“President also pointed out at the meeting that there were many scandals that need to be revealed but the secretariat had been investigating on petty issues so far,” he said. The Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat was established in 2015 to observe the complaints received from the public on Corruption and fraud and to refer the true complaints to the Bribery Commission or to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) of Police.
“There are six investigators, one adviser to the investigators, five advisers and another five Director Generals working at the Secretariat. The government spends around 12 million to run it,” he said.
Minister Senaratne further said that a special report on the functions of the secretariat will be submitted to the cabinet next week and the final decisions would be taken afterwards.
When asked whether the President at the meeting said if all the investigation bodies such as police, CID and FCID comes under him, he could submit all reports regarding scandals in three months, Minister Senaratne said even he likes the decision, if they can make it happen.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist whether the government is deliberately delaying local government elections as alleged by the Joint Opposition, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said, all parties have agreed to make amendments and to immediately take necessary measures to conduct the elections.
