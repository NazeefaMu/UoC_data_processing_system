For him, no was never an answer

Ranasinghe Premadasa was born on June 23, 1924, No 12, Dias Place, Keselwatta, Colombo 12. His father Richard Ranasinghe came from Hegalla in Kosgoda and his mother Batuwita Jayasinghe Arachchige Ensina Hamine hailed from Batuwita in Horana.
It is most probably this rare merging of two different streams of genes from two different communities who had lived wide apart for several generations that produced the genius called Ranasinghe Premadasa. As was customary at the time, soon after Premadasa was born his father had gone to the family astrologer with the time of birth to get the horoscope compacted. To the astonishment of the father, the astrologer had predicted that Premadasa would one day be the King of Ceylon; meaning in today's parlance that he would become the head of state; which he eventually achieved in great style indeed!
According to his parents, young Premadasa had displayed extraordinary leadership qualities from a very young age. In 1939 at the age of 15 years he began showing his colours as the prime mover and organizer of the Sucharita Movement; a social welfare and community development organisation. Politics ran in his blood. He was inducted into politics by Labour Leader A E Gunasinha in 1949. He was elected as a member of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) in 1950 and in 1955 he rose to the office of Deputy Mayor of the CMC. He joined the United National Party (UNP) in 1956; which incidentally became a lifelong contract.
On June 23, 1964; exactly on his 40th birthday, he got married to Hema Wickramatunge of Bandarawela. It is said that this was the turning point in his life as far as his political fortune goes. His journey to the very top of the political ladder commenced upon being elected as the second MP for Colombo Central in 1965. Thereafter, he was appointed Chief Government whip, Deputy Minister and Minister of Local Government in the 1965-1970 Dudley Senanayake Government. In May 1977 he was elected as the first MP for Colombo Central and appointed to the high office of Leader of the House and Minister of Local Government, Housing and Construction. On February 6, Premadasa was appointed as the Prime Minister; which paved the way to being nominated as the UNP candidate at the December 1988 Presidential Elections.
Front at the Presidential Elections
Premadasa's leadership qualities such as fearlessness, self-confidence, courage, determination, innovation and immaculate organization were taxed to the maximum at the December 1988 Presidential Election. The Presidential Election was a move of a battle of wits and of course, a do or die for Premadasa. It was conducted amidst chaos, bloodshed and mayhem. No one ever dreamt that it could be successfully concluded as the entire country was in turmoil. The civil war in the North and East was raging and the separatist terrorists had gained control of much of the territory. The Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) which was inducted under the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement to disarm the terrorists had been forced into battle. The JVP insurrection in the South had turned out to be a civil war of sorts leading to murder, arson and wanton destruction of both private and public property. Conducting an islandwide election seemed impossible. The prospect of LTTE land mines and car bombs exploding at any time, anywhere in the country was driving fear and uncertainty.
The Presidential Election was a real test of Premadasa's courage, determination and leadership qualities. Public meetings could not be conducted due to threats, disruption of transport and the uneasiness that prevailed. All kinds of alternative strategies had to be adopted to reach the voters. Premadasa never vacillated. He led from the front and held midday meetings in every electorate. The people listened to his speeches from the safety of their homes through the public address system.
Premadasa was a man who never took “no” for an answer. He was no coward either. He won the Presidential Election securing 50.43 percent of the votes.
Crisis management, his forte
Premadasa was the best crisis manager that Sri Lanka ever produced. The greatest crisis that he faced in his political career was the Impeachment Motion. It was masterminded by two of his Cabinet Ministers Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake, ably supported by Leader of the Opposition Sirima Bandaranaike and Speaker M H Mohamed. President Premadasa had prior knowledge of the impending bombshell but he remained calm and collected until one day in August 1991, when the former Speaker Stanley Tillakaratne called on the President and related signatures of MPs were being collected for an Impeachment Motion on the pretext that it was a motion to prevent the premature dissolution of Parliament. He said that he refused to sign the document as he was not allowed to read it. In the meantime the National Intelligence Bureau was tracking the clandestine activities of the perpetrators and in fact managed to obtain a photocopy of the draft motion from an employee of a Foreign Mission in Sri Lanka. It contained five allegations of misconduct bordering on fiction said to have been committed by the President. They were the abuse of power, autocratic rule, sexual misconduct, mental disability and misuse of state resources.
On August 28 at about 6 pm while the Cabinet meeting was in progress at the Cabinet Office, I received a telephone call from the Speaker M H Mohamed to the effect that there is an urgent letter to be handed over to the President and that he is sending it through his security officer. I asked him whether it is regarding the Impeachment of the President and he laughed. I immediately phoned the Cabinet Lobby and spoke to the President. He asked me to open the letter and read it to him. It stated that in terms of Article 38 (2) of the Constitution an Impeachment Motion against the President has been entertained and that in terms of Article 70 (1) of the Constitution the President has to refrain from dissolving Parliament until the Impeachment Motion has been finally disposed of. I took the letter and handed it over to the President. He slipped it into a file cover and continued with the meeting as if nothing had happened. He did not show any emotion nor did he show any excitement. At the end of the Cabinet meeting, the President very casually inquired from us whether anyone of the Ministers had signed the Impeachment Motion but no one had the courage to own up.
After the Cabinet meeting, the President came to my office and held a meeting attended by Ministers Sirisena Cooray, K N Choksy PC, Attorney General Sunil de Silva PC and myself and discussed the various legal, constitutional and procedural issues involved in dealing with the Motion. The President did not disclose his hand at this meeting. The following morning, the President telephoned me and told me that the only way out would be to prorogue Parliament immediately and I was asked to bypass the Attorney General, the Legal Draftsman, the Secretary-General of Parliament etc. and personally and confidentially to prepare the Gazette Notification proroguing Parliament with effect from midnight on August 30, 1991, and summoning Parliament on September 24, 1991. Those behind the Impeachment Motion were perplexed and confused. Teams of UNP MPs loyal to the President were sent to the districts to locate the errant MPs and bring them to the Presidential Secretariat. Out of the 20 UNP MPs who are said to have signed the Motion, 12 MPs said they did so without reading the document; upon being told that it was meant to prevent the premature dissolution of Parliament. Four UNP MPs said that they did not sign the document but their signatures may have been forged. All of them signed affidavits by way of disclaimer or withdrawal and all these affidavits were forwarded to the Speaker. In any case after computation of valid and invalid signatures it was revealed that the Speaker had entertained the Motion without the statutory requirement of 113 valid signatures; hence the Motion was, technically invalid. Therefore the Speaker was not in a position to place the Motion on the Order Paper of Parliament. We were wondering why the President remained so calm and collected throughout the 26 days of this melodrama. It is because he had a thorough understanding of Parliamentary systems, rules and procedures. The Impeachment drama ended with the expulsion of eight UNP MPs from the party and Parliament.
Fearless, true to his conviction
In terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of 1987, the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was inducted into the country for the limited purpose of disarming the LTTE. However, due to the intransigence of the LTTE, before long the IPKF was forced to switch roles from peacekeeping and disarming to combating and destroying the LTTE. Towards the end of 1988, the IPKF had become a permanent fixture in Sri Lanka and its numbers had increased to alarming proportions exceeding 100,000.
In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, the government virtually had no control. Sri Lanka Armed Forces were ordered to remain in barracks. Immigration and customs formalities were almost non-existent. The Airports, Seaports and much of the territory were under the control of the IPKF. Civil Administration was under the indirect control of the LTTE. For all practical purposes, the sovereignty of a third of Sri Lanka had been ceded. The entire country including the LTTE and the JVP labelled the IPKF as “an occupation force”. Both frontline candidates at the Presidential Election of December 1988 R. Premadasa and Sirima Bandaranaike solemnly pledged that no sooner they came to power the IPKF would be sent back. The JVP in the meantime pledged to continue with their reign of terror in the south sent it such time the IPKF is fully withdrawn.
President Premadasa knew that the crux of the problem was the IPKF. They had accomplished a good part of their task by pushing the LTTE into the Vanni jungle hideouts. In the meantime, at the invitation of President Premadasa, the LTTE had commenced talks with the government even though not in total sincerity and were ready to declare a ceasefire against the Sri Lanka government and all other militant groups in Sri Lanka. President Premadasa, therefore, made up his mind that the IPKF should leave Sri Lanka. On June 1, 1989, Poson Poya day he made an announcement that the IPKF has completed its mission and should leave Sri Lanka by the end of July. He followed it up by addressing a letter to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. However, Rajiv Gandhi was not prepared to accede to the request on the grounds that devolution of power to the North and East Provincial Councils as per the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement has not been completed. By mid-July, as India was not responding positively Premadasa decided to issue an ultimatum to the Officer commanding the IPKF in Sri Lanka demanding the withdrawal of Indian forces before July 29, 1989, or for the IPKF troops to withdraw to their barracks.
In the absence of any positive move by India, a confrontation between the IPKF and the Sri Lanka Army was imminent. A special Cabinet meeting was convened on July 27 and the President briefed the Ministers on the gravity of the situation and the follow-up action that has to be taken. However wiser counsel by some ministers seemed to have prevailed. Luckily, by then Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne had received an invitation from his Indian Counterpart to visit New Delhi for bilateral talks. Finally at a meeting with the Indian High Commissioner and his Deputy and President Premadasa and our Foreign Minister an agreement had been reached on the parameters of the talks and the delegation led by our Foreign Minister who left for New Delhi on July 28 itself. The New Delhi talks were successful; some major concessions had been won which included the commencement of the withdrawal of the IPKF July 29 itself. It had also been agreed that the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka should visit India to prepare a schedule for the total withdrawal of the IPKF. Thus the crisis ended before the Indian and Sri Lankan Armies confronted each other. President Premadasa had proved that he could take a bilateral issue to the brink without backtracking. He had shown an unwavering determination to stand by principle.
