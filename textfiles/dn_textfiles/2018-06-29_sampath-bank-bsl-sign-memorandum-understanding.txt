Sampath Bank, BSL sign  Memorandum of Understanding

Sampath Bank, recently entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Biodiversity Sri Lanka (BSL).
In a significant change to typical conservation initiatives the MoU will allow each organisation to work in concert with other, state and private sector, partners towards the restoration of degraded fern land in Halgahawala, Opatha and the development of a biodiversity credit accrual system for Sri Lanka.
The MoU was signed by Dilhan Fernando, Chairman Biodiversity Sri Lanka and Aruna Jayasekera, Group Chief Human Resource Officer Sampath Bank.
“Sampath Bank is a national icon that has always worked to steward the country towards a brighter future. This is why we are proud to have them on-board this landmark partnership that will have a significant impact on the future of Sri Lanka,” said Dilhan Fernando, Chairman, Biodiversity Sri Lanka.
This MoU further showcases Sampath Bank’s commitment to the environment and creating a green future for the nation. The five year long arrangement will allow the Bank to fund BSL’s pilot project in the Kanneliya Conservation Forest as well as work closely with partners to monitor its progress based on ecological and biological indicators.
The first phase of this project has produced the biodiversity baseline and management plan for the degraded forest patch of 10ha in Halgahawala, Opatha.
The project will restore this patch of highly degraded rainforest using principles of restoration ecology to enhance its ecological functions, habitat quality, species diversity and its capacity to provide biodiversity and ecosystem services in close approximation to what prevails at the nearby rainforest. In parallel to the restoration, the project will also develop a biodiversity credit accrual system using the insights derived, with the aim of assigning a unit value for enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services.
A secondary benefit of the project is that it will boost the local economy by providing employment opportunities to adjacent communities. Commenting on this historic partnership Aruna Jayasekera, Group Chief Human Resource Officer, Sampath Bank, said, “As one of Sri Lanka’s leading national banks that has been serving the masses for over three decades, we see it as our duty to proactively tackle challenges that may adversely affect our nation.”
