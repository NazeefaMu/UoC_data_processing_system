Point of view
Equity markets bounced back over the week to close at an 18-month high, as the benchmark price index gained ~29 points W-o-W to end ~66 points above the key 6700 index level.
Despite a 20 point loss between Tuesday and Thursday, index gains on Monday and Friday helped pare down the losses over the week.
Markets which remained largely dull till Thursday amid thin trading, recorded average daily turnover levels of ~ LKR 0.51Bn before hitting a notable LKR 1.63Bn on Friday which helped push the average weekly turnover levels to LKR 0.73Bn (5% higher than last week’s average turnover of LKR 0.70Bn and ~19% lower than 2017 daily average turnover of LKR 0.91Bn).
Large parcels which traded on Friday led to overall crossings accounting for ~38% of the total market turnover amid strong interest in Melstacorp (37% of crossings), Access Engineering (23% of crossings) and Hemas Holdings (10% of crossings).

Foreign investors meanwhile continued to be net buyers for the 24th consecutive week to end at LKR 0.76bn despite a marginal outflow on Wednesday this week (~38% higher than last week).
Y-T-D Net Foreign flows (LKR 22.9Bn) to the Colombo Bourse thus recorded the second highest yearly inflow since 2012 (LKR 38.6Bn).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum whilst looking for direction from greater clarity on the proposed new inland revenue act.
Slower pace of Fed hikes benefit FX/Bond Mkts
Emerging market equities rose to 2-year highs this week as the US Fed appeared to indicate a more gradual pace of rate hikes.
The Fed Reserve Chair’s comments to the US congress earlier in the week was interpreted by investors as ‘dovish’ and indicative of no interest rate hike in Sept’17 as US inflation rates remain below the Fed’s inflation target of 2%.
Emerging market equities and currencies responded buoyantly, as a slower pace of Fed rate hikes could impact the dollar and preserve the relatively wide gap between U.S. and developing-country bond yields.
The weaker USD along with higher interest rates in developing nations has led to record inflows to emerging-market funds in H1’17.
The US Fed’s signal of a more gradual pace of hikes is positive for Sri Lankan currency and bond markets as well as it implies that net foreign inflows to G-Secs (which have been positive since Mar’17) are likely to continue.
Net inflows to G-sec’s in Jun’17 was Rs. 236Bn vs. Rs. 196Bn in Mar’17.
Inflows to G-Secs should help support the LKR which will be vital in the context that oil imports remain high, exports relatively muted and remittances have taken a hit as geo-political tensions in the Gulf region appear to be protracted.
The US adopting a more dovish tone also implies that pressure on Sri Lanka to raise rates is lower, a positive development in light of the fact that GDP growth has slowed over Q4’16 and Q1’17.
