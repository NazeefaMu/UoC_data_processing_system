Good lawyer, Weerawansa’s only option, not hunger strike: Ajith

Deputy Minister of Power and Energy, Ajith P Perera yesterday said a good lawyer rather than a hunger strike would expedite MP Wimal Weerawansa’s release from prison.
“We believe that our courts are independent and only through the legal system, can they receive bail”, said Perera addressing the weekly cabinet briefing held at Parliament yesterday. MP Wimal Weerawansa, it is learnt had commenced a hunger strike yesterday in protest not being granted bail by courts on Tuesday.
Weerawansa’s current lawyer is none other than MP Namal Rajapakse. The MP was arrested on January 10 , for the alleged misuse of government vehicles.
“Weerawansa was not arrested for fighting on behalf of his country, this was misuse of public property. As a lawyer, I see no point in this fast. No one has been granted bail because of it, they have to seek redress through legal means”,Perera further explained.
