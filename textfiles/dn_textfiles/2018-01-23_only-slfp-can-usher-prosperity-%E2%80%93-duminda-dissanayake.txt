Only SLFP can  usher prosperity  – Duminda Dissanayake

Votes cast for the UNP, JVP or the GL’s new party SLMP would go waste since both the executive president and the SLFP President is Maithripala Sirisena whose support would definitely be with the SLFP candidate, said SLFP General Secretary and Ariculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake, addressing an election rally at Padaviya.
JVP is asking people to vote for their candidates at the forthcoming local government elections promising to make the village a ‘heaven’. Also, former President and Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa, on the SLMP election platform, is urging people to vote for the SLMP to enable development awakening in the village. It is same with the independent contestants. If you vote for members representing these political clans, your villages will remain underdeveloped with problems and shortcomings unsolved while the members chosen enjoy the salary and other privileges for their own benefit, Minister Dissanayake said.
“Only SLFP candidates could bring about prosperous development packages and relief to you once they have been voted into the local government bodies at the elections. They are reinforced and energized and invigorated by the executive president, the government and the provincial council, a three-fold strength,” the Minister said.
He said that G.L. Peiris’ party has no clear or permanent political vision or mission and the only objective is to gain power for the comfort of a certain politically bankrupted group rejected by the people. The JVP’s only strength is the tiny group of MPs in Parliament.
The SLFP General Secretary appealed to voters not to allow themselves to be misguided or hoodwinked by untrustworthy political groups. “Only your conscience could correctly decide the most suitable way you will use the franchise. Be wise enough to be with us the SLFP and the president dedicated to eradicate corruption deeply rooted in society,” Dissanayake added.
