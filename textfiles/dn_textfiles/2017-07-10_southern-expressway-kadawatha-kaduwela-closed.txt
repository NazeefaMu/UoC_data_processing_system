Southern Expressway from Kadawatha to Kaduwela closed

 
The Southern Expressway from Kadawatha to Kaduwela will be closed from t 12.30pm to 4.30pm today to a remove high-tension electricity cable.
Last night a section of the Southern Expressway between Kadawatha and Kaduwela was closed due to the falling of a high-tension electricity cable.
As a result, the Kadawatha exit of the highway was also temporarily closed and seven areas in the Western and Southern provinces including Horana, Mathugama, Ambalangoda and Galle experienced a power outage due to a breakdown in the Biyagama - Pannipitiya transmission line.
