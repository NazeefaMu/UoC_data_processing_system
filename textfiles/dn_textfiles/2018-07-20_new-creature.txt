A New Creature..!

In a home in Colombo there is deep sadness. A father is no more. Who’s voice like a shepherd’s call, kept his flock of children and wife safe together, now just resounds in their minds. I remember Chris Dawson. I remember him arriving at my home nearly thirty years ago, with his brood, concerned over a conflict in his beautiful Lanka. I watched as he a bigger than life figure kept a watchful eye on his family. And today, his wife, my aunt and children, my cousins bow their heads in grief in that home in Colombo.
For them do I pen these lines of comfort:
In a quiet pond lived a little colony of water creatures. They were a happy colony, living far away from the sun, busy, scurrying over the soft mud on the bottom of the pond. They did notice that every once in awhile, one of their colony, clinging to the stem of a pond lily climbed up gradually and moved out of sight and was seen no more.
They were greatly puzzled. Finally, one of them said, "The next one of us who climbs up the lily stalk must promise to come back and tell us where he or she went and why!"
"We promise", they all said solemnly.
One spring day, not long after, the very water creature who had suggested the plan found himself climbing up the lily stalk. Up, up, up, he went. Before he knew what was happening, he had broken through the surface of the water and fallen onto the broad, green lily pad above.
When he awoke, he looked about with surprise. He couldn't believe what he saw. A startling change had come to his old body. His movement revealed four silver wings. He moved those wings and found himself up above the water.
He could fly!
Swooping and dipping in great curves, he flew through the air. He felt exhilarated in his new form and by and by healighted happily on a lily pad to rest.
Then it was he chanced to look below to the bottom of the pond. There were his old friends, scurrying around, just as he had been doing some time before.
He remembered the promise and darted down, hit the surface of the water and bounced away. Now, he realized, he could no longer go back.
"I can't return!" he said in dismay. "Even if I could, not one of them would know me in my new body. I guess I'll just have to wait till they become like me too, then they'll understand what has happened to me, and where I went. Though I feel sad I can’t tell them how happy I am, and that I can fly!"
Somewhere above that home in Colombo, my uncle Chris can see you! So don’t weep my dear aunt and cousins, your dad’s not gone, he’s just a new creature..!
