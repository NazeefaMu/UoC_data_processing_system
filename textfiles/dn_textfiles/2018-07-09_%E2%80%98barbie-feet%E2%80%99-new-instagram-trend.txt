‘Barbie feet’ is the new Instagram trend

Instagram is full of picture perfect people. Sometimes it can feel incredibly daunting posting your own snaps for your followers to see.But if you’re keen to improve your photo game, there’s a new trend you need to know about.
Or more specifically, a new pose. If you take a closer look at any celebrity Instagram account, you might have started to notice a certain similarity between their photos.
That’s because they’ve all been doing something very specific with their feet.
Dubbed, ‘Barbie feet’ by Who What Wear , the stylish pose has taken social media by storm. But the trick is so simple you’ll kick yourself for not thinking of it before.
‘Barbie feet’ involves balancing on the balls of your feet, as if wearing an invisible pair of high heels. The shape and position of the foot when doing the pose can be compared to that of a Barbie doll, whose feet are molded into a permanent point - hence the name.
People are opting to strike a pose in this way for one very obvious reason.
It’s incredibly flattering It’s no secret that heels are the most flattering form of footwear as they elongate the legs and make them appear slimmer.
So Instagram pros are opting to create the illusion of wearing heels to appear more photogenic in places where shoes just aren’t practical. It’s especially favoured by stars posing in bikinis on the beach with bare feet.
