CEB TUA braces for island-wide strike on September 13

The Ceylon Electricity Board Trade Union Alliance Secretary Ranjan Jayalal yesterday said they would launch an island-wide strike on September 13 from 12 noon against the proposal to increase the electricity tariff and corruption. Accordingly, all employees attached to CEB apart from its administration will cease work supporting the trade union action, he said.
A proposal was forwarded to the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry by the CEB Engineers Association to increase the electricity tariff to meet the financial crisis of the CEB. According to the Engineers’ Association, the CEB needs an additional income of Rs. 25 billion to meet the financial crisis the CEB is undergoing.
CEB TUA Secretary Ranjan Jayalal speaking to the Daily News said they were of the view that large corruptions within the CEB should be addressed instead of making the public bear the burden of paying for the losses incurred due to corruptions. According to Jayalal, the CEB records fraud amounting to more than Rs. 6 billion not probed into by the CEB administration. Jayalal said two rounds of discussion were held with the Minister and the Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy on last Friday and Saturday to discuss the lack of probe into large scale fraud taking place in the CEB among other matters.
