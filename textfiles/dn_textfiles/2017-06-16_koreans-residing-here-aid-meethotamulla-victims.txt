Koreans residing here aid Meethotamulla victims

The Korean Residents Association of Lanka (KRA) donated 100 rice cookers to Sri Lankans affected by the Meethotamulla disaster this year.
According to the Disaster Management Centre, due to the collapse of the garbage dump at Meethotamulla on April 14, a total of 1,670 people were affected and about 100 families have been displaced.
The hand-over ceremony was held at the Disaster Management Ministry on June 12, with the participation of KRA Chairman Myung-ock Hong, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, and First Secretary of the Korean Embassy Miyeon Kwon.
KRA members and the Korean Embassy officials visited the Kolonnawa Divisional Secretariat on the same day and conveyed condolence messages to Kolonnawa Divisional Secretary Sugath Sisirakumara. The Korean community also delivered the 100 rice cookers in person to each family of the displaced in Kolonnawa. Meanwhile, the Korean Association also handed over relief items, comprising 150 bags of rice (10kg each), 150 boxes of food ingredients (sugar, milk powder, canned food, etc.) and clothes, to the flood victims and bereaved families in Ratnapura on June 8.
