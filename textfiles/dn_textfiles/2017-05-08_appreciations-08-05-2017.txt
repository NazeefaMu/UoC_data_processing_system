[APPRECIATIONS - (08-05-2017)]

Rev. Sr. Charmaine Mendis
Voice of the voiceless
Rev. Sr. Charmaine Mendis, who brightened the lives of deaf children of Sri Lanka for over five decades, left for her eternal rest on April 5.
Enduring cellulitis for a number of years with a swollen leg, suffering a hip fracture and difficulty in swallowing and breathing, she led an active life for 82 years. She passed away while chatting with her comrade nuns at the convent. Rev. Sr. Mendis belonged to the Congregation of Sisters of Perpetual Succor at Periyamulla, Negombo, and she was on the staff of St. Joseph’s Deaf School for the 53rd year when she passed away.
Rehabilitation of deaf children in Sri Lanka was the prime task of the Sisters of Perpetual Succor to which Sr. Charmaine thoroughly adhered to. She qualified in the field of deafness, specializing in the education of the deaf and audiology at the universities of Dublin and Salford in Ireland and Victoria University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. She returned to Sri Lanka after graduation in 1964 and from that time to date, there was no other person equally qualified in educating the deaf as Sr. Charmaine in Sri Lanka did.
The Education Dept. sought her assistance in the training programmes of the Government Teacher Training College at Maharagama and the National Institute of Education. She was the Audiometrician in the National Council for the Deaf for many years. She represented Sri Lanka at several international conferences on deafness held in the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, China and Australia. She brought much honour to Sri Lanka by her participation in these conferences.
Besides the international arena, Sr. Charmaine’s sweat was shed beyond bounds on Sri Lankan deaf children. She was attached to the staff of St. Joseph’s School for the Deaf, Ragama, for many years where she was the Principal from 1973 to 1976. Out of the 21 schools for the deaf in Sri Lanka, St. Joseph’s, Ragama, takes the pride of place in all Government examinations—GCE O/L and A/L. Many children obtained A and B passes and some were selected to the university. She advocated Total Communication, a mixture of verbal and sign language more than mere signs.
The Association of Parents of Deaf Children initiated by Sr. Charmaine in 1971 and continuing to date, renders yeoman service in the field of deafness not only to deaf children and their parents, but also to teachers of the deaf, public institutes and the general public.
A spate of programmes on Awareness of Deafness, which was very popular, was conducted in seven districts, mainly to young parents of deaf children. The Association launches talent building projects for deaf school children in art, dance, drama and sports every year and the children profit immensely by these. This year, the All-Island deaf Schools’ Art Competition was held in March and the Dance Competition will be held on May 27. The winners will receive trophies and other awards from a chief guest at the awards ceremony to be held at the D.S. Jayasinghe Hall in Dehiwala.
At the request of the Association, Sr. Charmaine have conducted nine special training programmes for Teachers of the Deaf and about 200 teachers who completed the programme were given special consideration by the Deaf Unit of the Special Education Department. All 16 facilitators of her training programme were university lecturers and professors and nearly all participants have commented that the course was superior to the course conducted by the Govt. Teacher Training College. As Course Director, Sr. Charmaine took a lot of pain to maintain its standards.
Deaf youth’s interests are looked after by the Association with regard to vocational training and employment. The youth are directed to the German Technical College or similar places of training and they are found employment for those who wish to work as tailors, in poultry farming or otherwise.
Deaf youth, both male and female, envisage problems in finding marriage partners and have been requesting the Association to assist in this situation. The Association, in response, to the request holds encounters for marriage aspirants along with their parents. There is a big demand for this service and many have found their partners through the three encounters held each year.
Sr. Charmaine’s constant complaint was that there weren’t sufficiently-qualified officers in the Ministry and Dept. of Education for deaf education matters. Therefore, it was very difficult to convince the authorities of the needs of deaf children. There was not a single qualified officer in both these sections, the ones available being qualified in visually-handicapped or mentally-retarded areas. Sr. Charmaine was always opposed to the calling of tenders for hearing aids and distributing them among deaf children regardless of audiograms. An audiorgram shows the accurate hearing loss a deaf child has and accordingly a suitable hearing aid should be customised for the child by an audiometrician. Sr. Charmaine regretted this faulty move of the Dept. of Social Services as the deaf children did not reap sufficient benefit from the hearing aids. She also pleaded with the Govt. to exempt the tax component on the ear-mould material and hearing aid batteries imported from abroad.
Her own audiology laboratory was maintained by herself and she tested the hearing of numerous children and produced correct audiograms. This was a great help to the poor deaf children’s parents as she only charged a nominal fee for the tests. From morning till evening, she was grappling with deaf children’s problems, meeting parents for consultation and never got tired of this service. As parents of deaf children are comparatively poor, she launched a plan to mitigate their financial strains. Sr. Charmaine, born to a wealthy family, got the help of relatives and friends both local and abroad and with her own personal resources, started assisting over a hundred families for their children’s hearing requirements. She used her free time to attend to this laborious task of letter-writing, depositing money in each one’s account and keeping a record of all transactions in addition to attending to her own personal healthcare and preparing for the next day’s lessons going to bed as late as 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. daily. Her sacrifice was so great that she considered deaf children’s solace as the primary need in her agenda.
In conclusion, let me explain how I first met Sr. Charmaine. It was at the 25th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Association of Parents of Deaf Children. I had received an invitation to attend the meeting and as I was looking out for some help to bring up my own deaf daughter, I decided to attend it. When the time came for election of a President there was a big commotion as every member whose name was proposed for Presidency started withdrawing with excuses of sickness, distance or age. This went on for abut an hour and finally, the Chief Patron, Sr. Charmaine, made order that the Association be dormant for two years. The members were delighted by this suggestion and the uproar subsided. I was vexed by this proposal and immediately got up and said that the Association should be ashamed to step down like that after running for 25 years and made an open request for someone courageous enough to accept the Presidency. The gathering became silent. All of them were astonished at my words as I had the audacity to challenge the Patron. A few seconds later, my name was proposed for the presidency. I got annoyed and upset and got up to say if the seniors of the Association did not want it to continue, neither did I. The moment I got up to speak, a soft hand touched my left shoulder. I turned back to look; It was Sr. Charmaine. “Please don’t reject this offer, please accept it. I know you have no experience, but I will give you all the support. Please accept the Presidency.”
I couldn’t say no to the very kind appeal of the Patron. I sat down silently; somebody seconded my name. A unique instance of one being made President of an Association the very first time he attended a meeting. As I went to the chair, I said, I will accept the presidency just for one year and somebody should get ready to replace me the following year. My appeal was answered only after nine years. Yet I am being re-elected from time to time.
B.R.M. Rodrigo,
President, Sri Lanka Association of Parents of Deaf children
Bakeer Markar
Gentleman politician
V.L. Wijemanna swearing in before Bakeer Maker as acting Plantation Industries Minister
I First came to know Bakeer Markar when I joined the Kalutara Bar more than half a century ago. At that time, I professed a political language quite different to his thinking. I spoke to him with a certain amount of trepidation, but he soon put me at ease and chatted with me as if he had met me after an absence of several years. That is one trait in him that can be vividly explained with one Sinhala word “ Nihathamanee,” roughly translated as very well behaved towards others although justice is not done by the Sinhalese word.
He was our Senior at the Bar and did not fail to constantly advice the juniors when needed or called on him. Those days, we had Courts on Saturdays. He used to come wearing a Sharkskin coloured suit. At the time, there was utter chaos with Poya and pre-Poya being the week ends. There was only one other Member of Parliament, and he kept aloof from the crowds, but not Bakeer. He was very popular with the juniors. Most of them practiced in the Criminal Courts. At that time, the hierarchy of the Bar Association was dominated by Senior Civil Practitioners. Criminal practitioners and the juniors resented the establishment. They decided to challenge the Supramacists. Enter Bakeer as our Savior. He was elected President unopposed. I was his Secretary.
In the year 1972, a new Constitution came into force. There was a ceremony to welcome the Judges. Late Minister Dr. Colvin R. De Silva, at that time, represented the Government. Addresses were delivered by Dr. Colvin R. De Silva, the Judges and the President of the Bar Bakeer Markar. Bakeer spoke in Sinhalese. He spoke of the wisdom and sense of justice in Sri Lankan History and ended with the Budhist stanza ‘Sabba pa passa Akaranan.’ There was pin drop silence during his delivery and the audience burst into a spontaneous applause as he ended. Everybody present in the hall, including the Juges, were mesmerized by his speech. Later, Dr. Colvin came up to Bakeer and congratulated him on his endeavor. But all was not well among some members of the Bar. In the course of that year, six motions of no confidence were brought against him. We won every one of them.
The period of the long Parliament ended after seven years in 1977. Bakeer was elected with a vast majority. They were the majority of Sinhalese. He served every person in his electorate with equal vigour. The Beruwela Constituency can boast of the greatest number of social castes not found anywhere in Sri Lanka. Soon after the elections, I saw him in an animated conversation with a lawyer MP who had lost very badly.
The conversation lasted for nearly an hour. After that, I approached Bakeer and told him that I had never seen that MP talk to Bakeer during days of glory in nearly seven years. He told me that’s true Siri, but I went up to him and sympathized although he never looked at me even during the period.
Bakeer became Deputy Speaker and Later, Speaker of our Parliament and thereafter a minister. Later, He became the the Governor of the Western Province.
He lived in a rented house, meaning he had not amassed wealth. I am happy to state that under the Ceiling on Housing Law, the ownership of the house befell on him. Bakeer’s Father was from Galle. He had been a practitioner of the ‘unani’ system of medicine. Bakeer had a large collection of ancient miniature booklets on cures for a myriad of diseases.
But he is not devoid of Wealth. He left behind his children who are capable of standing tall in any situation.
May the turf lie lightly on him. May he attain supreme bliss in accordance with his religious beliefs.

Tribute
Sumana de Silva
Exemplary centenarian
A century, whether it be a cricket match or a break on the billiard table, is an event which calls for publicity, congratulations and celebrations.
I consider it a great honour and privilege, to send this congratulatory message to my very dear sister-in-law, Sumana de Silva, my husband’s sister, on her hundredth birthday, which is on the May 8.
Sumana Akka, as we all affectionately call her, was born on May 8, 1917, in Ambalangoda. She was the eldest child of Patuwatha Withana Thomas de Silva. She started schooling at Girls’ High School, Kandy and later, when her father joined Government service, she joined Southlands College, Galle, where she was a boarder at the Hostel. She joined the Govt. Training College in 1941 when it was situated at Thurstan Road and passed out as an English trained teacher in 1942. After training, she joined Prajapathi Vidyalaya, Ambalangoda and later taught for a short time at Mahabodhi College, Colombo. She devoted 27 years of her teaching career at Ananda College, Colombo. She joined the Ananda College Staff in 1948 and retired in 1975. During her tenure as a teacher, she was sent on a scholarship to the University of Michigan to study the teaching of English as second language.
As a teacher, thousands of students have passed through her hands and I’m sure she can still remember each and every one by name, where he was from and his life at College. Many of her students have become leading doctors, lawyers, engineers, administrators, academics, officers of the Armed Services, Police, businessmen, planters and so on.
She always practiced what she preached and left an indelible mark on everyone who came in contact with her. She was a much loved teacher, who rendered almost 35 years in the cause of education. She never sought publicity, but went on in quiet efficiency throughout the years, giving of her best at all times. Generations of young men have surely reaped the benefits of her high ideals and values.
Sumana Akka is very kind-hearted and possesses a sense of fairplay and justice. Simplicity, is the hallmark of her personality. She possesses many admirable qualities—patience, integrity, amiability and honesty—all these are part and parcel of her.
She married Donald de Silva who worked at the Department of Fisheries. Her husband passed away in 1994, just a couple of months before their 50th wedding anniversary. She was the pivot around which her family unit revolved. Her family always came first. She symbolised the quintessential qualities of motherhood. She was an exemplary mother whose devotion and concern for her children extended beyond their childhood years. Her unconditional love and understanding allowed her children to make their own way in life and today, all of them are doing extremely well in life.
She is the mother of four children. The eldest, Dr. Lal de Silva, is a consultant surgeon, the second, Dr. Iyanthiemala Abeywickreme, is a consultant physician and was the former President of the Sri Lanka Medical Association. Tissa de Silva, the third, is an engineer and is the Director of Intelligent Systems (IBI) Group in Canada. The youngest, Channa de Silva, who captained the Ananda College Cricket team, was an officer in the Air Force and later, migrated to Australia, after marriage.
Although Sumana Akka is a centenarian, she has her wits about her and is interested in all that is happening around her and in this country. Very great indeed! Until recently, she was an avid reader and still is an ardent cricket fan and a champion at Scrabble. She is a very good seamstress and has done exquisite cross-stitch embroidery on her own clothes as well as household linen. She is an excellent cook and can turn out tasty dishes in a jiffy. But all these activities have slowed down gradually due to failing eyesight. She is a true Buddhist and lives by the principles she upholds. After her retirement, it was her practice to visit the Kuppiyawatte Temple regularly. She lives with her daughter at Fifth Lane, Colpetty. <U+200B>Here’s wishing her a Very happy birthday and may the Noble Triple Gem bless her with good health, happiness, peace and contentment, all of which she richly deserves.

Ranjith Fernando
Beloved husband
Three years have gone to the date of May 9, 2017, from the date that my beloved husband Ranjith Meril Fernando had passed away. But we still feel that he is alive with us, always.
Until Ranjith fell ill, he was efficient and committed to his career activities and all other day-to-day activities. His days were well-planned.
He began his day at 5.00 am with yoga exercises. It followed a morning tea with me, always in an enthusiastic manner, discussing planned activities. He had a deep faith in Buddhism and always listened to morning ‘damma chintha.’He never forgot to sweep the house prior to getting ready for office. I prepared his lunch as per his wish and he offered his sincere thanks to me while placing it in his office bag, which I admired mostly in our whole life time. I’ll never forget how he appreciated me when I was waiting at the gate till he was out of sight.
On the day we got married (October 15,) we obtained blessings from the ‘Sri Dalada Maligawa.’ We never repeated it on every wedding anniversary throughout the past 49 years of our marriage life. This was Ranjith’s great idea which caused much relief and comfort to both of us.
As a Government Servant, Ranjith served in many parts of the country. Some of them were Matale, Haputale, Kotmale, Mawanella, Nuwara Eliya and Naula. He was an active union member who sustained various positions. He was a July striker in 1980 and had to go abroad since he lost his job. But he used to come to Sri Lanka every year and spend a few weeks with us.
We have four children: two daughters and two sons and they take care of us.
We were lucky to have eight grand children as well. They loved Ranjith very much. He had a great relief by listening to their talks and played with them occasionally.
In addition, Ranjith treated his mother and only sister well. As per the Buddha’s guidance, this is a great merit which one can gain throughout his lifetime.
Rajith never forgot to arrange a family trip with all family members every year. It gave a pleasant and joyful experience to all of us and improved unity among family members.
Ranjith had many friends—local and foreign, male and female. All of them loyal and with good qualities. We went to Dambadiwa in 2012. How he prepared for the journey and the way we travelled together with others remains etched in my memory. It was our first journey to Dambadiwa and I never thought that would be the last as well.
Ranjith observed ‘sil’ with me on every full moon Poya day without fail. We were lucky since we were able to listen to sacred ‘dhamma desana’ preached by the Buddha and be able to understand the impermanence of this life.
After returning to home, we discussed it. As per the truth of life, figure decays and the name remains. My beloved husband, I wish I would get your kind assistance in my every birth. On the remembrance of your third death anniversary, we will have a ‘dhamma desana’ on May 13, followed by a ‘sangeeka dana’ on the following day at our Kottawa residence.
Our two daughters and their husbands, our two sons and their wives, all our granddaughters and grandsons and our sisters and brothers are joining hands with me to offer the merit of your good work and our aspiration for you is to attain Nibbana.
Non-Existence is nature
Nature is non-existence
Your ever-loving wife,
Nalini Jayanthi Fernando, Kottawa
Dawn Gooneratne death anniversary
In memory of my mum in heaven
If roses grew in heaven, Lord,please pick a bunch for me.Place them in my mother’s armsand tell her they’re from me.
Tell her that I love her and miss her,and when she turns to smile,place a kiss upon her cheekand hold her for a while.
Because remembering her is easy,I do it everyday,But there’s an ache within my heartthat will never go away
We love you Amma,
Dinesh Gooneratne and Anuri Dissanayake
