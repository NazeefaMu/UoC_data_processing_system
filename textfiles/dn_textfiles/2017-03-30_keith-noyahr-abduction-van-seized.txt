Keith Noyahr abduction van seized

A van suspected to have been used in the abduction of journalist Keith Noyahr was seized by the CID from a house in Piliyandala on Tuesday. Police Media Spokesman’s office said the house in Piliyandala belonged to a woman, who had been a friend of Army Major Bulawatta who is now in remand in connection with the kidnapping.
This van is believed to have been used for several crimes in the past including the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and the abduction of Keith Noyhar and other journalists.
Five suspects including an Army Intelligence Officer, and an army major arrested in connection with the abduction and torture of Keith Noyhar are now held in remand custody.
