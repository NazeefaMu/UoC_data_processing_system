Criminal gang busted

A group of seven suspects involved in various rackets, including poaching, illegal sand mining and robbery of cattle for slaughter, were rounded up by officers of the Galkiriyagama Wildlife Office during an operation in the Galkiriyagama forest range of the Kahalla Pallekelle reserve bordering the Anuradhapura, Matale and Kurunegala district on Tuesday. Galkiriyagama Wildlife Officer in Charge Dr. Ramasinghe said a stock of venison and body parts of deer, several firearms and ammunition rounds, torches, two tractor loads and a tipper load of sand and a lorry used to transport buffaloes were taken into custody along with the suspects.
Wild animals visiting waterways have become easy prey to poachers.
