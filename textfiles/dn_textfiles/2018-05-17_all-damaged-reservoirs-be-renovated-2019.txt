All damaged reservoirs to be renovated by 2019

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has directed the Agrarian Services Department to renovate all damaged reservoirs by the end of 2019.
According to the statistics of the Agrarian Services Department, there are 2,055 damaged reservoirs in the country.
“Considering the absence of sufficient rainfall during most of the cultivation season, we have decided to renovate the reservoirs to supply water to farmers without interruption,” Minister Amaraweera said.
He said the Agrarian Services Department expects to renovate around 1,500 reservoirs within this year at a cost of Rs. 1,000 million.
The Minister has also instructed the Agrarian Services Department authorities to purchase 10 Water-born Debris Collectors - Aquatic Weed Harvesters to remove invasive aquatic plants such as Salvinia, Water Hyacinth and Water Lettuce in the reservoirs.
