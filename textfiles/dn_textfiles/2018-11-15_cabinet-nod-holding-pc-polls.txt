Cabinet nod for holding PC polls

Cabinet approval has been granted for the conduct of the Provincial Council Elections under the former proportional representation method ensuring 25 percent female representation only for this time, Co-Cabinet Spokesman Port and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Speaking at the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday at the Government Information Department, Minister Samarasinghe said that the provision should be made promptly for Provincial Council Elections, since six out of nine Provincial Councils have already completed their official terms.
He said that the determination of electoral divisions which is essential for conducting elections under the Mixed Member Proportional Representation method introduced under the Provincial Council Elections Act No. 2 of 1988 amended by the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment Act) No 17 of 2017, has not been accomplished up to now. Considering the need to conduct Provincial Council Elections immediately, the Cabinet of Ministers approved this proposal presented by the Provincial Council, Local Government and Sports Minister Faizer Musthapa.
