Religious Perspectives
Happiness of spiritual service

We all may have some eagerness to achieve something. We will succeed in that or sometimes fail. If we succeed in that, we will be happy, if not we will not be happy.
Whatever our desired goals, which revolve around material possessions, maybe we won’t get any fruits for that. But when we wish to do something for God, whether we succeed in it or not, we will reap the fruits, the Sastras say.
Building a temple for God is described as a big service. Those who engage in that service, or helping for that in some way will be bright. If any of their ancestors are in hell, they also will be relieved from the sins they accumulated during the past seven births and achieve eternal bliss. This bliss is enjoyed in the abode of Lord Vishnu, the ‘Skandapurana’ says.
Building a temple for Lord Vishnu in Colombo is a long time dream of the devotees of Kotahena Sri Sri Radha Krishna temple. This dream is slowly being realized and now they are engaged in building a temple at 188, Newchetty Street, Colombo- 13.
The Construction work is at the final stage of completion. At present the sthapathy and construction workers are very busy to achieve early completion.
The main deities in the temple will be Sri Sri Radha Krishna, along with shrines for Sri Jagannath, Baladev, Subadra deities of Jagannath Puri, Sri Gaura Nitai deity, Sri Narasimha Deity, Lord Luxmi Venkadeswar Lord Ramachandra, Lord Hanuman Anjaneya , and Lord Sri Ranganathar.
The temple will feature dioramas of all the incarnations of Lord Vishnu, Dasavathara and many of Krishna’s pastimes.
His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta swami Prabhupada founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness with the purpose that he wanted all the temples built by the society should be as heaven on earth and the temples will fulfill all the spiritual education and cultural needs of everyone to bring peace and prosperity in the world. So the devotees of Lord Vishnu request all of them to engage in the spiritual service.
It is a very great opportunity to the well-wishers and devotees to contribute their part of service to the construction work as it is at the final stage of completion.
The devotees of Lord Vishnu pray for a bright future.
