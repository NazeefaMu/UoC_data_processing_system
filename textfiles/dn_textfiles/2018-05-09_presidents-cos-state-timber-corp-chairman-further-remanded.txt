President's CoS, State Timber Corp Chairman, further remanded

The President's former chief of staff and the former State Timber Corporation chairman, both of who were nabbed in a bribery scheme last week, have been further remanded in custody until May 22nd by Colombo Chief Magistrate Buddhika Sri Ragala today.
The accused in question, I.H.K. Mahanama and P. Dissanayake, respectively, were first arrested last Wednesday evening by officials from the Bribery Commission, who caught the men in the act of accepting a Rs. 20 million bribe from an Indian businessman in the parking lot of a high-end Colombo hotel.
Allegations claim that Mahanama and Dissanayake had solicited the bribe, originally totalling Rs. 540 million but bargained down to Rs. 100 million after negotiations between the parites, from the businessman on the condition that the two would aid the businessman in obtaining the proper approval required to attain certain machinery and building space he needed for projects.
