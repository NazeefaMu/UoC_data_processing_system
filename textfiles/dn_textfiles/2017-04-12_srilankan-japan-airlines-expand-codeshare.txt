SriLankan, Japan Airlines expand codeshare

SriLankan Airlines is strengthening its presence in the Japanese travel market through the expansion of its codeshare agreement with oneworld alliance partner Japan Airlines (JAL), to introduce six new routes and together provide passengers with seamless connectivity on an extraordinary choice of 84 flights a week between Japan and South Asia and beyond.
The six new routes (subject to requisite regulatory approvals) –Narita (Tokyo) / Bangkok, Narita (Tokyo) / Singapore, Narita (Tokyo) / Kuala Lumpur, Haneda (Tokyo) / Bangkok, Haneda (Tokyo) / Singapore, Narita (Tokyo) / New Delhi – are in addition to the existing four routes of Kansai (Osaka) / Bangkok, Nagoya / Bangkok, Nagoya / Narita (Tokyo) and Itami (Osaka) / Narita (Tokyo) - and will create new choice travel options to South Asia for travellers in more cities across Japan. These flights will be operated on JAL aircraft with both JAL and SriLankan flight numbers.
Accordingly, passengers can connect to Colombo and on to any destination in SriLankan’s global route network on SriLankan flights from Bangkok, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, New Delhi and Tokyo. This includes the Maldives, a highly popular vacation destination among Japanese tourists. SriLankan is the only international airline operating to Gan Island in the southern end of the Maldives and is also the airline with the highest number of frequencies to the Maldives. JAL will place its code on SriLankan flights to Colombo from Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi, in addition to its current codeshares on SriLankan flights on the Narita (Tokyo) / Colombo Bangkok / Colombo and Colombo / Male sectors.
