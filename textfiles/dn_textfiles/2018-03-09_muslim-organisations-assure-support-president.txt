Muslim organisations assure support to President

The leaders of Muslim organisations extended their fullest support to President Maithripala Sirisena to establish a peaceful atmosphere conducive to all Sri Lankans to live in peace and harmony.
These sentiments were expressed during a meeting held by the President, with the members of Muslim organisations yesterday, at the President’s Office to discuss the current situation prevailing in the country.
The President, pointing out that only a small group of extremist elements were responsible for riots, explained to the representatives that arresting them and taking legal action against them is already in process.
President Sirisena said the government has already taken all required measures to build a peaceful country for all to live in peace and harmony.
The Muslim representatives expressed their deep concern over the troubling incidents that occurred in several areas in the Kandy district and asked President Sirisena to take all steps to prevent such clashes, irrespective of religious or ethnic identities of culprits.
They expressed confidence that only President Sirisena could implement a long-term solution in order to ensure such clashes would not occur again and find a lasting solution to the issue during the tenure of the President.
The Muslim representatives added that legal action must be taken against individuals who are engaging in such anti-social acts without considering their positions. They also urged the President not to allow social media outlets to arouse any ethnic animosity through false propaganda.
The leaders of All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU) and members of the Muslim Civil Society were present at the gathering.
