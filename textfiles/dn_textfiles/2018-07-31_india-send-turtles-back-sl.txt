India to send turtles back to SL

The Forest Department in Tamil Nadu plans to send back a consignment of exotic turtles, mostly red-eared sliders, which was seized from a passenger at the airport recently, The New Indian Express said in a Trichy-datelined report.
According to sources, officials are planning to send the turtles back to Sri Lanka from where they came.
Sources added that SriLankan Airlines also failed to notice the consignment carrying the turtles during security check with the reptiles kept in different boxes inside a stroller bag. Last year, Customs nabbed another Sri Lankan passenger with 3,000 red-eared sliders at Chennai International Airport. In many cases, the Forest Department was helpless in taking tough action against such illegal acts as these non-native species are not listed under the scheduled lists of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
These turtles are popularly known as Singapore turtles or American turtles in the pet market in India, and are widely imported without proper documents as many people believe that they bring luck.
The growing demand for these exotic species has encouraged many people to illegally import these reptiles from illegally operating breeding units in several Asian countries. “These baby turtles would be brought from a captive breeding facility as most of them are of the same size. Otherwise, it is impossible to get this many turtles of similar size,” said Muralidharan M, an eminent turtle biologist and marine researcher.
Even in this case, experts confirmed that the Forest Department will be able to take action against the passenger only for importing it without proper documents.
