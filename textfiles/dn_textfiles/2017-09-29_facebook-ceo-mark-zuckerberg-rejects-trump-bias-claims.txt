Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg rejects Trump bias claims

The US president accused the social network of “collusion” on Twitter, branding it “anti-Trump”.
He made the same claim against the New York Times and the Washington Post. Facebook will shortly hand over 3,000 political adverts to congressional investigators probing alleged Russian meddling in the US election.
The site believes the ads were probably purchased by Russian entities during and after the 2016 presidential contest.
Facebook, Twitter and Google have been asked to testify before the US Senate Intelligence Committee on 1 November about the allegations of Russian interference.
Facebook and Google have confirmed they have received invitations to attend the committee hearing, but none of the social media giants have yet said they will be present.
Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear in the past that he doesn't like Donald Trump - or at least, his policies.
This statement shows frustration, I think. Not just with the president, but at the atmosphere swirling around Facebook at the moment - commentary that is painting it as a burden on the electoral process, and maybe even on society as a whole.
He's trying to show all the good - as he sees it - that Facebook has done.
He feels hard done by. And as a man obsessed by data and metrics, he's probably looking at the problem of Russian-backed fake news ads and seeing it as a minuscule part of all the election goings-on on his network of 2 billion people. But it's not the scale that's the issue here - but his immature refusal to face up to the public's concerns. It was less cover up, more can't-be-bothered.
