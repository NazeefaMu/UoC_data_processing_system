The Divine Plan

As we would learn from the Scriptures, the Blessed Trinity existed before the beginning of time and had done much in respect from the beginning of time. The early chapters of the Book of Genesis contain references to God, the Eternal Word and the Holy Spirit, as being divine entities in the composition of the Blessed Trinity with joint and several responsibilities (Gen. 1: 2; 1:26).
They created the world in a state of perfection and brought mankind into existence to dwell in it. God who had His own divine prerogative placed them in a salubrious garden in serene conditions, where they lived in blissful happiness. God communicated with them from time to time in the harmonious relationship that existed with them. The serpent did not wish that the abiding relationship they had with God should continue. He tempted and misled them to disobey God which depraved them with sin. This sin severed the sublime relationship they had with Him and also made an adverse impact on the world. God was perturbed that they had fallen victims to the serpent’s intrigue, but as He loved them, He did not abandon them. His justice and generosity towards them prevailed. He promised a Saviour to purify the generations of mankind to come (Gen. 3:15).
God’s focus was therefore on mankind. It was His intention to help them to live their lives even in the changed and difficult conditions of the world. He communicated with them through His Prophets to tell them what He intended to do for them. Centuries later, He conveyed a prophecy through Prophet Isaiah to a king named Ahaz. The content of the prophecy was “The Virgin is with child and will bear a son and call his name Emmanuel” (Is. 7:14). It was not well understood by the people when it was given, but in later times the people themselves knew that it referred to a Saviour promised by God for whom they were waiting with unceasing hopes. However, they were mistaken about what the Saviour would do for them. They expected the Saviour to be a person of gallantry who would help them in their secular and material lives. They did not know that God was concerned not about their lives in this world but their lives after death.
The crux of God’s plan however, was to save mankind from sin because He did not want them to live in the culpability of sin for all time. In doing so, He wanted them to attain spiritual excellence in this life which was possible only if they avoided sin and pleased Him. However, they had to be taught a new way of life to do this and that was to come. Besides this, mankind had to be redeemed of sin, not by mankind, but by someone who was different from them and above them in spiritual attribution. He chose His Son, the Eternal Word, to be the catalyst to bring salvation to mankind.
John says in chapter one of his Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was with God and the Word was God: He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him and without him nothing came to be” (Jn. 1:1-3). The Word had a distinct existence and was Himself uncreated and eternal.
As God wanted mankind to be a part of His plan to save them, He chose a virgin named Mary of Nazareth to accomplish His plan. She was the first human to know about the Word and that was at the annunciation of His birth. An angel of God said to her: “Do not fear, Mary, for God has looked kindly on you. You shall conceive and bear a son and you shall call him Jesus. He will be great and shall rightly be called Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the Kingdom of David, his ancestor; he will rule over the people of Jacob forever and his reign shall have no end” (Lk. 1: 30-33); “The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the holy child to be born shall be called Son of God” (Lk. 1:35).
This divine message explained everything that was to take place. She conceived the Holy Child by the power of the Holy Spirit as she agreed with God’s proposition. The conception confirmed the truth of Isaiah’s prophecy (Is. 7:14).
And it so happened that while shepherds were camping in the country side, taking turns to watch over their flocks by night, an angel of God appeared to them with the glory of the Lord shining around them. As they were terrified, the angel said to them “Don’t be afraid; I am here to give you Good News of great joy for all the people. Today a Saviour has been born to you in David’s town; he is the Messiah and the Lord. Let this be a sign to you; you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger” (Lk. 2:8-12). Suddenly many more angels joined him, praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth for God is blessing humankind” (Lk. 2:13-14).
The shepherds hastened to visit the location in Bethlehem in search of the Child and found Him with His parents in a cave. All those around were astonished when the shepherds told them what they had seen and heard.
This was how God fulfilled His promise to bring a Saviour to this world to save mankind from sin for all time.
