Road needs repairs

The road passing through the Nagahavidiya village requires immediate repairs as it often becomes inundated during inclement weather. Aside from residents, pilgrims are also inconvenienced by the state of the road as they use it when travelling to Kataragama. Picture by M. Nelson Piyaratne, Kataragama Group Corr.
