Donald Trump projected to win the Nevada Republican caucuses

Donald Trump will win the Nevada Republican caucuses, CNN projects, expanding his dominance in the early GOP contests despite the well-organized campaigns of his two chief rivals: Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. The results in Nevada, a state with complex caucus rules and unreliable voter data, were yet another sign of how Trump's momentum is sweeping the country. He heads into the Super Tuesday contests riding high in the polls and maintaining a wide lead over the other GOP contenders in the delegate count.
Trump, who has campaigned on a hard-line immigration platform including a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, is winning Latino caucusgoers in Nevada. Entrance polls indicated Latinos made up 9% of the electorate and 44% of them planned to back Trump. Cruz and Rubio had campaigned aggressively in Nevada, but were largely engaged in a fight for second place as they try to consolidate Trump-averse Republican voters around them. Cruz has attempted to cobble together a coalition of evangelical and libertarian voters, while Rubio has argued that he is the most electable of the GOP candidates. Knowing that time is running short to overtake Trump, Cruz targeted Trump on Tuesday with his sharpest attacks yet. "Look, I frankly don't care what position Donald decides to support today, tomorrow or the next day.
They change every day. I don't care what they are. But pick one and defend it and don't pretend that whenever people suddenly point out what you said, 'Oh, never mind.' And look, part of the reason someone vacillates from position to position to position is they're not starting from a core set of principles and beliefs," Cruz said. Trump, in turn, sharply ridiculed Cruz. "I've met much tougher people than Ted Cruz. He is like a little baby compared to some of the people I have to deal with. He is like a little baby: soft, weak, little baby by comparison."(CNN)
