Export crops cultivation in Anuradhapura promoted

The Export Agriculture Department has taken steps to encourage farmers in Anuradhapura to engage in export crops cultivation.
The Anuradhapura District Export Agriculture Extension Officer said the programme was now going on successfully in the Thambuttegama, Ipalogama, Rambewa, and Galenbindunu Wewa DS Divisions.
Over 15,000 areca nut plants will be distributed among farmers under a special project in the initial cultivation promotion zone in Anuradhapura, he said.
Phase one of the programme includes management of plant nurseries. Over 51 plant nurseries were registered by July, he said. The programme targets to distribute 55,000 areca nut, 210,000 cinnamon and 48,400 pepper plants among the farmers.
Seed, planting materials and extension services will be provided with the farmers for free, he said. Under the Dhana Saviya programme, housewives are encouraged to cultivate pepper, cinnamon and areca nut.
Over 1,900 have applied for plants and 10,251 pepper and 1,100 areca nut plants were issued, he said.
