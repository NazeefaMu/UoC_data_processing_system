SL to cultivate Vannamei prawns

The country has decided to cultivate the Vannamei prawn which has the highest demand and price in Europe, Japan and USA.
With the new cultivation the country plans to increase the fisheries export to USD 750 million by 2020 which is USD 280 million at present.
A sum of USD 70 million has already been decided to be invested in the country by one investor while another number of investors have already come forward to make their investments.
Following a discussion with Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economic Affairs State Minister Dilip Wedarachchi, Taproban Sea Food Group has expressed their willingness first to invest USD 70 million in the industry.
Minister and the State Minister made a site visit to Mannar and Northern Province to observe the lands identified by the National Aquaculture Development Authority and the investors for the cultivation.
Around 3,000 acres in Northern Province have been identified suitable for the cultivation and expects around 10,000 employment opportunities would be created for the people in the area.
The NARA would submit its report on the suitability of the lands identified for the cultivation by August 31 and the projects would be commenced thereafter.
