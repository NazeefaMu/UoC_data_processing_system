Housing Minister commissions Waya Ulpatha model village

The fifth model village named Waya Ulpatha, which was planned under the Anuradhapura housing development project, was commissioned by Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, recently. The said model village is located in the Palugaswewa Divisional Secretariat (DS) Division of the Anuradhapura district. The Waya Ulpatha model village consists of 25 well-equipped new houses and each family had been provided with a low-interest loan facility amounting to Rs. 300,000.
Minister Sajith Premadasa, addressing the public rally following the inauguration of the model village, said the government’s mission and vision in housing construction, was not politically motivated and was solely designed for the purpose of providing permanent housing facilities for underprivileged families within the country.
According to recent surveys, it had been found that currently in Sri Lanka, 227,523 houses are only half-done, while 1,340,928 families lack proper housing facilities. The government built 40 model villages during 2015, while 197 such model villages were constructed in 2016, the minister added.
“During last year, we commenced construction work for 2,016 model villages and within the period of 2015 – 2017, 15,656 new houses were built in those model villages. A sum of Rs. 5.998 million was allocated for this purpose. Under the national housing programme during 2015 – 2017, 256,169 families had become entitled for housing benefits. The government spent Rs. 16.412 million for this programme. This year, the government has allocated Rs. 12 million for housing development activities,” Minister Premadasa said.
The minister further said he was pleased to witness that the housing development programmes in the Anuradhapura district had become a success. So far, 43 model villages had been put up and out of them, five model villages had been commissioned. Minister Premadasa added that it was planned to construct 100 model villages within the Anuradhapura district during this year and hence, he requested the support and dedication of relevant officials and stakeholders, to achieve the said target.
At the ceremony, the minister awarded housing loan cheques to 300 families under the kidney patients’ housing aid project, Wisiri loan scheme and the Sampath Sevana loan facility programme. It was also revealed that within next few weeks, model villages constructed at Kudagama, the Nuwaragam Palatha East DS Division and Ihala Galktiyagama in the Medawachchiya DS Division, would be commissioned as well.
Women and Child Affairs Minister and Member of Parliament Chandrani Bandara, Parliamentarians Chandima Gamage and Ishak Rahuman, along with National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) Chairman Lakwijaya Sagara Palansooriya and Anuradhapura NHDA Senior Manager Devika Wijerathne were also present at the event.
