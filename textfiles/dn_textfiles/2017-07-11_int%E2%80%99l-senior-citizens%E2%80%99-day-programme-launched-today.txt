Int’l Senior Citizens’ Day programme launched today

Month-long fundraising campaign:
The National Secretariat for Elders will celebrate the International Senior Citizens’ Day with a month-long flag pinning fundraising campaign throughout the island from today.
The campaign starts after the pinning the first two flags on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to mark the Day at the Presidential Secretariat.
“This will be a campaign to show our love and care to the elderly,” Social Empowerment Welfare and Kandy Heritage Minister S B Dissanayaka said. The organisations and institutions offering services to the elderly population will sell the International Senior Citizens’ Day flags to the people from today to August 10.
A portion of the funds raised through the campaign will be imparted to organisations servicing the elderly. The balance will go to the Elders’ Security Fund of the National Secretariat for Elders, the minister said.
It is expected to raise Rs. 6 million through the Senior Citizens’ flag pinning campaign, he said.
“We raised Rs. 5 million last year,” Minister Dissanayaka said.
