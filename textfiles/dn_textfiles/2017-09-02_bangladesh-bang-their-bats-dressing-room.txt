Bangladesh bang their bats in dressing room

To celebrate first Test victory over Australia:
After spinning Australia out and recording a famous 20-run Test win in Dhaka, Bangladesh’s players celebrated in percussive fashion by creating an almighty racket in the dressing room.
The home side went 1-0 up in the two-match series with with Shakib Al Hasan’s second five-wicket haul of the game inspiring them to their first Test victory over Australia.
Mustafizur Rahman shared the jubilant celebrations on Twitter, as Bangladesh formed a musical ensemble in the pavilion - chanting and banging their bats against a container.
Australia have now won just two of 23 Tests in the sub continent, despite the best efforts of opener David Warner who top scored with a brilliant 112.
Set 265 for victory, the tourists battled to 244 all-out on a wearing pitch but lost a well-fought match that confounds the theory that Test cricket is dying in the region.
“Obviously a great feeling, beating Australia.
A great effort by the boys, especially Shakib and Tamim were outstanding,” Mushfiqur Rahim said at the post-match presentation.
“If you look at our home performance, it has been pretty consistent.
Against England (last year) also, we were very close in the first test and beat them in the second test. That’s the belief we have.
“I think the spinners did a great job. I thought Taijul (Islam), Miraj (Mehidy Hasan) and Shakib bowled really well in both the innings (but) I think Tamim-Shakib partnership in the first innings set up the game for us.” Mushfiqur said the lower order woes that prevented Bangladesh from driving home their first-innings advantage showed there was plenty of room for improvement.
“The lower order is working hard and if you see at the last few series, they are much better now,” he said.
“In this test, the wicket was pretty tough to bat on, that has to be said, because the top order also found it difficult to bat.
“The boys showed character. All the credit goes to the bowlers, and fielders.
They did miss some (catches) but it can happen.
Hopefully we’ll come harder at them in the next test and hopefully we’ll seal the series.” – The Telegraph
