Pure digital fantasy at its best

‘Smurfs: The Lost Village’ is a 2017 American 3D computer-animated adventure-comedy film produced by Sony Pictures Animation. It is written by Stacey Harman and Pamela Ribon, and directed by Kelly Asbury.
In this fully animated, all-new take on the Smurfs, best friends Smurfette (Demi Lovato), Brainy (Danny Pudi), Clumsy (Jack McBrayer) and Hefty (Joe Manganiello) use a special mysterious map that guides them through an exciting race through the Forbidden Forest, an enchanted wonderland that’s filled with magical creatures.
Their adventure leads them on a course to discover the biggest secret in Smurf history as they race against time and the evil wizard Gargamel (Rainn Wilson). They find a mysterious lost village, inhabited by SmurfStorm (voiced by Michelle Rodriguez), SmurfBlossom (Ellie Kemper), SmurfLily (Ariel winter) SmurfWillow (Julia Roberts) and many more before Gargamel does.
Fast-paced, colorful and fashionably girl-powered fun, it is perfect entertainment for younger kids.
