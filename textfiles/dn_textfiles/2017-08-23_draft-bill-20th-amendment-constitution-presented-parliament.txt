Draft Bill on 20th Amendment to the Constitution presented to Parliament

 
 The Government today in Parliament presented the 20th Amendment to the Constitution to provide for the holding of elections for all provincial councils on the same date.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake presented the Amendment Bill for the first reading. 
The Bill also seeks to take over the powers of provincial councils when they stand dissolved.
The Amendment seeks to insert a new clause to the Constitution stating, ‘the election of members to all Provincial Councils shall be held on the same date and Parliament shall determine the date on which all the Provincial Councils shall stand dissolved; provided specified date shall not be later than the expiration of the term of the last constituted Provincial Council.’
