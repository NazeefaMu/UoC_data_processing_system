Art of friendship

Friendship can at times be one of the most difficult aspects of our lives while at other times the most helpful. In Buddhism, friendship is an extremely important factor, perhaps even more so than you might expect.
Whatever kind of life you have, your friends are both a part of it and a reflection of it. Work or school associates, sports teammates, companions in religious community – in all of these, there is some degree of choice. You accept a job, join a team, or become a member of a social group; and you choose how closely to associate with the people in each group. Even in your family, you choose how close or distant to be with individual members.
Within each of these affiliation groups, there may be people you’d like to know better and there may be others you’d like to avoid spending time with. How do you choose which people fall into which category? Do you like the ones who seem to like you? Or the people you consider the most physically attractive? Are you drawn to people you consider thoughtful, or wise and helpful? Do you passively wait to be contacted, by anyone at all? Somehow, by some sorting method, you end up with friends and acquaintances that influence you and whom you influence.
This brief article is concerned with how you choose friends according to the Buddhist point of view.
Qualities
In the Upaddha Sutta, Ven. Ananda approached the Buddha and remarked that "half of the life is based on admirable friendship, admirable companionship and admirable association with the good." to which the Buddha replied, “Ven. Ananda, do not say so. Not half, but one's entire life is established on friendship, companionship and association with the good. When a Bhikkhu has admirable people as friends, companions, and comrades, he can be expected to develop and pursue the noble eightfold path.”
In the Mitta Sutta, the Buddha tells his monks to seek out friends with seven qualities: "Monks, a friend endowed with seven qualities is worth associating with. Which seven? He gives what is hard to give. He does what is hard to do. He endures what is hard to endure. He reveals his secrets to you. He keeps your secrets. When misfortunes strike, he doesn't abandon you. When you're down & out, he doesn't look down on you. A friend endowed with these seven qualities is worth associating with."
The reader would notice there is no mention of being well-versed in the Dhamma, mastery of meditation, or possessing great wisdom. Friendship, the Buddha knew, is far more foundational, far more simple.
Samannaphala Sutta
Buddhist perspective on friends is indicated in several places in Buddhist literature. One such instance is in the Samananaphala Sutta. The friendly nature among the Bhikkhus towards each other was so admirable that King Ajatasattu had remarked that "the Bhikkhus live in unity talking to each other with mutual friendliness .... mixing with each other like milk and water and seeing each other with pleasing eyes," and had even gone further and said, "How nice it would be if my son Udayabhadda too could possess these friendly qualities."
Dighajanu Sutta
According to Buddhist discourses "companionship with the wise" leads to many developmental progression: listening to good advice, rational faith, noble thoughts, clear thinking, self-control, good conduct, conquest of the hindrances, gaining of wisdom and the consequent liberation.
The Buddha provides the following elaboration in the Dighajanu Sutta : 'And what is meant by admirable friendship? There is the case where a lay person, in whatever town or village he may dwell, spends time with householders or householders' sons, young or old, who are advanced in virtue. He talks with them, engages them in discussions. He emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction, consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue, consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity, and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment. This is called admirable friendship.'
Sigalovada Sutra
The Buddha's advice regarding friends could also be well grasped by absorbing the contents of the Sigalovada Sutra. “These four, young householder, should be understood as foes in the guise of friends:(1) he who appropriates a friend's possessions, (2) he who renders lip-service, (3) he who flatters, (4) he who brings ruin
1) "In four ways, young householder, should one who appropriates be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend: (i) he appropriates his friend's wealth, (ii) he gives little and asks much, (iii) he does his duty out of fear, (iv) he associates for his own advantage.
(2) "In four ways, young householder, should one who renders lip-service be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend: (i) he makes friendly profession as regards the past, (ii) he makes friendly profession as regards the future, (iii) he tries to gain one's favour by empty words, (iv) when opportunity for service has arisen, he expresses his inability.
(3) "In four ways, young householder, should one who flatters be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend: (i) he approves of his friend's evil deeds, (ii) he disapproves his friend's good deeds, (iii) he praises him in his presence, (iv) he speaks ill of him in his absence.
(4) "In four ways, young householder, should one who brings ruin be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend: (i) he is a companion in indulging in intoxicants that cause infatuation and heedlessness, (ii) he is a companion in sauntering in streets at unseemly hours, (iii) he is a companion in frequenting theatrical shows, (iv) he is a companion in indulging in gambling which causes heedlessness."
Next, the Buddha explains that a good friend is a helpmate, does not change in happiness or sorrow and gives only good counsel and sympathizes when something goes wrong.
Friendship is a force that has no parallel; there is no other single power that can generate good qualities in a person as friendship with the good because, after a certain age children stop emulating their parents and start imitating their friends.
How to win Friendship
A Buddhist must understand how to win and keep friends. By being kind and generous you can win friends and also by being courteous and benevolent. Rejoice in a friend's achievements, praise any commendable acts and strong points. But if you always keep on talking of your friend's goodness, kindness, greatness and so on, then you are trying to deceive him. In dealing with friends, one's word should be as clean as the actions.
Buddha has given invaluable advice not only to keep the friendship but also to make the bonds stronger. One should not visit the friends too often or overstay the welcome. It is equally bad not to visit your friends at all. You should judge for yourself how often you should visit your friend, how long you should stay and so on.
A friendship deteriorates by asking favours, especially at wrong times. If at all you ask a favour, it should not be unreasonable or of a demanding nature. Asking favours far too often makes you a pest more than a friend.
Basic ingredients
In this manner, Buddhism points out the basic ingredients to foster a healthy friendship, minimize friction and displeasure, promote good-will, and companionship and ultimately bring about one's welfare here, and spiritual progress leading to the realization of the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana. The foregoing facts show that Buddha's word of advice regarding how to choose friends, win them and keep them expounded over 2580 years ago surpasses all books of the past few centuries on this subject and the Buddhist concept of friendship remains a vibrant force forever.
