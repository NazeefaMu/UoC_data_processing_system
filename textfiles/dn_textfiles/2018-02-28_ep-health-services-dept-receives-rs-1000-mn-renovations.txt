EP Health Services Dept. receives Rs. 1,000 mn for renovations

A sum of Rs. 1,000 million had been allocated for the renovation of the Eastern Province (EP) Health Services Department and its equipment, last year, Deputy Health Minister Faizal Cassim said.
He was addressing the opening ceremony of the Eastern Province Health Services Training Institute constructed at a cost of Rs. 34 million at the Thiraimadu Tsunami resettlement area in Batticaloa, recently (25).
The deputy Health minister further said, “We are able to initiate various important programmes in the heath sector of the Eastern Province under the guidance of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratna. Even though such a large sum is not permitted to be allocated to a provincial council, it was due to the personal efforts of Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratna that this endeavour was made possible.
The plan to improve health services for the next 25 years have been drawn up and are being implemented under the Good Governance government. “Before this government finishes its term, we shall implement the proposed plan in the Eastern Province. We are planning a propose to the government that the faulty equipment be repaired in the Eastern Province itself, without being sent to Colombo. At present, in addition to the long period of time taken for repairs, a lot of money is also spent for sending equipment out of the province for repairs,” he added. Health Services Director General Anil Jeyasinghe, Provincial Director M. Murukanantham, Batticaloa Government Agent M. Uthayakumar, provincial secretaries and Department heads were also present.
