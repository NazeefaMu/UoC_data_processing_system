3DH Energy Solutions launches Mersen Surge Arresters in Sri Lanka

3DH Energy Solutions, the power and energy solutions arm of the 3DH International Group, launched Mersen Surge Arrestors at a launch event held at the Movenpick Hotel Colombo recently.
Based in France, Mersen is a global leader in overvoltage protection devices and offers a comprehensive line of surge protection devices, components and systems. The surge arrester devices launched by 3DH are primarily for PV solar systems and telecommunication towers. The Mersen surge arresters guaranteed protection from power surges caused by lightning strikes. In the event of a lightning strike, the short response time of the device ensures that all the electrical equipment within the premises is well-protected.
As electricity prices continue to rise, Sri Lanka is witnessing an increase in the use of renewable energy, primarily in solar PV systems.
This is evident in the over 250 solar PV companies operating across the island today. Customers are encouraged by the decreasing initial investment for solar PV while the year-round sunshine in most parts of the island makes it an ideal renewable energy solution. However, protecting these expensive systems from the frequent lightning encountered during the monsoon and inter-monsoon thunderstorms is vital.
With the Mersen surge arresters from 3DH Energy Solutions, solar PV companies can provide the best possible safety equipment to their customers. All Mersen products come with a lifetime warranty with ample stocks available throughout the year.
Addressing the audience at the launch event, Dinuk Hettiarachchi - Chairman of 3DH International Group stated, “We are proud to launch a world-class lightning protection product here in Sri Lanka. This alliance aligns with our Vision to be ‘the partner of choice for international corporations in Sri Lanka’. With solar PV systems expanding rapidly across the island, it is crucial that customers take into account the risk to these expensive systems from power surges caused by lightning strikes. By using Mersen products, they have peace of mind as they are guaranteed of world-class, fail-safe technology that come with a lifetime warranty.”
3DH International Group was founded by 4 dynamic individuals with a goal of creating a successful value-based business conglomerate. Today, the Group has expanded into many sectors including Oil and Gas, Aviation, Power and Energy, BPO, Advertising and Marketing, Telecommunication, Insurance, International Trade, Real Estate, Leisure and Information Technology.
