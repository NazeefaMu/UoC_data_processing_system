Suspects arrested for possession of cocaine further remanded

Seven suspects arrested with 1.816 kg of cocaine were yesterday further remanded until February 15 by the Colombo Fort Acting Magistrate J. Trotsky. The suspects ordered to be remanded are: Abdul Abbas Husain, Timothy Denis Wangbow, Noni Vike Abdeen Iqbal, Francis Okelow, Onwara Sunday Vinindu and Notheen Seik.
The court had refused to grant bail to the suspects since the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) had not concluded investigations.
The magisterial inquiry was fixed for March 21.
