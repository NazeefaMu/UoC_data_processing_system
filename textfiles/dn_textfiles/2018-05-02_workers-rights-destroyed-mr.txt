Workers rights destroyed- MR

The present government is destroying the workers’ rights one by one which is evident from the denial to celebrate the Workers Day on May 1,” former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was speaking at the T.B Ilangarathna commemoration ceremony.
“The May Day rally of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna which will be held in Galle would be a massive success. We haven’t invited the 16 SLFP members yet. But, there is plenty of time to invite them,” Rajapaksa said.
“The present government cannot rescue this country from the mess it is in by any reshuffle,” Rajapaksa said when inquired about his views on the Cabinet reshuffle.
