SPEAKER ON BOND REPORT RUMPUS:
Bogus claims tarnishing country

Due to various malicious and false statements being made based on the Bond report, the reputation of not only the MPs and Parliament, but even the reputation of the whole country is in jeopardy, said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, issuing a special statement with regard to statements and reports based on the Bond report.
“Initially, someone had concocted a false list and said there were 118 MPs’ names on it, but now it has increased to 166. Not stopping at that, now they have leveled allegations against some reputed civil society figures as well. Therefore, I urge everyone, including the media to stop those malicious and baseless allegations immediately.
“I have requested the President’s Secretary to provide me with all the relevant documentation pertaining to the Bond report immediately, and he would do so with the cooperation of the Attorney General and the IGP as soon as he returns to the island,” said the Speaker in his statement.
He noted that all relevant divisions had notified him that there was no list of any MP who had obtained any money from PTL.
“Moreover, the Police have also notified me that there is no truth in the news being published that 25 ministerial security personnel had been questioned.
“It is with deep regret that I note the carnage that was created in the country due to a false report that a sterilisation pill was found in a bowl of curry served in Ampara. “Hence, I point out that this current situation is also as unhealthy for the country. Since yesterday, a huge social agitation has been noticed, with a highly unnecessary request for MPs to issue affidavits and calls for them to go before the media and pledge that they had not accepted any money from PTL. No matter what allegations are levelled against us, we must be true to our conscience,” Speaker Jayasuriya said. If such incidents such as those alleged are reported, the Speaker noted that the Police will definitely take necessary measures to address them. Hence, he urged all relevant parties to act with responsibility and diligence, including the media.
