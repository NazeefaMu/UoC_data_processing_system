PARLIAMENT

 
Previous regime’s attempt at reconciliation:
Sending tri forces personnel before War Tribunal - PM
The previous government attempted to build up reconciliation by sending members of the Tri Forces personnel before a war tribunal, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickemesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He further said the previous government promised UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon in May 2009, that the government was ready to send the Tri Forces members before the War Tribunal and promised the same to Darushaman. “But when the leaders realised that they too would have to go before the tribunal they opposed against it,” Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier also said that when President Maithripala Sirisena joined them, such matters were changed and there was no issue of a war tribunal. “Now we have the process of truth and reconciliation.”
He made these observations yesterday to a question raised by Opposition Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa during the round of questions for oral answers. MP Wimal Weerawansa questioned whether an institution has been established by the name of Task Force for National Reconciliation. National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister Niroshan Perera answered in the negative. MP Weerawansa then queried whether the media reports were false that former President Chandrika Kumaratunga was the executive of the same institution.
At this stage the Premier stated that the Minister had answered to the question positively and queried if MP Weerawansa objected to the reconciliation process. “You can clarify it from former President Chandrika Kumarathunge, as she is one of your friends. You earlier set up a government with her. Didn’t you? If you need it, I will ask it from her and let you know.”
“She was an old friend of us. But now she is a new friend of yours,” Weerawansa said. “No, we used to learn dancing together. Such was our past whatever the political differences we have,” the Premier said. He also challenged Wimal Weerawansa to express if he had any objections to the reconciliation process.
Wimal Weerawansa said it was the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa who commenced the reconciliation process after uniting the nation. He warned not to mislead Parliament. He also said that the previous government did not agree to produce the members of the Tri Forces before the war tribunal. He said Sinhalese students in the Jaffna University are being assaulted by Tamil students and was the reconciliation brought about by this government, adding that he would not ask any more questions.
Premier Wickramasinghe said that it could be clarified when studying what the previous government agreed to Ban Ki Moon and what Mohan Peiris said to Darushaman.
He also queried as to what happens if some one attempt to build up reconciliation if Weerawansa did not object reconciliation.
He added that it did not matter if it was former President Chandrika Kumarathunga or Mhinda Rajapaks who attempt to build up reconciliation. Premier also invited MP Weerawansa to join to build up reconciliation if he wished.
‘CEB losses due to issues in coal supply by Noble Resources Ltd’
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has incurred heavy losses due to the issues in coal supply by Noble Resources Ltd., until 2015, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said in Parliament yesterday.
He was making a ministerial statement on the controversy surrounding the coal procurement tender for the year 2015.
Citing several examples, the Minister said ‘Nobel Resources’ had supplied coal at higher prices than the index price in 2011, resulting in heavy losses several times due to non-supply of the required amount of coal.
The minister said the shortage of coal resulted in either shutting down the Lakvijaya power plant or by purchasing coal at higher prices from Taurian without following proper tender procedures over the past years. The Minister said 2015 was the only year where the Lakvijaya plant received the required stocks of coal without any shortage under supplier Swiss Singapore Ltd.
“Nobel Resources had secured the coal procurement tender on five occasions until 2015. However, on all these occasions, the said company had never been selected by the Tender Board, but by a Cabinet paper or by the Procurement Appeal Board. The company had made it a habit to create a coal shortage when the next tender was about to be given. The CEB, the Ministry and the Cabinet have been forced to give the tender to the same company to avoid a coal shortage,” he said.
The minister, commenting on the tender for the year 2015, said it was decided to obtain 50 percent of the coal requirement through ‘spot tenders,’ while the balance 50 percent by a long term tender. He said the purpose of this system was to break the monopoly in coal supply. He said several loopholes in the criteria followed when selecting the suitable company for long term tenders, have been identified. He pointed out that hardly any country considered the “size of coal” as a criteria in offering coal procurement tenders, adding that this error should be rectified immediately.
He said the tender for the year 2015, was called in November 2014, adding that giving it to Swiss Singapore over Noble Resources, had saved Rs 1,100 million to the CEB. The minister also pointed out that the calculation of Rs 1,803 million loss was misleading.
“Some had compared the index price of US$ 58 to the ‘spot tender’ price of US$ 51.25 and showed the difference of US$ 6.75 as a loss. This is not correct. We obtained the Attorney General’s advice on the Supreme Court decision on the matter. While following his advice, we will make sure the best decision beneficial to the country would be taken in this regard,” he commented.
The minister further said that he expected the report of the tri-member committee he appointed to look in to the matter before July 29, adding that the final decisions would be made after studying the report.
“We will take action if there has been any fault in the procedure taken. It is equally important to make an in-depth observation to find out whether the officials made those decisions honestly and justly,” he concluded.
MR had appointed 250  consultants to projects under RDA - Minister Kiriella
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has appointed 250 consultants to various projects under the Road Development Authority, said Leader of the House, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
He said that it was highly questionable as to why the Opposition queried about the consultants who were duly appointed, without questioning of previous appointments. He said that not a single investigation was held on the appointments made under the previous government.
He made these observations in response to a question raised by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa.
The Minister said that he would look into the matter that two from the same family had been appointed as consultants of projects under the Road Development Authority when Nalinda Jayatissa said that Savinda Samarasooriya and Cyril Samarasooriya of the same family have been appointed as consultants.
The Minister promised to provide a detailed answer to the MP on a later date with regard to reasons for recruiting a monk when MP Jayatissa inquired of the appointment of a bhikku as a consultant of the RDA.
Responding to the MP’s question, the number of consultants recruited to the Southern Transport Development Project of the RDA, the Minister said it was 56.
“We have won the Presidential election with an 81,000 lead and the General election with a lead of 131,000 in Kandy with the support of these people. We have to do something in return for them,” the Minister said. He said the appointments are for a period of one year.
MP Jayatissa said that each consultant was entitled to a monthly allowance of Rs 25,000 and a transport allowance of Rs 40,000. He added that some possessed only GCE (O/L) as qualifications.
Measures to be taken to fill 8,388 public service vacancies  - Minister Karunathilake
As at present, there are 8,388 vacancies to be filled in the Public Service, Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by UNP MP S M Marikkar. Minister Karunathilake replied on behalf of the Public Administration and Management Minister.
He said measures would be taken to recruit unemployed graduates to fill those vacancies in the near future. However, the Minister said recruitment to Development Officers position had been halted for the moment until a review was done as of a Cabinet decision taken in March.
He said a committee headed by the Public Administration and Management Ministry had been appointed for this purpose and Development Officers would be relocated to make their service more productive.
He said that there were 207 vacancies at present in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, 178 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Scientific Service, 18 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Architects Service, 147 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Engineering Service, 184 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Accountants’ Service, 137 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Planning Service, 199 vacancies in the Government Translators’ Service, 394 vacancies in the Government Librarians’ Service, 2,340 vacancies in the Public Management Assistants’ Service, 1071 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Information Technology Division, 3270 vacancies in the Development Officers’ Service, 55 vacancies in the Office Employees Service and 188 vacancies in the Drivers’ Service.
JVP wants special debate on Coal Power Tender
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday, requested a special debate on the controversy surrounding the Coal Procurement Tender.
He made this request following a lengthy statement by Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
“Offering the coal supply tender to Noble Resources for many years is no secret. Links concerning the local agent of this company is widely known. It is a good thing that this government made attempts to follow the tender procedure once again. The problem is that a similar deal had taken place at this instance with the company selected by the tender procedure.
The Committee appointed by the President had stated that the tender was questionable. Ministry Secretary had submitted the Cabinet paper ignoring the Procurement Appeal Board’s decision. That was the reason that the matter was taken before the Supreme Court. The SC had expressed concern in this regard. Therefore we urge to facilitate an extensive debate in this regard,” MP Dissanayake said.
The Minister agreed to facilitate a special debate on the matter. He also observed that the President appointed the said committee the same day after approving the Cabinet paper for the tender, adding that its report came several months later.
 
Info concerning buses  via SMS - Abeysinghe
The Government is to launch a special project to correct flaws in the GPS technology systems in buses and enable commuters to receive all information about buses via the Short Message Service, said Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe.
He made this observation yesterday in Parliament in response to a question raised by Opposition MP Sunil Handunnetti.
Admitting that there are flaws in the GPS technology system that was introduced to buses at a cost of Rs 61 million, he said that the technology was introduced to 2,085 buses, but was active only in 800 buses. “There was a flaw in the agreement as well and as we attempted to repair the broken system, they demanded for another Rs 8 million to which we disagreed,” the Deputy Minister said.
He said that a control room for the GPS system was being constructed to control the GPS systems of buses. He also said the public could dial 1955 and receive the needed information concerning buses. He said that one of the objectives for the introduction of the technology was to provide commuters with a better service.

Tax revenue had increased by 22.3 percent to Rs 441 billion in the first four months of this year compared to the same period last year, but it was Rs 53.8 billion less than the estimated tax revenue, the ‘Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report 2016’ tabled in Parliament yesterday indicated.
The report was tabled by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella on behalf of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.

As of the report, the Government had expected Rs 495 billion from taxes from January to April this year, but had only found Rs 441 billion.
The non-tax revenue had also declined by 8.8 percent to 31 billion during the first four months, while this amount was Rs 14.8 billion less than the estimated non-tax revenue.

Four year term for heads of sports associations should prevail - Aluthgamage
The four year term of heads of sports associations should go unchanged, said Opposition Parliamentarian Mahindananda Aluthgamage in Parliament yesterday.
He said if the term was to be amended to shorten it to a period of two years, he was not commendable, as the two year period was not ample for presidents of such sports associations to render a proper service.
He made these observations joining the debate on the Regulations under the Sports Law.
“Elected president take at least six months to over come the flaws, mistakes, negligence and constructive measures of his predecessor. Then he takes at least another six months to settle to work. The last six months of his term is spent working for the next election. So the period at least should be 4 years,” Aluthgamage said. “So I am sure the Minister has been misled by someone for amendments to reduced the term.”
He also said the terms of the president of sports associations could be four years, adding that Sports Director General could come to a decision after the expiration of two years, considering the conduct of the presidents of the associations if another election was to be held or not.
 
Brisk walking better than jogging to combat diabetes
US: Walking briskly on a regular basis may be more effective than vigorously jogging for people with pre-diabetes, a new study has found.
The findings are the result of a six-month study of 150 participants, each of whom was designated as having pre-diabetes based on elevated fasting glucose levels.
Study participants were randomised into four groups. The first group followed an intervention modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Programme (DPP), considered a gold standard, that aims to achieve a 7 per cent body weight reduction over 6 months. The programme requires cutting calories, eating a low-fat diet, and exercising. Study participants in this group adopted the diet changes, and performed moderate-intensity exercise equivalent to 12 km of brisk walking in a week.
Other study participants were randomly assigned to receive exercise only, using different amounts and intensities - low-amount at moderate intensity (equivalent to walking briskly for 12 km per week); high-amount at moderate intensity (equivalent to walking briskly for 18.5 km per week); and high-amount at vigorous intensity (equivalent to jogging for 18.5 km per week).
“We know the benefits of lifestyle changes from the DPP, but it is difficult to get patients to do even one behavior, not to mention three,” said William Kraus, professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine in the US. - PTI
