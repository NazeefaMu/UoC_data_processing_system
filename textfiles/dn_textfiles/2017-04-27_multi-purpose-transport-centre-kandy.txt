Multi-purpose transport centre in Kandy

A multi-purpose transport centre will be built in Kandy at a cost of Rs 6,000 million under the Kandy City Development programme by amalgamating the Goods Shed Bus Stand and the Kandy Railway station, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawake said.
Addressing a press conference at the Riverdale hotel Kandy, the Minister said tenders will be called before the end of this year for the construction of this electronically operated centre which will be similar to the working of the airport.
Multi-purpose transport centres have been proposed for Pettah, Kottawa and Battaramulla and Galle, but the proposed centre in Kandy will be given preference. He said Kandy, Jaffna and Galle would be developed as strategic cities under foreign aid. During the second stage, such cities would be developed in Anuradhapura, Trincomalee and Hambantota. All strategic towns would later be linked together under the government’s proposed plan. Although strategic town concept was not popular it was far better than beautification programmes undertaken in cities by building parks and roundabouts.
He said almost 40 percent work on the Colombo Financial City programme has been completed. Preference would be given to solve the vehicle congestion in Kandy, Minister Ranawake said.
