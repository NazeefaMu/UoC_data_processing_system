President’s reasons valid

As our front page main story yesterday aptly put it, President Maithripala Sirisena has set the record straight on the circumstances that compelled him to dissolve Parliament. They, no doubt, all cumulatively had a profound effect which finally forced the hand of the President. Issuing a special statement detailing the reasons as to why he took the decision President Sirisena maintained that all democratic norms were being flouted and revealed how MPs were being traded for sums ranging from Rs.150 million to as much as Rs.500 million. The President said it was really a regrettable situation where a representative elected by the voters had to be traded in this manner.
The buying of MPs was not a recent phenomenon but had been practiced from as far back as 1964. On that occasion the UNP managed to contrive a mass exodus from the then Government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike that led to that Government being defeated on the Throne Speech. Rumours were rife that a well known power-broker at the time engineered the defections by throwing money bags, when the Government was set to take over the Lake House Group of Newspapers through the Press Council Bill, the individual in question having a major stake in the concern. Years later, in 2000, there was yet another instance of mass buying of MPs at the height of the “Package” affair where CBK sought to divide the country into a Union of Regions. On that occasion, both sides went on a ‘buying spree’, with the UNP even sending some of its MPs abroad to keep them out of temptation’s way.
The President gave as another reason (for the termination of Parliament) the intransigence of former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in failing to abide by the Constitution and Parliamentary Standing Orders and arrogating to himself powers that were not his to claim. The President said; “I am very disappointed by his (former Speaker’s) actions. It is the Parliamentary tradition to have the Speaker act impartially and independent of party politics. However Jayasuriya chose to disregard Parliamentary Standing Orders, procedures and norms and not accept the Prime Minister appointed by the Executive, releasing statements to that effect, which left me no choice but to dissolve Parliament”.
But what would, no doubt, have been the most compelling reason that eventually forced the hand of the President was the very real possibility of bloodletting in the August Assembly when it convened on November 14. Like the President noted, grim forebodings were in the air and the possibility of bloodshed on the floor of the House could not have been ruled out. The President himself alluded to this when he said;”through various media briefings, both sides stressed that there could be a violent situation when Parliament reconvened on Nobember14, even resulting in the death of some. If I had allowed that when Parliament met on November 14, it would not only have been bloodshed in Parliament but was likely to have spread to your towns, villages and every street in the country.”
The President opined that he opted for the best solution, that of not permitting violence to take place on a large scale across the country but to respect democracy and let the 15 million voters decide who should be sent to Parliament.
No right thinking citizen of this country could find fault with the President’s reasoning and the eventual decision. Had some untoward incident occurred at a time emotions were running high in the midst of a highly charged political atmosphere, there is no knowing as to where things would have ended up. We say this because unlike in the times of the immediate post Independence Parliaments where politicians with staid deportment, stature and standing adorned the Assembly what we have today is a House which is in constant turmoil with violent behaviour and fisticuffs being commonplace. This is because on both sides there are those who were nominated for their muscle power where the brawn prevails over brain with no room for dignity and decorum, two terms widely used to underline Parliamentary sanctity.
President Sirisena, no doubt, is well aware of the state of play and was obviously leaving nothing to chance. With the former Speaker expressing his intention to go for a floor test at the very outset of sittings, this was bound to have resulted in unprecedented violence going by what we have already seen at lesser volatile situations in the House. Besides, the President had acted well within the Constitution as attested by independent legal opinion.
Which leaves us with the next question as to which criteria will be adopted when picking candidates for the General Election by all parties. There have been a clamour from several quarters, nay an outcry, that professionals and the educated be liberally included in the lists for the greater benefit of the country. We hope that this will be a golden opportunity to change the present political culture where misfits and undesirables prevail. We need true, honest and hardworking servants of the people in the House from all shades of political opinion.
