In the statement, the spokesman said the duke "may still choose to attend certain public events from time to time".
The duke attended Lord's Cricket Ground to open a new stand on Wednesday and was He was heard joking at the event that he is the "world's most experienced plaque unveiler".
On Thursday, he and the Queen are due at a service for members of the Order of Merit at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace before hosting a lunch for those attending.
