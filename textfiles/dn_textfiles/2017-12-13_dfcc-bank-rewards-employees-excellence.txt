DFCC Bank rewards employees for excellence

DFCC Bank held its ‘Rewarding Excellence’ Quarterly Human Resource (HR) Awards recently amidst a strong mood of fellowship and corporate pride.
The event was attended by Members of the Board, senior management, awardees and staff members. The final award ceremony for the year was held at the DFCC Bank Head Office Auditorium on November 23, to recognize and reward staff members who performed well in the third quarter of the financial year.
The Rewarding Excellence scheme was introduced to encourage and appreciate its employees who go the distance and perform above and beyond the call of duty. DFCC has earned a strong reputation for the quality of its people, having moulded some of the best banking professionals in the country. The Bank values not only their professional achievements but also outstanding effort in other areas of corporate life.
“I am delighted to recognize our team members who have performed exceptionally well this year.” said Lakshman Silva, CEO – DFCC Bank. “These awards are recognition of both their professional achievements, contributions to the company and also a reflection of the standards of excellence we strive for each day at DFCC. We are committed to being at the very forefront of the finance sector and ‘Rewarding Excellence’ is just one way that we continue to encourage our staff members to keep growing while providing the best possible service to our valued customers.”
The Panel’s Choice Excellence Award was bestowed on Dulanji Gamage in recognition of the bravery she displayed on August 2017, at the Piliyandala branch premises when the branch was forcefully entered by two armed men.
Her brave action averted any financial loss to the bank, while what set her apart is the loyalty and bravery that she displayed in an extremely tense situation.
The Living the Core Values Award was given to the Ratnapura Branch in recognition of the loyalty and commitment demonstrated during the floods that affected the country in June. The Ratnapura Branch was under threat of flooding and the team volunteered to move the Bank’s physical assets to a safer ground.
Meanwhile, the Panel’s Choice Award went to Senaka Jayasinghe in recognition of the honour and prestige brought to DFCC Bank by winning a Karlsruhe Merit Award in 2017.
The Panel’s Choice Award was given to Sudesh Jayasinghe in recognition of the commitment and enthusiasm shown by developing the current intranet on the Google platform, a task outside his job scope. A Special Recognition Award was also awarded to the Branch Operations Department as an acknowledgment of the tremendous support they demonstrated to internal stakeholders.
Finally, a Special Appreciation Award was also bestowed on Manouri Liyanage, Lashanthi Kodikara, Dilini Kankanamge, Nissansala Nawarathne, Dinuka Herath, Denessan Vaikunthavasan, Samadhi Galapitadeniya, and Meshara Perera for volunteering their personal time and effort to the success of the pilot English Education Project undertaken by the Bank.
