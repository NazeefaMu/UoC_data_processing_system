Municipal Councils, Urban Councils, Pradeshiya Saba Amendment Bills presented to Parliament

 
Three bills to change the composition of members in Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Paradeshiya Sabhas were presented before the Parliament today.
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha presented the Municipal Councils (Amendment) bill, Urban Councils (Amendment) bill and the Pradeshiya Sabha (Amendment) bill on behalf of the Government.
The three bills seek to amend  Chapter 252 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, Chapter 255 of the Urban Councils Ordinance and the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No 15 of 1987.
The three bills are envisaged to give effect to new sections which state that each Municipal Council, Urban Council and Pradeshiya Sabha will have forty percent of members as specified by the Minister in an order published in the gazette based on the Orders published in the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance (chapter 262)
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the three bills would be taken up for debate in the House on a later date.
