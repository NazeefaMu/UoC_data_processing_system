NMK Group   celebrates 35th   anniversary  donating medical equipment to LRH

The social responsibility of NMK Group of Companies is to make a significant contribution towards building a strong and healthy nation.
To achieve this objective, Marina has introduced to the market a wide range of safe and hygienic food products which ensure physical well being, the company's Chairman, Manjula Narayana said.
“As Buddhists, we know that tending to the sick brings them mental solace. Being mentally healthy reflects positively on physical health. The Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital is a specialized medical facility dedicated to the cause of caring for sick children. Making a donation to such a hospital is similar to tending to sick children”, he noted.
Chairman Manjula Narayana was expressing his views after donating a consignment of medical equipment to the Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital to mark a twin celebratory milestone-the 35th anniversary of NMK Group of Companies and the 7th anniversary of Marina. He said that over the past 35 years, NMK Group of Companies initiated and accomplished a large number of diverse social service charity projects.
Amongst the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives the company implemented were the granting of financial assistance to construct ‘Hadasuwa Medura’, a hospital for specialized medical care for cardiac patients at Kurunegala, donation of artificial limbs and wheelchairs to disabled persons in different parts of the country, providing spectacles free of charge to deserving people with poor eye sight, rehabilitation of irrigation canals and reservoirs, helping families who were affected by the tsunami and floods, awarding scholarships to deserving students who had qualified for university entrance and providing funds for the construction of the proposed new auditorium of Ave Maria Convent at Bolawalana.
Under the leadership and guidance of its Chairman, Manjula Narayana, a renowned Sri Lankan entrepreneur, NMK Group has also ventured into the international arena. NMK Group, a 100% Sri Lankan company, is committed to make a significant contribution towards building a strong and healthy nation through its CSR initiative.
