Upto SLFP Ministers to resign - Amaraweera

UPFA General Secretary, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday declared that the relationship between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was not affected by the No-Confidence Motion, on April 4.
Addressing the media at his Ministry, Amaraweera said President Sirisena wanted to continue the UNP-SLFP unity government and the decision in this regard would be taken before the next Cabinet meeting.
Amaraweera said the Ministers, Deputy Ministers and State Ministers who voted in favour of the No Confidence Motion moved by the Joint Opposition (JO) would not be removed from the Cabinet.
“The SLFP has nothing to do if they resign voluntarily. It is their choice,” Minister Amaraweera said. During the SLFP Central Committee meeting held on Monday night, the MPs who supported the NCM proposed to sever connections with the government. However, the President had not taken any final decision about it.
Minister Amaraweera yesterday hinted that the re-shuffle would happen after the New Year. “We have no idea to divide.The SLFP group in the government will stick together,”he assured.
