Govt. to purchase 1,000 buses for SLTB

The government will purchase 1,000 buses for the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) within the next few months in order to strengthen the SLTB bus fleet and the route network. The government also intends to start a super luxury metro bus service within Colombo and its suburbs.

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said, “Although the SLTB has 7,700 buses in its fleet, only 6,000 buses are in operational condition at present.
The Minister said this while addressing the gathering in the ceremony of distributing new engine kits for the SLTB buses at the Udahamulla bus depot yesterday. He said that the SLTB needs at least 10,000 buses to provide quality service to the public. Accordingly, 500 new engine kits were provided to the Udahamulla bus depot to be fitted into 500 unused buses need in engine repairs.
He further said “Politics prevailing in the country is responsible for the collapse of the SLTB.
SLTB was destroyed due to the political influences under all the regimes that came into the power previously.
All former governments filled the SLTB with their supporters unnecessarily. All SLTB workers have rights to engage in politics, but the SLTB administration itself must be devoid of politics. We all must get-together and work to uplift the SLTB despite the party politics.
