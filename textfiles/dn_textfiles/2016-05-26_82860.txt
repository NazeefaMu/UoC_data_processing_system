Saunders SC enters semis  beating Blue Star 1-0

 
Saunders SC booked a semi-final berth in the Cargills FA Cup 2016 by defeating Blue Star SC 1 to nil in the quarter final match played yesterday at the Race Course grounds. The match started around 35 minutes late due to heavy rains.
Both teams fought hard from the beginning to open the scoring, but non of them were able to sound the board throughout the first half as the score remained nil all. Saunders players displayed a better performance but were unfortunate to miss several scoring chances in the first half due to poor teamwork.
Blue Star players came up with an aggressive playing style, where two of their players were issued yellow cards in the third and 60th minutes.
Though they had a good defence, Saunders displayed a much better attack throughout the game. Saunders strengthened their attack with a much organized teamwork in the second half and recorded the winning goal through their foreign player C.B. Abdul Mohamed (Ghana) in the 68th minute.
Saunders SC will take on Renown SC while the Army SC and Colombo FC will clash in semi finals, next Saturday (28) at the same venue from 3.00 pm onwards.
