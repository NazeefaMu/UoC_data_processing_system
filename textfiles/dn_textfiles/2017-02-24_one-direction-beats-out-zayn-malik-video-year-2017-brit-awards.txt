One Direction Beats Out Zayn Malik for Video of the Year at 2017 Brit Awards

 
Even while One Direction is on their year-long hiatus, there's still some friendly competition between them and their former band-mate.
The One Direction guys faced off against Zayn Malik for the video of the year award at the 2017 Brit Awards, and ultimately the band came out victorious.

Their nostalgic "History" video beat out Malik's steamy "Pillowtalk" vid (among eight other nominees), earning Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson their seventh Brit Award.
Payne was the only One Direction member in attendance Wednesday (22), accepting the award from One Direction mastermind Simon Cowell.
In his speech, Payne acknowledged the group's time off, but reassured fans that "One Direction is who we are, it's who we always will be."
Despite not being there to say thank you in person, Tomlinson and Horan also took to Twitter to send their love to fans. "You guys to continue to surprise us with how incredible you are over and over again," Tomlinson said in a video.
This marks the fourth year in a row for One Direction taking home the Brit for British video: They won for "Best Song Ever" in 2014, "You & I" in 2015 and "Drag Me Down" in 2016.
