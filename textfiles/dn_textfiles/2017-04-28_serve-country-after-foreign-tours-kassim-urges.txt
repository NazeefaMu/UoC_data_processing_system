Serve country after foreign tours, Kassim urges

There is no use going abroad to take part in various conferences, summits and seminars unless those who participate in these do something worthwhile for the country, Health Deputy Minister Fizal Kassim said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that Bangladesh is ahead of Sri Lanka and other countries in the region with regard to helping children with autism. “Sri Lanka has a long way to go. We can learn from other countries to improve our condition,” he said.
Deputy Minister Kassim pointed out that it is the responsibility of parents to identify children with autism early and seek treatment and rehabilitation.
They need to spend 70 percent of their time with children with autism to see an improvement.
However, at present, most mothers are only interested in obtaining the relevant vaccinations on time and not other important aspects.
With correct medical treatment, rehabilitation and guidance, children with autism can lead a near-normal life and carry out their day to day activities without help, he added.
