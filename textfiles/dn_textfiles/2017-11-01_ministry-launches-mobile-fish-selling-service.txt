Ministry launches mobile fish selling service

A mobile service to sell fish at concessionary rates was launched by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry to supply more fish to the consumers, Ministry sources said.
Fish prices has gone down as large fish stocks arrive at the Peliyagoda fish market. The increase in local fish harvest resulted in decreasing fish prices, the sources said.
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister has instructed authorities to launch a mobile service to purchase fish directly from fishermen and sell them using lorries at concessionary prices, the sources said.
The programme was carried out effectively for the past few days, they said.
The Ministry has requested the Finance Ministry to suspend fish importation except that of Marlin (Koppara) and Sail Fish (Thalapath) since local fish harvest has increased manifold.
