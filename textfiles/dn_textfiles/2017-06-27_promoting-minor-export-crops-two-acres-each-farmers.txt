Promoting minor export crops: Two acres each for farmers

The government has drawn attention towards leasing out State land to farmers at two acres each to promote the cultivation of minor export crops including pepper, nutmeg, cloves and cocoa, said Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickreme.
He was speaking to the media after he accompanied Minister Mangala Samaraweera during his visit to Kandy to pay homage to the Ven Niyangoda Vijithasiri Anunayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter. He said his ministry would intervene to direct these export crops to the international market. He said these grants would be one measure among a host of benefits granted to farmers through the next budget.
