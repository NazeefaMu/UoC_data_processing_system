‘Swim Along’  to aid Mayan swimmers

The Colombo branch of the Past Pupils Association of Mahamaya Girls’ College, Kandy, has organized ‘The Swim Along’, an evening of singing, dancing and gastronomic delights to raise funds for a training pool for Mahamaya swimmers. The event will be held on January 27 at the BMICH at 8 pm. The band Kings will provide music. Mahamaya Girls' College, Kandy, has always made their mark in swimming. They are the current All Island Swimming Champions among girls’ schools in the island and had been so for19 consecutive years. Though they have won many accolades for swimming, the Mayan swimmers trained in a pool belonging to another school for many years and only managed to get their own pool many years later. However the swimming coaches have realized the need of a training pool for younger children. ‘The Swim Along’ was put together to raise funds for a training pool to help the school strengthen their swimming team and maintain the unbroken record. ‘The Swim Along’ is open to all music lovers.
