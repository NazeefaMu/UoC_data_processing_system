Rainco honours teachers in collaboration with Ministry of Education

Appreciating teachers for their selfless support and dedication in shaping the lives of students in many ways, Rainco (Pvt) Ltd, is collaborating with the Ministry of Education for the second consecutive year to host the national Guru Prathibha Prabha ceremony.
Coinciding with Teacher’s Day, the Guru Prathibha Prabha program felicitates teachers across the island for their invaluable contribution in empowering students and as among the nation’s biggest assets.
Rainco, the market leader in umbrella production is passionate about sustaining goodness across all its activities, amongst all stakeholders. Participating in the Guru Prathibha Prabha program is a unique way of showcasing a segment of society engaged in teaching, a noble profession which deserves better recognition.
Commenting on Rainco’s initiative of sponsoring the Guru Prathibha Prabha program, Ahmed Aroos, Chief Operating Officer, Rainco (Pvt) Ltd said, “Teachers have always played a vital role in all of our lives, but not many people talk about them or appreciate and praise them for what they have done or are doing. We as an organisation want to drive this and really acknowledge the vital role teachers have played in all our lives and it’s time to appreciate them. The meaning of Guru Panduru is literally a tribute to teachers. On that basis this program is very much in line with our organisation’s core value.”
As a tribute to teachers, Rainco have also launched a unique limited edition special collection of umbrellas honouring all teachers. Additionally, it is an ideal gift as the product is specially designed in commemoration of World Teacher’s day.
Rainco is engaged in several corporate social responsibility activities and is a firm believer in giving back to the community. Its foremost purpose in helping teachers is to reinstall the values inculcated by this special segment.
“We have many other CSR initiatives and this is one important activity. We collaborate on this program as we celebrate a special set of individuals. We aim to continue to pay tribute to teachers across the island whose contribution to mentor and uplift students deserves our wholehearted appreciation,” Aroos added.
