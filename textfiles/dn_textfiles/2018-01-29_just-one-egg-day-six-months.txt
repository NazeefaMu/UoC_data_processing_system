Just ONE egg a day for six months!

Feeding babies eggs boosts their brain development and function, new research suggests.
Just one egg a day for six months significantly increases youngsters’ levels of the nutrients choline and DHA, both of which are involved in brain health, a study found.
Previous research reveals feeding babies eggs improves their growth and prevents stunting.
Lead author Lora Iannotti from the Brown School at Washington University, said: ‘Like milk or seeds, eggs are designed to support the early growth and development of an organism and are, therefore, dense in nutrient content.
‘Eggs provide essential fatty acids, proteins, choline, vitamins A and B12, selenium, and other critical nutrients at levels above or comparable to those found in other animal food products, but they are relatively more affordable.’
The researchers analyzed 163 babies aged between six and nine months from Ecuador in 2015.
Of the infants, 80 were fed one egg a day for six months, while the remainder were given none.
Their vitamin and mineral levels were assessed via blood tests.
Results reveal babies who eat eggs have significantly higher levels of choline and DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, both of which play a vital role in brain development and function.
Iannotti said: ‘Eggs have been consumed throughout human history, but the full potential of this nutritionally-complete food has yet to be recognized in many resource-poor settings around the world.

The findings were reported in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
