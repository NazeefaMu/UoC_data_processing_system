Kandy unrest: Cabinet approval for special loan scheme for affected businesses

Cabinet yesterday approved the proposal made by Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella to provide concessional interest loans to businesses affected by the recent unrest in Kandy.
Minister Kiriella had pointed out that it was important to rebuild the damaged properties of the business community in Kandy as soon as possible and thus a concessional loan system needs to be introduced with the support of the state banks. He thus proposed that Cabinet approve the ‘Athwela Loan Proposal System’ which was adopted for victims affected by the floods in 2017, for businesses in Kandy.
This system grants loans at an interest rate of 2 percent. Businesses will soon be able to apply for this loan on the recommendation of the District and Divisional Secretaries in the affected areas in the Kandy Administrative District.
