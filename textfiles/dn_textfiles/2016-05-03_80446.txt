Barefoot patrols to free little soles!

When I was a child, going barefoot seemed a capital idea and spelled Freedom with a capital ‘F.’ If anyone dares object to my footloose and fancy free notions I will be tempted to shoo, sorry shoe them off, with a fine fff...flavoured flurry of fffff...foul invective.
We were, in those fabulous fifties, happy little unshod soles running the gauntlet of gravel, grass and rocky terrain. Yes, we also revelled in wading ankle deep in splendid, squelching mud. It all started after school was out or on holidays.
That was the time when as Sherlock Holmes, the greatest detective who never lived , could have been paraphrased as saying: “The game’s afoot!” Or rather, barefoot!
Even now some people with a colonial hangover still think it’s vulgar to bare your soles to strangers. Many of us found the constraint of shoes an uncomfortable aspect and freed our little soles at the earliest opportunity.
Consequently we lived as half-wild disciples of Tom Sawyer. Most Sri Lankan youngsters of my vintage would go barefooted out of choice rather than necessity.
You see, you had to wear shoes to school with white cotton socks to boot. It was and still is a fixation of an old colonial sartorial legacy to be properly shod to school, church and even certain informal events such as a movie. Abandoning footwear was the ‘done thing’ at the time. No one thought this odd, because it wasn’t. It is true that among the negative aspects of being barefoot was the risk of being skewered with thorns or broken glass.
Soon our soles toughened to leather and we traversed everywhere, even on gravel, or heated tar or asphalt without ill effect. For instance we were immune to the tiny thorns of the Nidhi Kumba, (Mimosa Pudica) plants that proliferated everywhere. We boldly trampled the touch-me- not leaves with bare calloused feet every time they opened up again and again giving the poor shy weeds a nervous breakdown.
But the larger thorns our poor little soles encountered were quite a different prickly proposition particularly when they penetrated deeply. Fortunately our ‘ayahs’ at the time were experts in emergency surgery digging out the thorns with safety pins in lieu of scalpels. They would sterilise the affected area with lime as both cleanser and disinfectant before performing the surgical procedure. If the thorn was embedded too deep they would tie a poultice of freshly scraped coconut which eventually drew the entrenched object out. Yet bare feet brought a whole new happy dimension to our lives. For the little females of the species they were excellent for playing hopscotch on packed ground because it was a lot easier to avoid the lines without their school regulation tennis shoes on.
Besides, the brown earth, cold and hard, felt good to our pavement-scorched feet. Bare heels rounded the ‘Jill’ marble hole for our ‘attabola’ games to perfection. All this helped us develop a remarkable degree of prehensile strength in our big toes.
Tired of squatting around the marbles square we would stand, grip the marbles on the ground dexterously with our toes and retrieve them without bothering to bend. The tenderfoot of today who has always run around shod would never be able to perform such a feat. Going barefoot in nature ensured that the sole of the foot would build itself a thicker callous of skin and toughen up - all the better to go barefoot with!
When the first day of school came following the holidays, we boys clothed our freshly scrubbed feet in respectable white socks and tucked them into sturdy- laced brown Oxfords or Barratt shoes. After a week of suffering from too-tight shoes our feet would spread out because we had gone barefoot all through the holidays.
I was once rain-larking in the backyard when my mother called out: “You’ve left your shoes behind!” To which I replied: “At least they’re not getting wet” as I padded along barefoot enjoying splashing in the puddles. I am still uncertain as to whether I got my ears boxed for the sassy remark or for running barefoot in the rain.
I remember distinctly a time that people of all ages used wooden clogs to keep their feet clean and protected. These were ugly, noisy and clumsy clod-hoppers with a crude leather strap nailed in to stirrup one’s feet in. That was before the invention of rubber flip-flops which were to come a decade later and named for the sound they made when you walked — flip, flop, flip, flop — but they could have been called ‘ouch-umphs,’ the sound you’ll make after wearing them all the time.
Flip-flops beat the old wooden clogs for comfort and balance feet down. At issue, though, is their utter lack of foot support. You have to scrunch your toes to keep the flip-flop on the foot while the heel lifts in the air. Today flip-flops have moved beyond the domain of beach bums to take their place among sturdier sandals for everyday use. Most everyone wears them now.
I was fortunate to grow up in a country at a time when going barefoot was not just tolerated, it was commonplace and in some communities actually expected when you were a child. I personally never feel quite so free and balanced as when I am barefoot and my wish for the children of the world is that they should be as fortunate as I was.
I was once late to serve at the 6.30 am holy Mass in the Carmalite chapel close to my home so I hotfooted it to be on time. The cloistered nuns did not look kindly on tardy altar servers. Fortunately for me the celebrant priest was even later than I. He rode in on his scooter just as I rang the chapel bell.
I realised all of sudden that in my dash to serve the Almighty I had completely forgotten my shoes. Rev. Fr. Neddy dismounting from his scooter asked me why I looked worried so early in the morning. I told him I had overslept and had forgotten my shoes. He uttered a booming laugh and raising his cassock slightly and said: “That makes two of us my son. We are both completely naked from the ankles down!”
