Ebert Silva, the pioneer brand in travel trade transport

The brand ‘Ebert Silva’ introduced to Sri Lankan travel and tourism industry by Late Nomis de Silva in the late 1930s who incorporated his passenger transportation service as Ebert Silva Omni Bus Co., Ltd, in the name of his eldest son ‘Ebert’ is functional even today.
Ebert Silva as a young 21 year old was compelled to take over the company with his father’s sudden demise in 1953. In 1954, seeing the ‘sparks’ of a new industry, Tourism, he incorporated Ebert Silva Touring Co., Lt
The Nationalisation in 1958 however, saw the end of Ebert Silva Omni Bus Company Limited, one of the biggest bus companies of the time, which was nationalised with its entire fleet of 68 buses together with 58 other bus companies.
Left only with two second hand cars Ebert Silva thereafter rebuilt his new company catering to tourists at the Mount Lavinia Hotel and the jetty of the Colombo Harbour. In a differently configured economy he travelled throughout the country looking for Lorries to be converted in to buses with the intention of rebuilding his fleet to cater to tourism, which he foresaw to have great potential of soon unfolding into a vibrant industry.
Queen and her entourage visited and view the ruined cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa in the company coaches and Ebert Silva Touring was the only private company to providing transport for this Royal visit.
The company was awarded many accolades which included Presidential Awards presented for the ‘Best Domestic Operator’ in Travel and Tourism in many years. In recognition of a lifetime of passionate and committed contribution to Sri Lanka’s travel and tourism sphere he was bestowed with the esteemed Presidential Award as a ‘Legend’ in Sri Lanka’s Travel and Tourism industry in the year 2009.
In 2006 under his guidance Ebert Silva Holidays was incorporated to offer creative and innovative experiences to the travel and tourism industry of Sri Lanka.
The company which operates the only purposely built double decker bus offers a fleet of modern transport solutions is being now run by Rajini De Silva Mendis.A pioneer visionary and a legend in Sri Lanka’s travel and tourism industry, Ebert Silva is remembered on his fifth death anniversary with many CSR initiatives.
