Firearm licences must be renewed before Dec. 31

Additional Defence Secretary N. G. Panditharatne told the Daily News yesterday that all licences issued on pistols, shotguns, revolvers and repeaters should be renewed by owners for next year (2019) before December 31.
He said at present, the Ministry of Defence had issued licences for 1,340 pistols and automatic guns for self-defence and 3,713 licences were issued on shotguns for the purpose of protecting properties belonging to individuals.
The Ministry of Defence had also issued 4,840 licences for shotguns and repeaters issued for state sector banks.
In addition, another 15,783 licences were issued on shotguns and related firearms issued for farmers to protect their harvest from wild animals.
According to the Additional Secretary, if a person keeping any kind of firearm without a valid licence after December 31, it would be considered a serious and punishable offence.
The individual could be sentenced to five or 10 years’ imprisonment by the Magistrate’s Courts.
Panditharatne added that if there is a gun or firearm without a valid licence after December 31, it would be considered an illegal weapon, according to the Act of Firearms and Guns. The Additional Secretary said individuals can keep their firearms only until January 10, 2019 without a licence.
The Firearms Act was first introduced to Sri Lanka on April 1, 1917 by the British during the colonial period.
