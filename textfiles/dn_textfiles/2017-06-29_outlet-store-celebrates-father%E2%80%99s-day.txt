The Outlet Store celebrates Father’s Day

The Outlet Store recently celebrated Father’s Day with many surprising gifts, special offers, and a contest where children expressed their infinite love to their dads.
The Outlet Store staffs randomly spoke to families who were shopping on that special day and surprised them with gifts by asking their children to express their love towards their fathers.
‘It was such a wonderful experience for us to see the emotions spread across our store and the love that was in the air on Father’s Day,’ said The Outlet Store Clothing Pvt Ltd, Managing Director, Sharhan Mansoor commenting on a press release.
The store had a range of special offers where families enjoyed a whole day shopping spree and also an on-going Facebook contest giving away vouchers to winners daily.
