‘Battle of the Lagoons’ on July 30

‘Hands across two rivers’ way back in 1979 the first ever friendly encounter between Holy Cross College, Kalutara and Maris Stella College Negambo took place at that time both schools were administered by the ‘Marist Brothers’. They took over the administration of the College facing the Kalutara lagoon in 1978.
Rev. Bro. Francis Silva who had served in Maris Stella College during yester years and, the first principal of Holy Cross College under the Marist Brothers’ administration, was instrumental in the birth of the Big Match between the two colleges
From 1995 on wards cricketers of both colleges are starving for a Big Match. During the non-playing era, which is still on course, old boys of both colleges get together to celebrate the Big Match they witnessed/participated all around the world, but an official match is what everyone are eagerly waiting for.
The present old boys unions of both the colleges have got together for the revival of the “Battle of the Lagoons” by organizing an event named “Road to Big Bash” with the participation of old boys of both the colleges. This event is organized with the motive of getting together and convince the stakeholders to resume the paused “Battle of the Lagoons”.
Old boys of both the colleges are warmly welcomed to take part in this memorable and crucial event which will be held on the 30th of July at HCC Grounds, Kalutara. The event consisting of two T20 matches will follow a brotherhood walk starting at 8.00 a.m. from the famous Kalutara clock tower.
