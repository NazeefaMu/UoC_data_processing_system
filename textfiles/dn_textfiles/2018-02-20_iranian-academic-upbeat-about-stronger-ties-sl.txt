Iranian academic upbeat about stronger ties with SL

Dr. Mohsen Eslami is an Assistant Professor of International Relations at the Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran. He is visiting Sri Lanka from Iran to headline a conference organized by the Pathfinder Foundation.
Dr. Eslami sat down with the Daily News last week to discuss the Iran nuclear deal in the context of changing global politics and how it might open new pathways for trade with Sri Lanka.
Excerpts follow.
Q: You’ve been invited to Colombo to give the keynote address at a conference on the Indian Ocean region in the 21st century. What is the focus of the research you will be presenting?
A: Well, my field is international relations and foreign policy. I’m a political researcher in international relations theory, but this is specifically about the Iran nuclear deal and regional conflict. The deal we have with the P5+1(shorthand for China, France, Russia, the UK, and the USA, as well as Germany) was so important. Because of the negotiation that came from the Western side and the Iran side, it made an unprecedented agreement between the two sides. This should be a model for other regional conflicts, as for example, Saudia Arabia and Iran, Syria, Bahrain and Yemen. This is the core of my research. Can we use this model for regional conflicts, or not?
Q: Do you believe the framework has potential to be replicated elsewhere?

A: I believe that this nuclear deal is about the very old-fashioned dispute, the nuclear subject. Because of the limitation of this subject, it’s so different from other disputes that we have in the region. I counted some of the disputes we have in the region: like Arab versus non-Arab conflict, or the Arab-Israeli conflict, Shia-Sunni conflict and even Arab-Arab conflict. The sense of the conflict we had with the Western sides is about the subject of the nuclear arena and because of that, it’s different.
But, I believe one potential of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is opening dialogue, opening some kind of negotiation between two sides. This gives us what they call conditional infrastructure for other policy or other decision-making we may have, as for example between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
But I don’t think the joint agreement will have direct effects, because it’s too different. It is about something specialized. But dialogue, negotiation and procedure is the new window for the players in the Middle East.
Q: Are you saying the deal could signal a new era of Iranian diplomacy, not just towards the West, but in the region as well?
A: Yes, yes. We can observe a new approach of diplomacy on Iran’s part.
Q: Is Iran pursuing similar agreements with other regional actors currently?
A: I believe that if we want to adopt or apply this model for other players, like Saudi Arabia or Turkey, we need an international player also - a mediator - because the essence and the nature of the conflicts that we have in this region is too different from the nuclear subject.
For example, you know that President Donald Trump just determined that (Jerusalem) is the centre of the Israeli regime. This is the very important and classic dispute that Arabs and Israelis, or Muslims and Israelis, have. Because of this decision, we see this dispute as ongoing and alive. We cannot resolve this dispute like the nuclear deal, because it is 60 or 70 years old. You have so many problems, wars, massacres. Because of that, if we want to use the model, we need a mediator like Russia or the USA.
But I don’t think the USA under Donald Trump is going to come to an approach like this. Maybe after two or three years something can change.
Q: Did President Trump’s decision really set back the peace process?
"But America, under Trump, hasn’t followed the right path, the right decision."
A: Yes. I think the decision of Donald Trump was a big risk. Because no other president did this. They understood that the Arab side, or Muslim-side, was also powerful. They have oil, they have integrity, they have potential for negotiating. The Muslim viewpoint is so important. Because of that, I think it was a very tough decision that Trump took.
I think it will show that this decision was harmful for Israel, because it demolished the peace process they had with the Arabs. All of the Muslim countries said they do not accept this. Because of that, this historical dispute comes alive again with the powerful wave against Israel. I think it was not a correct decision.
He acted on the will of the Israeli lobby. He didn’t need to do this.
Q: President Trump has been critical of the nuclear deal, as have been many Congressional Republicans. From your side, do you worry about America walking away from the agreement?
A: I think President Trump is going to get rid of the agreement. We believe, though, that Europe can do something, or manage the nuclear agreement. Obviously Trump has no will to continue.
European countries want to manage, use their lobby, to keep the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action going. We are waiting to see what happens. Iran is following our end of the commitment, we are obeying the commitment, but the American side doesn’t want to do the same. One side cannot get rid of it because they don’t want to commit anymore.
Q: There have been protests in Iran because it appears that people feel the sanction relief has not generated enough economic growth. Do you agree with that analysis?
A: The US decision on sanctions is not correct. Because we are having problems with our banking procedures, it leads to economic, financial problems. But we’ve had sanctions from the first day of the Islamic Revolution victory, 40 years ago.
With these new sanctions, we accepted a deal with the Western side. But America, under President Trump, hasn’t followed the right path, the right decision. Because of that, this deal is not going well. Banks won’t work with us because of the orders of the United States.
But the protests we are having in Iran is an internal matter. We’ve seen this in other countries too. We are committing to the agreement until the other side commits.
Q: People in the government of Sri Lanka and in the business world are eager to increase the country’s trade relationship with Iran. Are you meeting with any government or business leaders to discuss this?
A: We have historically had a strong relationship with the Sri Lankan people and government. We can open a book about the history of Asia and see the connections between our regions in historical times.
But because of the problems that we have in Iran – the banks or the trade system – it’s not what it was. But we are interested in increasing trade and we know the opportunities in this country are huge. The Chinese have come, India has come, and Iran is also a partner for the Sri Lankan people.
When I landed in the airport last night, when they saw our passports, they had a good reaction, we had a warm welcome. It means Iran and this country have a cradle of kindness. We can find a worth here.
We have problems related to sanctions. But our ambassador in Sri Lanka is working hard towards this goal and so is the government of Sri Lanka, to be pioneers. It’s the time for working, for trading and for cooperation.
We have to accelerate this.
Even now, as you know, more than 13 percent of Sri Lankan tea is exported to Iran. Also some Iranian products are imported to Sri Lanka, like oil, dates and nuts. Even with these sanctions, we have good relations with Sri Lanka. 
"I think it (Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital) was not a correct decision."
