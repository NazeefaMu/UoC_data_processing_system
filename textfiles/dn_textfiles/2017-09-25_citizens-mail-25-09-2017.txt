[CITIZENS' Mail - (25-09-2017)]

No end to SAITM conflict?
The continuous anti-SAITM campaigns, GMOA strikes, boycotts staged on by the medical professionals in front of the Fort railway station put one and all in confusion. Gradually, it has reached its blazing point now. But, some or other, it should end with a concrete solution without protracting the time and energy of the students. All should realize, time is precious and the wasted time cannot be regained at any point. The better the quicker decision and agreement save the life of the students. The great disappointment is that the doctors with great calibre, societal concern and the eminent professors also muscularly show not only negative attitude towards the SAITAM but also discouraging and vehemently rejecting this effort point blankly.
In my point of view, there are many alternative institutions for educational fields to continue, flourish and prowess academically. Likewise, why can’t we accommodate private medical colleges in our country to produce skilful doctors by following a set of standard general rules and regulations? Indeed, our country needs a number of doctors to serve the people. Be that as it may, building up with positive mind set for the benefit and development of the country rather than sending many of our children to foreign countries spending massive lump sum of money where many of the parents cannot afford. Instead of smashing flatly such newly budded sustainable ventures, the experts of the medical field can associate and cross the stream where it is shallowest and bring the agreement at some critical point to rectify the loopholes that they find and give the proper remedy to this issue no sooner than later despite of total pulling down.
It would be the best service and the enormous responsibility expected from the proficient and excellent medical officers who were worshipped as ‘living Gods’ once.
It’s not the time to fuel but to realize the fact and act swiftly in deliberation. As the adage goes, criticism is something you can avoid by saying nothing, doing nothing and being nothing. For the betterment of the country, we should have broader thoughts rather than being in a limited space.
