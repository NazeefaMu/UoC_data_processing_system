Trinity ride their luck to edge out Joes 30-25

St. Joseph’s dished out a superb brand of attacking rugby and gave a torrid time to Trinity throughout the entire game but a quick try by Trinity’s burly centre Warren Weerakoon and a penalty just before the final whistle cost Joes the match.
Trinity actually came from behind 15-20 midway into the second half to snatch victory beating St.Joseph’s by 30 points (5 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) to 25 (3 tries, 2 conversions, 2 penalties) in their Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league rugby second round match played at Havelock Park yesterday.
St.Joseph’s led 17-15 at half time.
Joes scored two tries through fly half Chathura Seneviratne and scrum half Reshan Gunawardena with winger Sachith Silva converting both tries and putting over a 45- metre penalty. Trinity closed down the gap with three unconverted tries scored by lock forward Reshan Madena, flanker cum captain Nathan Yee and scrum half Anouk Boyagoda in the first half.
After the break Joes scored two quick penalties and a try through Sachith Silva and their captain cum winger Vinul Fernando with Sachith missing the conversion whereas Trinity scored an unconverted try through fly half Akitha Sakalasuriya to cut down the lead to 22-20 in favour of the Maradana school.
Trinity sealed the match when centre Warren Weerakoon scored a converted try and a late penalty. Referee Dinka Peiris had a miserable game with the whistle which clearly had an adverse impact on Joes winning this game.
