CICT promotes Port of Colombo at maritime forum in Hong Kong

The role of the Port of Colombo in facilitating imports and exports and supporting trade with India and other subcontinent countries was expounded upon by Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) in a recent presentation to the 2017 Asian Logistics and Maritime Conference (ALMC).
The presentation was made by Tissa Wickramasinghe, Chief Business Development Officer of CICT, during a panel discussion of the conference, which was part of the Hong Kong Maritime Week programme.
Wickramasinghe's presentation explored aspects of the Port Value Chain and the importance of the Port of Colombo to its stakeholders including clients, other users, the industry, and to the entire South Asian region.At the panel discussion, CICT identified the Port as a transshipment hub located strategically in the Indian Subcontinent (ISC), East Africa and Middle East regions serving specific markets and supply chains. Wickramasinghe's presentation drew similarities between the role played by Sri Lanka to the Indian Subcontinent and the role played by Hong Kong to China.
