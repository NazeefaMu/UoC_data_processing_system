China celebrates PLA day

China will celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the Founding of the People’s Liberation Army of China on August 1. In line with this, Chinese Embassy in Colombo held the PLA Day reception recently at the Galle Face Hotel with the participation of the state minister of defence, Ruwan Wijewardene.
The People’s Liberation Army of China was formed on August 1, 1927 and at that time was called the workers and peasants’ revolutionary army. In 1927, the struggle between the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party of China reached its climax. Those who disagreed with the Chiang Kai-shek’s policy, formed a revolutionary communist bloc rousing the people to revolt in Nanchang.
The Communist Party of China upon establishing its authority decided to immortalize this day in history, awarding it a status of a national holiday. In 1946 the workers and peasants’ army was renamed into the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. At present the PLA consists of the air and naval as well as ground forces, and also engineering corps of China. Pictures by Sulochana Gamage
