Questions and answers

Deed of gift subject to life interest
Question
My father gifted me a land and a house with his life interest. Now I am going to renovate the house and make changes to the garden. Do I need the consent from my father to proceed with this work?
Pradeep – Nugegoda
Answer
Your father has gifted the property, keeping his life interest, so if your renovation activities interrupt the procession of the property, then you have to get his consent before you start it. If it is not interrupting your father’s possession, you can continue with your work without his consent, as you are the owner of the property.

Vehicle belonging to a deceased
Question
My father died from a heart attack 3 months ago. He leased a motorbike, and I paid monthly installments and used it. Now I want to sell this bike. Can I do it legally, because the owner is my father according to the documents? Do I need the consent of my mother and sister? Please advise.
Srimal - Welipillawa
Answer
If you want to do a transaction, then you need the consent of your mother and sister. You can get it by an affidavit, according to the Inheritance Law. As your father has died without a last will or transferring the said bike, then half of the ownership belongs to the mother and the other half to you and your sister (1/4 each). However, if you want to get their consent for the transaction, then they have to give it to you by a way of an affidavit. You need to produce the death certificate of your father when you submit the transfer papers to the motor vehicles registrar.
Property issue
Question
I advanced a substantial amount of money from 2004-2014 to a relative to purchase several properties and built a house, totalling Rs. 30 million from time to time on the understanding that they will return it on a future date. Now they say the properties and the house belong to them as all the deeds are in their names and I have no right to ask the money back. I have all the bank records to prove that I have advanced the money. Can I take legal action to recover my money? If so, will I be able to succeed? What is the present prescription period?
Saman – Negombo
Answer
You could have given money based on a sale agreement. But if there is no such agreement, then you can complain to the Fraud Investigation Bureau regarding the fraud committed by your relatives. You can also file a civil action to recover your money, but you have to present suitable evidence to prove your case such as bank records.
Nonpayment of life insurance premium
Question
I have taken a life insurance policy from a reputed Insurance Company. Due to my business failure, I couldn’t pay the insurance premium continuously for 3 months. What will be the consequences? Can I claim the money which I have paid for the insurance so far?
Answer
If premiums are not paid, the life policy can be lapsed. You cannot then get your money back unless there is a ‘maturity value’ or ‘surrender value’ to the policy which is normally a minimum of three years. Also, remember during that time, your life was covered. Some people have asked me to direct the insurance company to refund the premiums paid. You can’t ask the insurance company to refund the premiums you paid, unless there is a ‘surrender value’–because you were protected and covered during that time.
If your life policy lapses because you have not paid premiums on time, the insurer can ask you to fill up a new proposal form to continue the policy. By this time, your health conditions may have changed and deteriorated with age, and you may have developed medical ailments which you have now to disclose. If you had not allowed your earlier policy to lapse, you would not have had the need to fill up a new proposal form and the insurance company had accepted the risks of the ailments that you may have developed.
