Separate Court to hear cases against Buddhist monks needed - Patali

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said that when a Buddhist monk is penalised it should be done in line with the instructions of Mahanayake Theras.
Queried by the media on the imprisonment of Ven.Galabodaatte Gnanasara Thera, during a press conference at the Independence Arcade premises, Minister Ranawaka said that the Constitution has provisions for it.
He also said that there should be a separate Court to hear cases against the Budhist monks.
Minister Ranawaka further said that yet the judges have no option when a case is presented before them except to hear it according to the law.
"But, people are worried as to why the law is not implemented on Avant Garde and Entrust suspects as expeditiously in the same manner as was done against Ven. Galabodaatte Gnanasara Thera," Minister Ranawaka said.
