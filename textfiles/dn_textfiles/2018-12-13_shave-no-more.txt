Shave  no  more!

 
 
 
 
There is so much pressure on women to maintain smooth and hairless skin. Hair removal may be a basic step of most women’s beauty routines but a good wax - whether you do it yourself or trust a pro - requires proper prep and aftercare. Apart from the pain that inevitably comes when your hair is being pulled out from the root, waxing offers many amazing benefits. It is definitely worth it to put up with a little rain if you want to see the rainbow and the pot of gold at the end: silky smooth skin with finer regrowth.
Waxing defined
Waxing is hair removal from the root. Waxing is one of the most effective ways of removing excess or unwanted hair from the body. It involves depilation, which is the removal of the entire hair shaft from below the skin’s surface. It is among the most effective methods of temporary hair removal. There are many types of waxing techniques out there, with warm waxing being the most popular one.

 
 
 
Hair-free span
New hair will not grow back in the previously waxed area for four to six weeks, although some people will start to see regrowth in only a week due to some of their hair being on a different human hair growth cycle.
Almost any area of the body can be waxed, including eyebrows, face, pubic hair (called bikini waxing), legs, arms, back, abdomen, knuckles, and feet. There are many types of waxing methods which are suitable for removing unwanted hair in these specific locations.
The difference between Hard Wax and Strip Wax?
Hard wax is meant for those very sensitive areas such as Brazilians, manzilians, underarms, face and neck. Although, if you do have a preference for strip wax on your Brazilians our Lycon Azulene strip wax is thick and soft in consistency and it doesn’t stick to the skin like most strip waxes making it less painful and more comfortable. An hour after getting waxed with this strip wax you won’t have that after Brazilian wax feeling because it doesn’t have that skin pull.
Strip wax is recommended for large areas of the body such as legs, arms, chest and back. The wax we use is loaded with essential oils and has shrink wrapping capabilities grabbing hair as short as 2mm. This leaves you silky smooth without stubble from broken hairs. Getting a smoother wax without this shrink wrapping technology is near impossible.
Preparing your skin for a waxing treatment
Gently exfoliate your skin a day or two before waxing, but skip harsh scrubs the day of your waxing appointment.
Exfoliation helps wax grab hair and not skin, but it can also leave skin more sensitive to pain. So lighter is better. A rough washcloth is perfect for gentle exfoliation.

Benefits of waxing 
 
Smooth and even skin: One of the best benefits of waxing is that your skin will feel smooth and even. When waxing, you not only remove unwanted hair - you also wax away any dry and dead skin cells in the process!
No cuts or bruises: With waxing, you aren’t at risk to any cuts or nicks that can leave you with scars. This is good news, especially for those who have skin that is susceptible to discoloration due to even the slightest cut.
Stubble free skin: Waxing removes unwanted hair completely, from its roots. Shaving, on the other hand, often results in stubbles, leaving your skin feeling rough and abrasive.
 
 
Irritation and allergies-free: There are minimal chemicals involved in the waxing process, so waxing rarely causes any skin irritation or allergy.
Slow hair re-growth: After waxing, the regrowth of your hair is very slow, often taking four to six weeks. Many say that they have found their hair to be finer, after the regrowth.
Different forms of waxing 
 
Heated soft wax
This type of wax is mostly found in a port and is often softened by a microwave or a warmer.
It is one of the best techniques because the heat makes it easy to spread and also softens the hair and skin thereby lessening waxing pain.
Cold soft wax
Cold soft wax is taken directly from the port and applied on the skin. Even though it is convenient, it is firmer, meaning that you can have a hard time trying to get an even layer. Many people also find cold soft wax more painful than when heated. A downside to this technique is that it can leave hair behind if it is not applied properly.
Pre made strips
In this case, the pre-made strips already have the wax attached.
This type of waxing is not only easy to use, but it also leaves no chance of putting too much of the product. Depending on the amount of hair you are removing, you may use waxing strips more than once on a single area. However, it is always advisable to pre-heat the strips before using by rubbing them between your palms as this enables them to stick well on the hair.
The strip is simply placed on the skin and moved in the direction of the hair. Some of our favourite products are our waxing strips and waxing rolls, made from high-quality, all-natural cotton.
Hard waxing for hair removal
Also known as stripless waxing, this is another popular waxing method for hair removal. This is because it does not require a strip to remove hair. It is often warmed slightly, but can be used at room temperature or cold. Hard wax for hair removal is applied thicker than soft but in the direction of hair growth and works great for areas with thick hair growth. Hard wax is also useful for smaller, more sensitive areas.
