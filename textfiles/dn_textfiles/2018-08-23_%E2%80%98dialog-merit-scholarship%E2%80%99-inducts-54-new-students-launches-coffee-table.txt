‘Dialog Merit Scholarship’ inducts  54 new students, Launches coffee table book

Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s connectivity provider, inducted 54 new students into the prestigious ‘Dialog Merit Scholarship’ programme. The programme supports the higher education of students with outstanding academic performance based on their G.C.E Ordinary Level and G.C.E Advanced Level examination results, who aspire to be engineers. Coinciding with the induction was the launch of the volume ‘Alumni Journeys’, a selection of pen sketches of some past and present Dialog Merit Scholars on their journeys in becoming leading knowledge workers.
This book reinforces the importance of recognising students’ achievements and providing the next generation of students with inspirations – allowing them to flourish intellectually and personally to make a positive impact on society.
Launched in 2003, the programme has provided over 680 scholarships over 15 years to exceptional students with a commitment exceeding Rs. 100 Mn. The scholarship garners the support of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Higher Education and the University Grants Commission. The effort to support high achievers aligns with Dialog’s commitment to one of the Sustainable Development Goals - ‘Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning’.
Commenting on the occasion Supun Weerasinghe, Group Chief Executive, Dialog Axiata PLC said, “The Dialog Merit Scholarship Programme is aimed at empowering outstanding students from across Sri Lanka to accomplish their future aspirations. This is a holistic approach towards education – from Ordinary Levels to higher education and beyond.”
He added “ICT plays a pivotal role in the growth and development of a nation, and Dialog’s goal is to make education and technology affordable and accessible to all segments of society. ”
The 54 high achievers recognized at the event were chosen based on the results of the 2014 and 2015 Advanced Level examinations and were formally inducted into the programme in the presence of guest of honour, Dumindra Ratnayaka, by training an engineer himself and the current Chairman of the Board of Investment (BOI) of Sri Lanka.
Dumindra Ratnayaka, Chairman, Board of Investment of Sri Lanka said, “It is vital to build and support the future of engineers – those who will be instrumental in taking Sri Lanka to greater heights. We need such programmes to encourage in-country talent and ensure we build a talent pipeline – in giving back to the nation.”
Sharing his thoughts on the Dialog Merit Scholarship Programme, Sapumal Walisundara, an undergraduate from the University of Moratuwa and a Dialog Merit Scholar said, “Becoming a Dialog Merit scholar is an unforgettable milestone in my life. In addition to being rewarded for my achievements, this will help me focus and pursue my greater goal of becoming an engineer.”
Further, Dialog aims to provide these students with soft skills and exposure to the latest technological trends. Majority of these Dialog Scholars have joined top-notch corporates and even created their own businesses.
