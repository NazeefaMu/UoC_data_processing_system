Team performance and commercial values not related

Ten Sports Taj Television CEO Rajesh Sethi said that performance and commercial values were not related to each other when they assess teams.
Tomorrow Zimbabwe can be the no 1 team but the commercial value of that team won't increase. Winning and losing and commercial aspects are not linked, its not linear, he said.
Replying to a question how his company rated teams when they had their highs and lows, Sethi said, The right spirit of partnership is that you have to be through with your partner through thick and thin and we follow that. There are times the sun is shining and they are doing great and there are days when it's a bit cloudy. You can't choose to alter your behaviour with your partner depending on the day you have to be with him through thick and thin.
Explaining what makes a company like Ten Sports so unique from other broadcasters, Sethi said, We take a 360 degree view of sports. We have a significant play into cricket where we work with big cricketing boards around the world and have very deep associations with each one of them. We have a significant play in football. We have a lot of football properties like the UEFA, French League, India's I league, Australia's A league. We have a very significant play when it comes to football.
Then we have a third segment called sports entertainment. We have a marquee property like WWE, we also have a significant play into what we call multi-sports events where we are the rights holders of Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, Tour de France, and have significant play into tennis as well. We believe in offering complete 360 degree experience to our audience wherein we don't constrain ourselves to any one property and we cover across the spectrum.
We are also ensuring that we provide multi-screen experience to our viewers. We have started doing streaming on alternative devices as well.
We are very boundary less as an organization and we believe in having an external focus. For us each and every one watching a TV channel is a stake holder, all the partners we have, all the cricket boards, are our stake holders. We are pretty grounded and to put it in a blunt manner we have our ears and eyes on the ground and very closely associated with each and every stake holder who is part of our overall universe, he said.
To get the combination working smoothly Sethi said they were all driven by a common threat which is passion for the game.
We all love sports, sports is all about celebrating life. We all get our adrenalin rushing and pumped up when you talk about any sporting event coming up. We love it and we love what we are doing and the love for the game brings us where we all are, said Sethi.
There are 200 people in our Ten Sports team and you will find a believer of each and every sport amongst these 200 people.
Explaining how Ten Sport picks their staff, Sethi said, You must have high energy and be passionate about what you are doing. These are the core fundamentals we look into at each person we hire in our team.
The person has to be passionate about what they are doing and have high energy and spirit of team work. Sport is all about team work. We have a great set of people together. We love and fight together, an absolutely fantastic team.
