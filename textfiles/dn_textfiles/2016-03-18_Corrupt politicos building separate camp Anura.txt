Corrupt politicos building separate camp: Anura

 
Politicians who were involved in corruption, waste and murder seem to be building a separate political camp so that they will not be punished, JVP leader and parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa handed over the chairmenship of the SLFP to President Maithripala Sirisena and came back to politics to protect his family, Dissanayake said at a press conference at the JVP Head Office auditorium at Pelawatta, Battaramulla. He said when there was terrorism, the TID was set up while the FCID was set up to investigate the massive corruption and waste.
"So far 193 complaints have been filed before the FCID and reports of 34 investigations on those complaints have been sent to the Attorney General's Department," MP Dissanayake said. "Charges have been filed against four accused in four such incidents."
Dissanayake said those against whom complaints have been made before the FCID would be seen at Thursday's Joint Opposition stage at Hyde Park grounds.
