Introducing Shakespeare to the local audience

The Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka saw its inauguration on January 1, 1990 with the initiative of Obinmuni Gamini de Silva. The first discussion for this had been initiated with Sarath Dikkumbura, Ms Nayana Kumari, Sampath Arunasiri, Ashoka Muniwarage and Mahinda K. Premasiri seated as a special invitee.
Obinamuni Gamini de Silva took his oath as the President of the Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka officially establishing it in the presence of the President J R Jayawardena on 16th January, 1990. This moment was witnessed by the Deputy British High Commissioner, E J Field Esq., The Deputy Director of the British Council, Colombo, Dr Marcus Milton, Prof. Tissa Kariyawasam, Prof. A J Gunawardena with Obinamuni Liswith de Silva. Obinamuni Gamini de Silva produced a report of objectives, projects, code of discipline and goals set for the period oif next 25 years.
 It was emphasized that ‘we’ present our project against the bedrock of Royal Shakespeare Company GB, that ‘we’ commit ‘ourselves’ to its discipline and regulations and that ‘we’ produce Shakespearean Literature of Theatre only with Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka as the Centre’s main discipline. Dr. Marcus Milton asserted that it was the basic policy and discipline of the Royal Shakespeare Company, adding that Obinamuni Gamini de Silva must be sufficiently, aware of such specifications as a former student of the Company. The other guests did not forget to come up with their note of good visions.
President J R Jayawardena invoking this compliments expressed that drama and theatre, acting, cinema should be studied, that Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka is a proper place for those who strive to learn theatre and that such an education can discipline and produce ‘good’ actors for the country. This was accompanied by his emphasis that the Centre should not deflect from its focus on the set of principles in the face of any challenge. Because, in a country like Sri Lanka, the activation of the centre, can get openly restrained. Therefore, that the policy be reinforced.
The President’s Private Secretary and the Director General of the J R Jayawardana Centre, Premathila,a Mapitigama took part in this event by way of organizing. Sarath dikkumbura, Nayana Kumari, Sampath Arunasiri, Asoka Muniwarage, Darmapala de Silva, Nimal Weerakkodi, Nayana Kumari, Sampath Arunasiri, Asoka Muniwarage, Darmapala de Silva, Nimal Weerakkodi, Deepani Silva, Piyal Chandana Perera, Anura Atigala, Wimal Dissanayaka, Ananda Senarath Yatagara, Laksiri Mendis, Samanthi Manage, Ajith Deshapriya, Ajantha Ranasinghe, Ajithy Jayasinghe, Sujeewa Shiromi, Kumudu Karunarathna, Upali Senarathna, Priyangani Dedigama, Susantha Pushpakumara, A M A Niyaz, Nirmala Perera, Sujeewa Herath, the members of the workshop on drama and theatre were the founding members of the Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka. It is our duty to recall Saman Chandrarathna who organized the workshop.

At the same time, our honourable advisers, President J R Jayawardena, Prof. Tissa Kariyawasam, Prof. A J Gunawardena, Prof. Carlo Fonseka, Prof. Nandadasa Kodagoda, General Cyril Ranathunga, Dr Karunasena Kodithuwakku, Dr Nelufer de Mel, Tissa Jayathilaka, Jayasumana Dissanayaka, Dharmasiri Gamage, Dr Tissa Abeysekara, Lakshman Jayakody, Dr Lakshmi de Silva, Dr Chanaka Amarathunga, Dr Sunil Wijesiriwardena, Dr Edwin Ariyadasa, Dr Gamini Hathhettuwegama, Visharad Lionel Ranwala, Commander Tissa Gunathilake, Rear Admiral Ananda Peiris, Rear Admiral Harsha Mayadunna, Rear Admiral Nihal Obeysinghe, Rear Admiral Wasantha Fernando, earnestly strengthened as with their valuable instructions to socialize the Shakespeare Centre within the Local perimeter.
Social activists such as Dr Paneeth Abeysundara, Prof. Mudiyanse Dissanayaka, Prof. Gamini Dela Bandara, Justice Pradeep Jayathilaka, President Counselor Wasantha Nawarathna Bandara, Dr Deshapriya S Wijethunga, Dr Damith de Silva, Dr Malitha Wijesundara, Saman Athaudahetti, Dr. Asangi Jayasinghe, Dr. Premadasa Sri Alawaththage, Dr Rajitha Senarathna, Senarath Kapukotuwa, Jeewan Kumaranathunga, Dr Leel Gunasekara, Prof. Chandrasiri Palliyaguru, Dr Mirando Obeysekara, Palitha Gamage stretch their hands of consistent support.
Similar to Obinamuni Gamini de Silva’s efforts to incorporate the contribution of the above important personnel, the dedication by Sarath Dikkumbura, Nayana Kumari, Montague Sarathchandra, R G Wijesuriya, between 1990-1994 deserves the highest from of praise. The loss of 16 Sri 567 Toyota Corolla in 1993 as a result of the loan we had taken in 1992 to fund the Macbeth production makes a sorrowful gesture in our memory even today, because of its immaculate companionship.
Prof. Tissa Kariyawasam articulated once that Obinamuni Gamini de Silva dedicated his wealth and knowledge for the development of the centre by sacrificing his trade and business.
‘Othello’ emerging in 1990 was debatable representation of Shakespeare’s modern theatrical strategies of theatre, literature and theatre, thus making a leeway in the local arena. ‘Othello’ was staged in 2001, 2011 and 2016 as new productions. ‘Othello’ is all about a ‘School of Acting’. The measures are underway to take out ‘Othello’ in Tamil.
The system of politics and discipline as enacted by the Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka is quite sensitive. The remarkable nomination as Sri Lanka’s only voluntary institute of drama by the United Nations Volunteers, and the goodwill of the International Theatre Institute and Royal Shakespeare Company invest in us is their pride.
