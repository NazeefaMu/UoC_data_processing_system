SL, Luxembourg to boost business ties

Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana went on an official visit to Luxembourg on September 27. This was the first visit of a Sri Lankan Foreign Minister to Luxembourg since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1972.
Foreign Minister Marapana had a breakfast meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg Jean Asselborn at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Luxembourg. It was noted that Luxembourg is among the top 15 Foreign Direct Investors in Sri Lanka and there is tremendous potential for further investment. Luxembourg as one of the world’s top financial centres has interest in capital investments and there are several of the world’s leading multinational companies that have their headquarters based in Luxembourg. The two Ministers agreed to further strengthen bilateral relations with particular focus on economic opportunities. They undertook to facilitate the upcoming visit of a business delegation from Sri Lanka to Luxembourg in this regard.
Minister Marapana invited Luxembourg Foreign Minister Asselborn to visit Sri Lanka at an early opportunity.
Foreign Minister Marapana also met with Andrew McDowell, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and attended a business luncheon with senior officials at the bank’s headquarters in Luxembourg. The possibility of entering into a financing agreement for several major infrastructure development projects under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Region Development was discussed.
The Foreign Minister also visited the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which is the highest European Court and met with Prof. Justice Koen Lenaerts, KC, President of the European Court of Justice and discussed issues of mutual interest.
