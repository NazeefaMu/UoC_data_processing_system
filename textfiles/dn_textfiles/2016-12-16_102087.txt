Pension scheme for artistes

A pension scheme will be introduced for artistes by the Sri Lanka Social Security Board with the support of the Department of Cultural Affairs, Social Security Board chairman Keerthi Suranjith Mawallage said.
On the advice of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S.B. Nawinna and Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayaka, the officers of both institutes held discussions and the Cultural Affairs Department agreed to provide Rs. 44.4 million to the Social Security Board to commence the programme.
It is expected that from the second anniversary of the President assuming duty, the artistes will receive the pension.
Eligible artists will be selected by the Cultural Affairs Department.
All artistes between the ages of 22 and 55 are eligible. The artistes who contribute to the scheme initially will be eligible for a special bonus of Rs. 50,000 at the time of receiving benefits.
All artistes contributing at time of death, partially disabled, or fully disabled will receive huge benefits.
