EU has no power to take action against Sri Lanka - Keheliya

The European Union Constitution does not permit them to take any action against Sri Lanka, Co-Cabinet Spokesperson and Mass Media and Digital Infrastructure, State Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said.
The State Minister was speaking on the statement released by the European Union, calling for Parliament to have a vote on the Prime Minister.
He added that these actions of the EU can in no way be acceptable to a sovereign nation.
“The European Union has no power to take action against the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and it is unfortunate that a foreign entity is thus interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation.
The opportunity to interfere thus has been granted through the invitation of individuals like former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Mangala Samaraweera and Malik Samarawickrama,” he said. The Minister further added that it was shameful to see such countries interfering with the independence of a sovereign nation and that the Government was and will always only act in accordance with Parliamentary procedures, tradition and its own Constitution.
