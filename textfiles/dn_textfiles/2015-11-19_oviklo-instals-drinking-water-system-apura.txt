OVIKLO instals drinking water system in A'pura

OVIKLO International, a Logistic Solutions Provision sector in Sri Lanka, was instrumental in installing a water access system in a rural school, struggling to provide access to clean water to its staff and students.
With assistance of Divisional Secretary in Palugaswewa, the Company was able to identify the Galapitagala Vidyalaya in Palugaswava, a school that was enduring considerable hardship as a result of its exceedingly limited access to fresh, clean water. Before the initiative, 180 students and 16 staff members of the Galapitagala School had access to only a single tube well to fulfil their water requirements.
Commenting on the OVIKLO International contribution to the Galapitagala Vidyalaya, School Principal Nalini Damayanthi said, "Our students come from families with very severe financial and social difficulties. Therefore unlike many main District Schools, we can expect very little support from the parents to maintain the school infrastructure and facilities."
"Our water problem was very severe previously so parents who lived close by had to bring water in pots every day in the morning for the children to use during mealtimes. Some little time back we were able to install a tube well to access running water in the school. However the water was often full of grit and couldn't be used for drinking purposes."
The OVIKLO CSR team used its expertise to install a sustainable water access system through a robust tap line system and additionally, donated notice boards, a first aid box and educational materials, as required by the deserving students at the school.
As an an ISO certified company OVIKLO delivers holistic logistic service, and has managed to earn the a stellar reputation for excellence in the fields of warehousing, transport, value added services and project cargo management.
The Company brings the same degree of innovation and fervor to its community outreach programmes as it does to its business operations. The most recent such Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) venture involved re-venturing in to the Palugasweva DS area in Anuradhapura.
