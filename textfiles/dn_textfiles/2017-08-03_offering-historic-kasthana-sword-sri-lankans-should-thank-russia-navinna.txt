Offering historic Kasthana sword: Sri Lankans should thank Russia: Navinna

Sri Lankans should thank Russia and its President Vladimir Putin for their gesture to offer a historic Kasthana sword used by a Kandyan chieftain during the 19th century, Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S. B. Navinna said.
He made this observation yesterday dressing the handing over ceremony of the historic dagger (Kasthana sword) gifted to President Maithripala Sirisena by Russian President Vladimir Putin during his official visit to Russia, to the National Museum. The ceremony was held at the National Museum auditorium.
The Kasthana sword comprising Kandyan decorative art which was a prominent part of official attire of the Kandyan chieftain had been taken out of the country during the British administration to a destination in England. It had been displayed at an auction of antique items belonging to royal household and other dignitaries in 2006 and purchased by an anonymous Russian. However, Russian President Putin gifted the sword as a memento to President Sirisena.
Minister Navinna said Russian President Putin had a great respect to Sri Lanka and President Sirisena. He said Europe and other countries accept President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe due to the novel political tradition adopted by the country.
