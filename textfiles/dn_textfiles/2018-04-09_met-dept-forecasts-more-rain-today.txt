Met Dept. forecasts more rain today

Showers or thundershowers will occur over most provinces of the island after 2.00 p.m. today due to low-level atmospheric disturbance in the south of Sri Lanka, the Meteorology Department yesterday stated.
Showers or thundershowers will occur in the Southern, Eastern and Uva Provinces today morning as well. Cloudy skies can be expected in the southern half of the island.
The Meteorology Department requested the general public to take adequate precautions to prevent damage or injury from lightning.
Heavy rainfall above 75mm can be expected at some places, particularly in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces and in the Galle and Matara Districts.
Misty conditions can be expected at some places in the Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces during the morning.
On marine weather, the Meteorology Department said that showers or thundershowers will occur in the sea areas off the coast extending from Colombo to Batticaloa via Galle and Hambantota, today. Heavy rainfall can be expected at some places. Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in other sea areas in the evening or night.
Winds will be north-easterly to south-easterly in direction in the sea areas off the coast extending from Kankasanturai to Hambantota via Batticaloa and winds will be variable in direction in other sea areas. Temporarily very strong gusty winds and rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.
“On the apparent northward relative motion of the sun, it is going to be directly over the latitudes of Sri Lanka till April 15. The nearest areas of Sri Lanka over which the sun will be overhead today are Chilaw, Munamaldeniya, Moragana, Kutupotha, Ibbagamuwa and Laggala, at about 12:11 pm.”
