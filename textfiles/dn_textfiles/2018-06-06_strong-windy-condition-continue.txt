Strong windy condition to continue

 
Strong winds are expected to continue over the island and in the sea areas, due to the active south-west monsoon, the Meteorology Department said.
Prevailing showery and cloudy conditions in south-western part of the island will also enhance.
Rains or thundershowers will occur particularly in Sabaragamuwa, Western, North Western, Southern and Central provinces and Kaluthara, Ampara, Badulla, Batticaloa, Galle and Mathara districts.
