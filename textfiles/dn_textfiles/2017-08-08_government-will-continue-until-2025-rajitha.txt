Government will continue until 2025: Rajitha

A decision will be made in 2025 on whether to form a new government. The National Government will continue until then, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
According to Minister Senaratne, the Government will continue its work and programmes until 2020 and then up to 2025. "Nobody will be able to topple the Government until we are in the Government," he had stated.
He was addressing the gathering after opening the new State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) outlet in Anuradhapura on August 6.
Minister Senaratne had stated that the persons who boast about toppling the Government would be in prisons by 2025. The members in the Government do not know how to communicate information on the work they carry out. They work hard but do not know how to tell people about the work they did, he had stated.
Some doctors try to sabotage the programme which offers free lenses to eye patients who undergo cataract surgeries in the state hospitals because they have lost the benefits received from drug companies, the Minister had stated.
