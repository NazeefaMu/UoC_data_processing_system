Maussakele, Castlereigh reservoirs at risk of overflow

 
National Water Supply and Drainage Board Engineers warned today that water levels in Maussakele and Castlereigh reservoirs will overflow soon due to constant rainfall in the up country region.
The Water Board Engineers said that the water levels indicated 14 feet and 9 feet, 2 inches in the two reservoirs respectively.
Maussakele and Castlereigh reservoirs supplies water to Laxapana, New Laxapana, Polpitiya, Canyon and Wimalasurendra dams of the Laxapana hydro power plant complex and five other power plants.
