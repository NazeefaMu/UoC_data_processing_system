AIA Vitality, a new internet platform for healthy living launched

The AIA Vitality, a first of its kind in Sri Lanka, which is a science-backed wellness programme that provides participants with the knowledge, tools and motivation to improve their health was introduced recently.
AIA Vitality is an easy-to-use application which can be downloaded free from the Google play-store or the Apple app-store. It gives one weekly targets which can be achieved by staying active, such as working out in the gym, running, or quite simply, just walking. If you achieve the weekly targets, you get rewarded with a choice of exciting rewards, including mobile top-ups, movie tickets, discount vouchers from e-tailers and taxi vouchers.
AIA CEO Pankaj Banerjee emphasised “AIA Vitality uses extensive science backed research and behavioural economics, which shows that incentives can work to encourage people towards adopting and sustaining healthier behaviours.” He added, “AIA’s mission is to help people live, longer, healthier, better lives. We really want to focus on the customer on helping them in taking care of their health and wellness.
Chief Marketing Officer Nikhil Advani said “Life insurance has always been associated with, well, death and claims. But that’s exactly the perception we want to change. We’re changing the message of ’you die, we pay,’ to ‘we’ll help you live a better life’. The programme has been tremendously successful in other AIA markets and we are excited to launch it in Sri Lanka.”
