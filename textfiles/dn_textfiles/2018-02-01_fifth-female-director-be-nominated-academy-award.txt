Fifth female director to be nominated for an Academy Award

It was a good day for women in Hollywood after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences righted a wrong committed at the Golden Globes with Greta Gerwig bagging her maiden nod in the Best Director category for 'Ladybird'. Gerwig has now become the fifth woman to be recognised in at the directors round table in the Oscars history.
The actor-director, who also scored a nod in the Best Original Screenplay category, joins the likes of Lina Wertmuller ('Seven Beauties'), Jane Campion ('The Piano'), Sofia Coppola ('Lost in Translation') and Kathryn Bigelow ('The Hurt Locker'). Bigelow is the only woman to have ever won the Oscar in the segment.
Actor Natalie Portman had taken a dig at the Golden Globe Awards for having 'all male nominees' in the top five directors list. Gerwig has also been nominated for Achievement in a Feature Film when the nominations for Directors Guild of America Awards were announced. ANI
