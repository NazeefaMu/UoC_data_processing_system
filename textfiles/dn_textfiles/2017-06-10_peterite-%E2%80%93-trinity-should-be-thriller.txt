Peterite – Trinity should be a thriller

St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya will be at full strength and raring to go when they take on Trinity College Kandy in their Milo ‘A’ Division inter-schools knockout rugby quarterfinal match at the Sugathadasa Stadium today at 4:15pm.
Led by nippy full back Diyath Fernando the Peterites got some good players who could be match winners for the Bambalapitiya outfit.
Players such as fly half and playmaker Steffen Sivaraj, centre Theekshana Dassanayaka, number eight Angelo Mendis, flanker Sajith Saram, scrum half Raveen Fernando and skipper Diyath Fernando should be marked well by the Trinitians if not they will be in deep trouble like they got into the league game.
The Peterites, one of the strongest contenders for the Milo knockout championship this year, will be out for another shock win when they meet Trinity. The Peterites coached by former junior Sri Lanka coaches Colin Denish and Terence Henry, should have things their own way in this encounter.
The Bambalapitiya school in the just concluded league tournament beat the Antonians, D.S. Senanayake, Isipathana, Zahira and formidable Trinity but lost to Royal, Wesley, Dharmaraja and drew with S. Thomas’ in a tense battle.
Playmaker Sivaraj’s kicking boot will play a major role in this game.
Meanwhile Trinitians the dark horse of the Milo knockout, will be out for a quarterfinal win and keep their chances alive to move forward to grab the Cup championship. They will be heavily depend on their skipper Nathan Yee, playmaker cum half back Anouka Boyagoda, the two Bandaranayake brothers Reshan and Rashen, hooker Weliwatte, prop forward Aveesha Priyankara, centres Waren Weerakoon and Dilukshan Dange together with fly half Akitha Sakalasuriya.
Trinity lost two games within close margins to St. Peter’s and Royal but got the better of the Wesley, Science, Zahira, S. Thomas’, Prince of Wales, St. Joseph’s and Isipathana in the just concluded league tourney.
Going by the two teams performances so far, this encounter should be a close tussle for supremacy with St. Peter’s holding a slight edge over Trinity as they beat them 15-13 in the league match.
