German Tech Principal steps down

The Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute (CGTTI) Principal who was under a cloud over allegations of soliciting sexual favours to pass students has tendered his resignation.
A new Principal would be appointed shortly, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody said responding to a query by NFF MP Jayantha Samaraweera in Parliament yesterday. The minister said the newspaper advertisement calling for applications from eligible candidates for the post of Principal and Director of the German Tech Institute was published yesterday. “As soon as we came to know the incident, we commenced a disciplinary inquiry.
“We will not let anybody to spoil the good name of this reputed institution,” he added.
A video clip depicting the misbehaviour of the former German Tech Principal went viral on social media recently.
