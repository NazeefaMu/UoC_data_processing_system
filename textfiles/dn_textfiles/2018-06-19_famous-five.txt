Famous five

India’s Salman Rushdie made it twice. He was chosen the best Booker recipient at the 25th and the 40th anniversary of England’s Man Booker Prize. At the Man Booker Prize Golden Jubilee, however, Rushdie lost the competition. Instead, V S Naipaul stepped into the shortlist scaffold.
England’s Man Booker Prize committee has made it a custom to choose the best of its winners – perhaps lest they recede into a distant memory. The 25th, 40th and now the 50th anniversary is an offshoot of that custom.
What’s so special about England’s golden man booker prize shortlist? Five decades have elapsed since the literary award, well regarded as the most sophisticated prize in the English-speaking world. Several plans of global scale are afoot to celebrate the anniversary. Many literary festivals will be there to look forward to.
Yet what matters above all is that the semi-centennial event has a Sri Lankan connection.
Michael Ondaatje, whose ‘The English Patient’ won the Booker Prize in 1992, has been shortlisted for the Golden Booker Prize shortlist along with four more. Ondaatje’s book has been chosen out of all the Booker prize winners of the 1990 decade. The Sri Lankan-born Canadian novelist founded the Gratiaen Prize with the money he received as the Booker Prize for The English Patient.
Adjudged ‘Golden Five’, the chosen books include In a Free State by V S Naipaul, Moon Tiger by Penelope Lively, The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje, Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel and Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders. Like the 25th and the 40th anniversary, this will be a fight in close range.
The winner will be announced at the Southbank Centre, London, on July 8. If Ondaatje chances upon the covetous prize, it will mark the end of Indian dominance in English literature. The chosen book can be deemed universal that withstands five decades. The single best work of fiction published since the award’s inception in 1969 – that’s no simple deal.
The fifty-one winners from the half-century history of the prize will all now be in contention for the Golden Man Booker, whose authors include the likes of George Saunders, Michael Ondaatje, Ian McEwan and Margaret Atwood. These books will be judged by a panel of five judges who will each read selections from one decade. The judges include Hollie McNish (2010s), Simon Mayo (2000s), Kamila Shamsie (1990s), Lemn Sissay (1980s) and Robert McCrum (1970s).
The list is now open to the public on an online voting platform. The voting will be on till June 25. The overall winner will be crowned the recipient of the Golden Man Booker prize at the Man Booker Festival on July 8. The festival will run from July 6 to 8 and will take place in London’s Southbank Centre.
A list of the numerous literary festival partnerships and collaborations, as well as details on the full Man Booker Festival program, will be made available in the coming weeks.

The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje
Set in 1945, The English Patient explores the lives of four very disparate war torn people, a young woman and three men, who take refuge in a damaged villa north of Florence as the war retreats around them. In an upstairs room lies the badly burned English patient, alive but unable to move. His extraordinary adventures and turbulent love affair in the North African desert before the war provide the focus around which the vivid tales of his companions revolve. His very presence will forever change the destiny of those around him.
Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders
On 22 February 1862, two days after his death, Willie Lincoln is laid to rest in a marble crypt in a Georgetown cemetery. That very night, shattered by grief, his father Abraham arrives at the cemetery, alone, under cover of darkness.
Over the course of that evening, Abraham Lincoln paces the graveyard unsettled by the death of his beloved boy, and by the grim shadow of a war that feels as though it is without end. Meanwhile Willie is trapped in a state of limbo between the dead and the living – drawn to his father with whom he can no longer communicate, existing in a ghostly world populated by the recently passed and the long dead.
Unfolding in the graveyard over a single night, narrated by a dazzling chorus of voices, Lincoln in the Bardo is a thrilling exploration of death, grief and the deeper meaning and possibilities of life.
Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel
England in the 1520s is a heartbeat from disaster. If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years, and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe oppose him. The quest for the petulant king’s freedom destroys his advisor, the brilliant Cardinal Wolsey, and leaves a power vacuum and a deadlock. Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell. Son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a bully and a charmer, Cromwell has broken all the rules of a rigid society in his rise to power, and is prepared to break some more. Rising from the ashes of personal disaster - the loss of his young family and of Wolsley, his beloved patron - he picks his way deftly through a court where ‘man is wolf to man’. Pitting himself against parliament, the political establishment and the papacy, he is prepared to reshape England to his own and Henry’s desires.
From one of our finest living writers, Wolf Hall is that very rare thing: a truly great English novel, one that explores the intersection of individual psychology and wider politics. With a vast array of characters, and richly overflowing with incident, it peels back history to show us Tudor England as a half-made society, moulding itself with great passion and suffering and courage.
Moon Tiger by Penelope Lively
Claudia Hampton, a beautiful, famous writer, lies dying in hospital. But, as the nurses tend to her with quiet condescension, she is plotting her greatest work: ‘a history of the world ... and in the process, my own’. Gradually she re-creates the rich mosaic of her life and times, conjuring up those she has known. There is Gordon, her adored brother; Jasper, the charming, untrustworthy lover and father of Lisa, her cool, conventional daughter; and Tom, her one great love, both found and lost in wartime Egypt.
In a Free State by V.S. Naipaul
In the beginning it is just a car trip through Africa. Two English people – Bobby, a civil servant with a guilty appetite for African boys, and Linda, a supercilious ‘compound wife’ – are driving back to their enclave after a stay in the capital.
But in between lies the landscape of an unnamed country whose squalor and ethnic bloodletting suggest Idi Amin’s Uganda. And the farther Naipaul’s protagonists travel into it, the more they find themselves crossing the line that separates privileged outsiders from horrified victims.
Judges of five decades: Robert McCrum (1970s), Lemn Sissay (1980s), Kamila Shamsie (1990s),Simon Mayo (2000s) and Hollie McNish (2010s).
