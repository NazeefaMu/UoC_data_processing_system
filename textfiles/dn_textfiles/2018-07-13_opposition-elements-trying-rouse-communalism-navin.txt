Opposition elements trying  to rouse communalism - Navin

UNP National Organiser and Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said yesterday that certain elements in the Opposition are trying to arouse communalism and separatism in a big way.
Addressing a media briefing at the UNP Headquarters Siri Kotha yesterday, the Minister said they (Opposition) are spreading false information that the government was trying to divide the country through a new Constitution, removing Army camps from the North and allowing the LTTE to have commemorations in the North.
“These elements who represent the views and concerns of the Rajapaksa family also urge for a new leader for the country,” the Minister said.
“We vehemently reject all these allegations. We have not allowed to remove a single Army camp in the North. However, some LTTE supporters have suddenly held two or three LTTE commemorations without any prior announcements.
There is no state involvement and sponsorship for these commemorations. We stopped these activities as soon as we got the information. Since many UNP leaders including my father the late Minister Gamini Dissanayake was killed by the LTTE, we will never allow LTTE to rise again so long as we are in the power,” he added.
The Minister said the Parliamentary seat of former State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran should be nullified for her pro-LTTE statement.
“A party-level inquiry will be held by the three Member Committee appointed to probe into the controversial statement made by the former State Minister and disciplinary action will be taken against her accordingly. She may as well lose her MP position after the inquiry,” he said.
