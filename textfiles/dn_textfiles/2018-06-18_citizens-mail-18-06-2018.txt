Buddhism forbids violence for resolving conflicts
Buddhism is not a religion associated with violence. Buddhism forbids violence for resolving conflicts. Ahimsa is a key word in Buddhism. Ahimsa means not to injure. It is a primary virtue in Buddhism.
The Buddha condemned killing or harming living beings and encouraged mindfulness or Satipattana as a right action (conduct). The rightness or wrongness of an action centres around whether the action itself would bring harm to self and/or others.
Non-violence is the heart of Buddhist thinking and behaviour. Avoid killing or harming any living thing is the first of the five precepts (Panchaseela) in Buddhism.
As Buddhists, wherever we go we must carry the intention of peace, love and harmony in our heart.
Life’s purpose of happiness can be gained only if people cultivate the basic human values of compassion, caring and forgiveness. Recently we saw in newspapers and on TV, some Buddhist monks and laymen behaving in a violent manner.
This type of violent behaviour is against Buddhist teachings. The whole world is watching to see how we behave as Buddhists. When Buddhist priests behave in a violent manner, they are damaging the image Buddhists are having as peace-loving people.
As Buddhist leaders we must remember that we are always peaceloving and against any form of violence.
Buddhist monks and laymen should be very careful of the way they behave in front of cameras of journalists. We should not damage the reputation that Buddhism is a religion that is against any form of violence.
