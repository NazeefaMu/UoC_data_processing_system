H’tota port agreement makes country lose benefits: GL

The country will deprive of more advantages due to the proposed Hambantota port agreement, former External Affairs Minister Prof. G. L. Peiris said yesterday.
He said no party has proposed such an agreement which is most disadvantageous to the country.
Addressing the media at a press conference in Colombo yesterday, the former External Affairs Minister said the Employees’ Provident Fund incurred a loss of Rs. 1,000 million due to the Treasury Bond issue. “The national assets built by the government led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa are being sold out for a song to recover this loss,” he said.
He said the government has no option other than selling out national resources due to the massive frauds allegedly committed by the government’s big wigs. Prof. Peiris said certain clauses of the proposed deal violate the sovereignty of the country as ship handling and operation of the port are handled by a foreign company.
