Construction work in Matale stagnates without soil

Work in the construction sector in Matale is standstill due to a severe shortage of soil after relevant regulations on soil transportation were tightened by authorities, contractors said.
Over 3,000 workers will lose their jobs if the situation prevails, they said.
Even private construction work in the District has stopped as a result, residents of the area said.
They say certain groups excavate soil illegally at different places and regional politicians and administrators support them. The residents say an illegally excavated cube of soil is sold at over Rs. 10,000.
A few unscrupulous people benefit from the illegal activity, they said.
