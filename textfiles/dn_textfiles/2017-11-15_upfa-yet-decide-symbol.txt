UPFA yet to decide on symbol

Since a large number of political parties have expressed their willingness to contest in an alliance with the SLFP at the forthcoming local government election, the UPFA’s Executive Committee will decide whether to contest under the hand symbol or any other symbol, Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front (SLFPYF) Chairman Shantha Bandara said yesterday.
However, many SLFPers prefer to contest under the hand symbol and the SLFP’s final decision on the election symbol will be taken at the Central Committee meeting scheduled to be held soon.
He said, a collective agreement has to be reached by all, since many parties have expressed their willingness to join with the SLFP. Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said the SLFP was preparing for the election by appointing new organizers, reforming party branches and strengthening its conferences at grassroots levels.
