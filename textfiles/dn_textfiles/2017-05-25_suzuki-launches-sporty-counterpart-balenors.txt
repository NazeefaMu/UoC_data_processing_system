Suzuki launches sporty counterpart BalenoRS

The front-runner of the automobile sector in India, Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL), recently launched the invincible sporty counterpart of their latest crossover utility vehicle, Suzuki Baleno.
Suzuki Baleno’s latest variant, the BalenoRS (Road Sport) has been able to accelerate its way into the high performance league with the 1.0L Boosterjet direct Injection turbocharged engine offering 20% more power and 30% more torque compared to a naturally aspirated 1.2L petrol engine, which makes Suzuki BalenoRS an exceptional drive in tropical conditions both in urban and suburban terrains.
The Baleno RS offers a smooth and peppy ride across all driving conditions, thanks to peak torque available within a wide range of RPM (150Nm @ 1700-4500 RPM).
This means, the driver can drive effortlessly without frequent change of gears. Boosterjet is a powerful combination of two technologies: direct fuel injection and a turbocharger.
The Baleno RS effectively responds to the driver’s command for acceleration and performance, thanks to the powerful all-aluminum, three-cylinder, 1.0L Boosterjet engine.
The Suzuki Baleno RS kept up to its reputation as a performance car with an unconventional sportier interior with ample space, stunning black interiors paired-up with contrast stitching, coloured TFT multi information display system equipped with the Smart play Infotainment System makes Baleno RS a comfortable and enjoyable ride balanced with ultra sporty characteristics such as sporty front and rear bumpers and grille coupled with front, rear and side underbody spoilers, highly defined curves and powerful styling with black sporty alloys are the elegantly sporty accents introduced in the all new Suzuki Baleno RS, the next gen high performance utility vehicle.
