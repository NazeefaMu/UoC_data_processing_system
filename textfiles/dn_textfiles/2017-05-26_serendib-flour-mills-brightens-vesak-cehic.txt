Serendib Flour Mills brightens Vesak for CEHIC

Serendib Flour Mills as part of its CSR commitment recently celebrated the religious festival of Vesak by organizing a lantern competition for 40 students from the Centre for the Education of Hearing Impaired Children (CEHIC).
The company also hosted a 7-Star bun dansala in collaboration with Miyurasa Bakery, Narahenpita. Staff members from a cross-section of departments participated in both events, which were hosted as part of SFML’s commitment to celebrate important religious and cultural occasions, whilst supporting local youth and communities.
The students at CEHIC had to demonstrate their creative talents and team building skills, by creating unique and vibrant Vesak lanterns.
In the class category, the monara (peacock), ibba (tortoise) and hawa (rabbit) teams secured the first, second and third prize respectively, whilst students Shahimal and Nethumal won prizes in the individual category alongside their fellow students Ridhma and Sandakaleum.
The SFML team was present to facilitate the competition, which was judged by two Buddhist clergy members and a representative from Leo Burnett’s creative team.
CEHIC is a school that provides free education for children from all walks of life who are living with hearing impairments. Dedicated to fostering understanding as well as multi-ethnic cooperation and religious harmony, the school was founded in 1982 and is currently under the purview of Sr. Greta Nalawatta of the Sisters of Perpetual Help.
Commenting on the events, Kevin O’Leary – CEO, SFML,said, “We are delighted that the SFML team was able to come together to participate in the traditions of Vesak, one of the most important religious and cultural celebrations of the year.”
