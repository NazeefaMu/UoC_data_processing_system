Heavy fine, prison sentence for abandoning dogs at public places

Amendments to the Registration of Dogs Ordinance No 25 of 1901 will soon prohibit people from abandoning their dogs at public places. Those who do so will be fined a sum not exceeding Rs 25,000, imprisoned for a period not extending two years or both.
Cabinet this week approved the above proposal put forward by Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha in order to control the stray dog population and spread of rabies in several areas around the country.
He had pointed out that Local Government Authorities would be more effective in controlling the stray dog population if they had the legal authority to take action against those who abandon dogs on the street. The above amendment would grant them such powers.
Cabinet had earlier granted approval to repeal both Registration of Dogs Ordinance and Rabies Ordinance and draft new legislation to replace them, but the consultation process which has been going on for some time has not been finalised yet.
In 2006, the government passed a ‘No kill policy’ and thus stray dogs are only allowed to be sterilised.
