MR taking party men for a ride: Shan

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s present political maneuver is solely targeted at defending himself and his family members from grave allegations of corruption and fraud leveled against them. It will in no way benefit the party or the party men, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said.
“For the purpose, he abuses a section of grassroots level members of the SLFP as a shield. It is quite similar to the last hour attempt of LTTE leader Prabhakaran using innocent Tamil people as a human buffer to protect him from the looming defeat before the government forces in the last phase of war at Nandikadal," the Chief Minister said.
He was addressing a forum of party activists in Ambalangoda, Galle on Saturday.
It was held at the Ambalangoda Pradeshiya Saba auditorium.
“Since its inception the SLFP faced various challenges and suffered numerous setbacks. Political challenges and upheavals are not new to the party. There was an attempt in the 1980s as well to break away from the party and form a new party. Mahinda Rajapaksa covertly supported that destructive effort. He also encouraged his brother Basil Rajapaksa to be the general secretary of the newly formed party. I do declare this with much responsibility. At the by-election in 1983 Basil Rajapaksa supported the UNP,” de Silva said.
He said on several occasions, certain former leaders left the party.
“But none of them could do any serious damage to the party. Those who left the party ruined their political future by themselves. Some had to rejoin the party after sometime. Some joined other political parties while many went politically astray," he said.
Commenting on contemporary politics, the Chief Minister reiterated that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would never form a new political party.
