NMRA reduces drug registration charges

The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) has reduced the charges for registering new drugs, registering limited productions, and obtaining licenses, from midnight on January 5, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the charges were slashed under the instructions of the Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, followed by a request made by the All Ceylon Pharmacy Owners' Association. The charges were increased by a special gazette notification issued on June 14, 2017, but later, the members of All Ceylon Pharmacy Owners ' Association informed Minister Dr. Senaratne that they face various difficulties due to the increase of charges, he said.
The charges were reduced again with effect from January 5, responding to their grievances, he added.
