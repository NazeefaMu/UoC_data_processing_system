Sri Lanka has ideal investment opportunities : Ravi

Sri Lanka has ideal investment opportunities as country has been achieving economic prosperity through accelerating growth with social inclusion, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told an investors meeting in Hong Kong.
He was addressing the 2nd Sri Lanka Investment Summit held in Hong Kong.
Minister Karunanayake said Sri Lanka has vibrant backdrop of an invigorating economy seeking resurgence after a period of negative inferences.He said the country will reach “middle income status” in the near future. The minister said the country has provided many options for discerning investors through a pragmatic implementation of “Public Private Partnership” framework under a “win-win” situation. He said one of the areas offering opportunities is agriculture as the traditional agricultural sector is meant to convert into commercial one.
The proposed “Colombo International Financial City” is another area of viable investment for its geographical location. It is open to huge markets of the countries in the SAARC region, the minister said.
Minister Karunanayake said Sri Lanka expects to reach high economic echelons on par with the existing international financial centres such as Dubai and Hong Kong assuring investors full gamut of opportunities.
He said the necessary infrastructure such as expressways, megapolis city, provincial cities, railway and road transport mechanism are under construction already. Along with making these projects a reality, Colombo will be developed to a maritime hub to provide options for any interested investor in the country.Going by the punch line – this century is “Asia’s century” - Sri Lanka claims it share as the most peaceful country in the region for investors to launch their stable business ventures, the minister said.
