JSS urges President to end political marriage with SLFP

The Jathika Sewaka Sangamaya yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena to “end the political marriage he is having with Sri Lanka Freedom Party” and “become independent.”
“President Sirisena received 6.2 million votes on January 8 which went down to a 1.3 – 1.5 million in the recent election. He should understand that people have distanced themselves from him. Why has the general public distanced themselves from the President? A distance was created between the UNP and the President.
He should end this political marriage with the SLFP and become independent, and secure his honour as the President,” Jathika Sewaka Sangamaya (JSS) observed.
Speaking of the no confidence motion which was recently presented against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, JSS Vice President and Media Spokesman Sunil de Silva made these observations at a press brief held at JSS headquarters, Pitakotte yesterday.
De Silva said the SLFP ministers who voted supportive of the no confidence motion should step down from their posts. “They should step down and let others who can work, to continue with their work. They should act according to the expression they gave from their votes." he said.
“It should have been the UNP who should have refused to participate in the Cabinet meeting today, not the SLFP. Even though the Joint Opposition presented the no confidence motion, it was some of those in the SLFP who promoted it. The general public seems to believe that even the President was behind this whole thing. It is important not to let the country drift towards anarchism. All should work for the betterment of the people in this new year eve,” De Silva also said on behalf of JSS.
