Out of a total Government expenditure of Rs. 1,765 billion a sum of 970 billion has been set apart for servicing debts.
This amounts to 55 percent of Government expenditure for the first four months of 2019.
A press release by the Finance and Media Ministry said the Cabinet appointed on October 26 had stopped the Gam Peraliya, Enterprise Sri Lanka and the one programme for each village introduced by the Ranil Wickremesinghe government to develop the local economy and ensure village development.
If a new Government led by Ranil Wickremesinghe was not appointed, payment of public service salaries, and all other welfare programmes including the fertilizer subsidy, school uniform distribution and Samurdhi relief would have ground to a halt.
All these would be restarted under the provisions of the Vote on Account and school uniform vouchers would be provided to over four million schoolchildren at the beginning of the new school term.
‘The Vote on Account includes Rs.480 billion for recurrent expenditure and Rs.310 billion for capital expenditure,” the release said.
