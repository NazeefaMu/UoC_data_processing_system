Water supply to be disrupted in Colombo due to damaged pipes

 
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board said today that water supply to several places in Colombo will be disrupted due to damaged pipes near Labugama water purification center.
The pipes were damaged following floods in the area.
The Water Board said that water supply to other areas may also disrupt and water will be supplied under low pressure to some areas.
Commuters are advised to use water sparingly.
