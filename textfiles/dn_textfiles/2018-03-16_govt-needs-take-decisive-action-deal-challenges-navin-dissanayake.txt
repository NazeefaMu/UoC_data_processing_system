Govt needs to take decisive action to deal with challenges - Navin Dissanayake

“Successive governments face the challenge of balancing high debt with the need to grant subsidies to the people,” said Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake as he noted that the government would have to take decisive action to deal with challenges in the next five years, if they were to remain in power.
Speaking at the First Sustainable Plantation Management (NSSPM) 2018 programme in Athurugiriya recently, the Minister noted that every politician regardless of party faces the challenge of having to run a government whilst catering to populist demand.
“On the one hand every one rupee the government gets, we spend 90 cents on debt repayments; international and local. Then we have only 10 cents to spend on Samurdhi, fertilizer subsidies, free education, free health care and to make the roads and villages. And if we continue thus, that 10 cents will become 5. This is the reality. As a politician I’m very sad because even if I’m in the UNP, PA JVP or SLFP this will be the reality”, he said.
So this would be the situation even if Mahinda Rajapakse comes into power tomorrow. So how can he change this? I don’t know whether he can be a magician and create new money? Or will he take new loans to pay off our previous debts?, he added.
This is the basic economic dilemma which the country’s economy has been trapped in. We are trapped in a debt burden, said the Minister.
“So we don’t have a new formula for this. Income should be increased, expenses should be reduced and management should be made efficient. Corruption and wastage should be minimized and the necessary decisions made. Therefore, I’m very happy to be a part of this situation, I’m very happy to be the minister of this industry which now needs innovation”.
Touching on sustainability in the Plantation sector, the minister stressed that Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) since being privatized in the 1990s, have now stopped innovating though they continue to take on a huge burden in the industry. Minister Dissanayake also noted that the plantation companies needed to look more at ethical behaviour, given that in many instances there have been exploitation of labour, appropriation of profits and dishonest means to accumulate profits in the Plantation sector.
He however, remarked that there was a dire need for the government to introduce measures, means and models through effective consultation and discussion to bring up the RPCs at the bottom.
“This will not be done arbitrarily but through a consultative process by bringing some checks and balances to the overall sector to introduce good governance practices and also corporate social responsibility”, he said.
I want to change things, added Minister Dissanayake further, especially in the Plantation Sector. He promised changes to the tea sector next week and stressed that even if people leave, he would bring in an equally good person to take over and do things, “We need to work as a team, like in any company”, he said.
