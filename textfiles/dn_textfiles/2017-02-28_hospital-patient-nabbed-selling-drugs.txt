Hospital patient nabbed for selling drugs

An in-house patient at the Trincomalee Hospital selling drugs at its entrance was nabbed by an officer of the Trincomalee District Frauds Unit with three packets of hashish and Rs. 8,000 in his possession on February 26.
Investigations revealed that the suspect nicknamed “Visi Ata” had been admitted to the hospital on several occasions as a ruse to sell narcotics without arousing suspicion.
The suspect will be handed over to the Harbour Police for further investigations.
