U.S. Pacific Fleet join SL Navy for Pacific Partnership Goodwill Mission

The U.S. Pacific Fleet and its transport ship USNS Fall River arrived at the Port of Hambantota yesterday and will engage in the first Pacific Partnership goodwill mission until March 18.
Working side-by-side with the Sri Lanka Navy and local organisations in the Hambantota region, this multinational effort includes free community health clinics; school and hospital renovations; learning exchanges for medical and disaster-relief responders; seminars to promote women’s roles in peace and security and public performances by the U.S. 7th Fleet Band.
The U.S. embassy said in a statement that “Through this Pacific Partnership mission, the United States will continue to help Sri Lanka respond more quickly to humanitarian challenges. Our Sri Lankan partners will also be able to share with USA their valuable lessons learned from past natural disasters.”
Pacific Partnership is the largest multinational humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission conducted each year in the Indo-Pacific region. Military and civilian experts from the United Kingdom, India, Australia, Japan, and South Korea will participate in the exercise along with the United States and Sri Lanka.
The Pacific Partnership medical teams will join Sri Lankan doctors and nurses for training at the General Hospital and Nurses Training School in Hambantota, the Tissamaharama Base Hospital and other local clinics and hospitals. Free public medical and dental clinics in select cities will also be conducted by mission doctors and nurses.
In addition, local organisations, working together with U.S. Navy civil engineers, will complete renovations of the Ambalantota Divisional Hospital, Wishaka Mahila Preschool, Sri Gunananda Preschool and multiple Maternity and Child Clinic Centres.
The U.S. 7th Fleet Band will also hold joint public concerts at the Galle Fort on March 9, Tangalle City Centre on March 10, Hambantota Beach Park on March 11, Bata Atha Agro Park on March 13, Matara Beach Park on March 14 and several schools in the area.
