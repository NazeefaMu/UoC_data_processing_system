Etisalat ranked as Best Service Operator in  Sri Lanka

Etisalat has been assessed and confirmed by the telecommunications regulator as the best service level delivered call centre in the country among mobile telephony operators for three consecutive quarters.
The achievement highlights the high standard and performance of Etisalat’s Call Centre as having the fastest call answering through selected agent option.
Etisalat has worked towards maintaining this quality of performance throughout the last quarter as per the report issued by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) on their ‘Quality of Service’ (QoS) Reports.
The performance of service levels are monitored daily via a sophisticated system which shows live data of the number of calls in queue.
The achievement was mainly due to the significant contribution from the team and support extended by the call centre staff of Etisalat Sri Lanka, working around the clock to provide assistance in all three languages to customer inquiries. Speaking on this, Etisalat Lanka’s Senior Manager Customer Operations Erash Fernando said, “Our moto is, ‘it’s no Game, it’s No Magic, and it’s all about team work!’ We are very attentive to all our inquiries and complaints channelled via calls, emails or social media from our valued customers and we attend to them as fast as possible.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all who contributed towards securing this achievement.” Marking 25 years of market presence this year, 072 - the long standing mobile telephony operator in the country is constantly improving to provide personalised attention to their customers.
The quarterly bench-marking from TRCSL assessing the Quality of Service for Call Centres has driven the mobile telephony call centres in the country to improve their key performance indicators whilst improving turnaround time and first contact resolution.
