UTE-CAT for Northern-North Central Projects by Sierra Construction

United Tractor & Equipment (Pvt) Ltd (UTE), the country’s sole authorized dealer for the Caterpillar brand in the country supplied Sierra Construction with nine units of its industry-leading Caterpillar 428F2 backhoe loaders recently.
The deal totaling Rs.144 million will provide Sierra Construction, a leading construction infrastructure development player, machinery consisting of nine units of 428F2 backhoe loaders and two units of 20 ton 320D2 excavator for water distribution projects in the North Central and Northern regions.
Combining the latest technologies available for backhoe loaders, the Caterpillar 428F2 is equipped with a powerful 93hp CAT 3054C turbocharged engine ensuring outstanding fuel economy and many hours of productive life.
“ We made the decision to purchase a fleet of equipment under the world class brand name Caterpillar for the upcoming projects on grounds of reliability of backup service from UTE engineering,” Anura Premarathna, COO, Sierra Water Works (Pvt) Ltd stated.
Built in the UK, CAT backhoe loaders have been a popular choice even previously for Sierra Construction.
“Caterpillar has a well-proven history in the construction equipment industry and has been producing the highest quality machines for over 90 years. Sierra Construction has confidence in our machinery especially the durability, efficiency and high productivity of the CAT backhoe loaders,” said Duminda Perera, Manager, Machine Sales Division, UTE.
To-date, UTE have provided over 50 units of the next-gen 428F2 backhoe loaders to the construction industry.
