Halfpenny stars as dominant Wales thrash Scotland

CARDIFF, Saturday - Leigh Halfpenny scored two tries as Wales opened their Six Nations campaign with a dominant 34-7 victory against much-fancied Scotland in Cardiff on Saturday.
In an entertaining start to the tournament, Wales banished memories of their defeat to Scotland in last year’s fixture with a commanding victory courtesy of tries from Gareth Davies and Steff Evans and Halfpenny’s double.
The experienced fullback added 14 points from the boot for a personal tally of 24.
Scotland had not won in Cardiff since 2002 but arrived in the Welsh capital buoyed up by a superb spell in November that saw them thump Australia and fall agonisingly short of a famous victory against the world champion All Blacks. Wales, however -- without six British & Irish Lions stars -- started in inspired fashion at a fervent Principality Stadium with Davies intercepting a pass from opposite number Ali Price to canter over from 60 metres.
The visitors barely had time to settle in a breathless opening 15 minutes before Halfpenny dived over for his first Wales try since 2013 -- 38 games ago. Scotland, one of the most dynamic and unpredictable attacking sides, were guilty of overplaying at times and found it difficult to build cohesion or put pressure on the Welsh defence. - Agencies
