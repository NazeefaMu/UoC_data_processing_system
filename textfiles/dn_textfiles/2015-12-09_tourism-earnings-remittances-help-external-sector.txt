Tourism earnings, remittances help external sector

Sri Lanka's external sector performance remained modest in September 2015, on year-on-year basis, supported by the healthy growth in tourist earnings and moderate increase in workers' remittances. Although the trade deficit had contracted during the month, on a cumulative basis, the trade deficit increased to US dollars 6,145 million, during the period January - September 2015, the Central Bank said yesterday.
Earnings from exports at US dollars 850 million in September 2015 reflected a year-on-year contraction of 5.9 per cent the seventh consecutive decline since March 2015. The largest contribution to this drop came from industrial exports, which declined by 4.7 per cent, led by subdued performance of rubber products, gems, diamonds and jewellery, machinery and mechanical appliances and printing industry products, which jointly attribution to around 60 per cent of the overall decline in exports. However, continuing the healthy performance observed in previous months of the year, earnings from exports of spices increased by 34.9 per cent during the month, led by exports of pepper and cloves. The deficit in the trade account in September 2015 contracted by 4.1 per cent to US dollars 733 million in comparison to US dollars 765 million in September 2014. However, on a cumulative basis, the trade deficit during the first nine months of 2015 increased by 3.8 per cent to US dollars 6,145 million.
However, export earnings from textiles and garments, which account for around 48 per cent of total exports increased by 1.8 per cent, year-on-year during the month, reflecting a considerable expansion in garments exports to non-traditional markets such as Canada, Australia, India, United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong.
Meanwhile, earnings from agricultural exports in September 2015 declined by 11.3 per cent, year-on-year, mainly due to significant declines recorded in tea and sea food exports as in last few months.
On a cumulative basis, earnings from exports contracted by 3.7 per cent during the first nine months of the year reflecting declines in both agricultural and industrial exports. The leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka during the first nine months of 2015 were the USA, the UK, India, Germany, Italy and China which accounted for about 54 per cent of total exports.
Expenditure on imports declined by 5.1 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 1,583 million in September 2015. The largest contribution for this decline came from investment goods, followed by intermediate goods. Reduction in imports of transport equipment was the main contributor for the decline recorded in investment goods imports.
On a cumulative basis, expenditure on imports during the first nine months of 2015 decreased marginally by 0.6 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 14,141 million mainly led by the 16.1 per cent drop in expenditure on intermediate goods imports.
During the first nine months of 2015, the main import originating countries were India, China, Japan, UAE and Singapore, which accounted for about 60 per cent of the total imports.
