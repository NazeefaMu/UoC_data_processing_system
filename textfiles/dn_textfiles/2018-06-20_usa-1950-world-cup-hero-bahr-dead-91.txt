USA 1950 World Cup hero Bahr dead at 91

LOS ANGELES, Monday - Former USA international Walter Bahr, the last surviving member of the team which famously shocked England at the 1950 World Cup, has died, it was confirmed Monday. He was 91.
Bahr provided the assist for the goal which handed the USA a 1-0 victory over the English in Belo Horizonte, a result regarded as one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history.
Former United States Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati confirmed Bahr's passing in a post on Twitter.
"Saddened to learn of the passing of Walter Bahr — a legend as a player, as a coach and most importantly as a caring gentleman. Rest in peace my friend," Gulati wrote.
Bahr made 19 appearances for the USA between 1948 and 1957, and later coached club teams in Pennsylvania while working as a high school physical education teacher.
He later coached the men's soccer team at Pennsylvania State University from 1974 to 1988.
Bahr took over the Penn State men's soccer program in 1974 and led the Nittany Lions to the NCAA tournament 12 times in 14 years, winning 185 games from '74 to '87. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame and the National Soccer Coaches Association Hall of Fame.
Bahr's three sons -- Matt, Casey and Chris -- all played professionally in the North American Soccer League during the 1970s.
Chris and Matt Bahr would later go on to forge successful careers in the National Football League as place kickers, each winning the Super Bowl twice. – AFP
