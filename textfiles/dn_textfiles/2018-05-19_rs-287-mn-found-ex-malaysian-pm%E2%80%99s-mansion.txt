Rs 2.87 mn found at ex Malaysian PM’s mansion

Malaysian police on Thursday (May 17) night raided three apartments in a Kuala Lumpur condominium owned by former prime minister Najib Razak’s family, carting away 284 boxes containing luxury handbags and 72 bags filled with jewellery, cash of various denominations, watches and other valuables.
Police also found 2.87 million Sri Lankan Rupees at his mansion.
Amar Singh, director of police commercial crime investigations, said the police have searched six premises since Wednesday - the Prime Minister’s Office, Najib’s residence in Taman Duta and four other residences linked to him.
At one of these residences, Pavilion Residences, the police took what was likely to be their biggest haul, loading five police trucks with hundreds of orange boxes containing Hermes Birkin bags. Astro Awani reported that a police officer emerged from the condominium with a money counting machine. (Straitstimes)
