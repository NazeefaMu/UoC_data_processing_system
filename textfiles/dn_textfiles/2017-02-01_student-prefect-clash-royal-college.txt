Sources close to Royal College said the students went to police station after being beaten up by the prefects. “The prefects had reportedly caught the boys watching untoward things on an electronic device. Consequent to this discovery, the prefects had reportedly made them eat grass and knocked them around,” sources said. Asked what the police had done about the incident if there had been anything as such, an official of the Cinnamon Gardens Police said he did not know about it for he was not the one to handle the complaint.
“The OIC was there at the time,” he said.
