New National Cooperative Policy being finalised

Formulated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the draft of a new National Cooporative Policy for the country’s widespread cooperative societies, is now being finalised.
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Badiudeen yesterday said the shaping of the policy, which had fallen wayside for over ten years because of lack of action, has been completed in the course two years.
The draft policy has been produced through extensive consultation with cooperative leaders and stakeholders. Its focus is to develop the country’s cooperative sector on a firm footing, the minister said.
“We have to introduce the policy while preserving the provincial interests as well as the interests of the center,” he pointed out.
“The Provincial ministries have the most number of cooperative societies. They have the most number of people working in them. Therefore it is of utmost importance that they reflect on its content and contribute to make necessary adjustments, “he said.
