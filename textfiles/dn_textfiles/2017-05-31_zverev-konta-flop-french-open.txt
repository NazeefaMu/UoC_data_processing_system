Zverev, Konta flop at French Open

PARIS: Alexander Zverev, the man seen as a potential French Open champion, crashed out in the first round Tuesday while Johanna Konta became the second top 10 women’s player to exit.
Zverev, just 20 and fresh from his sensational Rome Masters demolition of Novak Djokovic, slumped to a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 defeat to Spain’s Fernando Verdasco, 13 years his senior.
“I played absolute shit, that’s why I lost,” said Zverev.
“But life goes on, it’s not a tragedy. In Rome I played fantastic, I won the tournament. Here I played bad, I lost first round. That’s the way it goes.” In a match controversially suspended on Monday at one set each, Zverev was defeated in a fog of mistakes and despondency.
The beanpole German committed 50 unforced errors and drew jeers from the Philippe Chatrier court crowd when he took out his frustration by hammering his racquet into the clay.
Konta is the second top 10 woman to lose in the first three days after world number one Angelique Kerber was also dumped out in the first round.
“I tried very hard and gave myself a big chance. Every time I tried to run as fast as I can and get the ball back,” said Hsieh, who won for the just the second time in seven trips to Roland Garros. nta has yet to win one match in the main draw in three attempts. AFP
