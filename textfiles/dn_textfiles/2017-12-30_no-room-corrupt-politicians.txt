President tells SLFP LG poll Candidates:
No room for corrupt politicians

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, requested the new SLFP candidates contesting the Local Government elections to become exemplary political leaders.
The President during his address to the candidates, stated that corrupt politicians were the main stumbling block to a developed and prosperous Sri Lanka, referring to them as apalaya (ill luck).
President Sirisena pointed out that most of the politicians in Sri Lanka are involved in fraud, corruption and other malpractices, which deter the country’s development.
The President said he requires future political leaders to give priority to spiritual development in the country and economic development.
President Sirisena was addressing SLFP candidates contesting the upcoming Local Government elections at a ceremony held at Sugathadasa Stadium yesterday.
“This country needs politicians who pledge for clean politics,” the President added.
“We go to newly developed countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Korea and complain that our country has not reached the same level of development. Our country does not have a dearth of academics, scientists, researchers or natural resources.
With all these resources, why are we lagging behind as a country? There is a secret behind this. The sad truth behind this plight is that our politicians of all levels do not do what they promise to do. They have their own personal agendas. They pay no heed for people and their betterment.” President Sirisena pointed out.
“No politician, in whatever the level from the bottom to top, should have personal agendas,” President Sirisena also pointed out.
“The only agenda the politicians should have is for their country and its people,” he also pointed out.
President Sirisena also pointed out that Sri Lanka no more needs politicians who are corrupt and use their political power to fulfill their own political agendas.
“We need politicians who love this country and its people. We need politicians who do not look for financial advantages. We need politicians who do not misuse and destroy public money and public property. We no longer need politicians who use political power for their own selfish achievements,” President Sirisena said.
President Sirisena also pointed out that many political parties have taken corruption free politics as a motto in their election campaigns. “This tendency itself shows that what we lack in Sri Lanka itself is corruption free politics. We promise it because we do not have it. We have a very long way to go.
“The SLFP has selected educated and clean young candidates at this election. I request all of our candidates to refrain from criticising your political opponents at your election campaigns. Instead, speak to your supporters about your vision for a developed village and a prosperous country.” President Sirisena said.
President Sirisena pointed out that he will give the leadership of the SLFP to the new political leaders of the party and not to his family members.
