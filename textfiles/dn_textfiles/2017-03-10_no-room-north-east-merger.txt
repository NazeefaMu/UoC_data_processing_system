No room for North, East merger:

Steering Committee on Constitutional reform process
 
The Steering Committee on the Constitutional reform process has come to a common consensus that a new Constitution will leave no room for a merger between the Northern and Eastern Provinces, said National Coexistence, Dialogue and National Languages Minister Mano Ganesan.
He said they expect to have a draft of the new Constitution ready by the middle of this year.
The Minister addressing a meeting of the Congress of Religions - a body constituting key religious leaders of all communities – said the TNA too had agreed to this stance despite holding an opposing view for many years.
“At the meeting of the Steering Committee this week, we only agreed two things for a new Constitution: one is that there will be no merger and the other is that Buddhism will continue to hold the foremost place in the Constitution while giving all other religions their due place,” said Ganesan speaking at the Mahabodhi Temple Trust’s office in Maradana yesterday.
The Steering Committee had also received reports from the Chief Ministers of all Provincial Councils. According to the Minister, they had indicated that they were unanimously opposed to a new Constitution which would take away some of the current powers of the Councils.
Some religious leaders meanwhile, criticized the Minister for not having a proper mechanism to implement the reconciliation process. They pointed out that the Constitution reform process was taking too long. They also requested religious leaders not be sidelined but taken into the fold when designing a mechanism for reconciliation.
Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith meanwhile questioned the Minister as to why the government could not simply
fully implement the existing 13th Amendment under a proper regulatory framework as an immediate step rather than waiting for a new Constitution. “Why not devolve powers which are already there?” he said.
 
The Minister explained that no government in power has successfully managed to implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and that it was better to not have new problems at a time when they were doing their utmost to prepare a new Constitution.
