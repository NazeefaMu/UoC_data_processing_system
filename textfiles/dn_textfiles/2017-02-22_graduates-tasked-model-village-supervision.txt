Graduates tasked with model village supervision

The Housing and Construction Ministry has launched a programme to recruit graduates on contract basis to monitor and observe the work connected with the model villages and reawakened villages programme launched on a countrywide basis, said Deputy Minister Indika Bandaranayake. The Deputy Minister said these graduates would be tasked with area inspection work on a daily payment basis. He said this at the Kurunegala kachcheri when he presided over a ceremony held to handover appointment letters to a batch of graduates selected for these new posts recently.
