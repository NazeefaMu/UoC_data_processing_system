Hambantota Urban Council meeting postponed

The Hambantota Urban Council recently postponed its first meeting to be held after last month’s local government elections by Southern Provincial Local Government Commissioner Ranil Wickramasekera due to absence of council members. Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) members of the UC had not appeared for the meeting.
Of the 21 members appointed to the urban council, only eight members of the United National Party (UNP) and one Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) member were present.
