A cuddly reason to live

She could read I was in pain': Breast cancer survivor says pet CHEETAH who cuddles up with her in bed helped her battle disease

South African was comforted by cheetah who licked her newly bald head
The 53-year-old beat the illness saying she ‘wanted to live’ for pet Fiela
A brave cancer survivor has told how she overcame the illness - with the help of her fully-grown pet cheetah.
Big cat lover Riana Van Nieuwenhuizen, from South Africa, was diagnosed with breast cancer back in 2013, undergoing a double mastectomy and chemotherapy as part of her treatment.
The 53-year-old describes how Fiela - who she bought in 2006 - would sleep on her bed, suck her finger and lick her newly bald head to comfort her.
Riana's unique bond with the animal means she can safely cuddle up with her and eat from the same dinner table.
The cancer survivor has now opened up about how the cheetah would comfort her during the frightening ordeal.
She said: ‘I was so afraid our relationship would change - I lost all my hair and the first time she saw me she just licked my head to say, “You are okay, I still love you”.
‘When I came back from hospital I was so afraid that she should jump on me and hurt me, but she had a certain way to get on the bed.
‘She did not get on top of me, she was always getting on the other side, as if to say - “I know you're hurt and I know there's changes”.
‘She could read that I was in pain. It's amazing how they can sense things in humans.
‘She looked after me somehow and that purring of hers, being with me - you don't think of yourself, you just want to live for them.'
Riana has had a passion for the world's fastest land animal since she saw one in a magazine when she was 13.
In 2006 she resigned after 22 years at the Department of Justice to pursue her dream of breeding cheetahs to release back into a ‘protected wild'. 
The big-hearted survivor now runs the Cheetah Experience in Bloemfontein, South Africa, with her home based on the site.
The centre is open to the public and is home to 19 cheetahs, as well as a plethora of other animals including lions, tigers, leopards, wolves and meerkats.
However it is nine-year-old Fiela who Riana holds dearest.
She explained: ‘Fiela was my first cheetah - we have a very special bond. We all call her ‘the Queen’, she does whatever she wants to do.
‘She doesn't like people touching her.
‘When she's with me it's just different - she likes to sleep on the bed, she sucks my finger, she sees me as her companion.
‘I'm her ‘mummy’ and I love her a lot.'
She has documented their time together in photographs which illustrate their unique relationship.
Riana is seen cuddling up to Fiela in bed and eating a bowl of food as she lovingly pets the animal.
Riana opened the Cheetah Experience in 2006 and now has five full-time staff, alongside a regular influx of volunteers and animal lovers who come from all over the world
Cheetahs are endangered animals and Riana said her main mission in life is to help them. Riana plays with her animals, helping them to maintain their hunting skills using stuffed toys.
She continued: ‘If humans don't look after them, we will lose them. The fastest land animal is running out of time.
‘We want to breed them in captivity, so one day I hope we can get a sponsor for a piece of land.
‘We will be able to release them, where we can watch them and monitor them without predators.'
