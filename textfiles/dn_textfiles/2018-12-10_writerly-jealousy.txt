On Writerly Jealousy

Recently, while reading a new book of poetry, I noticed a certain signature of influence: a poem with a macabre playfulness that reminded me of “Daddy.” Plath-y!, I wrote in the margin beside it. I pulled my copy of Plath’s Collected Poems off the shelf (inscribed Merry Christmas, 1994, Mom & Dad; I would have just turned fifteen) and reread “Daddy” for the whatever-eth time.
For most of my life I read “Daddy” quite literally, as a renunciation of Plath’s father: “Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.” She all but calls him Hitler, with his “neat mustache” and “Aryan eye.” As Janet Malcolm points out in The Silent Woman, the poem “has had a mixed reception.” She quotes Leon Wieseltier in The New York Review of Books, 1976: “Whatever her father did to her, it could not have been what the Germans did to the Jews.” Irving Howe, writing in 1973, found “something monstrous, utterly disproportionate” in the metaphor. I think of the Sharon Olds poem “The Takers,” which begins, “Hitler entered Paris the way my / sister entered my room at night.” (My friend Chris, in grad school, read these lines and said, simply, “No.”)
Pro-German allegiance
However, in 2012, newly released FBI files on the German-born Otto Plath suggested that he may have been a Nazi sympathizer. As the Guardian reported at the time, “the files reveal that he was detained over suspected pro-German allegiance.” Unlike her critics in the twentieth century, Sylvia may have had the inside scoop on those allegiances. She may have meant to literally call him a Nazi. That doesn’t close the case on “Daddy,” though. Nazi sympathies notwithstanding, there is little evidence that Sylvia harbored hateful feelings toward her father. As noted in a short, rather wonderful article about Plath and her series of bee poems, which I found on the website of a Dublin beekeeping association: “His death when Sylvia was only eight years old deeply affected her feelings and thoughts for the rest of her life. Her mother writes that, when she was told of her father’s death, she said: ‘I’ll never speak to God again!’<U+2009>” (Otto Plath, an entomologist, authored an influential book called Bumblebees and Their Ways.)
Plath does not betray conscious resentment of her father in her journals; the opposite, in fact: “I rail and rage against the taking of my father, whom I have never known; even his mind, his heart; his face, as a boy of 17 I love terribly. I would have loved him; and he is gone.” A few years later, she visits his grave: “I found the flat stone … right beside the path, where it would be walked over. Felt cheated. My temptation to dig him up. To prove he existed and really was dead.” Her journals make it clear it was her mother she hated instead. In 1958 she wrote:
Misplaced blame
I never knew the love of a father, the love of a steady blood-related man after the age of eight. My mother killed the only man who’d love me steady through life … I hate her for that … I hate her because he wasn’t loved by her … It was her fault. Damn her eyes.
It’s misplaced blame—Otto died of diabetes—but evidently how she felt. So why the big switch, in 1962? I don’t think there was one. She wrote the poem shortly after she discovered her poet-husband was having an affair with a mutual friend (the striking Assia Wevill—I feel compelled to tell you that the beekeeping site misspells her name as “Weevil”) and shortly before she, at last successfully, committed suicide. Given the timing, I now presume “Daddy” is mostly a veiled address to Ted Hughes: Hughes is the bastard she is through with.
