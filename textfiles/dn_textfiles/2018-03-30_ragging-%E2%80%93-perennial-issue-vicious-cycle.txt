Ragging – perennial issue of a vicious cycle!

In response to the article titled “Ragging, a psychological phenomenon” which appeared in the ‘citizens’ mail’ of Daily News of March 21, I wish to convey some of my thoughts as well following a survey on the matter.
This brutal physical and psychological menace deeply embedded into the sub-culture of the present universities is introduced to the students as a ‘process of flexionizing or socializing.’ But the fact remains that the real problem lies in this so-called process with its unethical and violent activities.
In this systematic form of abuse, it is most disturbing to note inhuman acts perpetrated by sadistic seniors such as abusive, obnoxious and threatening words to frighten and humiliate juniors in public, stripping them naked in the hostels and gender-based sexual abuse, kneeling them down in the scorching sun for a long time, keeping them in hunger on certain days, severe assaults on them and on the day of ‘welcome party’ to bathe them with water mixed with dirt and urine etc. The gravity of this problem even worsens in the Higher Educational Institutes and Universities outside the Western Province.
I clearly see ragging as a manifestation of vicious attitudes, frustration, jealousy, inferiority complex, socio-economic disparity, lack of socialization of disgruntled elements directed towards good looks and superior personality, better socio-economic, socio-academic backgrounds and even fluency in English of freshers.
This makes me all the more convinced as there are disciplined senior students representing respectable family environments who are not in agreement with this sort of corporal and psychological harassment by the miscreants.
I believe that spreading comprehensive awareness of the aspects of ragging could play an important role in awakening the mass support in order to curb and curtail the cruelty of ragging. Nevertheless, there is little chance for the victims to report their predicament to either parents/guardians or university authorities due to fear inflicted on them in different forms by the raggers.
Ragging leads to serious consequences not only for the victims and their parents, but its effects negatively impact the entire society. The students from the affluent backgrounds may join private universities or go abroad for their studies causing a huge brain drain and financial loss to the country while the children of poor parents must try to bear up the stress and strain at the expense of their physical, mental and psychological well-being. These traumatic health issues, without doubt, create a loss of self-worth and sickness even resulting in the extreme step of suicide by the victims. In such a gloomy scenario, how can the parents possibly send their children to Government Universities? Aren’t the promising careers our children dream of nipped in the bud?
In my opinion, though authorities of the Universities and the U.G.C. are aware of the enormity and gravity of the issue of ragging and various measures recommended by concerned quarters seasonally to deal with the problems, they have not intervened satisfactorily to implement a proper mechanism on ragging so far. It should be noted that ragging is nurtured by the conception that one becomes a senior simply because one arrives somewhere first and each year every senior batch rags the next batch of junior students which repeats in a vicious cycle.
Thus, there must be a proper policy and mechanism so as not to repress merely the superficial aspects of the problem while preserving its roots intact. In other words, the ill-effects of ragging, if not cured, may grow into a chronic incurable social disease.
