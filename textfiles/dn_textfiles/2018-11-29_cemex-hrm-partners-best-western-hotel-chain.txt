CEMEX HRM partners with Best Western hotel chain

Adding another prestigious company to its clientele, CEMEX HRM recently signed up with Sri Lanka’s first Best Western hotel which is part of the globally acclaimed Best Western hotel chain.
Since opening the doors in 2014, Best Western Elyon Colombo has steadily grown becoming a preferred choice for leisure and business travellers. This meant an increase in the number of employees that brought in the requirement of automating its HR functions to increase productivity and transform the employee experience.
Best Western Elyon Colombo now boasts of many benefits after this automation. The streamlined processes and advanced HRIS feature have helped the hotel drastically reduce the manual work involved. The application comprises several HR modules including HRIS, time and attendance, leave management, complex rostering, overtime management, employee self-service, and payroll.
“Our HR team and the CEMEX team have worked together in delivering this project without any delay and our employees have a lot of good things to say about the system. We’re confident that this automation will improve employee engagement and efficient processes especially with the solution’s complex rostering and payroll features.” said Presantha Jayamaha, Chairman - Best Western Elyon Colombo.
