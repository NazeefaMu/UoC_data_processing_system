Rajapaksa camp wanted to defend themselves from murder, fraud and corruption charges - JVP

The No-Confidence motion brought against the Prime Minister split the joint opposition and also undermined its recent electoral gains at local elections, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna leader Anura Dissanayake MP told journalists yesterday.
During a media briefing at JVP office in Battaramulla Dissanayake said only the Gotabhaya Rajapaksa camp in the JO was interested in the no faith motion while Basil Rajapaksa’s team had shown a lukewarm response although they had voted in favour of the motion.
“The behaviour of Mahinda Rajapaksa was also very strange.When he went with other JO members to handover the no confidence motion to the Speaker his facial expressions were similar to a dog being dragged to bath,” Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake went on to say that both former President Mahinda Rajapaksa MP and his son Namal Rajapaksa MP had not uttered a word during the no confidence debate or help those trying to win it.
The JVP leader charged that Gotabhaya’s camp was very keen to win the no confidence motion as most of those accused of major frauds and corruption was on that side.“Most of those responsible for the MIG deal and other major malpractices during the previous regime are on the Gotabhaya camp.They wanted to topple Ranil’s government and escape from the charges levelled” he added.
Dissanayake said that topics such as the current burning issues in the country, bond scam and the recent communal clashes never figured in the debate.
He said the Rajapaksa camp only wanted to defend themselves from the murder, fraud and corruption charges leveled against them.Dissanayake charged that the no confidence motion only showcased extent of the breakdown of the political system in the country.The JVP leader also observed that the no confidence motion was poorly planned.
The attempt Dissanayake said had helped the UNP to iron out its internal issues.
The JVP leader said that the no confidence motion had also created a major division among the SLFP and UPFA members supporting the President.
He said the JVP always had a very clear stance about the no confidence motion and acted in a manner which best suited the interest of the country and the people. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna leader Anura Dissanayake.
