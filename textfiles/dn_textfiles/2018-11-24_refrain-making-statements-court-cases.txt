Ranil tells UNF MPs:
Refrain from making statements on Court cases

As none of us can presume or express our personal views in respect of cases pending before the Supreme Court or in other courts, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesighe yesterday (23) strongly advised the UNF MPs to refrain from giving statements pertaining to cases pending before Courts.
“We need not express our views pertaining to cases pending either before the Supreme Court or the other Judicial Bodies. We cannot presume or make foregone conclusions as to what type of judgement would be delivered. The Supreme Court would deliver its judgement at the proper time. We also cannot say how the Bench is comprised, whether it is of three or five or nine Judges, to deliver the judgement. In respect of the Supreme Court judgement, we cannot say beforehand whether the judicial pronouncement of the Supreme Court is going to be unanimous or division Bench decision,” Wickremesinghe said.
He went on to say that the UNP has submitted its petition.
“We have submitted our petition in respect of the Constitutional crisis and we cannot say whether the Supreme Court is going to allow our plea or refuse it.
Having submitted our petition, we expected a temporary release and we got it. We can only wish that at the end of the case in toto, that we would get permanent relief.”
But if you think you want to go beyond mere wishing for the success of the case, then conduct Bodhi Poojas, take part in religious activities and avoid making statements, in respect of matters of this nature:, the UNP leader told the UNF members.
