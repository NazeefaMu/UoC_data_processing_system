Holders Juventus into Italian Cup semi-finals

TURIN: Douglas Costa and Mario Mandzukic scored in either half as defending champions Juventus advanced to the semi-finals of the Italian Cup on Wednesday with a 2-0 win over city rivals Torino.
Brazilian Costa opened after quarter of an hour in the Allianz Stadium with Croatian Mandzukic adding the second amid controversy on 69 minutes to set up a meeting with Atalanta, who eliminated Serie A leaders Napoli 2-1 on Tuesday, in the final four.
Lazio, finalists in 2017, will meet AC Milan in the other semi-final played over two legs on January 31 and February 28.
The winning team will earn a direct entry to the group stages of the Europa League.
“We’ve reached the semi-final for the fourth year running and the lads took the right approach to this game,” said coach Massimiliano Allegri.
Torino had wanted a free-kick for Sami Khedira’s challenge on Afriyie Acquah in the build-up to Mandzukic’s goal which was awarded after consultation with the video assistant referee (VAR). AFP
