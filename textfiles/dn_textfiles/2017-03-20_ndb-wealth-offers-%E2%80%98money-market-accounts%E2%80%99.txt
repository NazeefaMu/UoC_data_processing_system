NDB Wealth offers ‘Money Market Accounts’

 NDB Wealth has introduced ‘Money Market Accounts’ for those interested in taking control of their own finance. ‘Money Market Accounts’ allows for the safety and liquidity of traditional bank savings but, often, with higher rates of return”, according to Christina Wesley, a Financial Advisor at NDB Wealth.
“Money Market Accounts” from NDB Wealth offers added benefits that make them more desirable as nontraditional savings choices. The flexibility to make penalty-free cash withdrawals at any time, your earnings being credited to your account daily, and earnings being tax-free in the hands of customers.
Wesley said the best feature of NDB Wealth’s ‘Money Market Accounts’ is its remarkable earnings potential, which is significantly higher than the interest earned from the average bank savings account in Sri Lanka.
“Many of our clients beginning with basic savings products, like our popular ‘Money Market Accounts’, are soon so emboldened, they go on to build sophisticated, sustainable wealth plans, with our help of course. Aided by the exemplary advice that only NDB Wealth can provide, our customers have used our expertise to help them build long-term and sustainable solutions to meet some very unique requests, from securing a worthwhile retirement income, to creating a self-sustaining college fund for their children”, Wesley said.
