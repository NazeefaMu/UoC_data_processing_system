Sri Lanka is Pakistan's 'Focus Country for 2017'

 The Export Development Board (EDB) of Sri Lanka with the collaboration of the High Commission of Pakistan, organized a well attended seminar on 'Business Opportunities with Pakistan', recently.
The Acting High Commissioner of Pakistan in Sri Lanka, Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra, was the chief guest on the occasion.
The seminar was attended by Commercial Secretary of the High Commission, Adnan Younis, President Sri Lanka-Pakistan Business Council, Rohitha Tillekaratne, President Sri Lanka-Pakistan Friendship, Trade and Investment Association, Ifthikhar Aziz and other dignitaries.
EDB Chairperson Indira Malwatte, in her opening remarks, informed the participants about EDB's efforts to increase exports by raising awareness about export opportunities for Sri Lankan businessmen in Pakistan. She also recalled her experience on a recent visit to Pakistan which gave her idea about the great potential that Pakistan holds for the Sri Lankan firms.
She appreciated the support of High Commission of Pakistan for the EDB's efforts to improve business relations between two countries.
The Chief Guest of the Seminar, Acting High Commissioner Dr. Sipra thanked the Chairperson for arranging this high profile seminar that shows keenness of the EDB to promote trade with Pakistan.
He was of the view that Sri Lankan products and services would find receptive customers in Pakistan as Sri Lanka has a very friendly image in the eyes of Pakistani people.
Dr. Sipra also informed the gathering that Sri Lanka would be the 'Focus Country for the year 2017'.
Sri Lanka is the only country that has been granted this status. To avail this status, the EDB would place a large Sri Lankan pavilion for Sri Lankan firms during the Expo Pakistan 2017 to be held in November this year at Expo Centre, Karachi.
The event will provide excellent opportunities for visiting businesses to showcase their premium Sri Lankan products and interact with Pakistani as well as international buyers. The Expo was visited by above 30,000 buyers last year.
The Acting High Commissioner assured the Government of Pakistan's full support to strengthen bilateral trade relations between the two nations.
Commercial Secretary of the High Commission, Adnan Younis, made a comprehensive presentation on prospects of business with Pakistan highlighting the fact that economic growth in Pakistan has picked up momentum which augurs well for trade and investment.
