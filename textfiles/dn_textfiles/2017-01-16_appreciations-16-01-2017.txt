[APPRECIATIONS - (16-01-2017)]

Hemantha Paranathanthri
He had admirable qualities
It is with a great sense of gratitude that I pen this tribute to dear friend Hemantha Paranathanthri whose untimely death was shocking and unbelievable.
He led a very good social life. On every occasion we met at a party or get together, he was with his friendly and warm smile and hospitality. At any gathering he was the chief entertainer. He was fun loving and enjoyed dancing. He enjoyed life to the fullest.
He was the most admired person in his family. Paranathanthri was a loving brother, husband, father and a father-in-law. He had admirable qualities.
A good friend of the common man, he was admired by everyone. A person of rare qualities, he did anything with dedication.
He was courageous and did not hesitate to take bold decisions whenever necessary.
That's where his success was.
He never cared about cast, creed or religion and moved among people of all walks of life without discrimination. I met him a long time ago when he came from abroad to settle down in Kandy.
From that time, we were very close and helpful to each other. It is also with a great sense of appreciation that I recall vividly how he helped me to develop my businesses.
He was a pillar of strength to the family in all his activities. We recall with happiness the beautiful memories we had with him and feel sad that he is no more with us.
Death is a common phenomenon which we bring along with our birth. But the loss of a close and friendly person, to those around him is hard to bear. His demise is mourned by all his relations and friends.
If he has still not reached the eternal bliss off Nibbana, may we meet him again in our journey of Sansara.

Eresha Nilmini
Sacrificed her life for the country
Memories are all that remain of C.C.M.P. Corporal Eresha Nilmini of the first battalion of the Sri Lanka Regular Women's Corps and the Sri Lanka Military Corps - Police.
She was the first military police woman to have died in an LTTE attack. She left her two sisters and parents forever, 22 years ago.
Born on May 2, 1974, Eresha received her education at St. Joseph's Convent, Nugegoda where she excelled in studies and sports.
She also had the privilege of being a teacher at the Christ Church Sunday school at Kotte. Eresha participated in many beauty contests. She was among the finalists at the Miss Jessy Queen of Dehiwala - Mt. Lavina and Kotte and also in the Miss Sri Lanka for Miss World contest in 1992. She was the third runner-up at the Sri Lanka Army Avurudu Kumari contest in 1995.
On completion of her studies, she sought employment and her first appointment was at a private hospital in Narahenpita as a receptionist.
Since she developed a liking to join the military police, she applied for a position and was one among the eight, who were selected out of 8,000 applicants.
As military duties called, she found herself posted to the Northern area during the LTTE war, after completing her initial period in Colombo and was in the rank of CCMP Corporal at the time.
When she was serving in Palali, Jaffna, Assistant Parish Priest Rev. Fr. Emil Joseph of the Sacred Heart Church, Kotte dreamt one night that Eresha had stepped on a claymore mine.
The priest related the dream to her parents on December 26, 1996.
On January 2, 1997, morning, a friend of her parents informed them that Eresha had met with an accident while serving near the Jaffna Campus Thirnelvely.
Her father rushed to the Army Head Quarters, Colombo only to learn that Eresha had died in a claymore mine blast.
Eresha was a lovable daughter with soft spoken and endearing qualities with never a harsh word.
An alms giving in her memory was held at the Ragama Ranaviru Sewana to disabled soldiers on January 2.

Ramani de S. Wijeyeratne
The live wire of the family
The honour of writing a few words about our late sister-in-law Ramani has fallen on me and I am glad that I received the opportunity to do so. I must begin by saying that the families of late Sherard de S. Wijeyeratne, our dad and late Peter Fernando got to know each other around 50 years ago and by that we got to know, Rita Ramani Malkanthi Fernando.
I would also like to mention that we knew Ramani even before her youngest brother Christo was born. Ramani was our childhood playmate who became our sister-in-law. As children we would play Hora-Police and I’m certain that it must have been during these play sessions that our brother Turlough managed to get a hold of Ramani, who later went on to become Ramani de S. Wijeyeratne.
She diligently looked into every aspect of her family; the needs and necessities of our brother as well as their children Dinuk and Dinukshi. She was truly the live wire of the family.
I can remember during our childhood days how our families used to go on trips and how Ramani as the eldest in their family, would look after her brothers and sisters. She was a pillar of strength and her siblings would bring their problems to her and she never hesitated to help them. I am confident that Ramani’s brothers and sisters namely, Rohini, Deepal, Dayamal and Christo will agree with me in saying that she played this role to near perfection until she received the call saying “come home, come home”.
She had humble beginnings and later together with Turlough, she worked very hard to come up in life. How tirelessly they went on to build their own house. She often encouraged our brother not to lose confidence when they encountered challenges.
She brought up her children with lots of love and care but maintained strict discipline and guided them in the right direction. She made sure that the children got the right kind of education and more importantly that they learned the right values of life. There were times she even argued with the teachers saying that they were not strict enough with her children.
Ramani encouraged her children to engage in sports and she never missed a rugby match in which Dinuk played. She was also very proud to be a part of the de S. W. family and so were we in having her as our sister-in-law.
Ramani first fell sick in 2001 when I was out of Sri Lanka at work. I can clearly recall writing to Dinuk, reminding him what his mother has done for the family and to stand by her in her hour of need. However, I must say that Dinuk, Dinukshi and our brother Turlough made many sacrifices and did everything in their capacity for the past 15 years – running from hospital to hospital, surgeon to surgeon, and even from church to church seeking divine intervention until that fateful day.
In October 2002, she was to travel to India for treatment and it coincided with my brother’s 50th birthday. She really wanted to have a big party for him but was extremely disappointed that she couldn’t do it.
If I remember right, she was taken to India on October 15, exactly on the day of our brother’s birthday. Since I was not in Sri Lanka, I thought I must return and see Ramani before she was taken to India. I flew that morning and together with my wife, we went to see Ramani. When we went to her place, some of her cousins were there and as soon as Ramani saw me she immediately said to them that I have come all the way for my brother’s 50th birthday and that she had spoiled the show.
I in turn, had to tell her that I really came to see her and my brother’s birthday can be celebrated later when she returns after her treatment. This is one of the many examples of how selfless she was. She was not worried about her sickness and what was in store for her, but was more concerned about having spoilt her husband’s 50th birthday celebrations.
Ramani was known for many things and one was her great faith. She was a devoted Catholic who never missed Mass. Just recently we were talking about all the church services she would attend every week without fail: Sunday Mass, Tuesday’s at St. Anthony’s, Wednesday’s at All Saints, Thursday’s at Fatima Church and Friday’s at Infant Jesus. I wonder whether she was able to do all this during the latter stages of her illness, but nothing usually stopped her from carrying out her spiritual activities. She always believed in “what a friend we have in Jesus” and it was with that belief that she was able to fight her sickness for such a long period.
After fulfilling most of her obligations she just simply said, “have thine own way Lord, have thine own way”.
Ramani was also well known for her generosity and passion for engaging in charitable deeds. She did not forget her humble beginnings and helped many people from her hometown in Ja-ela. We witnessed so many people coming in vans and buses for her funeral all the way from Ja-ela to pay their respects. Dinukshi mentioned that there were many people whom she did not know who walked up to her and told her how Ramani had helped them financially to pay their children’s school fees, buy their school books and uniforms and so on. Her children, Dinuk and Dinukshi were surprised at how she had managed to do all this without their knowledge but perhaps it was this love for helping people in need that the Lord above us must have been “waiting and watching [her]”.
We will continue to do what you did and we will also make sure that you are remembered in each of these sessions until someday “we shall meet on that beautiful shore”.
Eternal rest grant unto her O’ Lord and let perpetual light shine upon her. May she rest in peace.
V.P. de S. W
