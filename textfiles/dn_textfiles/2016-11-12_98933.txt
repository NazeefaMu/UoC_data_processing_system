Hosts BRC defends Six-a-side title after 20 years

Hosts BRC will be defending the title they won 20 years ago when they take on Sri Lanka Army SC in the opening match of the revived BRC Six-a-Side cricket tournament that commences at the Colts grounds today.
On the adjoining grounds at BRC, NCC will meet Navy SC in another match that will get the tournament started after 1996, the last occasion it was held. This tournament which became quite a popular hit when it was first introduced in 1969 was at the time the shortest format of cricket long before the advent of T20 cricket some four decades later. BRC were the last winners in their Centenary year in 1996 under the captaincy of Deepal Madurapperuma.
BRC has invited the 14 Premier tournament teams and the two top teams of the Emerging Trophy of Sri Lanka Cricket’s 2015/16 season to participate in this year’s contest.
The draw for the eight preliminary matches to be played today are:
*At BRC grounds:*
NCC vs Navy SC, Badureliya CC vs Colts, Tamil Union vs Saracens, Moors SC vs SLPA CC
*At Colts grounds: *
Army SC vs BRC, Galle CC vs CCC, Chilaw Marians CC vs Ragama CC, SSC vs Bloomfield.
From the quarterfinals onwards the tournament will be worked off at the BRC grounds tomorrow (Sunday).
Besides the trophies, attractive cash prizes awaits the winner of the competition who will carry away a thumping Rs. One Million. The runner-up will receive Rs. 250,000 while there are cash prizes for man-of-the-match from the quarterfinals onwards with a top prize of Rs. 100,000 for the man-of-the-finals.
