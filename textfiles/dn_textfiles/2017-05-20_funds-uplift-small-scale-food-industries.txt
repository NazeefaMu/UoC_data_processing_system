Funds to uplift small scale food industries

Rs.10 million has been allocated to uplift small scale food industries in the country. The programme is based on the experience gained from the pilot project conducted in the Western Province last year.
Steps to conduct the programme in all districts have been taken by the IDB. The main objective of the programme is to improve the productivity and quality of products of small scale food industries in Sri Lanka.
