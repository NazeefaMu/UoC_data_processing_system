Colombo High Court allows Gammanpila to travel to Laos

Colombo High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa yesterday permitted Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila to travel to Laos from June 12 to 15.
MP Gammanpila whose passport was impounded by Court for allegedly cheating Rs. 20 million and misappropriating another Rs. 21 million following his alleged fraudulent share transaction, had sought Colombo High Court’s permission to temporary lift his travel ban.
The High Court Judge ordered the accused to be present in Court on June 16.
Defence counsel Thushara Dissanayake appearing for MP Gammanpila moved High Court that his client be allowed to travel to Laos between June 12 and June 15 on an official tour for Parliamentarians.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that the prosecution would not raise objections for the request.
