Cashwagon embarks on  its first CSR project

Cashwagon which provides digital financial services and working to simplify the complex and often long financial processes of clients in Sri Lanka completed their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program. Under this the Weherawatte Junior School, located in a low income and difficult area in the Kalutara District was selected to donate school equipment and other educational materials.
It was found that the children in the school had a great need for an activity room in the primary school. “So the main purpose of the CSR project was to provide an activity room for the primary classes with equipment and materials for it,” an official from the company said. In addition the company also donated books and educational equipment to students of the Weherawatte Junior School for their studies. “This was greatly appreciated by the teachers who worked in this school.”
The Cashwagon company on this occasion was represented by; Cashwagon Sri Lanka Head, Samila Fernando, Operations Manager, Supun Sangadasa, Customer Services Supervisor, Janani Ferdinando, Quality Control Manager, Jithmi Fernando and several others.
An activity room for the primary school children was a great shortcoming in the school and the principal thanked Cashwagon for their contribution.
The Cashwagon management said that they hope to continue with several similar CSR projects in the future.
