In an earnest endeavour to develop much needed safety professionals in Sri Lanka, INSEE Cement recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National Institute of Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) to partner with the institute and initiate a robust mechanism to provide academic and practical training for youth in Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) sector.
Dr. Champika Amarasinghe, Director General, NIOSH said, “It is indeed commendable of Siam City Cement Lanka, renowned in the country as producers of high quality INSEE Cement to strengthen the construction industry by taking steps to remedy the current lack of safety professionals in Sri Lanka. This clearly demonstrates INSEE Cement’s commitment to enhancing occupational health & safety in the country.”
Nandana Ekanayake, CEO of INSEE Cement said “We strongly believe in building a brighter future for Sri Lanka and this is one of our practical and farsighted ways of achieving the goal of upgrading the proficiency of youth in our country and making them understand the importance of health and safety.”
The training will provide for 12 participants with a NVQ Level-5 Safety Officer Qualification. The structured one-year curriculum will be initially conducted at the NIOSH Office in the Ministry of Labour.
The Course conducted by competent professionals will provide practical exposure in an advanced industrial environment to the participants. Gayan Fernando, Head of Health and Safety at INSEE Cement commented, “We are very appreciative of the officials of the Ministry of Labour Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development for joining hands with INSEE Cement to enhance the competencies of safety professionals who are in short supply in the country.
