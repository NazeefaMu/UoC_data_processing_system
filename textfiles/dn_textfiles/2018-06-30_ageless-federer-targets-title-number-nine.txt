Ageless Federer targets title number nine

LONDON, Friday - Roger Federer is already the most prolific and oldest winner of the Wimbledon men’s singles title but when he saunters into the All England Club on Monday he will do so as favourite to lift the trophy for a ninth time.
The seemingly ageless Swiss, who turn 37 in August, has planned his year around defending the title he claimed last year by beating Croatia’s Marin Cilic.
If anything Federer’s 2017 Wimbledon fortnight was the most impressive of his career as he swept through the draw without losing a set for the first time — ending a five year wait to nudge ahead of Pete Sampras on the all-time list.
Nothing that has happened in the past 12 months suggests Federer’s hunger is diminished with victory at this year’s Australian Open taking his Grand Slam title haul to 20. He skipped the claycourt season which was against dominated by his great rival Rafael Nadal who earlier this month won the French Open for an 11th time to move to within three of Federer’s record Grand Slam tally. Federer returned to the grasscourts in Germany, winning the title in Stuttgart before reaching the Halle final this month where he was surprisingly beaten by Croatian Borna Coric.
While Coric’s victory offers some encouragement for the rest of the field, Federer will not have dwelled on it. After all, he lost to veteran German Tommy Haas in the build-up to last year’s Wimbledon but was untouchable once he arrived in his favourite English country garden.- Agencies
