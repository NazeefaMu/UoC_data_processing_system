Compromise will lie somewhere in between

March 25 marks the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, an agreement that established the European Economic Community. The document is still one of the two most significant treaties in the contemporary European Union (EU).
The EU is also one of the major influencers in Sri Lanka and as Sri Lanka faces the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Tung-Lai Margue, Ambassador of the Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives in an interview with the Daily News said the events in Geneva were certainly of interest to the EU in the context of the GSP+ process and the European Parliament, which is set to review the process next, would be keeping a close watch on the outcomes from Geneva.
Excerpts follow:
Q: Can you talk about the economic growth that the EU model has brought with it?
A: I think that few people realise how much EU membership has brought to member states. In terms of shared prosperity, the average GDP per capita in the EU has almost doubled over the past 20 years. The increase has even been over 10-fold for some of the poorest countries. Of course, you have a mix of very developed countries, such as Germany, Spain, and the UK, and other countries that have joined more recently, such as Bulgaria and Romania who are not as developed.
Nevertheless, for these countries, and in particular the ones from the eastern part of Europe, membership has resulted in very clear increased prosperity and increased income for the populations. Another thing that people don’t always think about is unemployment.
Of course there is unemployment, but what needs to be known is that 10 million jobs were created between January 2013 and September 2016. Of course, you have different situations in different countries, and Spain still has a large share of unemployed people, but it’s being resolved progressively, and the same applies to Italy. But they are catching up and creating new jobs. But the big challenge remains youth unemployment. It’s clear that we’ll still have to work on this more.
The 300 million euro Juncker plan for the three coming years will help create new jobs.
Q: Can you talk about how the EU system and values have influenced the Asian region?
A: Well, what I would like to say is that the EU has been an evolving project. It started as an economic project, its founding states also sought to avoid the repetition of two world wars. Behind that economic background, you also had the idea of creating a form of solidarity between the people of Europe. So it progressively became a more political undertaking, and with the treaty of Lisbon it became the European Union. The accent on the “Union” is very clear.
It was a political ambition to put together a number of areas of cooperation that were until then purely under national sovereignty. It has shifted towards cooperation in areas that were for a very long time issues of sovereignty. For instance, home affairs and justice are now very clearly strong areas of cooperation, as are defense and security.
At the same time, because of our importance as a trade partner and as a trade block, we have developed the external projection of our values that are incorporated even in our trade matters. The GSP+ is a very clear example, where we use the leverage of trade to promote EU values in terms of human rights, good governance, and rule of law.
We have very long-lasting cooperation with Asian countries in general, and we are trying to promote these ties through a number of regional organizations. We have very close contacts with ASEAN, and we would like to have similar regional cooperation with SAARC, but unfortunately that organization is less developed and less strong, if I may say so, than ASEAN. But we try to promote regional organizations. And the EU discusses policy matters of concern, such as violations of human rights, improvements to civil society, and the fight against corruption, with each of these organizations.
Q: What is your view on what Sri Lanka should be doing with respect to the UN Human Rights Council’s draft resolution?
A: Although the process is not finalized yet. We have already made a declaration that we are fully supporting the process and most likely the renewal of the resolution for the two coming years. So there’s no doubt about our support.
And the Sri Lankan government is behind the process, and we are seeing a commitment from the government to pursue its efforts in terms of reforms. And we are supporting this, not only through words, but also through concrete projects.
Q: Should the Sri Lanka’s progress on human rights be part of its application for GSP+ status?
A: What is happening in Geneva is certainly of interest in the context of the GSP+ process. The European Parliament is looking at the position of the European Commission, which on January 11 shared that it would be ready to give Sri Lanka the green light for GSP+ status. But it’s now in the hands of the Counsellor of Ministers of the member states and of the European Parliament.
The Parliament in particular will not just strictly look at the conventions. They will have a broader view of things, and obviously they are very interested in what is happening in Geneva.
Q: What is the likelihood that GSP+ status is awarded?
A: It’s a bit difficult for me to take a strong position on that. What I can say is that my service, the External Action Service, and the European Commission, have assessed that Sri Lanka is ready to get it back because of the substantial progress it has made. Now, you need to know that the European Parliament is an independent body. What they would say remains to be seen.
When members of the Parliament came here last October to visit the Sri Lankan authorities, they noted that a lot of progress had indeed been made on human rights issues and reconciliation in particular. But they also noted that there were a number of issues that remain open.
The discussions in the Parliament will focus on these open issues, and those talks will occur by the end of the month. These talks will be very important for the overall outcome, which we expect to be announced in mid-May.
Q: Can you comment on the Sri Lankan reconciliation process?
A: That’s a very vast question. Reconciliation was at the heart of the campaign that brought President Sirisena to power in 2015. The coalition government also confirmed reconciliation as an aim later on, and indeed you referred to the resolution of the UNHRC. Reconciliation is very much at the heart of that resolution. We have been working very closely with the authorities and following what has been done since 2015. A number of important international instruments and conventions have been adopted. In particular, we are pleased with conventions concerning the disappearance of persons, which is very closely linked with reconciliation.
We have also noted that there have been two nationwide consultations: on constitutional reform and transitional justice. The constitutional reform is very important because it will look at three key elements that are very much connected. Two of them are very closely connected to the reconciliation process: the executive presidency and electoral reform. Last but not least is the devolution of competences. That is one of the key elements, to give confidence and voices to this country’s minority people living in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The fact that land has been returned is encouraging, but the amount is not yet sufficient.. The creation of the Office of Missing Persons is encouraging, though we are still waiting on its implementation. The rehabilitation of former LTTE combatants is a strong signal as well. We know that the government is about to adopt a Human Rights Action Plan, and we are waiting to see what will come out, and it will also contain important elements that can be connected to the reconciliation process.
Q: Do you see any problems with the process?
A: What is of concern to us is that the process is slowing down. The government started well with a number of important reform elements. What we still want to see is further progress on transitional justice. We know it’s difficult, but we also expect the government to stick to its commitments. The constitutional process has also been slowed. I did get confirmation from the Prime Minister that this process would be taken to its end and would include a referendum. It remains to be seen when this will take place, but the commitment has been reconfirmed.
One package of things where we expect progress to soon be made is the replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Linked to that, we expect improvement to be made on the code of criminal procedure. Now, where progress has not taken place yet is on security reform. Clearly we know that it’s a complex matter, but the government should also give signals in that area. We still feel that there’s a strong influence of the military in the economic activities in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. To conclude, there’s been a lot of progress, but a lot remains to be done. We remain convinced that there is tremendous opportunity for this coalition government to deliver for its citizens in order to ensure prosperity and a true reconciliation process.
Q: To move away from Sri Lanka, do you think the rising tide of populism is a direct threat to the European Union?
A: I would like to note that this trend is not only to be seen in Europe. In the United States. populism is very clearly what brought the new President to power. We see these types of trends in Turkey and in other countries. I believe that there are always a number of explanations for any trend, but I think that the effects of globalization are part of this. Is it a threat that can endanger the EU? I don’t think so. I have noted, both in my contact with headquarters in Brussels and with other colleagues, that there is an anti-Trump movement that is helpful for Europe. I think people have started to realize that just providing power to those who don’t have the experience, or who come up with poor economic programs, is a bad idea.
These people have started to realize that they are putting themselves in danger if they vote for these people. There’s always a vote of protest, but not many people think this vote of protest will bring people to power who are perhaps not ready to be in power. Something must be done to help those who are disappointed and those who are left aside. We can’t continue ignoring them and this phenomenon. And that’s the reason why I was very much encouraged by reading the white paper of the President of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker, that discusses how to think about the future of Europe. Topics that will be considered going forward are how to counter populism, nationalism, and xenophobia.
Q: What will the future of the EU look like post-Brexit?
A: I believe that the Brexit was a shock for all of us, including, I think, the population of the UK. I think that this shock forces the heads of states and governments to get their acts together. It’s very complex and difficult to know what we should propose to the governments and the people of Europe to regain their confidence in the EU construction. And there are a number of options on the table, like going for more integration or more individual state-focused activities.
The solution or compromise will probably lie somewhere in between. There are a lot of countries that are thinking of promoting enhanced cooperation and are ready to progress on certain areas, such as defense, without waiting for the rest of the EU to join. The Treaty of Lisbon allows enhanced cooperation between countries in certain areas without having the whole club coming along. It allows for bridges between individual member states. I think that’s one way to re-launch the machine. The debate will start, but it will be impacted by a number of elections that are about to take place. So we’ll have to see the impact of these elections. But I’m very much convinced that there will be a strong political commitment between the 27 member states.
