Over 71,000 will get kerosene oil subsidy from June 1

Over 71,000 Samurdhi Beneficiaries and the outboard motor boat fishermen would get kerosene oil subsidy from June 1.
The Finance and Mass Media Ministry sources said the Samurdhi beneficiaries would be provided with a coupon for kerosene subsidy, while the fishermen would be given money to their accounts.
However, only Samurdhi beneficiaries who do not have electricity get the subsidy. According to the statistics, 47,555 Samurdhi beneficiaries would get the kerosene oil subsidy. Of the fishermen, around 24,282 using small scale outboard motor boats would be entitled to the kerosene oil subsidy.
The Treasury would direct the funds to the Social Empowerment Ministry to pay the compensation.
The ministry sources revealed that the measure was taken under the instructions of Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera not to put the burden of the kerosene oil price increase on the low income earners.
The Ministry sources revealed that the fuel prices would be revised once every two months with the new price formula in comparison to the fuel price fluctuation in the Singaporean market.
The sources revealed the price could be increased or decreased accordingly. The fuel price formula was implemented on the Cabinet approval. One could predict the fuel price in Sri Lanka according to the formula to be revised in the future.
The price revision would be announced on the fifth day of every two months.
