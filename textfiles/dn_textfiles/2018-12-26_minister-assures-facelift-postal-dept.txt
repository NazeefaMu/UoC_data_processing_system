Minister assures facelift for Postal Dept

New technology and private partnerships will be introduced to the Postal Department to improve its revenue, Muslim Religious Affairs and Postal Services Minister M.H.A. Haleem said.
He assumed duties at his Ministry and paid his respects to the Mahanayakes of the Malwathu, Asgiriya Chapters yesterday.
The war had destroyed many post offices in the Northern and Eastern provinces, the Minister said. “I will take steps to refurbish and reinstate all of them in the near future,” he said.
“The United National Party (UNP) has understood the way it needs to reshape itself to serve the country. The UNP leaders have now understood their mistakes and what they need for change,” the Minister said.
Haleem said the UNP had not signed any agreement with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), and they have only come to a common understanding on certain issues. These include releasing the Northern land of civilians and political prisoners, he said. The Minister said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will form a broad alliance with other parties along with senior SLFPers to win forthcoming elections and develop the country.
