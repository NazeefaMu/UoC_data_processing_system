Chalmway charms on the ramp

Many awe-inspiring fashion statements took to the ramp as Chalmway International Hair and Beauty Institute’s (CIHBI) 17th graduation ceremony unfurled at the Bishop’s College Auditorium recently. Some of the beauty and fashion industry’s biggest names including Harris Wijesinghe, Forever Australia Salon Manager Jodie Falzo and CIHBI founder and chairperson Chandhani Bandara.
A highlight of the event was the fashion show titled ‘Fantasy Bride’ which showcased the creative talents of the students.
Speaking at the event CIHBI founder and chairperson Chandhani Bandara said that the graduation ceremony is a pride to her as well as to her students because it marks the coming of age of the next generation of beauty experts.
“We work hard to guide our students to reach their natural potentials in becoming knowledgeable professionals in the industry and always strive for excellence. The stunning fashion extravaganza is an evidence that this year too we have succeeded in our endeavours,” she said.
