Fence of palmyrah plants  to prevent elephant menace

Palmyrah Development Board has made arrangements to launch a scheme to plant palmyrah plants in a zig-zag style to prevent wild elephants and tuskers entering the villages at night.
The Kalpitiya Regional Office of the Palmyrah Development Board (PDB) has already handed over about 10,000 palmyrah seeds to the Wanatavilluwa Pradeshiya Sabha to start a nursery.
This novel method will be an environment-friendly and natural way of protecting rural villages from wild elephants which are destroying crops and houses and are a danger to villagers in the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the NWP.
