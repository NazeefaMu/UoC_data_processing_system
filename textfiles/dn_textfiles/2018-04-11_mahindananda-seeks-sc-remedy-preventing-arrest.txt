Mahindananda seeks SC remedy preventing arrest

Former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage filed an appeal (Special Leave to Appeal) in the Supreme Court challenging an order of Court of Appeal which dismissed a writ petition filed by Aluthgamage who sought an order preventing FCID from arresting him.
On April 6, the Court of Appeal had dismissed a writ petition filed by former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage who sought an order preventing FCID from arresting him for allegedly committing offences under Penal Code and Public Property Act while importing sports equipment during last Presidential Election.
Through this appeal petition, Aluthgamage has challenged the Court of Appeal order dated April 6, 2018 and sought an Interim Order preventing the FCID from arresting him over the allegations under Penal Code and Public Property Act in connection with importation of 14,000 carrom boards and 11,000 draught boards during the previous regime.
It was revealed that Police investigations launched following a complaint against Aluthgamage over a Rs. 53.1 million fraud said to have taken place, when importing sports equipment to the sports clubs.
