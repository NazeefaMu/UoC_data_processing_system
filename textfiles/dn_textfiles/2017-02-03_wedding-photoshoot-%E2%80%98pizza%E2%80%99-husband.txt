Wedding photoshoot with ‘pizza’ husband

People get married all the time and while photoshoots are in vogue right now, everybody is trying to be different. However in a very odd situation, a woman gets married to a pizza and does a complete wedding photoshoot with the pizza as her husband.
Christine Wagner, 18, took her love for pizza to a totally different level when she decided to get married to it. She got the idea when she was busy looking at her grandmother’s vintage dress. People have definitely got married to animals but being wed to a pizza is a totally different matter altogether.
Her love story doesn’t end there as once she posted about it on social media, a photographer Marcy Harris asked her if she would be willing to do an actually photoshoot for the wedding. Marcy decided to create a whole photo series of Christine’s love for pepperoni pizza.
Both, the married girl and the photographer planned the perfect shoot with the pizza actually having a bowtie on it and using a finger candy as a ring. The pair went ahead with the photoshoot and it is nothing like you could imagine. Mirror
