Sarasavi publishers,  HelpAge team up  for a worthy cause

Continuing in its efforts to restore the vision of needy citizens in the country, Sri Lanka’s premier book publisher Sarasavi Book Shop during the past three years assisted HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) by selling a record number of over 100,000 New Year, Vesak, X’Mas, Ramazan and other seasonal greeting cards to help underprivileged elderly citizens in the country.
The entire proceeds of the sales are utilized to perform free cataract surgeries and also to conduct free mobile medical and eye care camps in all parts of the country.
The services are conducted free for needy elderly citizens over the age of 55 years.
HelpAge Sri Lanka is a Not for Profit Charitable Organization that works to resolve the social, medical and low vision issues faced by destitute Sri Lankan elderly citizens.
HelpAge Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge highly admired the Sarasavi Book Publishers for extending its invaluable support towards a needy section in our society.
“There is a marked improvement in donations made by people towards the free cataract surgery program which has been conducted by HelpAge during the past 32 years,” he said .
Executive Director Liyanawaduge further said HelpAge expects similar donations from prospective donors to fund towards this program.
HelpAge Eye Hospital Manager Ajitha de Alwis said 20 low income elderly citizens undergo free cataract surgeries every day at the Eye Hospital in Wellawatte (opposite Savoy Cinema).
Sarasavi Book Publishers, Chairman Premasiri Haputhanthri admired the invaluable service rendered by HelpAge Sri Lanka towards underprivileged Senior Citizens to improve their health facilities, especially by providing them with free cataract surgeries.
HelpAge, Fundraising Manager Ruchilalani Batuwantudawa expressed her gratitude to Chairman Haputhanthri for his continues assistance to promote HelpAge greeting cards for the past 10 years.
