Sacred Heart Church observes Good Friday with passion play

The Sacred Heart Church observed Good Friday with a Passion Play depicting the crucifixion of Jesus Christ by performing the “way of the cross” at a special religious service. The Passion Play began from the Sacred Heart Church to St. Anthony’s College, Katugastota under the guidance of Rev. Father Suseinadan yesterday morning.
The Stations of the Way of the Cross are usually observed during lent, especially on Lenten Fridays and most importantly on Good Fridays. It is one of the most popular devotion of Roman Catholics.
The devotion consists of meditating on 14 events which form the 14 Stations of the Cross.
The purpose of the devotion is to focus on the Passion of Jesus Christ - a long version of “Stations of the Cross” or “Way of the Cross” with meditations and prayers.
On Good Friday, Christians worldwide are commemorating the crucifixion and the death of Jesus Christ at Mount Calvary in Jerusalem, the holy city. Good Friday is also called Great Friday, Black Friday, or Easter Friday and is the Friday before Easter.
