Indonesia-Sri Lanka industrial ties strengthened

Indonesia and Sri Lanka will strengthen cooperation in the industrial sector to improve economic growth of the two countries.
Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) on ASEAN in Hanoi, Vietnam agreed in this regard.
Indonesian Industry Minister Airlangga Hartarto said the government had offered ‘Complete Package’ cooperation to Sri Lanka to build railway facilities and infrastructure in the country. “So it is not only selling railroad cars, but also offering signaling systems, rails, to depots and stations,” he said.
He said Indonesia is one of the biggest players in the manufacturing of railway facilities in Southeast Asia. Indonesia’s domestic railroad industry products have been able to fulfill domestic, even overseas market orders, especially in developing countries and regional markets.
“We continue to spur the national railway industry to dominate the domestic market and increasingly play a role in the supply chain of the railroad industry for the global market,” Airlangga said in his official statement in Jakarta on Thursday.
The Industry Ministry has encouraged state-owned railway manufacturer PT INKA to continue to conduct coaching activities for small and medium-scale component industries so that they can produce products of a standard quality and can be used in the railroad industry.
The Minister said the domestic railway supporting industry has been able to produce around 70 per cent of the component requirements, including the railroad frame. “We hope that in the next two to three years, the industry is capable of up to 80 per cent of the needs,” he said.
The Ministry actively spurred the national railroad industry to continue to innovate technology, especially for export-oriented products. It proactively establishes business cooperation and promotion to increase market access to countries that have a large enough market potential, especially in Asia such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Zambia, Nigeria and Egypt.
The Governments of Indonesia and Sri Lanka also followed up on previous agreements in the trade sector. One of them is the joint efforts of the two countries to export ready-made garments to the European Union.
Based on Making Indonesia 4.0 road map, the textile and textile products (TPT) industry is one of five manufacturing sectors that are prioritised as pioneers in the road map for the application of the fourth industrial revolution. The national textile industry has high competitiveness because its manufacturing structure has been integrated from upstream to downstream and its products are also known to have good quality in the international market.
The Ministry noted that 30 percent of ready-made garments from the national textile industry are to meet the needs of the domestic market, while 70 percent is for export.
The export value of the national textile industry reached $12.58 billion in 2017, up six per cent compared to the previous year. The sector contributes IDR150.43 trillion to GDP in 2017. - NNC
