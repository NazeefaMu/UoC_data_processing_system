RHS Great British Village Show
by Matthew Biggs and Thane Prince
For many gardeners the village show represents the pinnacle of their sowing and growing year. This book takes you behind the scenes of a very British institution, with an insight into the worlds of both contestants and judges. Garden journalist Matthew Biggs hands out insider knowledge on how to cultivate some of the most popular veg and flower exhibits, while the jam-tastic Thane Prince shares her recipes for prize-winning cakes and preserves. Whether you’re after a best-in-show rosette, or just want to know how to grow a marrow, you’ll find this book both fun and informative.

Planting: A New Perspective
by Piet Oudolf and Noel Kingsbury
Piet Oudolf is one of the world’s leading contemporary garden designers, bringing architectural harmony to his naturalistic gardening approach through heavy use of perennial plants. This book is a real treat for anyone who wants an insight into how the mind of such a creative designer works and includes plans to some of his most famous works along with expansive photography. But unlike some designer’s portfolio pieces, this book also ably demonstrates how us amateurs can replicate similar effects in our own back garden, making it a practical and illuminating choice.

Build a Better Vegetable Garden
by Joyce Russell and Ben Russell
For some gardeners, building wooden structures provides them with a greater sense of achievement than cultivating the plants that grow in and around them. This new book contains 30 practical projects – from fruit cage to boot cleaner – that will keep anyone with a saw, drill and a few bits of timber happy for weeks. Every stage of each project is clearly photographed with such easy to follow instructions that even the most hammer-shy gardener will be able to knock out a cold frame with ease.
