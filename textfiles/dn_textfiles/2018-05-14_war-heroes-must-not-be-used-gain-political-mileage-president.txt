War heroes must not be used to gain political mileage - President

President Maithripala Sirisena says it is not ethical for a political party to use war heroes to further their own political agenda in any way.
The President made these remarks unveiling the ‘Wayamba Rana Abhiman’ War Heroes’ Monument in Kurunegala, Friday evening (11).
The new monument has been established to replace war heroes’ monument removed due to the Kurunegala - Dambulla main road development project. Under the guidance of the North - Western Provincial Council, the Road Development Authority and Ranaviru Seva Authority this monument had been erected near the Maligapitiya ground, Kurunegala, where the previous monument was located. Construction work of the memorial have been carried out by the Corps of Engineer Services (CES) of the Sri Lanka Army.
This war memorial displays all the names of the war heroes of the North-Western Province who sacrificed their lives to protect the motherland.The entire project has been completed at a cost of Rs 27 million.
Even though this war memorial was removed to make way for the road development project, during the past period some section of the society attempted to give a political interpretation stating that the government had forgotten the war heroes and had removed their memory.
A few protests were also organised opposing this move and when the President visited Kurunegala to attend a ceremony in August 31, 2016 he promised to establish a more creative war heroes’ memorial at the place.The new monument was erected to fulfill the pledge given by the President and the foundation stone laid on November 30, 2016 to create this monument.
President Sirisena said the present government at any time did not work to undermine war heroes but always tried to ensure their rights and accorded them the honour on behalf of the nation.
The President rejected all accusations towards the government regarding war heroes. He said that all these statements are meant to make the government uncomfortable.
Even though the government is accused of victimising the real soldier, the victimisation occurred during the past regime and the present government has fulfilled its responsibilities with the support of international cooperation to secure the pride of the soldiers.
The President said the present government took action to put an end to the talk of an electric chair and bringing foreign judges into the country to hear cases against our war heroes.
"Even though certain members of the army were taken into custody for investigation purposes, it is not in anyway hunting soldiers and no soldier who has protected the country was harmed and the government has worked towards giving them the highest respect," the President said.
Co-operative Development Provincial Minister Piyasiri Ramanayake presented the cheque of financial donation made by the North-Western Province Co-operative members through the War Heroes’ Welfare Fund to build the War Heroes Memorial, to the President and later the president handed over it to the North-Western Province Chief Secretary G.B.M. Sirisena.
North Western Province Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake presented a souvenir which included the structure of the War Heroes’ Memorial.
