SPC passes Sustainable Development Bill

The Southern Provincial Council (SPC) passed the Sustainable Development Bill with an amendment with the majority when it was presented for the second time yesterday.
According to the amendment, the Development Council should include a representative from each Provincial Council instead of the suggested three representatives of all Councils. The amendment was tabled by Governing UPFA Chief Whip Ajith Rajapakse and seconded by Chief Opposition Whip Asoka Dhanawansa de Silva.
Twenty six UPFA, UP, and Democratic Party members voted for while UPFA members A.G.C. Piyasiri and Channa Saliya Mendis abstained from voting.
