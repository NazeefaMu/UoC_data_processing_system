Maussakele, Castlereigh reservoirs at risk of overflow

 National Water Supply and Drainage Board Engineers warned today that the water in Maussakele and Castlereigh reservoirs will overflow soon due to constant rainfall in the up country region.
The engineers said the water levels indicated 14 and 9 feet, 2 inches in the two reservoirs respectively.
The Maussakele and Castlereigh reservoirs supplies water to Laxapana, New Laxapana, Polpitiya, Canyon, and Wimalasurendra dams of the Laxapana hydro power plant complex and five other power plants.
