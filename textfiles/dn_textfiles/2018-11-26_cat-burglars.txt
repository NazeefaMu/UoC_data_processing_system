Cat burglars?

What do you do after you fail? Purr your disappointment away and try harder. Two devoted art lovers have been trying to get into the Hiroshima Onomichi City Museum of Art for years now, but have been consistently kicked out just as they were entering it.
Meet Ken Chan and Gosaku, the most persistent feline out there. It started a couple of years ago when the meowseum debuted a show entitled ‘Cats - Mitsuaki Iwago Photography Exhibition.’
Just days after the exhibit opened, an unusual visitor arrived, creating the best publicity for the event you could imagine.
The security guard, however, blocked its path at the front door.
In March of last year, the same black neighbourhood cat returned. But this time it brought a ginger friend. Sadly, the two of them were forced to turn around. The two have probably taken residence somewhere nearby the meowseum, because they keep coming back again and again. Eventually, its staff started tweeting photos of the times they drop by, making them internet celebrities.And while they haven’t yet officially made their way inside, at least they receive snuggles and pets from the white-gloved guards when they take the art lovers back outside.
