"President Maithripala Sirisena could reunite broken hearts of Sri Lankans who experienced the cruelty of war for a long period of time. He could re-establish a hope in the minds of the people in North East who were brutally tortured for the past 30 years. The international image he has already got is significant,” Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.The Minister was addressing the ceremony held to mark the opening of several development projects in the Northern Province recently. It was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Minister said physical resources of a country can strongly be established through development projects and a massive social contribution is done through them.
“Today the country has been already entered to a rapid development procedure, which can fulfil public needs to its best. Development projects in East are being successfully carrying out. The project carried out by the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry to uplift services rendered by Local Authorities in East has allocated Rs 6,500 million to develop the area. Rs 300 million has been spent for resettlements of Sampoor," he said.
