Jumbo dies in van collision

A wild elephant died when a van hit it at the Yaka Wanguwa on the main road from Kantale to Habarana on Thursday morning.
The van hit the wild elephant near Kithul Ukkuwa close to Yaka Wanguwa.
The elephant, nearly 8 feet tall, was usually roaming around Kithul Ukkuwa.
Kithul Ukkuwa police and wildlife officers of the Kawdulla Range Office of the Wild Life Department are investigating.
Meanwhile, the committee appointed to investigate the recent train collisions with wild elephants reportedly handed over its report to Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday.
