Indian PM to attend UN Vesak Day celebrations here

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Sri Lanka in May for a United Nations programme marking a major Buddhist festival, a media report quoted a Sri Lankan minister as saying.
Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said Modi has confirmed his participation in the first-ever UN Vesak Day celebrations in Sri Lanka. UN Day of Vesak is celebrated annually in Buddhist countries. Devotees pay homage to the Buddha during the festival celebrated on the Sunday closest to May’s full moon.
This is the first time Sri Lanka is hosting the festival and has invited several world leaders for the celebrations on May 12.
Over a thousand representatives from India, China, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, Tibet, Bhutan, Mongolia and other countries where Buddhism is practiced are likely to attend, the report said. PTI
