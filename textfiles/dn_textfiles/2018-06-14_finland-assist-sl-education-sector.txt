Finland to assist SL education sector

Finland has pledged to extend the maximum possible contribution towards the development of the education sector in Sri Lanka.   
This assurance was given when visiting Finnish Deputy Education Minister Petri Peltoness called on Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and held discussions at the Ministry on June 12.   
During this meeting, discussions centred around a host of new policies and progress relating to the development of education in Sri Lanka, the Education Ministry said in a press release. The visiting Finnish Education Minister recalled that a Sri Lankan delegation led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam visited Finland on an official tour last year and studied new knowledge technology and strategies which would be helpful for the education sector in Sri Lanka.   
During the discussions held last year, the government of Finland had promised to help Sri Lanka in the development of technical and vocational education. 
Finland has promised to assist Sri Lanka in its 13-year mandatory school education programme and will assist to modernise the technical, vocational and IT curriculum and organise special training programmes for the benefit of teachers involved in these subjects.
