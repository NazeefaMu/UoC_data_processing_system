Inland Revenue schols for high AL achievers

A ceremony to award scholarships to students who topped the GCE Advanced Level Examination was held yesterday under the patronage of Inland Revenue Commissioner General Ivan Dissanayake.
The Commissioner General said the objective of organizing this ceremony was to send the message out that the cost of free education falls on the taxpayers and that students who have achieved the island’s best ranks are the result of this. The Commissioner General said the Department had been able to achieve an income of Rs. 602 billion in 2017.
“We have not used government funds to distribute scholarships. The Inland Revenue staff made contributions for this,” he said.
