Eight IUSF protesters remanded till May 19

 
The eight Inter University Students’ Federation protesters alleged to have protested defying Court orders were remanded till May 19 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, today.
Yesterday, the eight undergraduates including a Buddhist Monk who behaved unlawfully at the IUSF protest in Town Hall were arrested by Police.
Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the protesters who blocked roads and caused traffic jams, inconveniencing the public.
The IUSF said that yesterday’s protest was mainly over abolishing the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.
In addition, the IUSF demanded the government to take action on university admission shortages, to allocate six percent of funds to education, to refrain from money charges within school systems, stop selling government organisations and to refrain from making ETCA agreements between India and Sri Lanka.
