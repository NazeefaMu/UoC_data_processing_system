Professionals back President to abolish Singapore FTA

Professionals’ National Front (PNF) Secretary Kapila Perera said all professionals will support President Maithripala Sirisena if he takes action to abolish the Singapore - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement which is detrimental to the country.
While speaking after the appointment of Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister recently, the President categorically said that the way in which the Singapore - Sri Lanka FTA signed was wrong,” he added. Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he further said the Commission that was appointed to investigate the Singapore - Sri Lanka FTA has also noticed that there are many shortcomings in the agreement.
Former Minister Malik Samarawickreme signed this agreement without the consent of Parliament or Cabinet bringing shame to the country. The President seems to be of the opinion that the agreement should be abolished and it should be reviewed by a panel of experts and the intellectuals again.
“We urge President and the Prime Minister not to appoint former Minister Malik Samarawickreme to the same post again,” he said.
GMOA representative Dr. Danushka Devapriya said Sri Lanka until now has signed FTAs that only covered goods. However, this agreement opened the country’s service sector to foreigners.
“The law in Singapore updates frequently while it is stagnant in our country.That is why the service sector in our country must be protected.Former Minister Malik Samarawickreme cannot understand the value of professionals and has betrayed the country by signing this,” he added.
