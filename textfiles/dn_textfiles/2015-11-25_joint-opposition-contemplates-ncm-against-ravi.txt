Joint opposition contemplates NCM against Ravi

Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma yesterday said that the joint opposition is contemplating bringing a No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake for manipulating the figure to show that 6 per cent of has been allocated for the education sector.
He said that the members of the joint opposition were to take the final decision with regard to the No Confidence Motion against Karunanayake last evening
“President Maithripala Sirisena gave us an undertaking that he would give us an opportunity to have a discussion with Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over the 2016 budget,” Alahapperuma said. He alleged that the Finance Minister has misled the President, Parliament and the people by manipulating the figures to show that 6 per cent has been allocated for the education sector. Alahapperuma was speaking at a press conference at the N.M. Perera Centre yesterday. He said the people have lost confidence in the budget due to the manipulations of the present government.
Parliamentarian Dullus Alahapperuma added that President Maithripala Sirisena has said that the government has allocated 6 per cent for education for the first time. “We made him understand about the falsehood behind the Finance Minister’s claim that 6 per cent has been allocated for education through Budget 2016,”he said.
MP Alahapperuma said the President clearly understood the truth and promised us to arrange a meeting with the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister.
