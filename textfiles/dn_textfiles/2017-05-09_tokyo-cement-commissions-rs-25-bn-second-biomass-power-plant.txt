Tokyo Cement commissions Rs 2.5 bn second biomass power plant

President Maithripala Sirisena inaugurated Tokyo Cement’s second Biomass Power Plant in Trincomalee yesterday.
This is part of a series of events held in commemoration of late A. Y. S. Gnanam, the founder Chairman of the company.
The Tokyo Eastern Biomass Plant began construction in 2015 with an investment of over Rs 2.5 billion. The plant will contribute 70 Gwh per year to the national grid generated using industrial and agricultural waste sourced through community trade.
In total, the plant will produce 160 Thousand MW Hours of clean renewable energy per year, which equals to the annual electricity consumption of 100,000 Sri Lankan rural households.
Tokyo Cement Managing Director S. R. Gnanam said this contributes towards achieving the National Renewable Energy Target to generate 10% of the country’s energy requirement through all forms of non-conventional renewable energy resources by 2017. “With this opening, the company becomes the single largest contributor of renewable energy in the nation, generating 23 megawatts with the ability to supply 2.5 megawatts surplus capacities to the national grid, thus making a significant impact in the country’s energy footprint as a single player.”
The plant opening was among a series of events held in commemoration of the birth anniversary of Deshamanya A.Y.S. Gnanam, which included the foundation laying ceremony for a housing project for 25 families displaced during the war, distribution of deeds to residents of the Tokyo Cement Tsunami Housing Scheme in Nilaveli, foundation laying for a Technical Building and the commissioning of the Biomass Power Plant inside the Tokyo Cement factory premises at Cod Bay, China Bay.
Late A.Y.S. Gnanam was a pioneering entrepreneur who ventured into many of Sri Lanka’s firsts, which included the generation of Renewable Biomass Energy.
The company established Sri Lanka’s first successful large scale Dendro power plant in 2014 in Mahiyangana.
