Agony and ecstasy of Ministerial portfolios

After a long period of slumber the wheels of the Yahapalana administration, which were grinding to a halt, seemed to have received some impetus from public pressure and is beginning to show some positive movement. The resultant scenario saw the departure of two ministers from the Cabinet, both due to public pressure. However, the similarity ends there. The manner of their departure and the reasons for them are quite different in the two instances.
The first was the resignation, after some initial hesitation, of the “world’s best Finance Minister” - the affable Ravi Karunanayake. It was principally the SLFP wing in the consensual Government who initiated the move that resulted in the appointment of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Treasury Bond scam.
It must also be acknowledged that they got the support of the Joint Opposition, though it cannot be said that their genuine interest was to see an end to corruption in governance, being saddled itself with a heavy load of corruption and misappropriation of charges brought forward by the public and investigating offices of the State. It was at the Commission proceedings that Minister Karunanayake’s conduct came to be questioned. Matters came to a head with the Minister pleading ignorance to facts revealed by other witnesses, which conduct seemed to be far from genuine.
Challenging authorities
The second was the removal of the Minister of Justice – the “learned” Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, learned not only because of his academic qualifications and legal experience but also due to his self-publicity as a learned man during his election campaign. In this case credit should be given to the UNP wing of the Government, especially its backbenchers in Parliament for being the prime mover of the process that ended in his removal. The manner of their departure, however, was distinctly different. In the first case it was a resignation and in the other it was a removal by the Executive. Minister Karunanayake by his sole act of resignation was transformed from a rogue to a saint instantly. Praises were showered upon him, even by his bitterest critics for being a gentleman par excellence, a paragon of virtue, who restored a glorious tradition. So after all, he can be pleased with his conduct.
In the second case minister Rajapakshe stayed defiantly in office challenging the authorities both party and State playing the role of an unjustly framed up hero amidst the cheers of a lonely JO, whose behind the curtain God Father - the former President himself, unhesitatingly identified him as a village buddy. At a press conference after his removal he said that he was ashamed to be in a Cabinet that sold State property to foreigners. Perhaps he would have forgotten how he happily voted to approve the Hambantota Port Project, which later he criticized and how he identified himself with several other decisions of the Cabinet. May be he developed the faculty of modesty – lajja baya in Sinhala – quite recently after the hullabaloo over his indiscipline inside the party. One may be excused for concluding that his eyes are fixed on a future lofty goal of becoming a super “patriot”- a la the Rajapaksa brothers.
In a twist of fate a former Minister who resigned earlier was again re-instated in office though his portfolio has been changed. Of course no one knows yet the reasons for his return. This situation may lead to speculation whether the present duo would also return after a lapse of time when public agitation subsides.
It is on record that Minister Amaraweera, a close confidant of President Maitripala Sirisena publicly stated that he would not vote against Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe if a vote of no confidence. Similar statements were made by several other SLFP parliamentarians in the Government. The contempt with which these politicians hold public opinion gives strength to the doubts in the public mind.
Much more has to be done to secure that law and order will prevail over political interference. The two departing Ministers have shown by their example that still political influence and interference prevails despite all the new legislation and the appointment of independent commissions. They are not the sole culprits. Practices and traditions of yesteryear still continue widely.
Personal opportunism
Not only politicians but also a section of the bureaucratic state apparatus is also engaged in breaking the law due to their political allegiances or due to personal opportunism. Financial constraints, harassment of duty conscious officials, shortage of human and material resources etc. paralyze law enforcement authorities and cripple their services.
One charge against Minister Wijeyadasa was his failure to adhere to collective responsibility of the Cabinet of Ministers. How many other Ministers are also guilty of the same abhorrent practice? The SLFP is in half a mind whether to continue in office or attempt to form a Government under their leadership - an unrealizable dream in the short term.
With the forthcoming Local Government and Provincial Council elections in mind they play havoc with collective responsibility of the Cabinet and to use a local idiom play the role of bull in a china shop (walan kadeta penna gona wagei).
Not only Cabinet responsibility they also attack the Head of State, who is the President of their party by openly expounding policies not decided upon by the party of its President in an attempt to blackmail him. Noted in this respect are the day-time Miguels and night-time Daniels in it. Of course, it is also a consequence of the peculiar democracy found in that party where anyone could violate party discipline and get away scot free.
Emboldened by the latest developments, the former President now claims that he is still the President of the SLFP. Either he is insane or it is another of his crafty moves. It was under the glitz of the media that he offered the SLFP presidency to President Maitripala Sirisena and accepted the post of an Advisor of the Party. This column has repeatedly reiterated that it was a trap to surround the latter with a fifth column of Rajapaksa loyalists who would sabotage from within whatever President Sirisena decides and make him their prisoner. The Medamulane Vidane’s latest statements prove our point.
