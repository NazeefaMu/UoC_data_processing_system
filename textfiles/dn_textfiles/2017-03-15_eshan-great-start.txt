Eshan off to a great start!

The 2017 karting season got off to a great start for young Eshan Pieris with second place in Round 1 of the 2017 Rotax Max Asia Championships held in Sepang Malaysia. Under very warm conditions, Eshan finished the Time Trials in 4th, just mere tenths behind Indonesia’s Senna Noor and Prassetyo Hardja, who took the lead.
In both the Pre-finals and final, Eshan came in second behind Prassetyo Hardja and ahead of Senna Noor who has been the reigning Asia Max Champion for the past two consecutive years.
Eshan who is just starting his second year at Monash University Malaysia, drives for the RL Karting Team in Malaysia using the Birel Art chassis powered by IAME X30 Engine. A happy Eshan was quick to thank, “my absolutely amazing team RL Karting led by Aaron Lim, as well as Raj Raj for ensuring a great chassis and engine all throughout the weekend. I would also like to thank Monash University for all their support and encouragement which enables me to juggle academics with my racing and of course my parents for all they do to help me excel at the sport.”
He went on to say that this was a great start to a hectic race calendar which includes five more Asia Championship races, another five races at the X30 Asian Championships as well as four European tours and maybe the World Final at the end of the year.
