About 100 families in Dikarawa asked to evacuate

 
The Disaster Management Department warned 100 families residing in Ella, Dikarawa in Bandarawela last night to evacuate due to high risk of landslides.
The warning was issued in the wake of the heavy rains in Bandarawela.
The Disaster Management Department also said that a ground eruption that has caused due to the Uma Oya Multi-Purpose project in Bandarawela has added to the risk of landslides.
Residents of the high risk areas have reportedly refused to comply with the warning and to be transported to a safe zone.
Thirty families have been already evacuated.
