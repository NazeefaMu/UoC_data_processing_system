In tragedy, he finds theatre

Namel Weeramuni is second fiddle to none.He is in the company of the legends of theatre. Outstanding Personalities features this grand dictator of Sri Lankan theater. And he never compromises or toes the line when it comes to his productions.
Q: Why did you choose to do theatre? Why did you enter the field of theatre?
A: I am professionally a lawyer. From my youth the intention was to do law. But theatre was my hobby. And this hobby has now turned into my profession. I have a passion for it and that is why I am involved in theatre.
I did my Masters in Law in England. I practised in London for over 30 years in the field of law. And then I was in the Legal Draftsman’s Department as an assistant legal draftsman. I developed an interest in writing as well. I went to the States to do my doctorate in theatre but I did not complete it. I did a Masters in theatre (University of California Northridge) and recorded a GPA of 94.6 and then went to Hawaii to do my PhD. in theatre. There, after about two years I got really bored. I thought it was not worth me doing a PhD. Then, I had only to do the thesis. I did the course work, and only had to do the thesis. I then came back to London and again entered law. And then I came to Sri Lanka and built my abode called the ‘Punchi Theatre’. Throughout my life in England and in the States and in Hawaii, I did plays while studying and practising. Even now I can do a thesis but have become disinterested in it. There are 18 campuses in the University of California and one is Northridge where I got my Master’s in which there are 48,000 students.
Even as a schoolboy, I took an interest in theatre. I used to perform at school concerts. I too excelled in writing. I wrote short stories and criticisms of plays. I wrote poetry. In short, Arts gave me the greatest satisfaction. I was a voracious reader during my youth. Still I do continue this habit. Until I die I will be a student. That is what I believe about life.
Q: What element or quality in theatre appeals to you?
A: It is the tragedy of life which it portrays that draws me. I like serious theatre. Comedies are always good. But in tragedies you can discover a certain humanity. To me, that is what is most important. I am not trying to demean Greek comedies. They are legendary. But when we watch a tragedy, there is so much for us to contemplate when we come out of the theatre. Today, unfortunately there is nothing serious happening in theatre in Sri Lanka. This is what I feel. When you come out of a theatre you have to think about what you saw and ponder on the message, but there is nothing of that where these modern day plays in Sri Lanka are concerned. When you think of serious theatre, you think about Professor Sarachchandra, Gunasena Galappatty, Henry Jayasena and Sugathapala de Silva. We still survive on these plays. Tragedy gives you so much sensitivity to think about. The messages of the great films that I saw still roam in my mind. That is what inspires me. This element of tragedy kindles my passion. However I do not want to come across as someone who is critical of comedies. There is something appealing there as well. However in history, comedies too are great, such as the Lysistrata of Aristophanes. That was translated and done by Dharmapriya Dias which was a very good production. The play is a humorous account of how one woman sought to end the Peloponnesian War by persuading the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers, thereby forcing them to negotiate a peace. It causes a battle between the sexes and provides a study of sexual relations in a male dominated society.
Tragedy allows me to think about humanity. We can empathize and sympathize with characters. We get involved in the story. Let us take Anton Chekhov, the plays are all like comedies but at the same time they are also tragedies. Through comedy you portray tragedies. The play that I did Nattukkari is a tragi-comedy. We start with a lot of comedy and end up as a tragedy. Nattukkari was a play by Jean Anouilh, a French Playwright.
Q: You are a director, dramatist, actor and playwright. Do you like tackling controversial subjects? Do you like challenging convention? Do you like tackling controversial subjects?
A: Of course I do. One play I did, which was an original, is the Sword of a Journalist. Most people say Nattukkari was my best play, but as a production I really consider Sword of a Journalist as the best play I have done so far. It has not been seen by many because it deals with cruelty. I based that particular play on the JVP incidents in 1989. The background of the play is that there is a politician who wants to control the press. And the particular female journalist is someone who goes in search of truth. But she writes a story against a minister. The minister gets angry and uses the underworld gang to stop the stories. This journalist is unafraid and wants the truth to be divulged. As a result her father is killed by the underworld gang. The mother of the journalist is also attacked. The play is full of suspense and intrigue. It is a controversial play. I was also told by some well- meaning friends that even I might face problems. They said I might also become a victim.
I did another play called Fourth Floor. That too is a very controversial and political play. It is based on a real life character as well. I am a man who likes doing controversial plays. Again people suggested that I might be in danger. But I personally felt I was in no danger.
I also adapted one of Henrik Ibsen’s plays. Next to Shakespeare he is considered the best playwright in the whole world. I adapted his play – ‘An Enemy of the people’ to suit the Sri Lankan society. It was in Sinhala. It was a great success but unfortunately people did not come because it was serious. That is the whole problem.
The problem is that Sri Lankan people want to see only comedies because they want to laugh! But most of these are not plays or dramas, they are like stand up comedies. There is not much of a plot as such. The language is used in order to get laughs. It is done according to the mood of the audience. That is the whole problem.
My play Nattukkari (1969 - 1970) is a translation of Jean Anouilh’s Colombe. It was called theatre at its best. The public loved it. Within two years we had done more than 250 shows. It was also done in England with a different cast. In England I have done around six plays in Sinhala and English, and Nattukkari was one of those plays.
I have published 10 or 11 plays and a collection of short stories and two collections of poetry. I was a critique for Dinamina for seven years. One of my professors wrote of me: Namel Weeramuni is one person who has harvested all his talents in the University.
The feedback I received from my plays have been good and critics have called them remarkable plays. However there was one good play I did as an adaptation that was banned in 1972 which was called ‘Isn’t there anybody to save us from the chains?’
One common theme in my plays which I try to explore is the truth. And I have never compromised on that. I translated Jean Paul Sartre’s play ‘Nekrassov’ into Sinhala. I adapted that into my Sinhalese play. The censor board had a problem with it. They said it was against the government at that time. It is again about a journalist who tries to get the truth out. That was banned ultimately. I was not able to show it up to date. They wanted me to change the whole thing and I said that I was not prepared to do that. I did not want to take away the essence of the play.
Q: What do you expect from your actors and actresses?
A: What I want from actors and actresses is to portray the characters in accordance with the script. They must create in their own minds the character they are performing. You have to be truthful and genuine in what you perform. You got to interpret that. Sometimes I give a lot of freedom to the actors and actresses. But after some time I became a total dictator. I insisted on particular things being done my way. I wanted the delivery of the lines to be done my way. I get what I want out of them. To be a dictator is the best thing. Peter Brook is the world’s famous Dictator. He gets out of the actors exactly what he wants. He is considered a fine director, who directed the play Midsummer Night’s Dream. It was a totally different interpretation. It was a superb play. It was a totally different production. It was unimaginable. Peter Brook is considered one of the best producers in the whole world. It was so thought provoking. So that is also what I look for. The audience has to be enlivened. I have been able to do that in my plays. That is why all my plays have been successful. I have produced good actors and actresses. That is the important thing. And that makes me a very happy man today.
