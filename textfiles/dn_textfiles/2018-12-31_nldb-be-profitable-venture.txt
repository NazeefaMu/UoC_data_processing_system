NLDB to be a profitable venture

Agriculture, Rural Economic Affairs, Livestock Development, Irrigation and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister P. Harrison pledged to make the National Livestock Development Board(NLDB) a profitable venture.
He made this observation after assuming duties as the Minister of Livestock Development, recently.
‘I plan to reorganise and restructure overall activities in order to enhance the productivity of the Ministry while appointing a talented Board of Management to the Livestock Development Board,’ the Minister said.
Minister Harrison said that it is the responsibility of the Ministry to develop the living standards of the rural community. ‘Due to the absence of a proper dairy purchasing programme during the recent past, dairy farmers had to undergo many difficulties when selling their products,’ he added.
The Minister said that ending of the dark period of 52 days in the Sri Lankan political history is a victory achieved by the country’s general public.
