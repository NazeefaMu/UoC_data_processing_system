Dazzling Kate

Holy gorgeousness! Kate Middleton attended her first ever state banquet on Oct. 20 where she welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping in a flawless scarlet tulle gown and a lavish diamond tiara. See the stunning pics here!
Kate Middleton, 33, looked every bit the royal icon while attending her first state dinner at Buckingham Palace on October 20. As it was her debut at such a traditionally high-profile event, guests and fans alike were equally anxious to see what the Duchess of Cambridge would wear.
Naturally, she didn't disappoint! Kate stunned in a scarlet ball gown and plenty of gleaming diamonds - including a tiara! Click here to see the pics!
Kate joined her husband Prince William and Queen Elizabeth in hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan at the ornate white tie affair, which was held in their honor following a four-day state visit. Needless to say, the momentous occasion called for a particularly show-stopping ensemble, which Kate mastered (and then some) in a gorgeous scarlet red Jenny Packham tulle gown offset by a gorgeous diamond tiara! The Egyptian-style tiara, called the Lotus Flower tiara, is from the 1920s and was once owned and worn by the Queen's mother. The occasion was also just the third official time Kate has worn a tiara in public. In addition to her wedding day, the duchess was photographed with the papyrus tiara adorning her head at the annual diplomatic reception in 2013.
With its pearl and diamond details taking center stage, Kate wore the tiara with her hair pulled back into a low knot style and her new bangs parted to the side. To fit with her opulent look, Kate wore a more noticeably glamorous makeup look punctuated by defined brows and a subtly brown smokey eye.
Inside the banquet, Kate had the honor of sitting next to the Chinese president and Queen Elizabeth at the high table. Among the other nearly 170 guests were Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne and Prince Harry also appeared to be attending the event in a black puffer jacket and unshaven face, Daily Mail reports.
The A-list attendees were seated at a horseshoe-shaped table inside the palace ballroom where they dined using the silver of King George the IV and napkins adorned by the Queen's monogram all while enjoying each other's company in the name of international diplomacy.
Meanwhile, it looks like Kate is back to business as usual after giving birth to her second child, Princess Charlotte, back in April. Her maternity leave ended in mid-September and much like after her first pregnancy, the Duchess is looking more radiant than ever.
