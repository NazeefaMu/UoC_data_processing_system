“The Sapodilla/ Sapota is an evergreen tree which reaches up to 60 - 100 ft. The tree yields the flowers throughout the year. The leaves are oblong-lanceolate to ovate-elliptic, medium green, glossy. Leaves are 2 to 5 inches (5–20 cm) long, stiff, pointed, and clustered at the ends of shoots. Sapodilla/ Sapota composes of soft, easily digestible pulp made of simple sugars like fructose and sucrose. Sapodilla trees are well adapted to subtropical and tropical climates. The leaves are pinkish when newly emerged and light green to dark green at maturity. The flowers are small, white and bell-shaped. The tree yields flowers throughout the year. Each small branch is arranged horizontally or drooping,” said Hapuarachchi.
Sapodilla or sapota thought to have originated in the Central American rain forests, Today, it is grown in our country as well as India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The tree is fast growing, wind and drought resistant, and it flourishes well even under dry arid regions.
“Sweet and pleasant in taste, each sapodilla fruit is a berry - round or oval and measures about 10 cm in diameter and weigh about 150 g. A tree bears as many as 2,000 fruits per year. Sapota fruit has a gray/brown, sandy outer surface. Unripe fruits possess white, hard, inedible pulp that secretes sticky latex. This milky latex gradually disappears, and its white flesh turns brown as the fruit ripens. Once ripen, it becomes soft, acquires a sweet taste and smooth or grainy texture with slight musky flavor. It contains about 3-10 black, smooth, shiny inedible seeds, located in the center,” stated Hapuarachchi
