INSEE Cement creates employable  youth in Puttalam

Sri Lanka’s premier cement manufacturer INSEE Cement, spearheaded the renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Enterprise based Vocational Education (EVE) training center and the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) recently. The agreement extending a period by five years was signed at INSEE Cement’s head office in Colombo.
Under this programme, students hailing from diverse backgrounds in the Puttalam area receive English language and lessons in Information Technology along with relevant subjects including pneumatics, hydraulics, lathe/milling and Auto CAD, in addition to the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) curriculum in their first year. In the second year, full-time practical training is provided at EVE Centre located in the Puttalam Cement Plant. The project was initiated in 2012 and has benefited over 165 students.
Nandana Ekanayake, Chief Executive Officer of INSEE Cement, said,“We take pride in empowering our youth in the Puttalam area by giving them outstanding technical skills - a first step towards building independence and a sustainable livelihood. This will enhance their educational levels, increase their employability and give them a stable career path. The initiative will help to develop future technicians for the nation. At INSEE Cement we strongly believe in enriching the community particularly in areas where we do business.” The two-year programme provides theory lessons for those who opt to benefit from the training and coaching provided by trainers from NAITA.
Dr. A.U.C. Athukorala, Chairman of NAITA said,“We are pleased to contribute to this national endeavour to upgrade the skills of youth in the Puttalam area. It is very creditable of INSEE Cement engaging in a programme of this magnitude to develop and encourage the youth in the district that will generate value and long-lasting benefits to the community as well as the nation”.
The course is free of charge and the trainees receive a monthly allowance from INSEE Cement in addition to transport, meals and technical support. With the current intake being the ninth, the programme has been a great success, having produced multi-skilled maintenance technicians with exemplary computer skills.
The initiative has undoubtedly uplifted the living standards of the youth in Puttalam and has inspired them to develop to their full potential.
