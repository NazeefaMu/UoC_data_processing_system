HC allows Gammanpila to travel to Kuwait

The Colombo High Court yesterday permitted Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Leader MP Udaya Gammanpila to travel to Kuwait from July 27 to 30.
MP Gammanpila whose passport was impounded by the Court for allegedly cheating Rs. 20 million and misappropriation of another Rs. 21 million following his alleged fraudulent share transaction, had sought Colombo High Court’s permission to temporary lift his travel ban.
His passport was ordered to be released by High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe. The Court was informed that Gammanpila had obtained Court’s permission to travel abroad on five previous occasions as well.
