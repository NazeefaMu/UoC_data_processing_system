Illegally felled timber seized

Two tractor loads of illegally felled timber logs from a government forest area, were intercepted by the Karadiyanaru Police on Tuesday.
Karadiyanaru Police OIC D. M. A. Samarakkoon said that acting on a tip-off from the public, the Police in the Erakkulam forest area made their interception, and the two tractor drivers who had fled the scene, later surrendered to the Karadiyanaru Police.
The two tractors containing the 30 teak logs were being consigned to a saw mill at Oddamavadi at the time of the arrest. The suspects were to be produced before the Circuit Court Magistrate yesterday.
