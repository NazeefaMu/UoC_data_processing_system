Nalanda romp home with Under 15 division one Championship

Nalanda College, Colombo won the 2016 under 15 division one Championship when they earned an easy first-innings win over St.Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa in the finals concluded on Wednesday at Thurstan ground pushing St.Sebastian’s to the runners-up position. Nalanda on their way to this final beat Royal-Panadura, Holy Cross and S.Thomas whilst St.Sebastian’s overcame Isipathana, Mahanama and Prince of Wales, in the final round.
Lakshan Kashyapa, Nalanda’s mainstay with a match-winning 72 won this important fixture for his side after Nalanda bowlers, led by Jayod Kaldeera with three wickets to his credit disintegrated Sebastian’s innings for a modest 172 in which only Dunith Wellalage (31) and Janishka Perera (21) made sizable scores. After Sebastian’s chose to bat, Nalanda bowlers were so dominant that Moratuwa school batsmen had to bat-out almost 88 overs to get to their meagre total of 172.
Nalanda chasing 173 to gain first-innings advantage in this two-day game reached the target in 66 overs losing just four wickets in the process. As there was hardly any time left to get to a positive result, Nalanda were eventually declared the winners of both finals and the Championship.
St. Sebastians ‘A’ : 172 in 87.5 overs (Dunith Wellalage 31, Janishka Perera 21, Jayod Kaldeera 3/25, Thamidu Kamalasooriya 2/30, Raveen De Silva 2/17)
Nalanda ‘A’ :179/4 in 66 overs (Lakshan Kashyapa 72, Raveen De Silva 27, Jayod Kaldeera 21*, Dunith Wellalage 2/45)
