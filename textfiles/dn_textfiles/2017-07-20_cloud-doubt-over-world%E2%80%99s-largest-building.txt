Cloud of doubt over world’s largest building

The first official press conference of the proposed World Capital Centre (WCC), the world’s largest and 9th tallest building, to be constructed in the heart of the Colombo city, ran into a storm since the officials concerned failed to provide proof of solid investors. The media event was held at the WCC main office and it was also disclosed that though the BOI agreement was signed last month, the land for the project is yet to be identified.
“We have looked at three properties in Dematagoda, Borella and Colombo Fort and will finalize one of them soon,” said Deputy Chairman Dr. Senaka De Silva. “In addition we may also acquire a 14-acre plot of land,” he said.
De Silva said that the total investment for the project, to be completed in 2023 and towering 117 floors with hotels and a residential building which will include gold-plated high-end apartments and commercial spaces, would be US$ 2.5 billion. “The entire funding would be raised from overseas and a Dubai company would handle the construction.”
He also said that WCC was launched two years ago by President Maithripala Sirisena at the BMICH and there was a two-year delay by the BOI to sign the necessary agreement.
