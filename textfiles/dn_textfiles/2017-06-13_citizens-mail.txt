Citizens' Mail

Walk gone to the dogs
The “dog walkers” are a nuisance to people who go for a walk early morning down Isipathana Mawatha. There are about eight to ten dogs taken for a walk to relieve themselves. It’s absolutely nauseating to see dog excrement early morning on the pavement. Couple of them take spades and throw the “stuff’ into the nearby drain or the nearby lane.
Ironically these are all English educated people who might think they are the Crème de la société. There are some who are courteous but some are even arrogant and flaunt the dog’s “job” right in front of your eyes. For a person who goes for a morning walk, very likely has just gulped down a glass of water and mostly on an empty stomach this sight is nauseating. Rainy days make it worse as the excrement is soggy and smelly and attract flies.
Earlier the sand or grass patches on the street were dog “toilets”, now with the paved roads, it has become worse. If this uncivilized behaviour of the so called “educated society” continues, what do we expect from the more unsophisticated general public? These are ladies who would scorn at a fallen bread crumb on a table at home or a hotel but would not mind standing by the roadside while their “pets” relieve themselves. The same society would wrinkle their noses when a manual labourer smells of sweat. How hypocritical can the society be? Mind you there are foreigners belonging to the diplomatic corps, I have observed several times at the Independence grounds taking dogs for similar “walks”. Would they do that in their own countries, never! But they think the “white skin” is a passport for arrogant behaviour in South Asia.
This routine happens in the evening and night as well but there are less people at that time of the day. I am sure this happens in other parts of the city. At least our own “educated” society should be more civic conscious and be a “good example” of civilized behaviour for others to emulate. Bring a spade and a bag and remember the sight is disgusting to others or better still do that in your own garden!
