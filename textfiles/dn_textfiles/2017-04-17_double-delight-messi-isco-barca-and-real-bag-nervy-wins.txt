Double delight for Messi, Isco as Barca and Real bag nervy wins

BARCELONA, Saturday - Lionel Messi’s double strike helped Barcelona scrape a 3-2 victory over Real Sociedad on Saturday to keep the pressure on La Liga leaders Real Madrid, who needed a brace from Isco to beat Sporting Gijon by the same scoreline.
A much-changed Madrid side snatched victory at El Molinon thanks to Isco's two goals, which included a 90th-minute winner, to stretch their lead over Barcelona before the Catalans closed the gap back down to three points at the Nou Camp.
Messi scored twice and set up a third for Paco Alcacer as Barcelona saw off their Basque opponents, who pressed them until the end of a nervy encounter.
The win, however, kept the Catalans within touching distance of Los Blancos, having played one match more, ahead of next Sunday’s Clasico. – Agencies
