Better Together at Trincomalee UC

The Australian High Commissioner, Bryce Hutchesson, launched ‘Better Together,’ a photographic exhibition at the Trincomalee Urban Council recently celebrating 70 years of development cooperation between Australia and Sri Lanka.
The exhibition also celebrates, with a series of select portraits, the significant contribution Sri Lankans have made to Australian society. “These portraits showcase just a small representation of the large and vibrant Sri Lankan community that has contributed so significantly and positively to Australia’s multicultural life.” said Hutchesson.
The exhibition is open to the public until May 20 at the Trincomalee Urban Council.
