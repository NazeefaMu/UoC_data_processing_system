Lankan art at Kochi Biennale

T. Shanaathanan participated in the Kochi Biennale 2016 and the exhibition 'Insecurities: Tracing Displacement and Shelter' at MoMa New York, recently.
The art project attempts to map one of several histories of resistance during the 30 years of Sri Lankan civil war by presenting the memory of so called ‘minor’ artists or non artists. By inquiring how these artists/individuals appropriated or relativised their art practices under the conditions they faced during the war such as economic embargos, displacements, lack of communication facilities and travel restrictions, this project aims to register the innovative and alternative inventions that intertwined with the experience of war.
The collection of nearly 30 individual memories and stories in the form of testimonies and drawings are exhibited in a library card cabinet. The cabinet, as a physical form, and conceptual imagining, connects to the colonial cabinet of curiosities that led to the development of museums and archives. By employing this particular method of collection and display, this work attempts to play with ideas of archive, memory and indexing in relation to their connection to object and object making.
