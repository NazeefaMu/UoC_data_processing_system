THE FASCINATION .. THE DEDICATION .. AND TRANSFORMATION!

It is a documented fact that rugby is now one of the fastest growing sport disciplines in the world. The facts speak loudly for themselves. 2015's Rugby world cup the biggest spectacle in sporting history ...as the NZ all blacks created their own unique history ..beating the fortunate path of the Australians in all departments,. to grab the William Webb Ellis trophy for another 4 years and spark months of wild celebrations!
Millions watched on television and passed out as Scotland came 2nd on a flash incident, that shouldn't have been a penalty ... and millions crowded across the English channel to create unprecedented profits and fascinate the experts that crunch numbers for a living!
Twickenham so geared up for the multi cultural experience ...it forgot those peculiar English pleasantries at the cock and bull inn of much happiness, - especially the steak and kidney pie ... as England limped out, to utter dismay!
The shudder was celebrated around the world ..and southern hemisphere rugby handed yet another triumph on a silver platter..
National rugby is in the process of transforming ..to a fully professional structure based on player welfare, high performance platforms, and central contracts for core rep players.
The new hopefuls need a career pathway ..so we can cast the net for talent island wide. I need to see kids in Batticaloa aware of the opportunities, same for Jaffna, Arugam Bay, kalpitiya and Anuradhapura
University rugby has to be a major entity within this rugby family ..the inter university champions Moratuwa university winning both 15s and 7s back to back in 2015...well done Mora rugby and the continuous pressure to maintain their squad numbers and performance levels, despite the players leaving to pursue careers as graduates.
The Singer schools season kicks off with its usual gusto at their annual awards for 2015 .All will be rewarded for participation at the BMICH next Tues 15th March. The 2016 season launched at a post awards press conference and sponsorship handover to the Sri Lanka schools rugby football association - SLSRFA.
The Singer partnership supports not only the games fundament..but it creates a more competitive culture at school level ..driven on pride and passion among the big traditional institutions of learning.
If there is a shred of doubt...toodle along to Patana playing Royal and absorb the electric atmosphere that transforms kids and parents into marauding cheering partisan armies ..the green Havelock Park warriors vs. the blue and gold Reid avenue gladiators.
It is undoubtedly an imposing sight and makes the investment from each school plus the fans at each match ....the richest and biggest local spectator sport in Sri ..the no 1 in popularity and the most fascinating, once the Bradby and other trophy matches are lined up .
Heartwarming to see the Royal Thomian De Saram shield under lights with a full house @ Havelock park. What a spectacle indeed !!
National 7s is the career we propose ..an Olympic dream for former wingers like myself ..how fabulous the chance to fight for qualification ...2020 Olympics, realistically a decent shot. The men are currently no 3 in Asia ..the women were 5th but fell back to 8th in 2016.....great stats to build on. The 7s format is a mesmerizing factor and my blood twin ..the buccaneer years for Sri Lanka, in every known corner ;
...taught me how to survive in the middle against the best and the hardest -.Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, New Zealand, England, South Africa , France, Australia...a job to mark my opposite warrior, and an adrenaline driven hunger, to score tries, that simply defied logic.
Watching the game, as they kick off, in comfy shorts and beach slippers (designer of course )..still wires the heart with the twitch hitting the hamstring in anticipation of the rush !!! Long may it prosper!
The greatest achievement in sport is to graduate to play for your country ..the singular honour to represent our island nation ..despite the odds, has had me transfixed. What pushes us to put our bodies on the line? What deep animal instinct drives us to confront and challenge human digits double our bodyweight? .. What is it? Ponder that prospect and what you would do, thrust into that Colosseum? It's a mesmerizing fact that makes rugby the toughest game .. and rugby 7s the hardest sport in the world that humans play.
Bula bula to those island hearts that embrace the code, are still the proudest warriors, and certainly inspire the next !!!
