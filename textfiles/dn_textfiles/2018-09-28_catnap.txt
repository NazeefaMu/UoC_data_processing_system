Catnap?

Cats love a good snooze, so much so that there’s even a kind of sleep named just for them: the catnap. They also love a cuddle, so if you think about it, what better way to help out some shelter cats than to join them for a good snooze?
75-year-old Terry Lauerman knows this, and he regularly heads down to his local shelter for catnaps. Staff at Safe Haven Pet Sanctuary in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said that he came in brandishing a brush one day, and asked if he could groom the cats. “He just walked in and started brushing,” founder of the shelter Elizabeth Feldhausen told HuffPost.
“So eventually we told him he was an official volunteer and had him fill out our volunteer form.”
Terry visits the shelter daily, staying for around 3 hours a time. He brushes the cats before dozing off for a nap with them, before waking up and repeating the process. The experience is a mutually beneficial one, and has had far reaching effects for the shelter. After they decided to dedicate a Facebook post to Terry and his adorable volunteer work, it quickly went viral. The resulting publicity has seen donations flooding in, providing funds for the shelter to continue their important work for a long time to come.
“Our donations have increased!” Elizabeth told Bored Panda. “Normally, we’d make between $3,000 to $4,000 per month. This week, we have reached $30,000! This is amazing because we do rely solely on donation! The proceeds will likely go to adding additional quarantine rooms, so that we can save more cats more quickly, vet bills, and re-insulating the building so that we are more energy efficient this winter. We’ll have more than enough for all of those things, so some will go to savings and be our ‘rainy day fund’.”
