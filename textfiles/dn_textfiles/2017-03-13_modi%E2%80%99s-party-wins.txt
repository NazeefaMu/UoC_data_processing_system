Modi’s party wins

INDIA: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party won a landslide victory in India’s most important battleground state Saturday, in a personal triumph viewed as a massive show of confidence halfway into his first term.
Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a surprise absolute majority in Uttar Pradesh (UP), the country’s most populous state that is home to 220 million people and seen as a key indicator of national politics.
Party leader Amit Shah called the win a “historic mandate” for the BJP and said it would also form governments in the states of Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.
“These results will set Indian politics in a new direction,” he said at a press conference at the party’s New Delhi headquarters ahead of a formal election commission announcement of the results due later Saturday.
“The faith that people have placed in the BJP and in Narendra Modi will pay off.” The party won over 300 of the total 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh, way above the figure it needs to form a government on its own. It also won a majority in Uttarakhand, but the election commission website showed the opposition Congress Party led in Goa and Manipur with just a handful of seats still to be counted. Shah said the result showed Modi, who personally led the campaign in the key battleground state of UP, was now “the most popular leader since independence”.
The BJP had been expected to perform well in UP, but few experts had predicted the scale of the victory in elections viewed as a test of Modi’s popularity after a controversial ban on high-value banknotes.
Experts said the results showed Modi had succeeded in tapping into popular anger over corruption with the move, which was aimed at tackling tax evasion but also led to widespread chaos in a country where most transactions are cash-based.
Modi called India’s massive demonetisation drive, which withdrew 86 percent of the country’s currency bills from the system, to cleanse the system of tax evasion and corruption. Banks and ATMs witnessed massive lines of people for months. ATMs were not refilled for days and banks ran out of cash within a few hours of opening. The government was able to tide over the problem as voting started last month.
“People were more struck by the act itself than by its consequences,” said Gilles Verniers, a UP expert at the Ashoka University, told AFP.
“It was seen as a move that went beyond party and caste and affected everyone equally -- notably the rich.” The results will also strengthen the BJP’s hand in parliament’s upper house, where the lack of a majority has hampered its reform agenda. In a tweet, Modi said he was overjoyed by the “unprecedented support from all sections of society” and congratulated party workers. - FRANCE 24, AFP and AP
