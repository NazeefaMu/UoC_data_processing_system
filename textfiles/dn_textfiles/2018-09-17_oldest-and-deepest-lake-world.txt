Oldest and deepest lake in the world

Often mistaken for a sea, Baikal is a lake unlike any other on Earth. It is the world’s largest freshwater lake (by the volume of fresh water), and it is the deepest and the oldest lake in the world.
Located in the southern part of the Russian region Siberia, the lake contains 20 percent of the world’s freshwater making it the biggest reservoir of fresh water on Earth.
Known as the “Pearl of Siberia,” Lake Baikal is estimated to be 25 million years old and it is the home to more than 2,000 endemic plant and animal species of exceptional value to evolutionary science. Although it is hard to decide, the Nerpa seems to be the most famous of all endemic species that can be found at Lake Baikal. It is one of a kind species of seal that is restricted exclusively to a freshwater habitat. Sadly, the seal population has been reduced in recent decades and this unique seal faces an uncertain future due to climate change.
With a surface area of 12,248 square miles (31,722 square kilometers), Lake Baikal is bigger than many countries in the world including Belgium, Armenia, Albania, Haiti, Israel, Slovenia, and Qatar.
It is one of the three lakes in the world with a depth of over 1000 meters (3280 feet). At 1,642 meters (5387 feet) Lake Baikal is 172 meters (564 feet) deeper than Lake Tanganyika, and it is 617 meters (2024 feet) deeper than the Caspian Sea.
Lake Baikal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most popular destinations for photographers and adventurers.
The lake freezes five times a year, and its ice is so thick that it can handle a vehicle over 15 tons.
