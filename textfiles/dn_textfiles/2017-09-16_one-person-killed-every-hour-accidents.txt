One person is killed every hour and 27 die daily in Sri Lanka due to various types of accidents. This includes road traffic and other accidents.
Annually, 10,000 persons die due to accidents in Sri Lanka, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry’s Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) Unit Director Dr. Thilak Siriwardana said. According to Dr. Siriwardana, every year, four million Sri Lankans need to seek medical treatment for accident-related injuries and one in every five Sri Lankans seek medical treatment for the same. Four hundred and eighty persons become accident victims every hour. A total of 11,000 become accident victims daily.
Dr. Thilak Siriwardana was addressing the media during a health seminar at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo, yesterday.
