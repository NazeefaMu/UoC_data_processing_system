Influential steps

The South East Asian region comprises Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Java, Sumatra, Indonesia and Bali. From ancient times, India and South East Asian region have had close ties with each other. The immigration of Indian population to South East Asian region took place mainly for commercial purposes. Indian influences can be seen in many aspects of South East Asian life. This opened the door for Hindu, Buddhist influences, and for the linguistic and cultural expansion. Mainly in the classical dance forms, social ritual dances, and folk dances, one discerns the similarities. Very likely, the South East Asian dance forms must have been based on the Natya Sastra.
One of the popular dance drams of Thailand was Lakhon.
Leading roles
In Thailand, the dances were largely based on the perennial themes Ramayana, and Mahabharata. One of the most remarkable features in Thai dance except the clown role, all the leading roles are played by women. They wear the masks only when they play the role of devas, demons, and monkeys. It would appear that like Bharatha Natyam women’s movements in dance are sinuous movements. But there are not many facial expressions, but the meanings are expounded to some extent by hand gestures.
Lakhon Nai and Lakhon Chattri are two dance forms of Thailand. Both of them are drama based dances. In Indonesia, the evidence is available to show, that during the ancient Muslim regime, rulers extended patronage to the classical cultural dances. Like most of the Indian classical dance forms, Indonesian and Bali dance forms, are deeply associated, with religion.
Firm religious influence could be seen in the Indonesian culture. Famous Indonesian dance dramas depict the Ramayana. Most of the Indonesian dances are not so brisk, and generally, the tempo is slow, in such a way as it provides more opportunity to use the Anga, Pirathi Anga, and Upaanga, movements gracefully, (Head, neck, eye movements, legs, and hand movements, etc). Yet beautiful posturesand graceful stances resemble the stances and postures of various Indian classical dance forms.
Ramayana is the most popular dance theme in South East Asian dance forms. The Ramayana theme still plays an important role, in most of the Indian classical dance forms and in the annual Ram Leela festivals in the Northern Indian states. In Ram Leela, the actors wear masks or semi crowns.
Hindu themes
Bali is not deeply influenced by the Islamic tradition. But it is influenced by the Hindu tradition. Due to the Hindu religious influence, the Bali dance forms are naturally based on Hindu themes. The Wayang Topeng is one of the dance forms in which the dancer wears the masks. Such dance forms resemble some of the rural Indian folk dances or some of the ritual dances of India.
Another Indian folk dance is the puppet show. The puppets are, made out of leather; or cloths. These puppets are activated by twine. The theme of the puppet show must be based on some religious episode, or based on epics. The same type of puppet show could be seen in Bali under the name of Wayang Kuilit.
In Myanmar, there are many classical dances which show the distinct Indian influences. Javanese dances like the dances of India are firmly based on Thala, Laya, and Rhythm. After the 15th century, most of the Javanese dances moved to Bali.
One of the most popular dance forms was Wangang, which is based on Indian puranic stories, mainly Ramayana, and Mahabharata, and another dance itself, based on the indigenous epic called Panje.
In Cambodia like ancient Indian dances, dances were danced in royal courts. In Malaysia and Singapore, classical Indian dances, music, cultural heritage, and languages are still preserved well without much alien influences. Indian classical dance forms, Indian folk dances and Indian ritual dance forms have largely influenced the dance forms and dance themes of South East Asia.
