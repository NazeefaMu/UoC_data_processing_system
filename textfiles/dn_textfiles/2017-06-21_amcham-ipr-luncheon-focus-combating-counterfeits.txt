AMCHAM IPR luncheon to focus on combating counterfeits

The American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka will host a public forum entitled 'Combating Counterfeits' to address the detrimental effects of counterfeits on Foreign Direct Investment, the economy and the corporate sector.
This luncheon is designed to foster greater collaboration and understanding among regulators, entrepreneurs and industry experts to combat this growing threat.
Improvements in recognizing, protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights in Sri Lanka has the potential to transform virtually every aspect of our nation’s economy and encourage much needed FDI.
The keynote address will be given by Upul Jayasuriya, Chairman of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and the panel discussion will comprise representatives from many government departments including the National Intellectual Property Office, Sri Lanka Customs and Sri Lanka Police Department and the corporate sector.
The AMCHAM IPR Luncheon will be held at the Moonstone and Amethyst, The Hilton, Colombo from 12.30 pm to 2.30 pm on Thursday, June 22.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka, a non-profit association founded in 1992, brings together more than 350 members representing 230 leading Sri Lankan and American companies based in Sri Lanka engaged in trade, business and investment activities between Sri Lanka and the USA.
As a vocal supporter of issues that affect its members and the Sri Lankan corporate sector at large, they regularly support forums such as these to encourage collaboration and discussion among the private sector and decision makers.
