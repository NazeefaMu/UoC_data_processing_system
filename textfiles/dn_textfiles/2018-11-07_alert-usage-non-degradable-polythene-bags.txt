Alert on usage of non degradable polythene bags

The continuous issuing of non degradable polythene bags to customers by several super markets and business enterprises free of charge was brought to the attention of President Maithripala Sirisena by a leading compostable and biodegradable bags manufacturer, the Plastic Packaging (Pte) Ltd (PPP).
This was revealed by PPP, Chairman Dr Mervyn Dias at a media briefing held at PPP Auditorium, Ratmalana. The conference was held to create awareness of the company’s participation at the recently concluded Presidential Environment Awards 2018 Exhibition, held at BMICH under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Several other environmental protection organizations and importers of compostable resin including the Sri Lanka Bioplastic Association, manufacturers of environmentally products to replace plastics and the Central Environmental Authority represented the exhibition. When President Sirisena visited the PPP stall, Dias displayed some reusable compostable and biodegradable bags and said the bags contain 100 per cent zero polythene.
He told the President that after using the bags it gets composted in the open environment within 180 days.
He also mentioned that the bag has triple usage that could be used for shopping many times, to store food and vegetables in the refrigerator and finally in the kitchen bin to collect biodegradable waste.
Dias said it is pathetic that some supermarkets and other business enterprises still issue more than 40 million polythene bags every month and such bags take nearly 500 years to degrade in the environment. He also advised customers to take their own reusable bags to supermarkets and help to reduce the usage of polythene bags.
