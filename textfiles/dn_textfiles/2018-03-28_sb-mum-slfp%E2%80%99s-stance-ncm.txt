SB mum on SLFP’s stance on NCM

As the numbers game intensifies in the wake of the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, SLFP Treasurer and Minister S.B.Dissanayake yesterday said there was no reason for the SLFP to oppose the NCM.
He however refused to affirm whether they would vote in favour of it.
“The United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) has to make that decision collectively. We have not taken a collective decision on it yet- but it is difficult for us to oppose this,”Dissanayake said.
He was addressing a media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters on Darley Road yesterday. Dissanayake said however that the contents of the NCM were not in opposition to what they as a party believed in. “We have brought up the very same issues they now speak of. When the Bond Issue occurred, it was UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera who lodged the first complaint at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC),” Minister Dissanayake said. “A group of SLFPers including Thilanga Sumathpala and Nimal Siripala de Silva staged a protest outside the Central Bank against the issue. In addition, it was we who took it to COPE and asked that it be investigated. Our Members took great efforts within COPE to bring the crime to light,” he said.
“It was also the SLFP after a special Central Committee meeting that appointed a committee with Nimal Siripala De Silva to study the issue and they recommended that the President appoint a Presidential Commission to investigate into this,” Minister Dissanayake said.
“We also have to admit that in the last three years, we failed to develop the economy.We could not turn it around and as a result we faced many economic difficulties. We spoke of this with the Prime Minister and within the government on many occasions,” he added. Minister Dissanayake noted further that at the last Local Government elections, the people had given them a clear message-it was to remind the government and the two major parties that drastic changes needed to be made.
“Thereafter, we know that the President and a large group within the UNP tried to bring in certain changes in a democratic manner, having had discussions within the government and within parties but those did not bear fruit,”Minister Dissanayake added.
“We do not want to topple the government, he explained and added that they were hoping that the NCM would pave way for changes that the people and the two main parties want in this country,” he said.
“This new change he hinted would be in the form of a more comprehensive national government under a new Prime Minister,” he said.
Dissanayake however added that they would still invite the current parties who helped set up the government to form the new government with them.
“We look at this NCM as something not against the President or Government but against one,”he said.
The NCM is written against the person who is most responsible towards the Central Bond issue.
At present, four SLFPers have already placed their signatures on the NCM.
The SLFP Treasurer was also quick to deflect any blame that might come the President’s way through the NCM and stated that the President had always acted very democratically within government and allowed the Prime Minister along with the UNP a free reign within government.
“The President could not even bring about the Cabinet reshuffle he wanted or make changes within the Finance Ministry,” Dissanayake said.
The NCM will be taken up for debate on April 4 and Parliament can vote on whether they would go for a secret ballot or not.
“It is only on two occasions that a secret ballot is held; when appointing the Speaker and when impeaching the President but if the majority wants, they can also ask that this be made a secret ballot,” Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said at the briefing.
“We have until April 4 morning to make a final decision on the vote,” quipped Dissanayake.
