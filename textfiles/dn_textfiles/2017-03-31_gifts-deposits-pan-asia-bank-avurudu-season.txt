Gifts for deposits from Pan Asia Bank this Avurudu season

To share the spirit of this festive season Pan Asia Bank, has come up with a promotion where a range of valuable gifts are to be given away to its customers when they make a qualifying deposit with the bank.
This Avurudu promotion which is based on “Ganu denu”, one of our most cherished local traditions is valid from March 23 to April 30.
Fixed deposits also include Suwasavi Fixed Deposits which offer a free family medical insurance and special Senior citizen’s Fixed Deposits.
In order to honour this rich tradition of conducting Ganu Denu, all Pan Asia Bank branches except WTC branch will be kept opened on April 14, from 9.00 a.m. to 12 noon.
The uniqueness about this promotion is that, in addition to these valuable gifts, customers will also receive an attractive interest rate on their deposits. Going the extra mile the bank has added another reason for its customers to enjoy the season by offering gifts for every Western Union transaction made at any of its branches island wide.
This is a special promotion for all western Union money transfers performed at all Pan Asia Bank branches island wide throughout the month of April or until stocks last.
Pan Asia Bank hopes that this will encourage savings among customers to ensure a prosperous New Year while simultaneously allowing them to enjoy the rewards of their savings.
