CEB strikers to get paid leave

Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyabalapitiya yesterday gave instructions to the CEB administration to consider the two day strike launched by the Ceylon Electricity Board Trade Union Alliance as paid leave.
The CEB Trade Union Alliance launched and continued to strike on September 14 and 15 which now shall be considered paid leave as instructed by Minister Siyabalapitiya.
Accordingly, Minister Siyabalapitiya requests all the CEB workers on strike to report to work today.
“According to the workers who are on strike, they have nothing against me, the ministry or the government. The issue is an internal one. Thus, for an uninterrupted service, I request your presence work on September 18,” Minister Siyabalapitiya states in a press release.
