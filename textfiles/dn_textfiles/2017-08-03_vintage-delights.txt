VINTAGE 'DELIGHTS'

The Vintage car Owners Club has made arrangements to hold its annual drive from Colombo to Galle in the “oldest of the old” motor cars on the August 12. This is a mighty task as all cars on the drive have surpassed 75 years of age and it is not for the “faint- hearted” to take up the challenge to motor a good 72 miles in a brace of motorcars that was registered prior to the year 1940.
This is the challenge to prove the might of the Vintage motors and the Club is glad to note of the many members who are keen to bring out their vintage “delights” to participate at this unique event. The drive will be flagged off in near Prince of Whales College, Moratuwa being the starting point of many Old Crock Rallies in the past, at 7 am and will head southwards along the Galle Road with a “Pit-Stop” for breakfast at Bentota and will proceed towards Hikkaduwa for the traditional Tummy Fill at the Coral Sands Hotel. The parade of the vintages will chug along from the Coral Sands Hikkaduwa heading to the last “lap” being the Galle Fort where heritage and vintages will come together creating an absolute ambience of nostalgia of the glory days of the past. A grand Evening tea will be hosted at the PeddlersInn at Peddlers Street which is where the Vintages will be on display for the viewing (3.30pm onwards) by all making it an event to be remembered.
The event is much awaited by the vintage motoring fans both local and foreign who swarm to the Peddlers Inn at the Galle Fort to witness the display with many new comers being amazed to note of the many vintages that have travelled a long distance covering a good 72 Miles and to also note of the excellent condition of these cars that have also covered over 75 years of existence.
The President of the Club Neil Fernando takes great pleasure to host the participants on an overnight stay at the Coral Sands Hotel, Hikkaduwa with many a fun filled events to keep the vintage toes tapping prior to setting off back to Colombo after a good night’s sleep and a hearty breakfast on the following day.
The main organizer of the event Saman Karunanayake is delighted to note of the great interest taken by his fellow members on the above event and it would be an ideal opportunity to witness the “oldest of Old” motoring Marvels to take on to the streets once again.
