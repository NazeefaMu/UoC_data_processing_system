Echoes from Holocaust

The term ‘Holocaust’ has always stirred my innermost feelings of existence. What does the term signify? I was told by learned people that the term derives from Greek ‘holokauston’, literary means ‘something burnt whole’, a compound of ‘holos’ or ‘whole’ and ‘kaustos’, which is also the source of English ‘caustic’ or through destruction especially by fire. What else are you in search of?
My inner self questions.
The term ‘Holocaust’ has given way to other terms such as ‘genocide’, ‘extermination’ and ‘extinction’. I was in Wroclaw, Poland, at the time I was concentrating on Concentration Camps, where the Jews were brought by Nazi SS army officials in order to face the most dreadful and horror-filled punishment of facing the extermination. In Poland, I was under the UNESCO – Polish Government ‘Copernicus Award’ for Social Sciences. I was anxious to visit a concentration camp left behind as a symbol of horror of the mankind of the yesteryear.
There was one Professor, attached to Lublin University, with who I frequently discussed not only the blessings of the existence but also the horrors which come as the alternative force. That was the moment where he suggested: “Do you like to go with me to see Majdanek in Lublin?”
Genocide warrant
It is the earliest concentration camp set up only a few months after Hitler’s rise to power.
“So when can we go?” I asked Professor Tadeus Magul.
“Any time convenient for you,” he responded.
“Tomorrow?”
“That’s fine. Let’s go during the early hours of the morning.”
So we set forth. Professor Tadeus Magul knew quite a lot about the Holocaust. He handed over several texts of significance written in English like Norman Cohen’s celebrated book titled as ‘Warrant for Genocide’ published in England in 1967 and later republished several times. I went on reading all the source material until the wee hours of the dawn.
We reached the entrance to the Madjaneck Concentration Camp, before noon. There were a few others. I saw the long barbed wire fence. Beside it was the culvert dug around. I stood amazed, seeing how silent the professor stood. He whispered in my ears. The words came one by one like a poem.
“We got to adhere to silence. No noise. Respect the dead. This is that fence, which when touched by an intimate who wants to escape will be electrocuted instantly.”
Speechless
I stood listening. No words came from me. I had nothing to ask. His explanation was simple.
“When electrocuted, the body falls down into the culvert. Then the body is taken by a wheel barrow to the extermination camp. The shivering body, if the pulse is felt, is pushed into the shower room. It is called bathroom with a shower which showers the gas called Zyklon B (Cyclone B). That’s all. Let’s go in. See for yourself how things have happened.”
I came to know the story of Jews. They were called inmates or internees.
The living conditions included a rough place to sleep called ‘barrack’. The wooden barracks were named blocks. Early in the existence of the camp, the inmates or the prisoners brought from various places. They slept on the straw spread across the thin layers on the bare ground. Later when the barracks were fitted with floors, they were supplied with paper mattresses, filled with shavings and moldy straw. I came to know that all the inmates were numbered. Newcomers received the numbers left vacant.
We were walking together. But the difference was that Professor Tadeus Magul was silent. I was silent. The rare occasion was the whispering of facts, and the translation of some Polish lines written in some places.
Uniform
I came to know that the clothes given to the inmates hardly had any protection from cold and rain. Instead, penalties were incurred by those who wore scarves, sweaters or simply papers under the coats.
The uniform for women was a little different. They would be given skirts - not trousers or slacks - and white kerchiefs, to substitute for caps. The children in most cases kept their own clothing, as there were no small sized uniforms. As such they were mostly clad in pyjamas.
What did they eat? The food was did not suffice the living conditions. They lacked protein, calcium and vitamins.
Hunger, I was told by my friend, was a continuous force. It was the reason for their debilitation as the pictures or photos show. It was also the reason for numerous illnesses. This resulted in psychological aberration like becoming angry and stealing food from fellow inmates. The human qualities gradually weakened to the point when inmates quarreled with each other.
For a moment I remembered the dear old diary of the charming Jew girl, Anne Frank. I felt that she has written her hidden notes to express her innermost feeling of this gruesome existence. Why did this all happen? Anne seems to ask herself helplessly. Apart from hunger, dirt, insects, cold and little chance of ever getting enough rest and sleep.
Reduced to ashes
Then we walked towards the extermination unit. This, I felt, is the moment to reconsider the validity of our existence. Extermination was nothing but reducing the human body into ashes. The ashes were filled into a large tank like empty space. A vast land!
My mind flashed backed into endless limitless spaces created by humans to bury humans. For what reason? For not agreeing to disagree?
Then I saw a lady, tears flowing down her cheeks, holding a red flower in her hands. She was silently contemplating on something pensive and moody. Murmuring perhaps a prayer: “I send you this red flower on thinking of how we lived together, loving each other. May this memento be a token of memory of how the humans should love each other!”
Then I saw Professor Magul too holding a red flower in his hand.
“There may be a relation of ours buried in this mound of ashes who knows what befalls us.”
I too followed suit. True enough that I am a Sri Lankan come to see all this. But who knows whether a relation of mine too is reduced to ashes here? Is this the Holocaust?
John Boyne’s book ‘The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas’ centred around a Nazi Concentration Camp is now translated into Sinhala titled as ‘Iri Andume Sangavunu Kandula’. This Bookmark marks the occasion.
