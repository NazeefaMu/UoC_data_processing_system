[CITIZENS' Mail - (17-01-2017)]

Respect the religious diversity
Today the whole world is in a sad situation. Everywhere there is confusion. Everywhere there is fighting.
Thousands of innocent people are being killed. Thousands of houses are being destroyed. Schools are being destroyed.
Places of worship are being attacked. Hospitals are being attacked. There are millions of refugees all over the world.
The main reason for this mess is that we do not respect others ideas. We do not respect others beliefs. We do not respect other cultures. We do not respect other religions. We do not respect other countries. We do not respect other communities.
We think only we are correct. All the others are wrong. We think only our religion is correct and great. All the other religions are wrong. We think our culture is the best.
Other cultures are of second class. We think only our country is great. Other countries are inferior.
As religious leaders we have failed to correct this situation.
Time has come to look back and see where we have gone wrong. What has gone wrong? Are we doing the correct thing? Are we telling the correct thing? How to take the world out of this mess? How to settle this confusion? How to stop our followers destroying the world? How to put our followers in the correct direction?
We are talking hours and hours of our religious principles. We have days and days of religious celebrations. We have thousands and thousands of places of worship. But we are not telling our followers to respect other religions. We are not telling our followers to respect other ethnic groups.
We are not telling our followers to respect other cultures. We tell our followers that only our religion is correct and all other religions are incorrect. We do not teach our followers about religious harmony. We do not teach our followers of ethnic harmony. We do not tell our followers to respect other communities. We do not tell our followers to respect other religious beliefs.
So let us try to correct the world. Let us start thinking in a different way. Let us stop the fire that is burning the world. Let us stop the killings. Let us stop burning others property. Let us solve the refugee problem. Let us stop destroying others houses.
As religious leaders let us all get together and stop this menace. Let us tell our followers to respect other religions.
Let us tell our followers that people of all religions must live together like brothers and sisters. That is what all religious leaders have preached.
