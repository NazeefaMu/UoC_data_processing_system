Third day’s play abandoned due to rain

Heavy rain washed out the entire third day's play of the second test between New Zealand and Bangladesh at Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Sunday.
Rain had forced the players off early on Saturday and the hosts were to have resumed their first innings on 260 for seven, a deficit of 29 runs, with Henry Nicholls on 56 while Tim Southee was on four.
However, downpours overnight ensured there would be at least a delay to the start of play, but when the rain did not stop umpires Paul Reiffel and Nigel Llong abandoned play without a ball being bowled at the conclusion of the scheduled tea break at 1600 local (0300 GMT).
Bangladesh were dismissed for 289 with about five minutes remaining on the opening day's play on Friday with Southee taking five wickets.
