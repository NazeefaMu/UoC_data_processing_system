Drama Queens!

Being creative and learning to make creative choices helps students to be better at thinking up new ideas. It allows them to view the world around them in new ways. Confidence gained from learning performing arts skills applies to school, career, and life.
This is one of the main intentions behind the International Convention on Students’ Quality Circles (ICSQC). The event was held for the first time in 1997 and was initiated by the City Montessori School in Lucknow, India, to propagate the quality circle philosophy among students worldwide. Now in its 20th chapter the ICSQC was held in Embilipitiya in the Sabaragamuwa Province this year from May 14 to 19. The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council had provided the participants with food and lodging free of charge. Student delegates from around 20 countries competed in seven categories to showcase their skills at the event. Students had to show their talents in skit presentation, case study presentation, poster and slogan making, quiz, debate, student parliament and collage events. Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya, Colombo, stood out at the competition as they won many accolades in the event.
“We had 14 members in our Quality Circle this year. They took part in all the categories from our school. We won first place in skit presentation. Dinethmi Jayawardana won the Best Actress award for her performance as the king. We also got a special commendation awards for the case study presentation and the poster and slogan making categories,” Imara Gamage, the school’s Quality Circle team leader and head prefect said.
Apart from Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya, Ananda Vidyalaya, Nalanda Vidyalaya, Mahanama Vidyalaya and Devi Balika Vidyalaya took part in ICSQC 2017.

The Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya drama troupe consisted of six members: Dinethmi Jayawardana, Siluni Nayananda, Dinethma Supulvi Jayashantha, Roshelle Perera, Ihansa Karunaratne and Rashini Dias. The case study presentation consisted of four members: Imara Gamage, Gihini Gunawardena, Samadhi Fernando, Samindi Weerakoon and Roshelle Perera. Tharushi Liyanage and Saneesha Sandamini handled the poster and slogan making as well as the collage category. Dinethmi Jayawardana and Siluni Nayananda represented the student parliament. They were the two students selected from Sri Lanka to represent this category from the western parlaiment. Dinethmi Jayawardana and Roshelle Perera handled the debate while Thirani Athukorala and Siluni Kannangara took part in the quiz. Students from grade 10 and 12 were selected to take part in the events. The whole project was spearheaded by Kumani Boyagoda who is the teacher in charge of Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya’s Quality Circle.
The theme given for the skits was how to combat disaster management through adequate decisions. It needs to run for around 10 minutes. The Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya’s Quality Circle team based their skit on a popular folk tale: the fables of King Kekille. They concentrated on environment conservation in their play. The drama ‘Dawn of a Green Dream’ was scripted by Dinethma Supulvi Jayashantha. It was translated into English by Nilmini Mahanama, an English teacher at the school. Jayani Kapuge developed and directed the drama. She also designed the costumes for ‘Dawn of a Green Dream’. She has also been the teacher who led the school’s team in the skit presentation category at the ICSQC for four years.
Speaking about how she came across her storyline Dinethma noted that she went through several folk tales before finally deciding to use the fables of King Kekille as the basis for her script.
“I changed the characters a bit to suit the storyline. I have written several scripts before for the school. I also played the role of Andare in ‘Dawn of a Green Dream’,” she explained.
Reflecting on the moment when she was named as the Best Actress at the event Dinethmi said that it took time for the news to sink in.
“I was happy to bring such pride to my school. I feel that all our efforts and hard work had been well rewarded,” she said.
Ihansa Karunaratne plays a pivotal role in the drama. She is the goddess who gets the message across to the audience. She said that that her whole team was determined to win the event.
Siluni Nayananda who took on the character of Chief Advisor said that though that was her role, the Chief Advisor always worked in a manner to please the king.
“Finally it was the goddess who gave the best advice,” she noted with a smile.
Rashini Dias who gave life to the Chief Minister said that hers was a comic role. She has taken part in many school dramas before and has mostly done comic roles.
“I believe that my ability to change my voice to suit many characters gave me this opportunity,” she said.
Speaking about the challenges they encountered at the event Roshelle Perera who played the role of the mason said that the biggest chalange was how to make use of the full 10 minutes to get their message across.
“Our success is mainly due to team work. We overcame many challenges to emerge as the winners of this category. I admired the skit presented by Devi Balika Vidyalaya a lot. They have interwoven their story with lively music. They became first runners up at the event,” she said.
Students of Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya have won first place in the skit presentation category in 2011 as well. They have also won the Best Actress award several times.
Tharushi Liyanage and Saneesha Sandamini who represented both the poster and slogan and collage categories were under Vishanthika Mallika Hewa’s charge. They said that they used natural products to make their creations.
The students said that they wish to thank their principal R A M R Herath, Associate principal in charge of all the societies Champa Illangakoon and Kumari Senaratne who assisted them in the case study. Their parents too have been very supportive towards the project.
Speaking about the competition she was involved in Samindi Weerakoon said that the case study involved a systematic way in disposing organic garbage found within the school premises. The girls had even made a barrel out of discarded materials to make compost as a part of the project.
“The most important thing you learn by taking part in ICSQC is that everything you present has to be of quality. You get a training in various sectors which prepares you on how to handle events in the future. You learn about time management and how to work as a team by taking part in this program. You also get an opportunity to interact and see the methods that other student delegates use in the competition,” she noted adding that all the practices were done after school.
“Taking part in such a competition benefits you in the long run. It actually helps to motivate you in your studies rather than become a hindrance. For example one needs to engage in a lot of case studies when one begins to pursue higher education. ICSQC is a doorway for us on what is expected in case studies. We faced a lot of problems tackling the case study. We could not identify the issue correctly in the first place. The short time period we were given to complete the case study was another challenge but we managed to resolve all our issues in the end,” Imara added with a smile.
