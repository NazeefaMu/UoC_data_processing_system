Ricky Martin engaged to Jwan Yosef

The 44-year-old singer breaks the news to Ellen DeGeneres in a Wednesday appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, revealing that he popped the question to artist Jwan Yosef - his boyfriend of more than a year.
“We just got engaged,” he gushed. “I proposed. I was really nervous. But I got on my knees and I took out - not a box - I just had them in a little velvet pouch.” Martin had a slightly different way of popping the traditional question. “Instead of saying, ‘Will you marry me?’ I said, ‘I got you something.’ I said, ‘I want to spend my life with you.’ And he was like, ‘What is the question?’ [I said] ‘Would you marry me?’”
He adds: “It was very beautiful … He said yes.”
The pair made their red carpet debut in April at the amFAR Inspiration Gala in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Martin seemed to confirm the relationship by posting an Instagram photo of the pair at the event with the caption, “Yup.” Martin flashes his engagement band on the show, and tells DeGeneres that the two are now living together.
“He’s a conceptual artist, and I’m a collector. So I started looking for art and I saw his art and I went crazy because I love what he does, really original, and I contacted him — and then I collected him,” Martin says with a laugh.
Martin, who is the father of 8-year-old twin sons Valentino and Matteo, split from Carlos Gonzalez Abella in 2014. People
