'Brow bows' could be the most unflattering beauty trend yet

The bar for bizarre beauty trends keeps getting lifted ever higher in 2018.
If you thought having a piercing where you'd traditionally sport an engagement/wedding ring was the very apex of the weird trend curve, then you were wrong.
So, let's turn our attention to eyebrows. Now, you may think there's only so much you can realistically do with your eyebrows, but seeing as common beauty wisdom says they're the "hangers" for the face, even tweaking them slightly can make a massive impact.
But nothing could prepare us for 'brow bows'.
German makeup enthusiast Lisette Scheffler ( @beautylizs ) showed off this new and unusual trend.
As you can see, to achieve the look, you simply fill in your eyebrows to create a dainty - or massive - bow, with the arch of the brow serving as the tied ends.
You probably have questions. How? Why?
Luckily, Liz explained her motivation to POPSUGAR :
"I just saw how all of the brow trends became very popular in the past and thought it would be funny to create my own, and so I came up with the bow brows."
Liz's look appears to have caught on, too.
Convinced?
If you want to recreate this bold look for yourself, then follow Liz's lead and draw the outline with a Maybelline brow sating pencil and then fill it in with short strokes to achieve the 'bow' look.
Liz the uses Benefit brow gel to define the shape nicely.
