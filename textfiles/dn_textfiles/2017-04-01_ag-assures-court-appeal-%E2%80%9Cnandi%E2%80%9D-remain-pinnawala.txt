AG assures Court of Appeal: “NANDI” to remain at Pinnawala

 Order stayed till May 26 :
Several civil society activists sought Interim Order to suspend exportation of the elephant:
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya yesterday assured the Court of Appeal that the baby elephant Nandi would remain at Pinnawala and steps will be taken not to send the animal to New Zealand until the next court hearing on May 26.
In a writ petition before the Court of Appeal, several civil society activists have sought an Interim Order to suspend the exportation of the baby elephant “Nandi” to New Zealand until the final determination of the writ petition. The Court of Appeal Bench comprised Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Lalith Jayasuriya.
The petition had been filed by 18 parties including Dharmavijaya Foundation, the President of Dharmavijaya Foundation Olcott Gunasekara, Bodhiraja Foundation and Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera.
The petitioners had cited 41 parties including Attorney General and Minister of Livestock and Rural Development.
Five-year-old baby elephant Nandi had been purported to be gifted to New Zealand, when New Zealand Prime Minister John Key visited Sri Lanka in February 2016.
The petitioners stated that elephant “Nandi” belongs to the species ELEPHAS MAXIMUS, a rare and vulnerable species with Sri Lanka being one of the few countries that is home to the Asiatic elephant.
The petitioners further sought an order quashing the agreement entered into by government of Sri Lanka and the Auckland zoo with regard to the gifting of the baby elephant “Nandi” to New Zealand.
The petitioners further said that it has been stated by conservationists that the exporting of Sri Lanka’s elephants for the purpose of gifting in order to be displayed in Zoos for the commercial purposes of foreign countries, is ill conceived in as such around the world today there is a distinct and growing trend of the concept of zoos being considered deleterious to the welfare of the animals.
Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekara appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena appeared for the petitioners.
