According to the statement, she was on medical leave and undergoing treatment prior to her sudden death. McCauley, a national of Ireland and the United Kingdom, was the first UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka.
“Ms. McCauley was a bold, inspiring, and strong leader.

McCauley recorded 17 years of service in the United Nations and another seven working with children in the development sector. She was instrumental in developing policies and strategic frameworks on leading global issues in a number of countries, the statement said.
“The United Nations Family will miss her dearly, especially her humility, passion, energy, sense of humour and unwavering commitment to make lives better for all. Our deepest condolences are shared with her family. Dear Una, we miss you,” the statement further said.
Issuing a special statement addressing the General Secretary of the United Nations, President Maithripala Sirisena extended the deepest condolences of the Sri Lankan government on the passing of Una McCauley. “Ms. McCauley was a deeply committed professional.
