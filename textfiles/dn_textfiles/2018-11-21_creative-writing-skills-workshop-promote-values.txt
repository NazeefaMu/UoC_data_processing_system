Creative Writing Skills Workshop to promote values

The Interact Club of Colombo School of Arts and Sciences together with the publication division of the Marga Institute is conducting a creative writing workshop to promote good citizenship and values among school children. The programme initiated by the Marga Institute is designed to bring together talented young writers among school children who would work together to publish a Children's novel on good mindfulness, citizenship, and good values.
The children's storybook which is scheduled to be published in March 2019 will comprise the short stories that will be selected at the CSA/ Marga Workshop.
Gratiaen Award Winner Lal Medawattegedara, Lecturer, Open University of Sri Lanka, will conduct the creative writing workshop.
The first pilot workshop organized by the Marga Institute together with the Colombo School of Arts and Sciences will take place on November 24 and 25 at the Colombo School of Arts and Sciences at Mahawela Place Colombo 6. The programme will consist of exciting group activities, discussions on literature and values, and a session on creative writing.
Considering the outcome of the workshop, a Spokesmen of Marga Institute stated that the idea is to encourage young students to express their views about the world that they wish to live in and help them to create stories that will promote values.
“Last year we got the approval from the Ministry of Education to carry out an island-wide programme to promote values among public schools, and initially a couple of private sector organizations showed interest in sponsoring it. Unfortunately, it did not materialize and thereafter we considered proceeding with it as a pilot programme with our funds and approached the Interact Club of Colombo School of Art and Sciences. We are happy to see the interest of these children as they take the initiative to reach out to other schools in Colombo through the Interact Network and bring together a small group of young creative writers” Spokesmen for Marga Institute stated.
