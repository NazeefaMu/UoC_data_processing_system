Growing the best tomatoes ever!

Red, ripe homegrown tomatoes are the crown - jewel in many a vegetable garden. Let this be the period that you can say the same, with luscious fruit grown in your backyard garden, patio or balcony. Follow these tips for the best tomatoes ever.
More sun equals more fruit
Choose your sunniest garden spot, because tomatoes soak up sunshine just like water. Aim for seven hours of sunshine a day.
Give them room to grow, too, planting seedlings 30 to 48 inches apart, with rows set 48 inches apart. This will let light into the lower portions of the mature plants and improve air flow.
Beef up the soil
Tomatoes thrive in rich, well-draining, slightly acidic soil with a pH of 6.5 to 6.8. To determine pH, pick up a soil tester from the Garden Center or your local Cooperative Extension Service. If soil is too acidic, add dolomite lime.
If it’s too alkaline, add sulfur or composted organic matter.
Timing is everything
Whether you start your own seedlings or pick them up from the Garden Center, tomatoes like warmth. Wait until soil temps are consistently over 60 degrees before planting outside. If the weather is still iffy, protect tender seedlings from cold with row covers or plant protectors.
Plant deeply
Here’s a neat trick: Tomatoes will root along their stems. With leggy transplants, dig a trench and lay the stem sideways, bending gently upward. Snip or pinch off the lower branches and cover with soil up to the first set of leaves. This extra root growth will produce a stronger, more robust plant.
Water deeply and mulch, mulch, mulch
Juicy jumbo tomatoes need water, about an inch a week. A blanket of mulch — anything from shredded pine bark to grass clippings and composted leaves — will keep the water from evaporating in summer’s heat.
A soaker hose is an efficient solution; just position the hose in the garden and pile mulch up and over the hose.
Offer a cup of (compost) tea
Add the benefits of nutrient-rich compost to keep heavy-feeding tomato plants happy. Soak one part organic compost in one part water, let sit for 24 hours, filter the “tea” and use to nourish plants.
Pruning is for suckers
Tomato plants send out suckers — leaves that shoot out from the main stem. “Suckering” tomato plants, or removing the suckers, makes sense because it promotes air circulation, keeps down disease, and focuses the plant’s energy on growing fruit. Small leaves and tender stems can be pinched off with your fingers; pruning snips give a clean cut to thicker stems.
