Royal Rugby Rally on October 28

The Royal College Rugby Advisory and Management Committee have organized a fund raising rally to be held on the 28th of October 2018. Proceeds of the event will go towards the player development fund for the 2019 rugby season. The Automobile Association have stepped forward to support this year’s event as the main sponsor. The sponsorship cheque was handed over to the Principal of Royal College on the 3rd of September.
The rally is scheduled to be flagged off at the Boake gates at 9.00am and conclude at the Orient Club at around noon where participants and well wishers will gather for lunch and refreshments. The route will take approximately 3 hours to complete and will require teams to navigate a course, leading participants through Colombo and its suburbs. Each team will consist of a driver and a navigator.
Teams will be required to attend a briefing at 8.00am on the day of the event. Registrations are now opened. If you are interested in participating or have any questions, please contact the organizing committee on [email protected]. Registrations for the event have been limited to 50 vehicles.
