China offers 10-year visas  to 'high end talent'

China is issuing long-term visas to lure highly skilled people from abroad to work in the country.
The multi-entry visas will be valid for between five and 10 years, according to state media.
Technology leaders, entrepreneurs and scientists from in-demand sectors are among those eligible to apply.
China has set out goals for its economic and social development, and sees recruiting experts from abroad as key to achieving that.
When plans for the scheme were first considered, China said at least 50,000 foreigners would benefit.
Applications for the visas can be made online, are free of charge and will be processed quickly, the Chinese government said.
Visa holders will be allowed to remain in the country for up to 180 days at a time, and will be eligible to bring partners and children.
In 2016 China introduced a ranking system for expatriates, aimed at identifying the skills it wanted to attract while reducing the number of lower-skilled foreigners coming into the country.
According to a document from the Chinese government, those classed as "high-end foreign talent" included Nobel Prize winners, successful Olympic athletes and directors of "world famous colleges of music fine arts and arts".
Top scientists, heads of major financial institutions and professors of "overseas high-level universities" also fit the bill.
The visas would also be granted to the spouses and children of the “high-end” recipients.
China implements a strict immigration system and tightly controls the issuing of work visas.
Most foreigners working in China must renew their visas every one or two years.
The new visas are meant to expand the pool of foreign specialists working in China, particularly in the areas such as science and technology, which Beijing sees as key to driving economic growth.
According to government guidelines, high-end foreigners also refer to, among others, Nobel Prize winners, chief or deputy editors in Chinese state media, foreign coaches and players in national and provincial sports teams, postdoctoral students from world-class universities outside China, and foreigners who earn at least six times the average annual wage in China.
The average annual income in Beijing in 2016 was 92,477 yuan (US$14,220), according to official statistics.
The visas are part of a top-down drive to make China a more attractive place to work and stay.
In February 2016, the central government relaxed the country’s green card rules, extending eligibility for permanent residency to foreigners working in broader fields than just government departments or laboratories involved in “key national projects”.
Of all the provincial-level areas in China, Shanghai has the highest number of foreign workers, with about 215,000 of the city’s 24 million people coming from overseas.
A third of those overseas workers are employed in the business service sector, according to local authorities. In 2016, Japan was the biggest source of foreign workers in Shanghai, followed by the United States and South Korea.
