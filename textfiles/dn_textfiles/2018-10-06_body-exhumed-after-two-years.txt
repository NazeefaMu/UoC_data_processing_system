Body exhumed after two years

The remains of person who died two years ago was exhumed at the Unawatuna cemetery in Buttala when relatives complained that the death was suspicious. The remains of Priyantha Jayasinghe (28) of Unawatuna in Buttala who was married to a medical college student then, was exhumed before Wellawaya Magistrate Mahesh Vakishta yesterday.
A brother of the deceased Asanka Jayasinghe said the brother died on the same day his sister-in-law (deceased’s wife) came home. He added that he was in sound health condition and was suspicious of the death. Some organs of the deceased were sent to Government Analyst’s Department. He said since the reports were delayed they made a complaint before the Wellawaya Magistrate and he ordered to exhume the body.
The Magistrate ordered the JMO to report to Court if there was anything suspicious into the death.
