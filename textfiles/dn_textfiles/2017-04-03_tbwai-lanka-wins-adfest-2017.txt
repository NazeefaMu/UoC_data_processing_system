TBWAi Lanka wins at ADFEST 2017

Competing against 3,011 entries across 18 awards categories at ADFEST 2017, TBWAi Lanka brought glory to the country by being the only Sri Lankan Agency to win a award at the recently concluded awards presentation. The press ad – “afterlife” created for a reputed publication won a Bronze award in the Media Lotus category. The Media Lotus category counted 250 entries and 35 awards being given, including 1 Grande, 10 Gold, 15 Silver and 9 Bonze.
The winning idea was the use of “chad” – the fragment of paper created when holes are made by a paper puncher to encourage people to save and recycle even the smallest piece of paper.
To make the message relevant, the insight used was the deep rooted cultural understanding of Sri Lankan “masks” associated with after life.
Thus, masks made out of chads re-iterated that even the smallest piece of paper could be recycled and given a new life.
“Competing among Asia’s best is no easy task. In the Media category, to be placed among the 35 metal recipients from 250 entries is an honor. It proves that insight driven ideas stand the test. The challenge for local teams is to be focused and consistent” said Subhash Pinnapola, Chief Creative Officer, TBWAi Lanka.
“Every award is special and a Lotus Award more so as ADFEST is Asia’s most celebrated and recognized creative festival.
When the piece recognized has an insight that is unique to the culture of Sri Lanka, it is even more special as it is that uniqueness which puts Sri Lanka on the global arena. I am extremely proud that TBWAi Lanka was able to keep the Sri Lankan flag flying high at ADFEST 2017” said Renuka Marshall, Managing Director TBWAi Lanka.
Founded in 1998, ADFEST is considered the ideal place for the creative industry to gather, network, exchange ideas and meet new friends.
With less than 200 delegates in its 1st year, ADFEST this year welcomed close to 1200 delegates from 69 cities in total.
ADFEST not only raises the standard of creative excellence in the region, it also celebrates the uniqueness of local culture.
It has become a learning hub for those in the communication industry through the showcasing of the region’s best creative works and inspiring content from experts in various disciplines.
