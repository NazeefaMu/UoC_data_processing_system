Laggala drowning
Two bodies of children recovered

The bodies of two children who drowned in Thelgamu Oya, Matale, was recovered yesterday evening, Laggala Police said.
The Police Life Saving Unit said that the bodies were discovered near two distant caves about 750 meters away from the place they have been bathing. The bodies of the deceased have been sent to the Dambulla Base Hospital, Laggala Police added.
According to the search operations, the Police stated that the huge rocks present in the area had blocked the vision of the incoming volume of water and there was no method to save someone from any sudden disaster in the area.
All the eight bodies of the deceased have been now discovered and Lieutenant Dinuk Madusanka of the Trincomalee Navy Camp said that Navy officers had continuously gone on search operations in search of the last two bodies from the November 4 until yesterday.
An eye witness of the incident, a worker connected to the construction work of a nearby bridge, H. G. Chandrapala told the Police that he had seen the two children bathing and suddenly, a volume of water had carried them away, drowning them.
He further said that he had tried to save a person who had hung on to an iron rod of the bridge, before that individual was carried away by the stream.
The deceased hotel owner Kingsly Rathnayake had been constructing a tourist hotel in the area near this Oya and had asked one of his co-workers to keep lunch prepared for them after they come back from the Oya. The co-worker sadly added that Rathnayake had been a nature lover throughout his life and was concerned about the environment when building his tourist hotel.
The dead bodies of the children were sent to the Dambulla Base Hospital for a postmortem examination and were subsequently handed over to the relatives, yesterday.
