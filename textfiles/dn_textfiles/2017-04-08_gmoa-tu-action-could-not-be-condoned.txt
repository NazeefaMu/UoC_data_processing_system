' GMOA TU action could not be condoned'

Due to severe hardships of people and their lives:
Trade Union action by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), could not be condoned as as such action could cause severe hardships to the entire society, Secretary General of the Sri Lanka Nidahas Sewaka Sangamaya Leslie Devendra said. “How could the trade union action by the GMOA be ethical,” he questioned. He said that trade unions should consider ethically of their union action prior to launching, though there was every right for trade unions to go for trade union action.
There are two sides of trade union action, namely “Ethical” as well as “Labour rights,” he said. He noted that the government could disperse such trade union actions which cause hardships and threats to people as well as their lives. “Under the International Labour Convention, governments are empowered to take measures to disperse such trade union actions on the grounds of protecting the people and also their lives. When people and their lives are under threat owing to trade union action, the government of such country could attempt to come to an agreement with such trade union,” he said.
