Mathews, Kusal  out of Tri-series

Sri Lanka’s white-ball captain Angelo Mathews who suffered a right hamstring tightness has returned to Sri Lanka and will not take part in the remainder of the ongoing ODI tri-series, a media release from Sri Lanka Cricket states.
Mathews’ participation in the rest of the Bangladesh tour will depend on medical advice.
Meanwhile opening batsman Kusal Perera is suffering from a side strain, which occurred while he was batting in the match against Zimbabwe on Sunday.
Perera has been asked to rest by the doctors and will miss the remainder of the ongoing ODI series.
Batsman Dhananjaya de Silva will replace Perera in the squad.
