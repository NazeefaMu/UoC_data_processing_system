The resolution has widely opened the way for Sri Lanka to play a vital role as a member of the international com- munity, committed to the values of the UNO Charter, the universal Declaration of Human Rights and other covenants on Human Rights and Social and Political Rights.

"The government's commitment to review the Public Security Ordinance and the Prevention of Terrorism Act and replace it with anti terrorism legislation in line with contemporary international practices. The government's commitment to a political settlement by making necessary constitution changes. The government's commitment to strengthen and safeguard the credibility of the process of truth seeking, preparation and guarantees of non recurrence by engaging in broad national consultation with the inclusion of victims of civil society groups. This resolution has positively laid to rest the fears and suspicions that prevail regarding the nature of the investigation, which under the earlier resolutions on Sri Lanka would have led either to an international investigation or what is stated to be a investigation by a Hybrid Court."
