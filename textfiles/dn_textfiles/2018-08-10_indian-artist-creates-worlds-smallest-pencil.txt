Indian artist creates world's smallest pencil

An Indian artist is showing off what he says is the world's smallest pencil - a functioning writing implement measuring only .2 inches long.
Prakash Chandra Upadhyay, a micro-sculptor, said he drilled a minuscule hole in a piece of wood and inserted the graphite to create the pencil, which requires a pair of tweezers to use.
Upadhyay said it took him about four days worth of effort to make the tiny pencil, which measures .2 inches long and only .02 inches wide.
"This pencil is made of a single piece of wood. The wood has been drilled and the lid has been fixed in it," Upadhyay told ANI News. Upadhyay's pencil was recognized as the smallest by Assist World Records Research Foundation.
