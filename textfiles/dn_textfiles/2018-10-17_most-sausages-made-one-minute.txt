Most sausages made in one minute

Barry John Crowe has been making sausages since he was 13 years old. Last year, on national television, he broke the Guinness World Record for the number of sausages hand-linked in one minute.
He finally got to see his name in print, as the Guinness Book of World Records 2019 edition went on sale. He joined Ray D’Arcy on the line.
When he’s not busy raising three children, who are thrilled to see their Dad gracing a coveted half-page of Guinness’ latest collection of records, Barry John is at Crowe’s Meats in Cavan town trying to dream up new additions to their 36 varieties of sausages. Popular flavours include Chocolate chip, Pepperoni Pizza and – the latest – ‘the Spicebag sausage’. Ray asked if Barry John if he is ever tempted to try to break his own record. He’s thought about it and the answer was...Yes!
