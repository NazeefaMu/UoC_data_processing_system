Omentra to bring freedom of online  marketplace to Sri Lankan businesses

Omentra.com one of Sri Lanka’s largest ever complete Business-to-Business (B2B) online marketplace for business supplies are working hard to further expand its network of suppliers and partners.
In an interview, Omentra Head of Operations, Nadun Kumar shares his views on concept behind omentra , its special features , local e-commerce industry outlook and etc…
Q: What is Omentra.com?
A: We provide 360° B2B procurement related solutions, where we give businesses the convenience and simplicity of selecting from the best suppliers and finding solutions for their daily procurement related business needs.
Q: How does Omentra.comhelp businesses?
A: Essentially, Omentra.com is an online marketplace that businesses can use to simplify and ease their procurement related activities in a manner that frees up companies from the burden of administration and logistics related to B2B procurement processes, by enabling the effective digitization and optimization of procurement procedures – whether that is in order to find suppliers for daily raw material inputs, or to find suppliers for a last minute order of laptops or office chairs.
Our goal with this platform is to enable companies of any size, and working in almost any sector to gain free, easy, and reliable access to whatever products or services they require to make their businesses run better. This can span absolutely anything from IT products, electronics and office supplies to engineering, manufacturing and construction equipment and related supplies and services.
In total, we have eight sales categories and within each of these is an already impressive diversity of products and services, including several global and local firsts in terms of business models and value-added services.
Q: What is “Solution Guru”?
Solution Guru I would say is first time in the world. It is something similar to a start-up accelerator. We understand that there is an increasing number of start-ups coming out in Sri Lanka.
I believe we should all help them in any way possible, as it is a healthy sign for the country’s economy. Solution Guru is a simple help for such start-ups.
It enables a start-up to find business suppliers to simply set-up office and if needed even to reach out to financing companies or venture capitalists (business angels).
I really believe this would be promising for all Sri Lankan start-ups.
Q: Are there any fees applicable for a business to use the website?
This website is absolutely free to be used by businesses to ease and simplify their daily procurement related needs.
Q: How do we identify whether the vendor is genuine or products are original, which is displayed in Omentra.com?
The products of Omentra.com meet all the quality and acceptable standards. There is an initial verification process done by the Omentra team before on-boarding a vendor and their related products, in order to ensure the maintenance of this standard.
Q: What is the level of development for the Sri Lankan e-commerce industry and its importance moving forward?
A: e-Commerce is easily one of the most important new business models in the world, especially with regard to developing countries as it provides greater market reach, enhances participation in international supply chains, and improves firm-level and market efficiencies.
In many ways it is considered “the great equalizer in international trade”, providing new Business-to-Business (B2B) opportunities that previously did not exist.
Globally, B2B e-Commerce is projected to increase at a rate of 19% YoY with sales reaching $6.7 trillion by 2020.
In comparison, B2C e-Commerce is set to grow at 17% YoY approximately half that amount in the same time. Annual consumer sales in Sri Lanka are valued at Rs. 300 billion and currently online sales are just 1% of it.Closer to home India’s e-commerce industry is slated to skyrocket by as much as 71% in 2015 and reach an incredible US$ six billion, according to Gartner.
If we connect properly, India’s spillover effect could have dramatic impact on Sri Lanka’s business landscape. The e-commerce industry in Sri Lanka is likely to expand more than threefold by 2018.
Hence, we believe that Sri Lanka’s e-commerce industry is at an inflection point.
Even though the market is getting saturated with a plethora of Business-to-Consumer (B2C) e-Commerce platforms, there has been no successful B2B e-Commerce platforms that have been launched and established itself successfully at a national scale and we believe that this is an area which Omentra can help usher in drastic changes.
