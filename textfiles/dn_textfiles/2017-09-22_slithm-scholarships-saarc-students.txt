SLITHM scholarships for SAARC students

As part of its contribution to regional cooperation, the Government of Sri Lanka through the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs recently offered two scholarships in tourism and hospitality management to students in SAARC countries. The offer was made during the 18th SAARC Summit held in Nepal.
Consequent to this the SAARC Secretariat has nominated two students namely Deki Wangmo from Bhutan and . Fatima Mosavi from Afghanistan to follow the hospitality training courses conducted by the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM).
Wangmo from Bhutan has already joined SLITHM and is currently following a five month certificate course in Hotel Front Office Operations. Having taken a liking to the country and SLITHM, she will continue at SLITHM’s main campus in Colombo, pursuing the three year Management Diploma course commencing in January 2018, as well.
Meanwhile the other student nominated by SAARC, Fatima Mosavi of Afghanistan is expected to enroll for the same three year Management Diploma course scheduled to commence in January 2018.
SLITHM is Sri Lanka’s leading tourism and hospitality educational institute with a highly successful track record spanning over five decades. Its graduates are in great demand both locally and overseas and occupy senior positions in the hospitality industry.
Established in 1966 in Colombo, SLITHM currently operates campuses located in Kandy, Bandarawela, Anuradhapura, Koggala, Ratnapura, Hambantota, Passikudah, Negombo, Polonnaruwa and shortly in Jaffna.
Chairman, SLITHM, ASunil Dissanayake welcomed the foreign students who have enrolled for various courses. “Regardless of your level of education, within a short period of time, you can succeed if you join the hotel and tourism industry, so I invite the youth not only in Sri Lanka but also the SAARC region to join Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management,” he said.
