Eheliyagoda Pradeshiya Sabha grapples with fly menace

The Eheliyagoda Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) sprays a chemical to nearly 500 houses in Beruwana, Eheliyagoda since flies are rapidly spreading throughout the area.
The PS had spent over Rs, 1 lakh on spraying the chemical to 1000 houses, Eheliyagoda PS Field Officer Milinda Roshan said.
Recently the residents in the area held a protest in front of the PS urging the PS to stop dumping garbage into a mine since the area has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies.
The PS has started to dump garbage there in 2007. The mine is overflowing now with garbage. Eheliyagoda PS Vice Chairman Ruwan Liyanage said they will set up a garbage recycling unit to resolve the issue very soon.
