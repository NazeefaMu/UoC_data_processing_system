SLPP letterheads cause concern for SLFP organiser

Matale District SLFP organiser Susil Premaratne has lodged a complaint with the Elections Commission alleging that certain state officials with political rights contesting the forthcoming local elections have submitted leave applications in a misleading manner.
The letter heads of the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna depict the picture of SLFP patron, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is a former President of the SLFP.
In a letter addressed to the Elections Commission Chairman, Premaratne said this was improper and misleading because the correct procedure was for public officers in the State and Corporation service having political rights under chapter 32 of the Establishment Code contesting elections as a candidate of a party to submit a leave application bearing the letter head of the General Secretary of the respective party.
As such he has requested the Election's Commission Chairman to cancel or reject the leave applications which did not conform to this legal procedure.
The letter has been copied to the Matale District Assistant Elections Commissioner.
