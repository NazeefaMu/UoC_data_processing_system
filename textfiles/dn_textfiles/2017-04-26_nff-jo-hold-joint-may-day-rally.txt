NFF, JO to hold joint May Day rally

National Freedom Front would hold its May Day Rally jointly with the Joint Opposition at the Galle Face green, said former NFF Parliamentarian Mohammad Musammil.
He said they would support the four struggles; the struggle of the working class, the struggle of the farmers, and the struggle for protecting the motherland that have already been initiated against this government. He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the NFF party Head Office in Battaramulla.
Musammil said they would work together with the main aim of toppling this government which attempts to betray the energy security of this country to India and sell the natural resources and the public assets.
"The UNP government would attempt to hand over the Oil Tank Farms in Trincomalee to India although it has promised the trade unions not to do so," Musammil said. "The energy security in a country is as important as its defence. But this government attempts to hand them over to India as they agreed before the January 8 election," he said.
He added that the government has not been able to provide reasonable compensation to the victims of the Meethotamulla tragedy as well as they had failed to provide reasonable compensation to the victims of the blast at the Salawa armoury.
"Today the farmers are facing a critical situation due to the lack of water. Even if they cultivated, they would not be able to fetch a proper price for their harvest. But the rice price in the market is very high," Musammil said.
