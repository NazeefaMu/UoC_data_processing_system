Lanka should publish budget revenue, expenditure consequences

Sri Lanka should move towards a more professional way of managing the economy and take immediate measures to publish revenue and expenditure consequences of numerous budgetary promises made by the government.
Verité Research Executive Director and Head of Research Nishan de Mel speaking at the LBO-LBR Business Forum under the theme 'Business Climate Outlook of 2016' said the various budgetary promises, changes in expenditure and policies should always come to Parliament with the estimate of the revenue or expenditure consequences as budget promises are easily forgotten once the budget is over.
"There are some debts that are not even calculated in budget accounting. Public service pensions is a huge debt that the government accrues year by year.The country should take immediate measures to make it mandatory to at least publish the present discounted value estimates of pension debts.
"We have a pension scheme in which there is no obligation to do the national accounting of the debt that is accrued to the future when pension promises are made today."
Commenting on the government's measures to cut budget deficit targets, he pointed out that the cutting of the deficits didn't happen in the way that necessarily was helpful to the long-term development of the country and sectors that need investments.
"There is a serious problem in using what's said in budget year on year as means of setting expectations of the future. Not understanding how revenue is actually going to go forward, government tries to create short-term revenue crunches that have to be met with short-term solutions.
The country is not yet in the right political cycle where the solving of the major issues has been made politically important."
He also added that Sri Lanka is faced with serious issues with regard to unlocking and attracting the labour force in a viable way into higher productivity and higher wages.
According to De Mel, Sri Lankan labour is opting out of work because either they are stuck in the unproductive agricultural sector or they are opting out to go for low skilled jobs or semi skilled jobs outside the country. Export and foreign direct investments depend on the ability of the country to help a large number of small players to create jobs and support production processes.
He pointed out that anticipating changes will not come by back door lobbying ; changes will only come when there is a social and wider business level consciousness that government must deliver out of the structural changes.
