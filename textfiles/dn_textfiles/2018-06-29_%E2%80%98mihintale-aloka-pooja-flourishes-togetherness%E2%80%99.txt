‘Mihintale Aloka Pooja  flourishes togetherness’

President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited Mihintale together to inaugurate the Aloka Pooja organised by Lake House symbolising the reconciliation in the country, Mihintale Raja Maha Viharadhipathi and Custodian Ven. Walawahangunuwewa Dhammarathana Nayaka Thera said.
The Thera was delivering an anusasana on the Poson Poya day during the Aloka Pooja Ceremony.
The Thera said Mihintale became sacred when Kakusandha, Konagama, Kasyapa and Gouthama Buddhas visited the location. "Maithri Buddha will also visit Mihintale. It is the place the Dhamma was discoursed to deities, and distributed sacred relics to the country," the Thera said.
The Thera said the Mihindu procession was held for the first time at the Mihintale and the world's first sanctuary was established surrounding the rock. "Sixty eight stone caves were vested in the Maha Sangha and King Dewanampiya Tissa and his 40,000 followers turned Buddhists at the sacred place," the Thera said.
The Thera requested the President and the Prime Minister to remove all barricades that prevent the children from Dhamma schools. " The proposed Mihintale Illumination System to be launched at a cost of Rs. 3,300 million will be complete before the 2019 Poson festival," the Thera said.
The prelate requested to declare Eighth Wap Ceremony (October) to commemorate Arhath Mahinda Thera's attaining Nibbana.
Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said the CEB incurs a huge loss by providing electricity to religious places in the country. He said the Mihintale Aloka Baraya (Trust Fund) will be established very soon to provide electricity to the sacred area on the request of the Thera.
The Mahameuna Poson Pirith Chanting Ceremony on July 30 followed by an alms giving for 100 Bikkhus at the Bomaluwa Temple will see the end of the week-long Poson Poya Aloka Pooja at Mihintale. Over 600,000 devotees visited Anuradhapura and Mihinthale in the week. Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M.Wanninayake along with the Divisional Sectaries, Department Heads and Lake House Officials will open today's festival.
