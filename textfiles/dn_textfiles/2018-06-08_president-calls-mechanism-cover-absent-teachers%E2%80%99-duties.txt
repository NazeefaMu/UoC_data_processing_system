President calls for mechanism to cover absent teachers’ duties

President Maithripala Sirisena noted that there should be a proper mechanism to cover the duties of teachers who are on leave.
The President urged relevant authorities to introduce a suitable mechanism to carry out educational activities of schools without obstruction due to absent teachers.
The President was speaking at a ceremony to recruit 500 graduate teachers to the Western Province, at the Nelum Polukna Theatre, yesterday.
President Sirisena had come to know that 1,500 female teachers are on maternity leave annually from the Western Province alone. In addition, a significant number of teachers go abroad annually and another considerable number of teachers are not deployed for teaching due to various issues relating to mental health. However, as this situation causes a severe impact on the smooth function of school education, the President advised authorities to introduce a suitable mechanism.
Addressing the newly appointed teachers, the President noted that teachers are duty-bound to create a knowledgeable society since a knowledge society is a must to develop the country. The President added that a knowledgeable and educated society plays a key role in the development of the country.
The President while highlighting the value of latest knowledge, said teachers should be up to date as sometimes, students are far better than the teacher, knowledge wise.
“In this ever-advancing world, it is common to see that certain students are more knowledgeable. Students are keen on seeking knowledge by using modern technology. Then teachers too should cultivate a flair to hunt for knowledge,” the President said.
The government will provide all facilities for school teachers to enable them to have a conducive condition mentally to provide a sound education to students, President Sirisena said. He said the commitment made by teachers to nurture children with knowledge is not limited to their salaries, because the teaching profession is the best profession in the world.
The President said students should qualify, not only by overcoming various academic barriers and passing examinations, but should also achieve success in the journey of life.
“One of the prime objectives of the government is to provide the maximum educational benefits to students,” President Sirisena said. The President said education is not merely gaining qualifications but also inculcating citizens with values for the benefit of the country.
President Sirisena said students have to use modern technology as part of their progress. The President requested students to make the best out of modern technology in a productive manner.
