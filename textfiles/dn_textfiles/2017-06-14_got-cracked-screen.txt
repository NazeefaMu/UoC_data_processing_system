Got a cracked screen?

A cracked smartphone screen can ruin your day, and if you don’t have the right repair options it could ruin your month.

We’ll walk through the options you can use to fix your broken iPhone screen or broken Android screen. There are a variety of ways you can fix your broken screen and options to look for help.
If you drop your iPhone or Android without a case you may end up looking for a solution. Cases can help, but the odds are good that if you are reading this you are looking for a solution for a screen you already cracked.
Contact the Manufacturer. Before you attempt any DIY screen repair options you should check with the company that made your phone.
Apple offers AppleCare+ if you buy within 60 days of buying a new device.

We’ve also seen the occasional free repair, but that depends on a lot of factors lining up in your favor.
HTC offers an Uh-Oh protection plan that covers a screen replacement if your HTC One M9 breaks within the first year. This is a free replacement and the new device arrives fast.
Samsung sells a Galaxy S7 warranty and warranty plans for other Samsung phones like AppleCare+ does. If you buy this before the damage happens you are covered.
