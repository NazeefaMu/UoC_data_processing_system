If political anticlimax not resolved
Lanka can become uncompetitive  in the eyes of investors - FTZMA

Sri Lanka will become uncompetitive and undesirable in the eyes of present and future investors which ultimately affect all constituents of the nation, a statement issued by the Free Trade Zone Manufacturers Association (FTZMA) Executive Committee states.
FIZMA therefore urges all in authority to put an end to this political anticlimax and work with and support the private sector to further develop the country.
Excerpts of the statement. Since the crisis started on the October 26, we have had many concerned inquiries from our customers and other stakeholders both local and international regarding the present political situation in the country.
The image portrayed especially in the west has been extremely negative both in the print as well as digital media.
This has had implications for most of the future order books of our members.
While it important to preserve the sovereignty of our country, we must also accept the fact that we are operating on a global platform which is highly interconnected and transparent to our end customers and consumers.
Upholding the Constitution, law and order, consistent policy making, and political and economic stability are key to growing our businesses and attracting further FDI (Foreign Direct Investment). We are extremely disturbed and disappointed with the behavior of all political parties concerned in not reaching a consensus to this political flux. It is important and urgent that all political leaders at loggerhead put the country first.
FIZMA is one of the largest manufacturing associations representing Katunayake, the largest free trade zone in the country. The zone employs roughly 45,000 workers and has over 52+ organizations which operate over 80 plants within the zone.
The membership is made up of mainly large multinational companies with principals from the US, UK, EU and other countries.
