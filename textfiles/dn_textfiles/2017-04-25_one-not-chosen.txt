The one not chosen

“The right of every man to life is correlative with the duty to preserve it; his right to a decent standard of living with the duty of living it becomingly”, so writes Pope John the XXIII in his Encyclical Pacem in Terris.
Simply put, this means that just as we must preserve and defend the right to life of every human being, society must also provide the supports necessary for that being to live in dignity.
The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka is vehemently opposed to the proposed legislation to decriminalize abortion. Indeed, the taking of life, at whatever stage is a crime and does not find favour with most people. Here, the Invitro Fertilization method deserves mention, as in some instances, unused, live embryo’s too are discarded. As Catholics, we believe and support the sanctity of life from conception to natural death. To us, this means upholding the right to life of everyone including the babe in the womb. Therefore, is opposition to the taking of life in the womb enough? What must we do to ensure a life of dignity for the mother and child?
Listed as a crime under the Penal Code, a woman can be charged for terminating a pregnancy whether or not the woman is married. More often than not, it is economic hardship or social stigma that drives a woman to seek a termination of a pregnancy.
While society sees abortion as a crime it fails to recognize that our attitudes towards women, ‘fatherless children’, the disabled and the poor, often create situations in which an abortion is considered the preferred option. It is our own complicity in creating and sustaining a culture of judgement and surveillance that aids and abets that sin.
Dignity and sanctity of life
The government of Sri Lanka proposes to decriminalize abortion under three circumstances; in the case of rape or incest, where the girl is under 16-years-old (constituting statutory rape) and serious foetal impairment.
Christian teaching tells us to accept whatever God gives, and even a seriously impaired foetus, cannot be aborted as it amounts to taking a life.
The same applies to a pregnancy that has occurred owing to rape, incest or where the girl is underage. In all of these circumstances, the only exception that allows a termination is if medical advice indicates that the mother’s life is in grave danger. What this article aims to raise is that alongside the protection of life in the womb, we must also look to the dignity and sanctity of life at all stages.
As such, it is imperative that society be educated to be kind and respectful of children born in situations of rape, incest, outside marriage or with disabilities. In arguing for the right to life, we are called to support the mother and protect the child. In bringing to term the life of an abnormal or impaired foetus, parents must receive the necessary tools and supports to meet the economic and emotional demands of caring for such a child. Woefully, neither the government nor non-governmental agencies provide adequate supports for such children or their families. Nor is our education system geared to meet the special needs of these children.
Sri Lankan society is conditioned to automatically judge a woman who is pregnant outside the conventions of marriage. The tag “unwed mother” immediately places her in a position of disadvantage; to be pitied or scorned, to live a life of shame. We kill her at that point, as we kill the child she bears, at the very moment of birth by our attitude. That is the irony, that while we do all we can to prevent an abortion (because it is a sin to kill), we take away their dignity and their “right to a decent standard of living with the duty of living it becomingly”. This calls our attention to the “justice question; to examine factors such as poverty and the stigma of being “impure or fatherless”, that lead women to choose abortion.
Catholics who opt for abortions and those who help carry out the act are excommunicated as per the teachings of the church. A statement released by the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka on the issue, reiterates this clause, “formal co-operation in an abortion constitutes a grave offence. The church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life.”
Yet, the man who commits the heinous crime of rape gets off with a much lighter sentence. Let’s take the case of the girl in Brazil, who, after being sexually abused by her step-father was found to be pregnant with twins at the tender age of 9. Her mother and doctors, all Catholics opted to terminate the pregnancy and were excommunicated. The Church in Brazil took the stand that though the step-father had committed “a heinous crime”, “the abortion, the elimination of an innocent life, was more serious”. – (Brazil rocked by abortion for 9-year-old rape victim, Independent)
It did not matter that the girl had been sexually abused for several years, or that she would live with the trauma of these events for the rest of her life. It did not matter that her life was in danger; her mother was expected to put her daughter through the rigours of pregnancy and possible death to save the life of the twins. (Given the circumstances and public outcry, The National Conference of Bishops of Brazil, later cancelled the excommunication order).
Evils of abortion
The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka is urging her clergy to organise prayer campaigns, and preach to the faithful on the evils of abortion, so as not to “fool our womenfolk who thus call for the “right to choice” in regulating their babies to suit their so called newly won ‘freedoms’.” (Koinonia Bulletin, February 2017) It is our view, that while we work to defend the unborn babe, that the Catholic Church must simultaneously spearhead a campaign to educate their menfolk to respect women and not treat them as sexual objects. The language used in the statement itself is patriarchal. It is imperative that we call our menfolk, and our society to integrity. Sanctity and dignity of life must also extend to the women who are sexually abused, shamed, and silenced by patriarchal attitudes.
The Church is well positioned to raise awareness through educational activities to change society’s attitude to women who find themselves pregnant outside marriage, whatever the circumstance. Society must learn to respect children born in such situations instead of relegating them to live as orphans or quietly smuggled away from the mother or condemned to live within the confines of one’s home, in the case of the disabled and impaired. ‘It is important for that child to feel wanted…..: writes Pope Francis in Amoris Laetitia, who in November 2016, while reiterating his opposition to abortion, which he refers to as a “grave sin”, also permitted Priests to forgive that sin, ‘“there is no sin that God’s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father.” Pope Francis Extends Priests’ Ability to Forgive Abortion, New York Times, Nov. 21, 2016
The Church could also do more in providing much needed support for care givers of the differently abled children in our midst. Such facilities would help dissuade parents from resorting to terminating an abnormal or impaired foetus.
The Catholic Church accrues her wealth through the generosity of her congregation. Such monies must be utilized to provide long-term activities and facilities that would ensure a life of dignity for all, instead of endorsing patriarchal attitudes through statements such as “fool our womenfolk.”
The church must also take the lead in alleviating poverty by insisting on a just wage for all workers[AR1], and supporting or initiating more income generating projects for the marginalized of society. The church must oppose schemes that jeopardize employment of the people for the financial gain of a few. The Maintenance Act of Sri Lanka has provision for the upkeep of children, adult offspring, disabled offspring and spouses unable to maintain themselves. Unfortunately, most women are either unaware of its provisions, or do not have the backing of family or community to fully benefit from it.
Therefore, it is our firm belief, that to successfully prevent abortions, there must be an attitudinal change in society. Who else is better positioned to bring about that change than our clergy?
Pope Francis advises that, “If the Church stays “indoors,” she certainly will age. The Church is called to come out of herself and to go to the “existential peripheries,” where the mystery of sin, pain, injustice, religious indifference and all of human miseries are found.” (A Year with Pope Francis, Daily reflections from his writings, edited by Alberto Rossa, CMF)
The bishops, the clergy and the religious must take on a pivotal role along with the faithful to introduce a solution that would abide by the church’s teachings of protecting the unborn while ensuring the dignity of the mother and the child. The laity are not exempt from this call either. Discipleship calls them to take up this work, ‘for the fast that is chosen is to loosen the chains of injustice, and to break the yoke.’ (Isaiah 58:6)
The call of the hour is immediate unified action.
We are certain that there are many Christians and non-Christians alike, who believe a change of attitude is essential if we are to safeguard the dignity of women and children, and uphold the right to life. We invite them all to join us in working together, along with the Church and the government in achieving this change.
