Sensitivity and creativity of Alun Lewis

A few months ago, I was in Wales as a visitor to a family known to us. Though I was aware of some of the Welsh writers of fame I could not get a glimpse of the best poets who were outstanding and influenced new trends in creative writing, perhaps globally.
The Welsh family members in turn paid a visit to us in Sri Lanka during the pre-New Year period. The head of the Welsh family gave me a precious gift.
It was titled as 'Collected Poems of Alun Lewis' about whom I wrote an introductory note in these columns sometime back. Now I am getting to know more about the poet.
As edited and collected by Cary Archard, collected Poems of Alun Lewis, which brings closer to Wales in the cross cultural process and from a wider perspective, the humanistic themes of a wartime poet who served as a soldier in India as well. Archard notes that it was an arduous task to collect all poems of Lewis. This was mainly due to the restless life he had spent. During the wartime, nearly all of Lewis' poems were written between September 1939 and January 1944, and practically all of them were written on active service. They were not simply a record of his war service, but a young man's struggle to make sense of all that was happening to him. To begin with, in his soldier training in England and then his journey closer to the theatre of war in India.
As Archald states, he was especially preoccupied with the conflict between the creative act of writing poetry and what he saw as the brutalising and destructive nature of soldiering. An example could be drawn as follows from the collection.
The poem is titled as 'Monologue'.Mother, will you come and kiss away my fear,Every night like this nightYes, I will come, my dear.Tomorrow - do not cry -Flowers I will bringAnd our secret lullabyIn your ears I will singNow sleep, hard shines the moon,And I must goYour narrow bed will soonBe whole with snow.
For Lewis, it is said that the gift of poetry was a heavy responsibility. He wanted to get things right in the sense of being true to that gift. It is believed that Lewis had consulted one of the leading poets of the day, Robert Graves, famed for his Greek Myths translated into English and original English poems written based on Greek sources. 'Nightingale' is one example.
In this compilation, the reader comes across three main sections. First, Lewis' maiden collection titled as 'Raiders'. Second, the collection titled as 'Ha Ha! Among the Trumpets: poems in Transit'. Third, 'Uncollected Poems'. The first section is subdivided into 1. Poems in Khaki 2. Poems in Love 3. Songs 4. On Old Themes.
The second section envelopes quite a number of poems written while serving in India. As a sensitive poet, he tries to observe and jot down the areas of an alien culture in places such as Bombay, Poona and Maharashtra.
Alun Lewis is no more. Some of his works have appeared later as posthumous publications. In 1946, 'Letters from India' (edited by Gweno Lewis and Gwyn Jones). In 1948, 'In the Green Tree', a collection of short stories appeared.
