Retd. Maj. Gen. Kamal Gunaratna trying to be manipulative of the facts of war: Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka

Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday said retired Major General Kamal Gunaratna is trying to plot a path to politics by being manipulative of the facts of war.He said,” he is yearning to become the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army with the support of the Rajapaksa family. I must warn him that the Rajapksas are going to knock him down and he is never going to get it.”
Field Martial Fonseka was speaking at a press conference at Government Information Department in Narahenpita yesterday.
Fonseka said,” Major General Kamal Gunaratna who commanded a regiment under my command during a certain period of the war, had said that he played a malor role during the war and it was because of that leadership that the war was ended with success.”
“But, he had not specified what kind of leadership role he played,” he stressed.
“Legally and customarily, the true leadership descends from one’s senior officers in the Army. No army officer can take orders from outsiders or any political authorities other than from his senior officer in command,” he explained.
“This officer had said he had got a leadership and it was due to his leadership that the war was concluded successfully. This is the sort of thing that an Army officer can never say because every officer in the Army takes orders from their senior officers,” Fonseka said. He said,” An army officer cannot take orders that come through the backdoor of some Secretary or persons engaged in politics.”
“Gunaratna owes an explanation,” he said, “He had spoken about sacrifices made by military personnel. He had said that 5,900 Army personnel had sacrificed their lives in the war, but that number is 5,300. A total of 500 Navy,Police and Air Force personnel had sacrificed their lives,”Field Marshal Fonseka said.
“He had said that 2,900 soldiers had sustained injures, but over 23,000 soldiers were injured during last phase of the battle”the Field Marshal said.
“He( Gunaratna ) does not know the number of soldiers who got injured and taken from the field of battle.” “Gunaratna had said around 6,000 terrorists were taken into custody and another 6,000 were hiding among the people.
This is also untrue because the number of terrorists taken into custody was 12,000.
It appears that this officer has clean forgotten what had happened in the field. “
“I still can remember every bit of it as if it happened yesterday. I think one’s dedication helps one to remember things of importance,” he said.
“He had said he is an experienced officer. I do admit that. He was at the Sillathurai camp. He was surrounded by terrorists. He was there for a week with 100 soldiers.
“I had the chance of sending backup troops to rescue him. I was servicing with the Singha Regiment at the time,” Field Marshal Fonseka said.
“Also, terrorists surrounded his camp in Mankulam. He was with 300 soldiers. He made an escape through a fence and returned with 150 soldiers. He is experienced. But, the experiences he had were mostly unpleasant.”
“He says that Army intelligence is the most valued asset in the force. He was an infantryman. According to what we have learnt the greatest asset in an armed force is infantry. It is personnel of the infantry regiments that had sacrificed the most number of lives in the battlefield- around 5,000 lives in total.”
As pointed out by Field Martial Fonseka seven or eight persons of the Army Intelligent Unit, had died in the line of duty during last phase of the war. Field Marshal Fonseka alleged that Major General Gunaratna is full of air about Intelligence Units apparently for some political pursuit. But, he is not speaking on behalf of Sri Lanka Army. “I must make mention here that those who talk a lot about Intelligence Units did not know whether such a thing existed in this country, when I took over the Army then.”
“The first thing I did after assumeing duties as the Army Commander was removing four of the intelligence officers who were there. I appointed four officers of the Infantry regiments and other regiments to the posts. We restructured the system of Army intelligence and its functions,” Field Marshal Fonseka added.
