‘Ice Age 5’makes an appearance

Since that first movie, the world has been threatened by 'The Meltdown' (2006), seen the 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs' (2009), and been through a 'Continental Drift' (2012). With 'Ice Age: Collision Course', there is now the threat of mass extinction, no thanks to the twitchy Scrat (Chris Wedge), whose shenanigans with a UFO cause a giant asteroid to start hurtling towards Earth.
The original 'herd' of Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger (Denis Leary) has also expanded to included an entire village of characters, including Manny’s wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) and daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer), Sid’s Granny (Wanda Sykes), Diego’s girlfriend Shira (Jennifer Lopez), possums Crash and Eddie (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck), and the latest addition, Peaches’ fiance Julian (Adam DeVine).
And that’s not counting Buck (Simon Pegg), the one-eyed weasel who makes a comeback here, having appeared in 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs'.
There are some new characters in this one as well – a yoga-loving llama (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a pretty ground sloth called Brooke (Jessie J) who falls in love with Sid, and three Dromaesaurs (flying dinosaurs, apparently) voiced by Nick Offerman, Stephanie Beatriz and Max Greenfield, who have a slightly skewed sense of logic when it comes to surviving the end of the world.
'Ice Age : Collision Course' in 3D will be premiered on July 22 by Ceylon Theatres at Majestic Cineplex 10.30am, 1.30pm, 4.30pm and 7.30pm Fri/Sat 10.30pm and Empire Cineplex 10.30am,1.30pm, 4.30pm 7.30pmand Fri/Sat 10.30pm
