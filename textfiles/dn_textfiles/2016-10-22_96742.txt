Honours even as Tamim leads Bangladesh fight-back

CHITTAGONG, Friday: Tamim Iqbal scored a half-century as Bangladesh made a solid start Friday in response to England’s first innings in an evenly-poised opening Test before skipper Mushfiqur Rahim was bowled just before the close.
England paceman Ben Stokes dismissed Rahim for 48, three overs before stumps in Chittagong. The hosts finished the day on 221-5, trailing England’s first innings total of 293 runs by 72.
Shakib Al Hasan, who shared a 58-run partnership with Rahim for the fifth wicket, remained unbeaten on 31 overnight along with nightwatchman Shafiul Islam, who has yet to get off the mark.
Tamim earlier top-scored with 78 for the home side, his 19th half-century and fifth against England, before he got a top edge when he attempted to cut off-spinner Gareth Batty.
Tamim, who hit seven fours, added 90 runs with Mahmudullah (38) for the third wicket to steady Bangladesh’s innings after Moeen Ali took two wickets in one over before the lunch break to rattle them.
Tamim got a reprieve at 55 through a television review after being given out just before the tea break.
Adil Rashid, who earlier dropped a tough catch of Tamim at 28 off Moeen, broke the left-handers’ partnership when he had Mahmudullah caught at slip by Joe Root. The hosts had been 29-2 at lunch after Moeen -- who scored a half-century in England’s innings -- bowled opener Imrul Kayes for 21 off his very first ball and then had Mominul Haque caught by Stokes at slip for a duck.
Earlier, 18-year-old debutant off-spinner Mehedi Hasan claimed the final wicket of Stuart Broad to finish with 6-80 as England added just 35 runs to their overnight 258-7 before they were all out. Left-arm Taijul Islam took the other two wickets that fell in the morning
in England’s innings to return with the figures of 2-47. Taijul dismissed overnight batsman Chris Woakes (36) off the first ball of the day as Mominul took the catch at forward short leg.
Adil Rashid was given out leg-before off Mehedi in the next over but the decision was overturned after a review as replays indicated the ball had been missing leg stump. Rashid made good use of his fortune to score a brisk 26 before a fine diving catch at cover by Sabbir Rahman off Taijul ended his innings. AFP
