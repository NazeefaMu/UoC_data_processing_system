CEB trade unions to continue strike until ‘favourable’ response from Minister

 
Trade unions attached to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) are to continue its strike until a ‘favourable’ response is received from the government.
CEB Trade Unions Convener Ranjan Jayalal said the strike begun on Tuesday (12) would continue today for the fourth consecutive day until their demand were met.
Discussion with the Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya on Thursday (14) had proved unsuccessful leading to the decision to continue their strike action.
The trade unions attached to the CEB are making over several demands including the revision of the salary ratio from 1:6 to 1:9.
