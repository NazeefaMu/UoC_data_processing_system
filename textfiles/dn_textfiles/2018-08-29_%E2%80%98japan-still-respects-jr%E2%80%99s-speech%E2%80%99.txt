‘Japan still respects JR’s speech’

Japanese people still respect the speech delivered by the late President, J. R. Jayewardene, at the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco in 1951 as the then Finance Minister of Sri Lanka, Pelpola Vipassi Foundation President, Japan-Sri Lanka Cultural Friendship Association President, International Pelpola Buddhist Viharaya Chief Incumbent and Chief Sangha Nayaka in Japan Ven. Pelpola Vipassi Thera yesterday said.
The people of Japan always appreciate his noble task. Japan was about to divided into several parts and it united back because of the former President’s speech, the Thera said.
The Thera was addressing a media briefing in Colombo.
The Thera said discussion are now underway with the Japanese government to include JR's speech into Japanese school textbooks.
Former President told that the hatred cannot be won by hating them and kindness is the only way to win over the hatred. "We all must support Japan to regain her sovereignty," the former President had told, the Thera recalled.
Ven. Pelpola Vipassi Thera is in Japan over 40 years striving to enhance Japan-Sri Lanka links.
The Thera said the International Pelpola Vipassi Buddhist Temple and Peace Centre in Gunma in Japan educates the Japanese people about this historic speech.
The Thera said Sri Lanka seems to be under the Chinese control but it should not become a Chinese colony. "Sri Lanka has obtained many loans from China. We have talented people and experts. What we lack is proper plans. Japanese people do not receive anything free. They know how to get maximum from their limited resources,” the Thera said.
Japanese Fujisankei Communication Group Media Advisor Hisao Sato said Ven. Pelpola Vipassi Thera has strengthened the Japanese-Sri Lanka links.
