GMOA condemns state media

Although the state media is biased, unethical and cunning, the current Cabinet Media Minister is good, but he has to control his deputy, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Editor Dr. Nalinda Herath said. Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the worst Media Minister was Mangala Samaraweera and the media was worst at that time. But now media, especially state media has fallen to a lower level than during his time.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that the GMOA is able to launch a tough strike but then a large number of patients will die. On the other hand, the main objective of the GMOA is protecting patient's lives and not letting them be destroyed by unqualified and sub standard doctors.
Changing Governments will not solve the SAITM issue. Only changing policies will solve it. GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya is a law-abiding person. The previous Government filed court cases against him. The GMOA does not make or break Governments. If anyone thinks so, something is wrong with his thinking, he said.
The GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said the conduct of the present Government is not practising good governance. Suppressing trade unions is not good governance. It is a violation of human rights.
