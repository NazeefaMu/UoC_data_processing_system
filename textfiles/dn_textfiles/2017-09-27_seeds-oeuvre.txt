Seeds of an oeuvre

Art is embedded within the diversity of man. Much of the art created in the world is not perfect nor all-encompassing. The artistic impression of any creation is found through the eye of the beholder and he or she interprets it according to his/her own perceptions and experiences in life. The difficulty in creating such pieces, however, is only known to the artist who painstakingly spends hours perfecting her art. It is one such artist that we met in Galgamuwa.
In the village of Kallanchiya in Galgamuwa lives Adhikari Mudiyanselage Lakmini Adhikari. An Arts graduate from the University of Kelaniya, she works as a development officer at the Galgamuwa Base Hospital. Her passion, however, is to pursue her art and every free time she finds, she immerses herself in it. Her talent lies in bringing to life various birds through grains of paddy.
Self-taught skills

Adhikari’s life hasn’t been easy and despite having to struggle to make ends meet, she taught herself the skills needed from an early age. She uses paddy seeds to create intricate designs of birds.
“I have been pasting various items together since I was a child. From the time I was studying in Grade 6 or 7, I used to use various varieties of seed to make such creations. It was after that I decided to create such drawings using seed paddy,” said Adhikari.
In the beginning, she chose her favourite birds to turn into art. Today, she has turned 15 varieties of birds into picture with the use of seed paddy.
“My biggest issue is finding the time to create these pieces. But every bit of time I get, I devote it to my art. Whether I find some free time at work or if I am at home, I start pasting seed onto paper,” she said.
“Many people think that pasting seed into a certain shape is not a big deal and that anyone could do it, but every picture takes a lot of patience to make and is very time-consuming. Each seed has to be pasted according to its own pattern. If you put one wrong seed with the wrong pattern in a place, you can ruin the whole picture. So we must choose every seed carefully, so that the pattern of the bird is exact; from its beak to its claw,” Adhikari added.
A painstaking process
The pasting of seeds together is thus an excruciating task and she further explained the process it took to get all the seeds down in the right prior to pasting it onto cloth.
“Firstly, I outline the picture I want on a piece of cloth. It is thereafter that I start to paste seeds on to it. There is a particular kind of glue I use for this purpose. The seeds naturally sourced from paddy which grows in the area. Certain types of seed, however, are hard to find as they have a unique colour attached to them. But when you use these different seeds, you can add great colour to the painting.
The other problem is that not all seeds can be pasted thus. I mostly use seeds of samba, nadu, suwadel, heenati for in my art. My biggest problem now however is that I am finding it very difficult to find certain types of seeds. But many people have now come forward to help me find these seeds.
When I start to paste birds, I use each variety of seed to get the exact features of the bird. The features and colours of the bird differ at its beak, head and neck. The feathers especially need an intricate design. All this have to be done with a calm mind.”
Not all, however, have the mindset or talent to achieve such intricate designs. And it not easy to develop the discipline and patience needed to perfect them.
“I have given most of my creations to my friends and they all now hang in various government offices. I have not sold any of them. Some have offered Rs. 50-60,000 for these paintings, but I don’t want to sell my creations.
I cannot put a price tag on the happiness I gain through this work. I hope to have all my creations displayed in an exhibition soon. I am working towards that,” she said.
