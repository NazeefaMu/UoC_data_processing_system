President opens vestibule for historic  Dimbulagala  Aranya  Senasanaya

President Mathripala Sirisena ceremoniously inaugurated the vestibule for the Dimbulagala Aranya Senasanaya, a primary sculptured gateway referred to as the ‘Wahalkada’, its surrounding walls and the Piriven Dharmshala building during Poson Poya.
The ‘Aranya Senasanaya’ in Dimbulagala has been a primary location for religious activity and carries historic significance and value to Sri Lankans.
The ruins of Buddhist religious structures in the Dimbulagala area are of equal significance to those in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa and is listed by the Department of Archaeology under the antiquities ordinance.
Dialog Axiata was instrumental in funding the preservation efforts of the cultural heritage site towards the development of the 50 ft. structure and its surrounding walls.
Initiated by President Mathripala Sirisena under the development project, Pibidemu Polonnaruwa, the project was supervised under the purview of the Divisional Secretariat with voluntary contribution of labour extended by the Navy and the design by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development.
