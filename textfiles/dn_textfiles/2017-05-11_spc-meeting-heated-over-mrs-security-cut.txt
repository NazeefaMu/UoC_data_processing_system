SPC meeting heated over MR's security cut

Several Joint Opposition (JO) Councillors opposed the government's alleged attempt to reduce the security detail of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when the Southern Provincial Council meeting was proceeding yesterday.
The meeting was abruptly adjourned after 45 minutes of its commencement due to the interruption.
Opposition members walked out of the chambers criticising UPFA councillors’ allegations against the government.
Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Janatha Vimikthi Peramunu and Joint Opposition members did not move out of the chamber.
As the Opposition members left the chambers, Chairman Somawansa Kodagoda adjourned the meeting to May 29.
JO councillors Ariyawansa Shammu, Chamly Withanachchi, Provincial Minister Weerasuman Weerasinghe , and Sinha Saman Kumara took part in the heated argument over MR’s security detail.
