Three-year accelerated agriculture plan mooted

The Agriculture Ministry, in collaboration with the provincial ministries of agriculture, plans to implement an accelerated agriculture development programme for the next three years, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister has instructed officials to take necessary measures to prepare the plan after discussing with provincial authorities.
Accordingly, a forum, participated by Provincial Agriculture Ministers, was held to discuss and prepare the draft plan, at the Agriculture Information Technology Institute in Gannoruwa under the patronage of Minister Amaraweera, recently.
The document of the three-year accelerated agriculture development plan is scheduled to be handed over to the President this month.
The Minister said the minimisation of post-harvest losses, introduction of new technologies, the expansion of market opportunities and the improvement of training facilities were discussed at the forum.
The plan will address the issues faced by farmers and consumers, he said.
