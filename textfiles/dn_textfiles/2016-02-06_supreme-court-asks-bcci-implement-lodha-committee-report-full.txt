Supreme Court asks BCCI to implement Lodha Committee report in full

The Supreme Court of India has asked the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to implement the recommendations of the Justice Lodha Committee in full on Thursday (February 4).
The two-judge bench comprising Chief Justice TS Thakur and Justice Ibrahim Kalifullah stated that they found no reason to disagree with the recommendations.
"BCCI should understand that this is not a second innings... it's all over," the Supreme Court judges stated."Decks must be cleared for a complete reform. The best course is to fall in line and BCCI must take a very realistic view of the matter. We find no reason to disagree with the recommendations of the committee."
Among the various recommendations made as stated in the Lodha Committee report, was the fact that the Indian cricket board must come under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, since it is performing a public function. However, the board had earlier declined the recommendations stating that it was a private body that did not use public funds.
The report had also recommended that ministers and government servants cannot occupy a position in the BCCI and a professional should be hired to run the day-to-day affairs of the cricket body.
"If you have any difficulty in implementing it we will have the Lodha Committee implement it for you," the bench stated.
The board, which has been reluctant to consider all the recommendations stating administrative complications as the issue, has said that the legal committee will meet on February 7 to discuss the issue. The court has scheduled the next hearing on March 3.
