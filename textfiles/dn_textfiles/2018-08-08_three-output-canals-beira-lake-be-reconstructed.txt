Three output canals of  Beira Lake to be reconstructed

Three output canals and gates of the Beira Lake located near the Court Complex, McCallum Gate and the Presidential Secretariat which were temporally closed will be reconstructed and opened to contain the stench which pervades the air in Colombo city, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Minister addressing a media briefing yesterday said a new project has commenced to dredge the mud and sewerage which have been blocking the Beira Lake for the past five to six decades.
Although the Beira Lake is legally owned by the Ports Authority,permission to maintain and clean its water body has been given to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation.
Colombo’s sewerage system was built during the British Colonial period,but,it has not been developed in parallel with the increase in population and other development activities in Colombo city. The sewerage system is obsolete and we hope to transform the Beira Lake from its present state to a worthy centerpiece in a revitalised city, once the project is complete,” Minister Ranawaka added.
