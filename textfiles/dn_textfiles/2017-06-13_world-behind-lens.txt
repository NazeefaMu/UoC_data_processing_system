World behind the lens

“The apex of evolution in photographic technology is capturing the ‘right moment’. It is an act of camera technology, photographer’s observation and his reflexes known as motor skills. Capability to capture the right moment shows the cameraman’s prowess whether he is old-school or represents digital era”, says veteran and renowned photographer, writer, poet and a teacher of photography, Lal Hegoda.
Hegoda’s latest photography exhibition, “Solosak Roo” (Sixteen Photographs) will be unveiled at the Lionel Wendt Art Centre on June 22. The event will be opened for the public from 23 to 25 from 10 am to 7pm.
“How can I abort the fetuses originate after all 16 photographs had been taken? So I give my fans a bonus by adding few more photographs to the exhibition”, says Hegoda. Hence the exhibition will physically showcase 22 photographs by the veteran.
Hegoda has served 47 years as a teacher of photography. He has held photography exhibitions in Colombo, Kandy, Galle and also in the United Kingdom and Tokyo. His very first exhibition (Freud’s Daughter) was held in 1971.
Lal Hegoda says there cannot be any Art without imagination. “Photography too has a technique but one should not be a slave of technique”, he says.
He adds; “Photography could also be considered as a folk art. There is a fourth dimension in human life. The photographer can make this fourth dimension visible in human minds through his works”.
Hegoda also indulges in poetry and often adds value to his innovative photographs with verses of divine touch. At the unveiling of his book ‘Lokaya Ekama Yaayaki’ (The World is one common locale) few years back which had a mix of photography and poetry he said, “People of the new world do not just look at photographs…they read photographs”.
“Hegoda sees the world through the lenses of a camera and tells us a story to take home and think”, seasoned author W A Abeysinghe said at the event. Abeysinghe said the vision, imagination, philosophy and presentation will ultimately win over technique.
Hegoda has his own philosophy on photography. “Photography is a massive external drive that preserves visionary memory. Photography thus is equivalent to a vast external drive that serves the entire world”, he says.
“The human brain stores memories as a computer encapsulates data. Memorizing means recalling old memories into the limelight of active memory, like serving data to a processor. Data stored in human brain is meant to fade off gradually. Unimportant and unused data shall be outdated and forgotten with the passage of time. However forgetting is not a complete deletion, it is merely a dwindled stage of memory. Data documented in photographs would not decay if duly preserved. A photograph can thus recall something which is already forgotten or occurred decades ago”, he elaborates.
“You can get to know how your mother looked like when she was young. Perhaps there should be an image showing her delightful face on her wedding day. How would have she looked when she was pregnant with you? Which other medium will enable you to engage in such time travel?” Hegoda ponders.
