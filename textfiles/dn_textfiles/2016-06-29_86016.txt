Proteas fall prey to Silva’s left-arm spin

Maliyadeva Kurunegala’s slow left-arm spinner Damitha Silva instigated a sensational collapse as South Africa lost their last seven wickets for 43 runs on the opening day of the second under 19 test at the Welegedara Stadium in Kurunegala yesterday.
South Africa looked set for a big first innings total when openers Ricardo Vasconcelos (53) and Joshua van Heerden (81) put on 101 for the first wicket and skipper Wisan Mulder contributed a fine half-century (63) to place them on a firm footing at 201-3.
But Silva after an unsuccessful first spell of 13 overs which yielded 39 runs without a wicket struck a double blow in the first over of his second spell and with good support from Ashen Bandara continued the decline of the South African batting to finish with figures of four for 56.
Six of the Proteas batsmen fell to leg before decisions (four to Silva) as South Africa who won the toss and batted first were dismissed for 244 by the close
