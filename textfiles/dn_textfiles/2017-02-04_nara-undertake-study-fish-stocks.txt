NARA to undertake study on fish stocks

A study on Sri Lankan fish stocks is to be undertaken for the first time by the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) to assess the country’s fisheries resources.
The last tudy was undertaken in 1982, NARA Chairman Dr. Anil Premaratne said at a media briefing at the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry yesterday. “We have observed a great reduction in the coastal fisheries industry over the last several years.
“This is due to factors such as climate change, bottom trawling, or illegal fishing methods,” Dr. Premaratne said.
He said NARA would introduce a method called ‘ocean ranching’- a type of fish farming where “juvenile fish are released into the ocean to grow unprotected and unassisted to be subsequently harvested”.
Once this is done, the NARA fish survey would be able to inform the fishermen the types of fish high in supply and those that need to be protected. "It will also increase our overall fish stocks," he said.
An MoU has been signed with Norway for the project. The NARA also developed cheap fish food and had invited industry to partner with it to produce it commercially.
A kilo of this fish can be sold at Rs. 140 compared to the imported fish food which costs Rs. 250-280 a kilo.
NARA scientists have also come up with seaweed jelly bottle at Rs. 12. This too awaits investors for commercial production.
