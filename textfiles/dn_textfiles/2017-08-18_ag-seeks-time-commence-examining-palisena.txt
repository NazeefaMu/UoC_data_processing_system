AG seeks time to commence examining Palisena

Bond Commission to convene on August 25 :
The Attorney General’s Department yesterday informed the Bond Commission that the team needed time to examine the documents produced by Kasun Palisena, the Chief Executive Officer of Perpetual Treasuries.
They pointed out that Palisena had produced a volumnous list of documents and therefore they needed time to examine the documents prior to examining Palisena.
Palisena concluded his evidence in chief yesterday after being led by Perpetual Treasuries Counsel, Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando and his private counsel Kalinga Indathissa. He was also examined by the Chanaka Silva, the Counsel for Arjun Mahendran.
 
Having heard the submissions by lead counsel for the Attorney Generals, President’s Counsel Dappula De Livera, the Commission granted August 25, to re-commence proceedings.
Accordingly, the Attorney General’s team would commence examining Palisena on August 25.
