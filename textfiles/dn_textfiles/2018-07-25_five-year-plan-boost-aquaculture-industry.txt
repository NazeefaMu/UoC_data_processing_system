Five-year plan to boost aquaculture industry

State Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi yesterday pledged to implement a five-year plan to develop the country’s aquaculture industry as the major foreign exchange earner of the country.
The state minister yesterday instructed the National Aquaculture Development Authority of Sri Lanka (NAQDA) to take immediate measures to prepare the plan. The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has already taken measures to make the aquaculture and fish food processing industries the two main national production industries of the country.
The five-year plan will be implemented in line with this programme of generating more employment opportunities and income.
