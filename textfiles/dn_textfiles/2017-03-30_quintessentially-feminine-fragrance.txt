A Quintessentially feminine fragrance

The Body Shop's British Rose was launched in celebration of the skincare retailer's 40th anniversary.
From The Body Shop's well celebrated legacy of ethical sourcing to the freshest high quality roses grown in an award winning farm by horticultural experts, the British Rose range is uniquely and unabashedly English. "Roses are inextricably linked with the British identity," states The Body Shop Beauty Botanist Jennifer Hirsch in a press release. "The unique blend is extracted from English roses selected for their complexity of fragrance, perfectly capturing the experience of sinking your nose into one of these fragrant flowers," she adds.
The roses come from a farm in Herefordshire, England and are grown by farmers passionate about the land. Carefully plucked by hand, these Herefordshire roses are treated carefully onsite to extract exceptional quality rose essence to form the base for The British Rose range.
Inspired by the demure, yet stunning deep red and pink hues of the rose, The Body Shop experts have also created a range of new Lip and Cheek Stains for 12 hours of hydration for all skin tones. Enriched with Community Trade honey and 100% organic Community Trade aloe vera, the lightweight formula adds a non-drying, comfortable and long lasting colour to the lips and cheeks. The Special Edition British Rose Eye and Cheek Palette features dusky hues and rosy tones for a touch of colour that can be built on from day to night.
