Help the Red Pandas and enhance your beauty!

With every purchase of the Himalayan Charcoal Purifying Mask and Soap in its Sri Lankan stores, The Body Shop will direct a portion of the sale price to the Red Panda Network- a global conservation network committed to protecting the world’s declining red panda population.
The Body Shop chose the Red Panda Network for the ground-breaking research and conservation activities it conducts in Eastern Nepal- an endeavour that resonates strongly with the brand’s own commitment to ethically sourcing the charcoal for its products from the foothills of the Himalayas. The Red Panda Network is committed to the conservation of wild red pandas and their habitat through the education and empowerment of local communities. The organization was founded by hiking enthusiast Brian Williams following a hiking trip in the Himalayas, where he learnt about the endangered population of red pandas in the world (currently estimated to be about 2000). He formed the organization to raise awareness on the plight of these pandas and to continue the fight to help these creatures survive and thrive in the wild.
Every purchase of The Body Shop’s Himalayan Charcoal Purifying Mask and Soap will mean that a portion of its marked price will be directed to the Red Panda Network. Specifically, these proceedings will fund the planting of as many bamboo trees as possible in the Himalayan wilds- a simple but effective way to ensure that Red Panda populations have an important element of their diet in abundance in order to thrive.
The 100% vegan Himalayan Charcoal Purifying Mask and Soap utilize beauty culture’s hottest new super ingredient to deep cleanse and purify skin for an extra special glow. The mask is a popular product in The Body Shop stores around the world; it uses charcoal to draw out impurities and excess oils from the skin, antioxidant-rich green tea to exfoliate and Community Trade organic tea tree oil from Kenya for clearer skin.
The mask is part of a range of The Body Shop products harnessing recipes of nature. The British Rose Fresh Plumping Mask is a refreshing gel mask infused with natural ingredients such as rose petals, aloe vera and rosehip oil to quench and re-plump skin. The Ethiopian Honey Deep Nourishing Mask melds organic honey with cold-pressed marula oil and organic olive oil for intense replenishment. The Chinese Ginseng and Rice Clarifying Polishing Mask removes dullness and unevenness, while the Amazonian Acai Energizing Radiance Mask infused with acai berry extract, Guarana seed extract and organic babussu oil is for skin that needs a super-fast recharge. Add to this the Japanese Matcha Mask enriched with matcha green tea and dandelion extract, and the collection of expert masks for city living is complete.
