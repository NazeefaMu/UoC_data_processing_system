President should be hailed for bold decision - Ven.Elle Gunawansa Thera

All Sri Lankans have a responsibility to protect President Maithripala Sirisena, who took a serious political decision for the sake of the country, Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera said.
He said both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa have a sound knowledge on the roots of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party as they are sons of 1956.Therefore, they need not be taught about the country, race, or religion, he said.
Speaking to media after a religious ceremony yesterday in Colombo, Ven.Gunawansa also appreciated the sacrifice made by the President and said the new Constitution, that was attempted to be brought should be discarded. He said that the resources in the country should be used within the country itself without giving them to foreigners and emphasised the importance of a programme to achieve that purpose.
Ven. Gunawansa also urged that action be taken to prevent the destruction of archeologically important sites and also called on the new PM to uplift the country’s economy through a national policy.
