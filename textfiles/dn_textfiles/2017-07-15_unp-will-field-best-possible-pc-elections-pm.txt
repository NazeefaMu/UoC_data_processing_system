UNP will field the best possible at PC elections - PM

The United National Party will select the best qualified team of candidates to contest in the Provincial Council election due in December, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
PM Wickremesinghe was chairing the UNP working committee which was held at Sirikotha yesterday.
UNP Working Committee has taken a decision to appoint Ministers Kabir Hashim and Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to carry out the election campaign at the grassroot level. Priority will be given to select the most qualified candidates as the representatives of the UNP, it was said.
The media campaign for the election will be handled by Ministers Mangala Samaraweera and Imtiaz Bakeer Markar.
The Working Committee also took a decision to limit criticisms levelled against the government within the party level only. A committee was appointed to take disciplinary action against Provicial Councillor Anuradha Wimalaratne who did not participate in the last UNP May Day rally.
It also took decisions regarding an exhibition which will be held on July 27 at the Maharagama Youth Center commemorating the PM’s 40 years in politics.
