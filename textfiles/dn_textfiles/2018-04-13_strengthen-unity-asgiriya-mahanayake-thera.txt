Strengthen unity:  Asgiriya Mahanayake Thera

All ethnicities should celebrate the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, strengthening the unity between various communities which existed for a long period, said Asgiriya Chapter Mahanayake Most Ven Warakagoda Gnanaratana Thera.
The Thera, in his message marking the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, observed that the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities have lived for thousands of years in a cordial manner, while they managed to settle sporadic conflicts among communities amicably without allowing them to spread across the country.
The Thera said there is a group that attempts to claim that there are conflicts between communities by highlighting isolated incidents which affect all ethnicities.
The Thera pointed out that the Sinhala and Tamil New Year falls on the same day and the two communities share similar customs. The Thera added that this feature is helpful in building national unity. He wished all communities a happy New Year that would fulfill their aspirations.
