An ideal human being

As a result of a series of discussions ensued between two scholars in India, there resulted a compendium of five brilliant research papers on the concept of man. The year happened to be 1995, and the two scholars Dr Sarvapalli Radahkrishnan and Dr P T Raja of Rajasthan University, Jodhpur in India. The concept of Man embraces five topics covered by the various aspects of human existence which goes as The Concept of Man in Great Thought as researched by Professor John Wild of Harvard University, USA, The Concept of Man in Jewish Thought, as researched by Professor A J Heschel of the Jewish Theological Seminary, New York, The Concept of Man in Chinese Thought by Professor W T Chan of Dartmouth University, The Concept of Man in Indian Though by Dr P T Rajan and in conclusion a summary of comparisons and reflection on the selected topics that go as the concept of the ideal man, the man, and nature man at society.
The reader gets a chance to obtaining a glimpse of the concept of man in the human existence. As the learned scholar at the outset points out, the Commonwealth of humanity has no written constitution, it is based on community of ideals, freedom and dignity of the individual, rule of law, economic opportunity for all citizens and love and peace. Radhakrishnan traces the various standpoints of human evolution in order to demarcate the concept of the accepted concept and thought and brought down the centuries human evolution.
The preparatory remarks of Radhakrishnan adds light to the articles that follow in the understanding of social, political and spiritual aspect of the man as a living being over a short span of life. The scholar Radhakrishnan attempts to uncover the genesis of such concepts of democracy, autocracy and aristocracy as against the various governing rules of law extended by the east during his life span.
In the research of John Wild on t eh concept of man in Greek though, a survey of view follows on the teachings of such thinkers as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle down the centuries. The influence of the thinking f these three thinkers had spread around the work to the extent that the same teachings have implanted a sense of existence in most countries in the research by A J Heschel on the concept of man in Jewish Thought, much material is drawn from his own three works which appeared as pioneer insights on the topic. They are ‘Man is not alone’, ‘Man’s quest for God’, and ‘God in search of Man’. The most significant area in the research is the response to the head of god and the paradox of divine concern. Both centre round the man’s quest for a better sense of living as against all conditions and cruelties that make the man miserable. It is debatable, whether the god could be believe as helpful or not whether the man could gain any higher standard of living via the praying conditions to god. Whatever it is the belief centres round quite a number of human standpoint.
W T Chan in his survey on the concept of man in Chinese thought states at the outset that whether a Chinese or a Confucisionist or a Taoist a conservative or a radical scholar or an illiterate he is a humanist. To him, man is the measure of all things. Man is made to believe in himself and not on any power struggle that lay beyond. As such initially an attempt is made to depict how the man becomes a strong image in his own living tradition and culture. While drawing material from quite a number of ancient Chinese songs, the scholar Chan drives a strong point on the man as the strongest and most knowledgeable living creations on the earth. This is followed by the concept of man in Indian thought by Dr Rajan. The scholar goes to the distant past to trace the standpoint of man in such civilizations as Mohendajaro at Indus valley bringing to light various factor pertaining to the topic, which cover the man in Vedic concept, Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. The scholar Rajan tries to expose the image of man as taught by the Buddha in his sermons mostly retraced by later monks.
In Tripitaka, he compares the image of man as taught by the Buddha as the best example of creativity and skill that are born as a result of one’s own diligence as perseverance, unsurpassable from other points of view. In conclusion he states that the missionary real of Buddhism had vision to the point that it resulted in the Bodhisatta ideal, the supreme state of the concept of the man in existence.
The man in Bodhisatva has to perform certain purifications called Paramita in order to achieve the highest goal in the existence.
In the concluding chapter titled as Comparisons and Reflections, the reader is made to feel that the concept of man as laid down by the greatest philosophers of the world go to state the dictum that goes as ‘Man, know thyself’.
This may be said to be the first advice of all human traditions.
