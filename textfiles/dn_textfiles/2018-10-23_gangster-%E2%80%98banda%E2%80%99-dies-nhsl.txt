Gangster ‘Banda’ dies at NHSL

The underworld gang member ‘Banda’, who was critically injured following a shootout with police October 4 at Oruwala, Athurugiriya, had died while receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital (NHSL) yesterday.
The suspect was said to be a close associate of underworld figures such as ‘Makandure Madush’ and ‘Angoda Lokka’.
‘Banda’ was suspected to be the main organiser of Madush’s father’s funeral, where a private helicopter was used to rain flower petals over the funeral procession. Madush, an underworld gang leader, is said to be in hiding overseas.
