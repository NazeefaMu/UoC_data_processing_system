Govt to pay  Rs. 1,000 b in  debt for two years

The government is to pay a Rs. 1,000 billion debt in the coming two years, which was acquired by the previous Rajapaksa regime.
This was revealed at the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue, yesterday. The amount does not include foreign debts due in these years.
It was also revealed that Rs. 600 billion worth bonds are maturing by 2018, and Rs.400 billion worth bonds are expected to mature by 2019. These short term bonds have been issued in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Out of these bonds, there are three medium term bonds issued in 2003 which are to mature in 2018 as well.
“For Sri Lanka’s economy, the coming two years would be like a new moon day,” it was observed at the Commission.
These revelations came when Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva was leading evidence at the Commission yesterday. De Silva was questioning former Deputy Governor Dr. W.A. Wijewardena on the reckless manner in which Treasury Bonds have been issued by the Public Debt Department.
Dr. Wijewardena agreed when de Silva suggested that there has been no management of debt on the part of the Public Debt Department when issuing short term bonds of large volumes, without thinking as to how they would pay back when matured.
Dr. Wijewardena agreed when suggested that the total national debt amounted to US $ 11 trillion. He said, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had publicly disclosed this information previously as well.
Representing former Governor Arjun Mahendran, Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva produced documents containing details of the maturity profile of Sri Lankan Rupee bonds as of April 2017.
Dr. Wijewardena answered in the affirmative when asked if the CBSL and the former Finance Minister had close communication regarding the debt management particulars.
De Silva also pointed out that under the previous regime, the Director of Treasury Operations Department had stopped coming to board meetings, to which Dr. Wijewardena said the action was extremely undesirable.
De Silva asked Dr. Wijewardena if he believed that all the above mentioned Treasury Bonds have been issued before the Domestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC) had met and discussed the government requirement and other market conditions, to which the latter said it seemed to be the case.
Dr. Wijewardena also expressed his assent when de Silva suggested that the DDMC and the PDD have failed to execute their responsibilities in managing public debt.
Had not the DDMC met before the issuing of Treasury Bonds in past years, the single handed decision of issuance, interest rate and coupon rate must have been decided by an individual officer in the Public Debt Department, de Silva suggested.
“We might have to get a clarification in this regard. I am not in a position to agree or disagree regarding the suggestion.” Dr. Wijewardena said to the Commission.
Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva drew the attention of the Commission that it was in a backdrop where Public Debt Department had not executed its responsibilities, that his client Arjun Mahendran took office as the Governor of the Central Bank in January 2015.
