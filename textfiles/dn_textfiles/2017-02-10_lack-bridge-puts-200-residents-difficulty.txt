Lack of bridge puts 200 residents into difficulty

Nearly 200 families in the villages of Karnuggala and Pahalagama are facing inconvenience due to the lack of a bridge across the Ellawala Ganga at the Metihakka landing site.
They said they have to wade through water to cross the river to attend their daily work and other errands. During high tide, they have to traverse a devious two mile route to reach their destinations as crossing the river is difficult and dangerous. Although preparations were made earlier to build a bridge across this spot, the move stopped after completing the surveying work.
