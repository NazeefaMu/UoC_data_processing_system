‘Stoned Alone’  is a spin-off of  ‘Home Alone’

If you’re a fan of the popular 90s comedy franchise ‘Home Alone’, which starred actor Macaulay Culkin as the young lead Kevin, you’ll be happy to know that Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds is planning come up with a riff of the film.
The ‘Deadpool’ actor’s next project, titled ‘Stoned Alone’, revolves around a 20-something stoner, who misses his flight for a holiday ski trip and then gets high. In that state, he starts believing that people are breaking into his house and realises that actual burglars have actually broken into the house.
Just like Kevin in the ‘Home Alone’ films, the lead in ‘Stoned Alone’ also attempts to battle the burglars and teach them a lesson, with rather creative attacks. This R-rated comedy will be directed by Augustine Frizzell from from a script by Kevin Burrows and Matt Mider. As of now, the cast of the film has not yet been finalised and it’s yet to be seen if Reynolds will be a part of the film. Currently, the actor is working on the upcoming mystery comedy ‘Detective Pikachu’ which revolves around the kidnapping of a teenager’s father, and the young boy is then forced to team up with Pikachu in order to find him.
