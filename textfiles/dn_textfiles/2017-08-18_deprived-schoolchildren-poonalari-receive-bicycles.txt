Deprived schoolchildren in Poonalari receive bicycles

The National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry provided 85 bicycles to the schoolchildren of Mulankavil Maha Vidyalayam and Nallur Maha Vidyalayam in Poonalari Divisional Secretariat to avoid dropouts and increase school attendance, National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy said.
Schoolchildren are experiencing difficulties in attending schools due to transport problems, according to the secretary. The programme was launched on the request made by the Principals and the Divisional Secretary, on the advice of the Northern and Eastern Provinces Development Committee functioning under the guidance of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The ministry has also taken action to provide transport services for schoolchildren through the Transport Ministry and National Transport Commission. These initiatives are part of the reconciliation efforts and fulfilling of Sustainable Development Goals to increase access to primary and secondary schools in conflict-affected poverty-stricken areas, said the Ministry Secretary.
The event was participated by Mavai Senathirajah, MP and Chairman, Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee and others.
