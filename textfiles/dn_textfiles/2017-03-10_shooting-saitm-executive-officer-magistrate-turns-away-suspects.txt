Shooting at SAITM Executive Officer: Magistrate turns away  suspects

Two persons, including a former regional politician, who came before Thulhiriya Magistrate U. Suhudurugoda to surrender to Court claiming responsibility for the recent shooting incident involving SAITM Executive Officer Sameera Senaratne were turned away by the Magistrate who said he had no judicial powers to remand them.
The duo including former UPFA member of the Kaduwela Pradeshiya Sabha Aruna Lakmal Thushara (41) and Sunil Udayakumara (42) of Gonagama, Kaduwela left court with their lawyers. The lawyers told court that their clients came with them to surrender to court. They said as there were rumours that Police were planning to arrest their clients they came to court after hiding in a friend’s house in Dorawake, Warakapola. They requested the Magistrate to order their arrest and send them to remand custody. The Magistrate who turned down the lawyers’ request said he had no judicial powers to order them to be remanded.
