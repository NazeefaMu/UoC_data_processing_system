Bandara asks Lakshman Yapa to correct his figures

UNP Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said Public Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena should correct the figures in his calculation over the Treasury Bond issue.
“He, while addressing the media had said that the loss of the Treasury Bond issue exceeds Rs.1 trillion. It cannot be such an amount. Then he should come before the media and correct figures,” Bandara said.
MP Bandara was addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday.
He said that UNP Parliamentarians have requested the President to appoint five more Presidential Commissions to inquire into five mega scale frauds and corruption that took place during the last regime. “However, we have not yet decided these five,” he said.
When asked he said that the UNP Parliamentarians met the Prime Minister on Thursday to seek his assistant to expedite the process of taking legal action against mega scale frauds and corruption that took place during the last regime.
He said that UNP Parliamentarians may protest opposite the Atterney General’s Department urging that investigations into these mega scale frauds, corruption and monetary misconducts be expedited.
