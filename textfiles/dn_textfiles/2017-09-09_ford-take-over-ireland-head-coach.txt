Ford to take over as Ireland head coach

Graham Ford is set to take over as Ireland's head coach in December, when the incumbent John Bracewell's contract comes to an end. Ford, the 56-year-old former South African first-class cricketer, has signed a three-year deal with Cricket Ireland.
In June, Ford ended his second stint as Sri Lanka's head coach, stepping down after 15 months of a tenure that was originally scheduled to stretch until the end of the 2019 World Cup. His first stint lasted from 2012 to 2014. Before that, he had served as South Africa's head coach from 1999 to 2002. He has also worked with Dolphins (formerly Natal) in South African domestic cricket, and Kent in England.
“I am really excited to be a part of this new era in Irish cricket,” Ford said. “I have always enjoyed working with decent people and, in their attitude, character and camaraderie, the Irish cricketers have always come across as such.
“With my knowledge and experience I believe I can genuinely make a difference. All my efforts will be dedicated to assisting the players to improve and achieve their full potential while playing an enjoyable brand of cricket.”
