Story of a strong-willed way

Book reviews:
Title: Golden Rays on the Dark Moon
Author: Jayantha Mangala Rajapakse
Jayantha Mangala Rajapakse’s work is not just an autobiography. The book, highly edifying and informative, is a ‘rags-to-riches’ story of a son of the soil from Galle, the South of Sri Lanka, who, in his own words, is “a person who became rich through a dint of perseverance.” This richly readable book, written in a great literary style, is a must-read for any budding entrepreneur.
From the halcyon days of the 1950s, just after the country gained independence from our colonial masters, as the book describes, the author’s childhood in the village of Urawatte, his education, the insurgency of 1971 when the Island was plunged into bloody chaos for the first time in contemporary history, his work for the Government and a multinational organization, financial struggles and mastering daunting challenges, deeply woven into the story of his teenage love affair, in which, unlike in many such histories, ended in success.
This beautifully written book, awakening nostalgic memories of a peaceful Island of simple and unpretentious folk, is permeated with the author’s deep adherence to Buddhism, according to which he always fashioned his path.
The way he writes about his partings from loved ones at various points of his life where he was compelled to go abroad, brings about a pang to readers. The reader is compelled to identify with the author in his endeavours and be mesmerised to keep on turning the pages, to find out how everything turned out.
Among many entrepreneurs from the South of Sri Lanka who made successes of their lives and enriching those of many others, this is an enlightening and motivating book, highlighting the author’s way of thinking, “Where there is a will, there is a way,” his indomitable courage in the face of adversity and perseverance. Neatly printed in a very readable form by Vijitha Yapa Publications, this is a book every budding and even successful entrepreneur should peruse and it is valuable reading for school children as well who aspire to be successful entrepreneurs some day.
