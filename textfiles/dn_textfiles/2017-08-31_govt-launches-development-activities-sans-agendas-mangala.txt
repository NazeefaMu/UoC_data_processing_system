Govt launches development activities sans agendas: Mangala

Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said development activities of the previous regime were limited only to propaganda but the present regime is engaging in genuine development without any political agenda.
The Minister was addressing a meeting following the opening of the Uda Gammana at Bedigamtota in Suriyawewa. He was accompanied by Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa. The minister said the present regime inaugurated a period of transition in the country that was conducive to the people while the previous regime did everything possible to fatten the economy of the rulers. Today, the people live in peace and harmony sans fear psychosis. That is what was expected from the present regime, he said. The minister said the present regime took over the country along with ‘three heaps of garbage’. Corruption is one heap of garbage which had spread up to the Presidential level. The second is the allegation regarding human rights. The third is the country’s debt, he said.
The minister added that the previous regime shot to death those who sought drinking water and made journalists disappear when they wrote against the regime. Those in the administration had allegations of human rights violations.The present regime under President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe saved the country from such allegations by the international community.
The minister said the previous regime set up a seaport sans ships, an airport sans planes, an international playground sans cricketers and an international convention hall sans conventions to gain a large amount of commissions. The previous regime did not concentrate on the day to day requirements of the less fortunate, down-trodden people, the Minister added.
