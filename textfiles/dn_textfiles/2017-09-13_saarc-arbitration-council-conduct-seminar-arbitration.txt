The Seminar will be held on September 23, 2017 in Kandy at Sinhaputhra Finance PLC Auditorium. It will be organized by Thusantha Wijemanna, the Director General of SARCO, who has been a much sought after speaker at Banking and Finance company seminars since the early 1990s.
The Chief guest will be K. Kanag Isvaran P.C. who may be known as "The father of Arbitration in Sri Lanka" a distinguished senior lawyer who has written widely on the subject, including publishing the only available book on this procedure in Sri Lanka.
Speakers at this seminar will be an Judge of the High Court Judge, K. Kanag Isvaran PC, Mohan Weerakoon PC, Kaushalya Nawaratne, Attorney-at-Law, Thusantha Wijemanna Director General SARCO, Ravana Wijeyeratne, Managing Director Sinhaputhra Finance PLC, Faazaan Mirza, SARCO.
This seminar is suited for CEOs, Heads of Legal and Heads of recoveries of Banks, Finance Companies, and other large companies saddled with debt recovery as a central concern.
Many companies over the years have used arbitration as a speedier method of debt recovery. Since by and large Arbitration takes care of the trial stage at the locations and frequency of sittings desired by the parties, this otherwise long drawn out process can be reduced to less than three months.
In finality as it also ends up as an enforcement of the arbitral award from the High Court, it is deemed more powerful than a district court judgement. Some institutions have had more success than others in using arbitration.
However, it is generally not the preferred choice of the legal fraternity. Yet even within lawyers there is much debate that the method could be beneficial to their profession in the long run and certainly to instill confidence in the legal system that is currently regarded as a very time consuming process. Regardless of this debate, it is undoubtedly an area that one can all learn more about.
