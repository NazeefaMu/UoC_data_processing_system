Towards a quality Police Service

When I see the headlines of most of today’s (03/10/2018) leading newspapers, I feel very sad and disgusted, about the plight of the Police whose reputation has taken a beating recently. When we joined the police, as young Sub-Inspectors, in the early 70s it was with so much pride and hope, we joined this very elite organisation which was respected by the society.
The British had really brought so much discipline and command into the system that encouraged youngsters especially outstanding sportsman in that era, from respectable family backgrounds, to join as officers. Only a very limited number of personnel were taken. But due to various factors including terrorism, insurgency and political influence, there was a transformation in the Police. Various governments made attempts to revitalize the Police, but none of them was able to resurrect this most important Government establishment which has deteriorated from top to bottom.
Today the IGP has been identified as a joker. This is not the kind of certificate one would associate with the Police. It is so sad how this situation has deteriorated to this abysmal level. We as Sub-Inspectors at one time were so proud to wear the uniform and we were respected at all forums. I still remember as young officers how our seniors, conducted themselves in courts with leading lawyers and came out with flying colours and how they tackled some of the brilliant cases.
There was no assistance from the Attorney General’s Department and various other associations. These Inspectors, HQIs prepared meticulously for court dates, getting up very early in the morning about 4.00 a.m. to prepare their notes. It was amazing to witness. Since it is unfair to mention names, there were officers who were better than any President’s Counsellors at that time. The Kirambakanda case, Turf Club robbery, Matthew Peiris case and many other cases can be quoted. But, there again it is not fair to pick a few.
Strength to the people
Where did we go wrong is the question. When the Head of the Department is unable to hold onto his position and the status that he supposed to maintain, having a Police Commission or Constitutional Council is of no use. It is quality leadership that can produce results. It is a pity the people in command has not realized and identified how we defeated the most brutal terrorist organisation in the world.
This was possible purely because there was no political interference where operations were concerned. It was the task of the professionals to decide and handle situations and today it is not so. You can see how politicians are protecting the culprits - it is obvious when you follow a news conference. Why can’t the Police make use of that experience to strengthen the society, law & order, security and give strength to the people of this country with correct people occupying the correct positions?
Get experts to train the police and other specialized units like STF, Narcotics and Criminal Intelligence Units. Surely the diplomatic missions will come forward to assist in the same way they did in the past to strengthen the STF, NIB etc.
Although I do not wish to pick any former IGP specifically, since I had the privilege of directly working under some of the respected IGPs like Stanley Senanayake, Ana Seneviratne, Rudra Rajasingham and Cyril Herath, I learnt what leadership is.
Political leadership
I studied how they handled various difficult situations, challenges, and upheld the position of the IGP. It is true you need the support of the political leadership, but they knew that they were professionals and also needed their professional knowledge and experience for the politicians to strengthen their position.
Thus they never made any decision that would affect the Police department in the long run.
Ana Seneviratne was once told by the President at that time to remove an OIC from Nuwara Eliya district (Ragala) as the Minister in charge of the district was very angry since he has assaulted one of his Junior Politicians. The President implied that he would not be able to work in that district. The IG did immediately remove him from that station, which was an E grade station, only to post him to an A3 station which is a higher rank.
As for Cyril Herath, when the Political leadership wanted an officer promoted as a policy he did not agree because he had a valid reason and refused to do so. Since the political leadership insisted that he should promote their nominee, the IG tendered his resignation. That was the quality of the officers we served under.
We never had IGPs using slang language in public or singing and dancing on the stage in uniform. If we knew that this was the future standard of the police I do not think many of us would have ever thought of joining the Police service.
There are so many things that the police can do especially to strengthen the community, ensure harmony in society and win the confidence of the people even at this late stage.
We need somebody with vision to carefully analyze what really went wrong for the department to go down to these depths, because discipline is the key factor to produce results.
I only hope there will be a day police officers once again earn respect like in the olden days by the society as the guardians of the nation.
