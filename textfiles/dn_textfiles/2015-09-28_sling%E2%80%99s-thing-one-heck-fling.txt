The sling’s the thing for one heck of a fling!

Pssst! Over here, boys! Don’t tell spoilsport adults, but the catapult could soon be making a comeback! The humble slingshot has been a fixture among boys across cultures and across generations. For us baby boomers any boy who did not own a sling was considered a sissy.
I noticed new versions of the toy are being marketed as a way to encourage boys to make contact with their inner Dennis the Menace image. My brother Denis whose name is spelt with a single ‘n’ was far more menacing than his comic book counterpart as a kid.
The Dennis of fiction was depicted as just a normal five and half year old, realistically thoughtless and reckless for his age. His status as a ‘menace’ was entirely due to the unforeseen consequences of his adventures and Dennis was usually responsible and mature enough to own up when he realised he’d done something wrong.
Incidentally, the sibling Denis was around the same age as the American cartoonist Hank Ketcham’s pint-sized hero when he first hit the news-stands. It was synchronously a sort of unexpected phenomenon. However, it did occur and in a universe as big as ours strange coincidences are bound to happen.
Now some six decades later, brother Denis says he is relieved that ‘slingers’ have the promise of making a comeback despite parental safety regulations that are destroying childhood. The Yanks call these weapons slingshots but we called them ‘cattys’ or ‘catapults,’ while in the local Sinhala vernacular they were referred to as ‘catapols’.
The comic book Dennis was the archetypal badly behaved schoolboy with a touch of innocence that appealed to readers. I must admit that my brother Denis, the bother of my life, was far more anarchical in his outlook. Besides, if the truth be told, I was no cherubic angel either, not by a long sling shot.
In similarity to the fictional brat you could picture us little bounders roaming the range of shrub land with handmade catapults dangling from our back pants pockets. Our side pockets bulged with rounded pebbles we used as ammunition when we set our sights on a tempting target. Actually glass marbles were more effective projectiles but too precious to sling away at worthless targets.
Like the gunslingers of the old wild West we were equipped and ready to draw and fire at a split second’s notice. Through constant practice we developed the necessary muscle, memory and instinctive aim for taking fast shots as they presented themselves. Make no mistake about it catapults are weapons. There is no gainsaying the fact that they could be lethal as well. Now I am certain that many protective and unadventurous parents may wonder why our parents let their kids wander around armed and dangerous!
In mitigation I can say that they could never be considered responsible for our actions because we manufactured our own weaponry at absolutely no cost. The lethal aspect was determined by the choice of ammo one selected. And our parents were never truthfully apprised of the lethality of the projectiles.
Obviously, common sense is required whenever you use a catapult, and serious injuries can occur if they are misused. That bit of advice was drummed into our heads with repetitive regularity. Other warnings included, always ensure that you have a safe backstop to catch the projectiles during target practice and always treat a catapult in the same way as you would treat a gun. Never point it at anyone.
Still like all good hunters we used different calibre ammo for different targets. Big round pebbles were fair for targeting rats. But two-legged rats deserved less deadly missiles such as hard, green jam fruits.
Nonetheless, it was the type of ammo whose zing caused a nasty sting, to prompt tattle-tale victims to scream out the common painful epithet, ‘Budu Ammo!’ - which has nothing to do with ammo!
During the vacations, when my brothers Denis, Lance and countless cousins such as Arlen, Ralph and Bambi came to visit, we would organise ‘war games’. We divided ourselves into teams and used these hard jam fruits to stock our armouries with before the battles began. And what pitched battles they were! We unleashed broadside after broadside of improvised shot and shell at one another amid a cacophony of war-whoops and painful yelps.
During our time catapults were traditionally made using a forked tree branch and two bands of bicycle rubber inner tubing to provide the spring for projectiles. You also needed a piece of soft leather for the pellet pouch – for which old shoe tongues were the ideal material. The best wood for catapult handles were found in hedgerows. The ultimate choice for a handle was a forked ‘Y’ shaped branch with ‘U’ or ‘V’shaped arms of equal diameter. The handle, or ‘karu’ in local parlance, should be thick enough to provide a good grip. Goda kaduru or the poisonous bitter nut tree provided the ideal wood for the purpose. It is also best to allow the wood to season for a few months. But in a survival situation green wood will work fine.
The catapult is held and used in a similar way to an archery bow. The projectile in its leather pouch is held between the folded index finger and thumb of your right hand. Occasionally when practicing you will hit your hand when it shoots forward, this hurts, but serves as a good reminder to hold the catapult straight next time.
