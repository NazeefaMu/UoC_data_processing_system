Rajinikanth evades questions on Sri Lankan Tamils

 
Refraining from commenting on any issue related to Sri Lankan Tamils, superstar Rajinikanth evaded question on Mullivaikkal Remembrance Day today, which is observed by Sri Lankan Tamils.
The day is regarded by Sri Lankan Tamils as a remembrance for those, who died in the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War.
Earlier in March, Rajini called off his proposed visit to Sri Lanka to inaugurate a housing scheme following opposition from Tamil fringe groups.
"VCK chief Thirumavalavan and MDMK chief Vaiko urged me not to visit Sri Lanka. I accepted their request because of cordial relationship," Rajinikanth said.
The decision came after he met with opposition from pro-Tamil outfits in his state.
Rajinikanth was to participate in a charity event, slated to take place on April 9.
He was scheduled to formally present keys to 150 homes built by Gnanam Foundation for the internally displaced Tamils in the island nation.
However, the visit was opposed by the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) and Marumarlarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMDK).
Gnanam Foundation has been focussing on re-building infrastructure in the key areas of Sri Lanka, which were badly affected in the civil war that took place around three decades ago.
