Son’s fiancee  in lasting shock

Buttala police nabbed a suspect for abusing a girl who is said to be married to the suspect's son.
The son had accompanied the girl to his father's house to introduce her to his family members. While she was in the washroom of the house, the father had allegedly abused the girl. The son was not at the house when the incident took place.
Neighbours, hearing the girl's shouting, had informed police and the 48-year-old suspect was nabbed within hours.
The suspect was produced before the Wellawaya Magistrate's Court.
Investigations are continuing.
