Commission on SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering, Mihin
Treasury settled over Rs.520 mn owed to Lankaputhra Bank by Mihin

The General Treasury has ultimately been burdened in settling over Rs.520 million due to the Lankaputhra Development Bank (LDB) by Mihin Lanka Pvt. Ltd. until 2008, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Catering, and Mihin Lanka learnt yesterday.
Lankaputra Development Bank Acting General Manager Ranjith Dissanayake testified before the Commission for the second day yesterday.
As disclosed by the witness, the Treasury had to pay Rs.522 million for the credit facilities amounting to Rs.138 million and investment in preference shares of Rs.384 million inclusive of the interest for Lankaputhra Development Bank as at December 31, 2008.
The Treasury had also paid Rs.160 million to the company from the budgetary allocation of 2008. Accordingly, the total amount that was settled by the Treasury was Rs.682 million.
When asked by the Commission as to who was exactly responsible in paying the due amount to the LDB, he said that according to the agreement signed between the LDB and Mihin Lanka Pvt. Ltd, this money should have been recovered from the company.
When asked as to whether it was a tripartite agreement between the LDB, Mihin Lanka Pvt. Ltd. and the Treasury, the witness told that it was not so and there is no such document stating that the Treasury will reimburse this money to the bank.
“For this investment made, the LDB did not even possess an application,” he added.
“This money has been settled by the Treasury by issuing Bonds to the value through the Central Bank that matured in two years.
The witness was not aware about a Cabinet decision on the issuance of these Bonds. But, they are have the Bond Certificate with them,” he said.
