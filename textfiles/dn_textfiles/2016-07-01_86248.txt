Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka  a strength in next big battle: PM

 
 Catering to the people’s expectations for a new country is the next biggest “battle” before the Government and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka is a strength in this crusade, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was speaking at the event to grant UNP membership to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday. Fonseka received the membership letter from Prime Minister Wickremesinghe after signing a document at the auspicious time of 11.40 am.
Along with Fonseka, all Democratic Party front line members received UNP membership letters from UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim. Fonseka was also appointed the UNP Kelaniya Organizer.
The Premier speaking at the occasion said granting UNP membership to Field Marshal Fonseka was a unanimous decision of the party.
“The UNP is a party that marches forward. Field Marshal Fonseka did not retreat at anytime, not even after the war. Many difficulties came his way after he contested as the Common Candidate. That was how the then Government treated a war-winning Army Commander,” he said.
The Premier said even though Fonseka contested the previous General Elections from a different party, the UNP decided to offer him a seat as they were of the opinion that he should represent Parliament. “Now we are one force and we have one journey. That journey is to create a better country that has eliminated poverty and corruption. We need to empower the rural economy, strengthen the middle class, create employment opportunities and usher in educational reforms. Saying is earlier than done. People like Field Masrshal Sarath Fonseka are a strength to us in this journey,” he said.
Field Marshal Fonseka pledged that his support to the UNP would be consistent and unchanging.
“This is a unanimous decision taken by our party considering the contemporary political situation and needs. When I came forward as the Common Candidate in 2010, my ambition was to save the country from the corrupt rule that prevailed at the time. I also campaigned for good governance and a better political culture. Therefore, I can be happy that the present government has been committed to good governance and a country free of corruption, bribery and thuggery,” he said.
“The ‘Mahinda Chinthana’ plague is not over. It’s phantoms are still haunting. The 6.2 million people who united to defeat him should remain strong and united,” he added.
He said the UNP agreed to give nominations to 39 of his party men at provisional and national level elections, and requested to give a chance to the rest of his party men at the Local Government level elections. “I have no separate political agendas and the UNP leadership can trust my word. I am not a politician who back stabs. I challenged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa openly and to his face."
