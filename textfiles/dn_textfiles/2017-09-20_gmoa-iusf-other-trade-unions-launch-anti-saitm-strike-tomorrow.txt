GMOA, IUSF, other trade unions to launch Anti-SAITM strike tomorrow

 
The Government Medical Association (GMOA) together with Inter University Student’s Federation (IUSF), health, education and other trade unions will launch a 24-hour Anti-SAITM token strike at 8 a.m. tomorrow.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa told Daily News Online that the strike is in protest of government’s failure to provide an acceptable response to demands against the SAITM. 
He also said  the attempt to establish the Accreditation Council (AC) reducing the powers of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and not providing a favourable solution to students who have been protesting against the SAITM outside campus for the past few months, were reasons for their protest.
