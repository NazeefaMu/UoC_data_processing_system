Heated argument erupts over COPE Chairman’s alleged breach of standing orders
A heated argument erupted yesterday in Parliament when government MP Ashu Marasinghe charged that COPE Chairman Sunil Handunetti has acted against standing orders, while the opposition charged that MP Handunetti has been subjected to undue influence by the government. Referring to a media statement by MP Handunetti that said COPE would start investigations on alleged frauds on central expressway, MP Marasinghe said making the statement was wrong as the oversight committee has to discuss the matter while the Auditor General also must look into it.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said there was no legal impediment for the COPE to investigate into the matter. He said a member is free to talk about the future plans of COPE.
Joint opposition MP Aluthgamage said MP Handunetti has been subjected to undue influence by the government.
“The objective of the government is to silence Handunetti,” he said. “Handunetti was called to Speaker’s room and a minister attempted to influence him,”he said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said anything like that did not happen.
“Myself, MP Handunetti, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella had a discussion on the matter,” the Speaker said.
“We also sought the opinion of the Auditor General. No undue influence was exerted on anyone,” he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said COPE could carry out any investigation, while powers of oversight committee and other committees such as COPE could be sought out latter. He said amendments could be made to standing orders if necessary.
Arundika switches allegiance
UPFA Parliamentarian Arundika Fernando crossed over to the Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday after making a statement in Parliament.
He said he was not invited to attend the ceremony organised when the Tourism Development Authority Chairman was appointed. He said the funds of the Tourism Development Ministry was not utilised for the development of the tourism industry. The Finance Ministry had taken away the money, he said.
Fernando said the people had faith in the good governance government that health, educational and development strategies would be implemented and poverty eradicated. However, the situation went from bad to worse. Even the SAITM issue was allowed to fester when it could have been nipped in the bud, he said.
When he had spoken up against these issues, he was removed from his ministerial post, he said.
He was removed from his Ministerial portfolios as
He was Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Deputy Minister, and was removed by President Maithripala Sirisena on September 12.
Fernando vowed to work together with the Joint Opposition towards the toppling of the government.
In a bid to minimise road accidents
Minister proposes trolley cycles to replace three wheelers
Trolley cycles which are being used in over 16 countries, could replace three wheelers minimising the number of road accidents, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this comment during the second reading debate of the Motor Traffic (Amendment) Bill when it was taken up in Parliament for debate yesterday.
Minister de Silva said the government intends to make amendments to the Motor Traffic Bill.
He said in keeping with new technology, the government intends to improve the vehicle registration process, issuing of licences, and renew the laws.
He said discussions were held with experts in the field, including public representatives. In the event of penalty points of drivers reach a certain level, their licences would be cancelled.
This system is followed internationally, he said.
“We need to implement the system in the country. The Motor Traffic Act needs to be amended to implement the system,” he said.
The current Act does not contain provisions to register motor homes, Trolley cycles and caravans. The Amendments to the Motor Traffic Act will allow for the registration of these Trolley cycles facilitating a safer service. Many fatal accidents are reported due to three wheelers. Trolley cycles could replace the three wheelers. Introducing safer modes of transport is the responsibility of the government, he said.
In terms of the issuance of driving licences, Minister Siripala de Silva said only physical fitness of a driver was considered in issuing a driving licence. He said the government intends to probe a person’s mental health too in the future in issuing driving licences.
He said there are no laws in place concerning the transporting of dangerous materials. Those transporting dangerous materials need to be far more vigilant and careful. The current law also does not specify that a sign should be displayed on the vehicle when transporting dangerous or hazardous materials, he said.
Minister de Silva said a driver is compelled to pay fines of traffic offence at a post office. The government intends to make the system easier where fines could be paid using simpler electronic modes of payment, he said.
The minister said stringent regulations will be brought in for the regulation of three wheelers to ensure better safety measures. He said measures would also be brought in to improve public transport.
Vanni District TNA- MP Charles Nirmalanathan said his party would support to measures taken to minimise road accidents. He commended the Transport Minister for measures taken to make it mandatory for all three wheelers to have meters fixed as some three wheeler drivers charge exorbitant amounts even for short distances.
He urged the Transport Minister to recruit the Tamil youth in the North to fill the vacancies in the Transport Board (SLTB). He said there are many rehabilitated youth who are unemployed.
Commending the measures taken by the Transport Minister, UPFA Galle District MP Mohan Priyadharshana Silva said most of these proposals to improve the transport sector were most welcome. He said increased fines have not contributed to the reduction of accidents.
He said the attitudes of the people need to be changed. He said no driver willfully causes accidents. He said sometimes, accidents occur due to technical faults of the vehicle. He suggested revisions in traffic fines.

Bills required to be submitted to Parliament prior to holding of the Local Government elections will be presented to Parliament expeditiously, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday.
He said this in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
