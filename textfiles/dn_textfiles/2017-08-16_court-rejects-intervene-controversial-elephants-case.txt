Court rejects to intervene into controversial elephants case

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday refused to grant permission on an animal welfare organization’s request to intervene into a case where illegally caught wild elephant calves being sold to third parties.
Counsel Aruna Laksiri with Hemantha Balasuriya appearing for the Centre for Environmental and Cultural Studies sought court’s permission to intervene into the case. Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing on behalf of the Attorney General raised objections for counsel’s move citing that the appellant does not have locus standi to support the application.
Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara observed that the appellant is not a party directly relevant to the case in accordance with section 320 of the case.
“Illegally caught wild elephants are considered as public property. Wildlife Department, CID and Attorney General are parties who appearing for the state. Accused parties and elephants owners are the other parties relevant to this case,” Chief Magistrate said.
On a previous occasion, the Court had issued an order directing the Wildlife Department that 15 elephants taken into its custody following CID investigations be temporarily released to the claimants to take part in the upcoming Kandy Esala Perahera.
The 15 elephants were temporally released for 20 days between July 27 and August 15. Prosecutors maintained that 38 illegally caught wild elephant were taken into Wildlife Department custody following CID investigations into a racket where illegally caught wild elephant calves were sold to third parties.
The prosecutors alleged that the suspect, Samarappulige Niraj Roshan alias Ali Roshan, was the mastermind behind the racket where illegally caught wild elephant calves being sold to third parties. The prosecutors alleged investigations have revealed that the suspect was directly involved in selling 39 wild elephants and the captured elephants calves being sold for 15 years. Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appeared for the Attorney General.
