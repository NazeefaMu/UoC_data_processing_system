Donald confident Malinga will deliver

South African fast bowling legend Allan Donald also known as ‘White Lightning’ expects Sri Lanka’s spearhead of the bowling attack ‘Slinger’ Lasith Malinga to make his mark in the Champions Trophy when he returns from injury to play in his first ODI in two years.
Commenting on Malinga who is currently playing in the IPL for Mumbai Indians, Donald said, “From my experience coming back from injuries like Malinga’s I am sure he would have planned the way he is going to come back. He knows what he needs to perform at optimum level, he is world class and he is the leader of the bowling group. A shrewd character he would know what it takes to take Sri Lanka all the way.
“With our management, medical and support staff looking after him, miles in the legs is probably what he needs right now.Twenty20 cricket is not ideal but the calibre and quality that Malinga is he will perform for Sri Lanka. I feel if it’s once in the heart you know what’s required,” said Donald who represented South Africa in 72 Tests and became the first bowler from his country to capture 300 Test wickets.
Donald also played in 164 ODIs for South Africa and took 272 wickets.
Head coach Graham Ford said that he is confident that Malinga would make an impact in the Champions Trophy.
“Lasith is very determined to make an impact, he has been working hard on his fitness but even if he not giving us the full 10 overs he is a class act who can take wickets upfront and finish the innings off,” said Ford.
“I am confident that Malinga will be 100 percent fit. I am not looking at him going to operate on one leg. All reports indicate that he is doing well. I spoke to Mahela (Jayawardene, coach of Mumbai Indians) a couple of times and when they left him out the first time I thought there might be something wrong.
“But Mahela said it’s nothing wrong but they’ve got plans to win the competition and don’t want to play him all the way through. All the indications are that he is going to give us something special. As time runs out in his career he is determined to make an impact.
