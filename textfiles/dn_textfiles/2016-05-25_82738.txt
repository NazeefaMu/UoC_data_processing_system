JVP says govt’s disaster mitigation  allocation slashed for 2016

 
 JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said yesterday that the government had no prior preparedness and plan to face the disaster situation as indicated by the reduction of the disaster mitigation allocation for 2016.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said the capital expenditure on disaster prevention and mitigation for 2015 was Rs.2522 million. But, it was reduced to Rs.2135million this years. The allocation for the recurrent expenditure too was very low this year compared to last year. It was Rs.1543 million in 2015 which has been reduced to Rs.799 million in 2016.
Natural disasters occur suddenly. The government could not intervene in the relief and rescue operations in the first few days since it has no extra funds and initial preparedness. “We urged the government to put the country on an emergency footing. But, the government did not do so. Therefore, government officers could not intervene to help the flood and landslide affected people at the initial stage due to barriers placed by circulars.
Now the government has designated these areas as High Security Zones.
He said a proper mechanism should be created to ensure that relief funds are distributed correctly to the affected persons.
If the government thinks about the environment, it should stop unauthorized constructions and reclamations. It is obvious politicians are behind most of these illegal constructions and reclamations. The Irrigation Department should have an alternative method to control the water level in the Kelani river and other rivers.
The government should also announce a definite stance on providing lands for the people who lost their homes due to floods and landslides. In paying compensation, the government should not restrict this to legal deed owners but should also consider the unauthorized settlers. A swift programme is needed to get the lives of the affected people back to normal. The JVP red-star relief team made a massive contribution in the rescue and relief operations in the flood and landslide hit areas of the country to the best if its abilities.
Commenting on the Rugby player Wasim Thajudeen’s death, he said that according to the statement given by the former Western Province DIG Anura Senanayake, the political big wigs behind the Wasim Thajudeen’s murder can be identified and their names should be revealed.
