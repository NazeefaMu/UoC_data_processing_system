Dream fulfilled

D.P. Anura Lalith Rupasinghe (40) of Thilinagama, Mirigama, who lived in his incomplete house after being disabled and restricted to a wheelchair three years ago, fulfilled his dream of completing his house with the intervention of Danesha Rajapaksa of the D.A. Rajapaksa Foundation.
The house was ceremonially handed over to Rupasinghe by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Provincial Councillor Udena Wijeratne while the Maha Sangha chanted seth pirith.
