United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake inspected the houses of victims of the recent violent incidents in the Digana and Theldeniya area.
He met the family members of the Sinhala person and the Muslim youth killed in the violence and made a financial donation of Rs.100,000 each family.
Several members of the Colombo Municipal Council, the Maha Sangha and Muslim leaders accompanied the MP.
Karunanayake speaking to the public in the area appreciated the efforts made by the Maha Sangha and religious dignitaries of other faiths to strengthen unity among communities.
He said there were elements with vested interests trying to scuttle efforts to strengthen peace and unity. The MP said the government would take appropriate measures to maintain harmony among communities.
