Pethiyagoda calls for urgent need to look into social issues of plantation workers

The responsible authorities should pay more attention towards the day-to-day problems and living conditions of over 200,000 plantation workers in the country, considering the invaluable service rendered by them to uplift the plantation sector.
Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda made these remarks at the 163rd AGM of the Planters’ Association of Ceylon held in Colombo. Planters Association Chairman S.S. Poholiyadda and Deputy Chairman A.L.W. Goonawardena were also present.
Speaking further, Dr. Pethiyagoda said the Planters’ Association over the past several decades contributed immensely to develop this most important sector. Commenting further on the problems faced by plantation workers, Chairman Pethiyagoda said this vulnerable sector is the backbone of the plantation industry.
“Therefore it is the duty of the responsible authorities to pay special attention to the housing, education and nutrition needs of plantation workers and their families,” he said.
The Chairman said if plantation workers are neglected, it is difficult for them to become normal citizens of our society.
Dr. Pethiyagoda said, “According to a survey conducted by a group of specialist doctors a few years ago in the plantation sector of Nuwara Eliya District, it was revealed that a large number of men and women between the age groups of 18 to 24 had contracted sexual transmitted diseases.”
He said the survey further revealed that one in every 10 children in the plantation sector was sexually abused by older persons and therefore 10% of children were abused at a tender age.
He also paid attention towards the percentage of Nuwara Eliya District plantation sector girls of 18-24 who had undergone illegal abortions.
Dr. Pethiyagoda said it was a positive factor that with all these difficulties, 3% of children in the plantation sector had passed their Ordinary Level Examination.
He said, “Plantation workers households are not like others, as their children are badly exploited due to various social issues and it is the sole responsibility of authorities to look into this matter.”
The Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman also said plantation workers are the isolated community in the present day society and it is the duty of everybody, especially the state, to look into their social needs and provide suitable assistance.
He asked authorities to make the plantation workers full citizens to get a meaningful representation of people in Sri Lanka.
He said that it is the duty of everybody to integrate them with the rest of our society and said no government has so far found the political will to help them to develop into the modern urban unit.
Dr. Pethiyagoda also focused attention towards the pesticides that are immensely needed to develop the plantation industry and said authorities had banned using of pesticide even without consulting the Fertilizer Secretariat, the Medical Research Institute and the Tea Research Institute.
