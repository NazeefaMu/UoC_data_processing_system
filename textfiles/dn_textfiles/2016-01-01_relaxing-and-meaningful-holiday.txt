Relaxing and Meaningful Holiday

Batticaloa is a pretty little city tucked away on an island, surrounded by a gorgeous lagoon. Batticaloa district has many places of interest including the famous Golden Beach of Passikudah, Kalkudah and not to mention Arugam Bay which is one the best beaches in the world for surfing.
Opened six months ago with 10 Deluxe Rooms, Hotel Nirutha is one place to check out as it accommodates within one's budget. The hotel atmosphere and friendly staff like Rasika and Chamara will give a relaxing and meaningful holiday to a busy life. The hotel comes with all necessary amenities and it is very close to the golden beach of Passikudah.
"I had very good opportunities to invest money in developing new business in the UK, but as a Sri Lankan I had to give back to my motherland that gave me so much. My moral obligation was to help the people of Batticaloa who have recovered from a 30 year civil war and piecing together their lives after the devastating Tsunami. I left to London 25 years ago and currently living there with my family. But we have to respect our native place and I would like to give more opportunities to my village people to work at my hotel", Hotel Nirutha proprietor Sam Venugopal stated in a release.
The name of this hotel comes from putting together his mother's name Nirmala and daughter's name Samrutha to form Hotel Nirutha.
"All the interior design was carefully chosen to represent the peace and tranquility of Batticaloa, its cultures and this was only possible by Yamuna de Fonseka (interior designer) and has had her hands on many of the holiday resorts in Sri Lanka. " he added.
"We never use artificial flavours to our food. We are using natural flavours and ingredients which are specially shipped from London. We are specialized in Italian Pizzas. We offer both Sri Lankan and Western food but we are very well trained to make authentic Indian food too. All the equipment in our kitchen and many hotel items were imported from London and we have a 50 pax conference hall too", Management Consultant H R Hewawasam stressed.
The Batticaloa Lagoon, which is the largest lagoon in the island runs along the famous Lady Manning Bridge popularly known as the Kallady Bridge that connects Batticaloa town to the rest of the eye catching villages, features extensive mangrove swamps and some sea grass beds that attract a wide variety of water birds. The lagoon is famous for its Singing Fish where on Full Moon nights, during the period of April to September, a faint but distinct musical sound resembling a plucked guitar rises from the lagoon waters in the area along the Kallady Bridge, a couple of kilometres off the town centre of Batticaloa. The mysterious music is attributed to a noise emanated from some form of a marine life found in the lagoon. The best way to listen to the music is to dip the end of an oar into the water and hold the other end to one's ear.

The Batticaloa Light House called Muttuwaran Lighthouse which was built by the British in the year 1913 is located where the Batticaloa lagoon meets the Indian Ocean along the Bar Road. The solid looking Batticaloa Fort with hulking walls, the most picturesque of the small Dutch forts of Sri Lanka was built by the Portuguese in 1628. The fort guarded by four bastions, protected by the sea from 2 sides and by a moat on other 2 sides, was captured by the Dutch from the Portuguese in 1638. It was the first Portuguese fort in Sri Lanka captured by the Dutch. In the year 1772, the fort fell to the British.
