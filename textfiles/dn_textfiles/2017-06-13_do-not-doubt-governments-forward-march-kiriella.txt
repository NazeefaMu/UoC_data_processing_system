Do not doubt government's forward march: Kiriella

"The discussions held among the main parties in the good governance government to review their collective agreement for the next four years have been successfully completed. Therefore, no one should entertain any doubts about the government's forward march," Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Minister Kiriella was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stone for a new children's park at Rajawatta, Peradeniya on June 11.
He said the President and the Prime Minister had great confidence in each other and the government will go from strength to strength during the ensuing four years.
He said two and a half years had lapsed since the government assumed power and certain critics were claiming that the government was short-lived. "To those predicting the downfall of the government, I would say they were highly mistaken for the government would last for its full term with added strength and vigour," the minister said.
He said it was the United National Front, which provided leadership to the campaign to bring President Maithripala Sirisena to power.
Therefore, the UNP had a duty to steer the national government forward while protecting the President. He said the government has committed to fulfil the pledges held out to the people during the Presidential and the General Elections.
