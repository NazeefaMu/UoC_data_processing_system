“The demands of the 21st century urge that companies can no longer operate in the same way as before. New tools are required if companies are to be responsive in a world that is changing. The sustainability issue is a critical consideration for boards of companies and has to be embedded in its long-term strategy. The chartered accountancy industry therefore has a valuable and indispensable role to play in Sri Lanka”, said the High Commissioner.
“ACCA’S Sustainability Reporting Awards is therefore an indispensable tool that can assist companies with its on-going relationships between the company and its stakeholders in developing strategy. In this regard, best practices from South African companies are instructive in demonstrating how companies can achieve long term sustainability, responsive to the needs of companies and society as a whole.” she added.
ACCA Sri Lanka with its pay off line, ‘Think ahead’ has endeavoured in felicitating Sri Lanka’s best sustainability reports via ‘Sustainability Reporting Awards’ for over 14 years.
ACCA Sri Lanka Member Network Panel President, Adrian Perera congratulating winners who have conformed to the criteria indicators of completeness, credibility and communication said, each winning report had clearly acknowledged and demonstrated economic, environmental and social impacts on internal and external stakeholders.
“We at ACCA believe that if Sri Lanka is to develop itself to become the true pearl of the Indian Ocean, businesses must come up with strategies that are not only viable but also sustainable in the long run”, he said.
Franklyn Amerasinghe the head of judging panel said that having observed an increasing number of integrated reports being entered into the fray, the judges noted more strategic thinking in relation to sustainability, encouraging all organizations to move towards this approach.
