Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu to be incorporated in development programme - PM

The Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu districts will be incorporated to the country’s overall development process, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He issued this pledge when he addressed public officials at a discussion held at the Kilinochchi Kachcheri during his visit to the Kilinochchi and Jaffna districts to review the progress of development work yesterday. The Prime Minister said the development strip encompassing Hambantota, Kandy and Moneragala would be extended to Jaffna to incorporate those districts to the country’s development programme.
The Prime Minister who said that development projects were already underway in Jaffna, added that Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu too required more and more development projects.
The Prime Minister who noted that the Northern Province was in abject poverty in comparison to the other Provinces, said that Kilinochchi and Mannar were the least developed areas in the province.
He said the objective of the government was to develop the Northern Province and make it economically strong in line with other areas in the country.
