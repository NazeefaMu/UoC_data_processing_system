Lee retires after 12 seasons

Washington: David Lee, who helped the Golden State Warriors to the 2015 NBA title during a 12-season career, announced his retirement Sunday on Instagram.
Lee, whose fiancee is Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, averaged 13.5 points and 8.8 rebounds over 829 games with New York, Golden State, Boston, Dallas and San Antonio.
"An epic night celebrating my retirement with my friends and family!" Lee posted with a group photo on Instagram. "Thank you to my amazing fiancée @carowozniacki for planning the surprise!"
Former world number one Wozniacki had a relationship with Northern Ireland golfer Rory McIlroy, a four-time major champion, and they became engaged in January 2014 but broke up four months later, McIlroy saying he "wasn't ready for all that marriage entails."
This past Valentine's Day, Wozniacki announced she was in a relationship with Lee and the couple announced their engagement earlier this month.
Lee was a first-round pick by New York in the 2005 NBA Draft and spent five seasons with the Knicks, earning NBA All-Star honors in 2010. AFP
