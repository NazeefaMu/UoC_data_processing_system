All change as new owners steer F1 into fast lane

Melbourne: Formula One ventures into the unknown zone of a long-awaited revamped and high-speed era under new American ownership this weekend when the engines roar into life at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.
Liberty Media’s takeover and the off-season departure of the sport’s veteran commercial ring-master Bernie Ecclestone have coincided with an overhaul of the technical regulations to usher in a new breed of ‘fatter and faster’ cars.
The wider new machines with broader tyres make much greater physical demands on the drivers and are expected to provide more noise and spectacle -– and hopefully better racing with more passing moves –- as Formula One bids to appeal to a younger, global, digital and social media savvy audience.
The retirement of 2016 drivers world champion German Nico Rosberg has also triggered change with Finn Valtteri Bottas switching from Williams to partner three-time champion and pre-season favourite Lewis Hamilton in the champion Mercedes team.
That has been just one of a ripple of moves up and down the pit lane that have added an even greater sense of adventure, and the unknown, to the competition with Ferrari performing well in pre-season testing to suggest they may join Red Bull in mounting a challenge to the dominant German team. AFP
