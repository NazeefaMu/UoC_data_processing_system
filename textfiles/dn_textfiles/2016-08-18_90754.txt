India topple Australia in Test rankings

 
Colombo, Wednesday: India has regained its title as the world's number one Test team after Australia suffered a 3-0 series defeat against Sri Lanka Wednesday, the International Cricket Council said.
India, who had ceded the top slot to Steve Smith's side at the turn of the year, regained their crown thanks to their recent series victory over West Indies, which meant Australia had to win the final Test in Colombo. Sri Lanka's 163-run victory on Wednesday has also allowed Pakistan to leapfrog Australia in the rankings table after Misbah-ul-Haq's team drew their series with England 2-2 on Sunday. AFP
