Jumbo gathering

With the rise of the dry season in the north central province of Sri Lanka, comes the extremely rare opportunity to witness ‘The Gathering’, the coming together of hundreds of elephants in Minneriya National Park. Globally hailed as a truly incredible sight, ‘The Gathering’ has been named the sixth greatest wildlife spectacle in the world by Lonely Planet. During the peak month of October, guests visiting Cinnamon Lodge Habarana and Habarana Village by Cinnamon will have the fortune of watching herds of hundreds of these gentle giants, as they congregate around the Minneriya Reservoir.
Herds of elephants
With the onset of the dry spell in the region, the water levels of the Minneriya Reservoir recede, inducing a fresh growth of vegetation. Despite the hot and dry weather, the lush flora and water readily available at the Minneriya Resevoir attracts hundreds of elephants from various surrounding areas, including Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee, Matale and Kaudulla. It is estimated that during the peak of this great elephant gathering, up to 200-300 elephants come together at the same place to bathe, court, drink, feed and socialize, making it the largest congregation of Asian elephants in the world.
A safari in Minneriya
The wildlife safaris offered by Cinnamon Lodge Habarana and Habarana Village by Cinnamon in Minneriya National Park, are conducted by Cinnamon Nature Trails, the award-winning eco-tourism division of Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts. These jeep safaris provide the perfect opportunity for wildlife enthusiasts to observe and experience this magnificent wildlife spectacle firsthand. The Cinnamon team works with an experienced team of naturalists, drivers and trackers to provide an insightful safari experience to guests that is filled with valuable information. The safaris enable guests to not only observe these large herds in their natural habitat but also to learn more about their habits and social structures.
Protecting Minneriya’s elephants
As part of an ongoing collaboration between Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts and the Centre for Conservation and Research, Cinnamon Lodge Habarana and Habarana Village by Cinnamon have been actively involved in the ‘Cinnamon Elephant Project,’ an initiative focused on elevating elephant viewing based tourism to the next level. The project endeavours to further enrich and enhance the visitors’ experience by providing them with exclusive insights on the congregation and dispersal patterns of smaller elephant herds that come together to form the larger gathering at Minneriya National Park.
Moreover, the behavioral, health and demographic data gathered during the course of the project also ensures the well-being of the elephants, enabling them to be monitored, which in turn benefits the nation’s long-term efforts to conserve and protect the Asian elephant. By tracking and monitoring these herds, the field teams are able to keep track of their movements and act on any concerns or health issues that might be affecting them.
Commenting on the iconic wildlife phenomenon that can be observed in Minneriya National Park during the dry season, Head of Cinnamon Nature Trails Chitral Jayatilake said the dry season in the north central province of Sri Lanka, which is at its peak in October, serves as one of the best times to visit Minneriya National Park, where the extremely rare sighting of hundreds of elephants gathering in a single location can be enjoyed.
