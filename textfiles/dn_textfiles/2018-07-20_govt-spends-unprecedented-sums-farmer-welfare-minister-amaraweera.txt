Govt. spends unprecedented sums for farmer welfare: Minister Amaraweera

The colossal funds allocated by the government for the agricultural section for farmer welfare is unprecedented in the history of this country. No other government in recent history has done so much of work for the welfare of farmers, said Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
The minister was addressing a meeting at Mahawela in Jandura to mark the launch of a development project under the Gam Dahasak Wew Dahasak (Thousand villages and thousand tanks) programme in the Ambalantota DS division, recently.
The minister said his ministry had set apart Rs. 5,228 million towards the crop insurance scheme. Under this scheme, Rs. 100,000 per hectare would be paid in the event of damage to paddy, maize, B onion, Soya bean or green chili cultivation.
This had induced farmers to take up agricultural cultivation without second thoughts. All agricultural tanks in the country would be renovated by next year. Rs. 9,000 million had been set apart for tank rehabilitation.
Minister Amaraweera said steps should be taken to provide toxin-free food for the younger generation. Every inch of arable land available should be cultivated in a village to achieve development.
The government which had the interest of farmers at heart, paid Rs. 38,000 million as drought relief to farmers notwithstanding its financial difficulties.
Minister Amaraweera said the immense development work undertaken by the government did not get sufficient publicity in the media, adding that the manner in which some sections of the media highlighted killings and other crimes, made people believe that crimes had escalated under the present government. This was a travesty of the truth because there had been a drastic reduction in the rate of crimes after the present government assumed office.
This was largely due to the restoration of law and order in the country. Although the Agriculture Ministry had a surfeit of officers, the country produced only 11,200 metric tons of fruits annually, whereas fruit imports amounted to 44,000 metric tons annually.
This was highly regrettable, he said. Although a persons should consume 200 grammes of fruits daily, an average person consumed only about 95 grammes and that was also imported fruit and this was not satisfactory.
