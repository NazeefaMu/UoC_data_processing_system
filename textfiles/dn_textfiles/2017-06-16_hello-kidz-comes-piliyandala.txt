Hello Kidz comes to Piliyandala

Hello Kidz’, a dream paradise which has cemented its reputation as a reliable supplier of quality mother and baby care products, opened their 10th retail outlet in Piliyandala.
The opening of the newest Hello Kidz outlet further establishes their status as the most trusted mother and baby care product retailer. The brainchild of Dr. Priyanka Perera, Hello Kidz started its operations four years ago, with the opening of a one-stop products outlet in Maharagama, fulfilling the needs for quality products for mothers and babies. The chain of outlets saw a rapid expansion based on the trust which they developed through their outstanding relationship with valuable customers. Soon, new outlets were opened in Talawatugoda, Pitakotte, Boralesgamuwa, Moratuwa, Negombo, Horana, Kandana and Panadura.
The newest Hello Kidz branch in Piliyandala reinforces the group’s recognition as the largest retailer of mother and baby care products. The tremendous success and growth of Hello Kidz is a result of the maintenance of a very high standard of product quality as well as the efficient and friendly service extended by staff members, spearheaded by their working director Nishamal Priyantha and the directress.
With their extensive range of products which is loved by thousands of mothers and kids who thrive for quality that comes with affordable price tags, Hello Kidz is marching ahead as the market leader.
