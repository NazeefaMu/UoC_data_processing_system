Young players deliver their best at Asian Rugby Sevens - skipper Muthuthanthri

Sri Lanka rugby sevens captain Sudarshana Muthuthanthri praised his team mates and said they all delivered their best for the country at the first leg of the Asian Rugby Sevens tournament concluded in Hong Kong recently. “They showed their prowess, but unfortunately lost to China in the Cup quarter-finals due to mistakes at crucial stages. China has improved a lot in recent times and beat experienced Sri Lanka side in last year’s Asian Sevens in Colombo,” Muthuthanthri mentioned.
“Our youngsters lacked experience and were unable to win kick off balls and made blunders in the rucks. But the experience gained in this Sevens tourney will stand them in good stead in the second leg in Korea in two weeks time.
Sri Lanka finished fifth in the first leg in Hong Kong after beating Malaysia in the semi-finals and Philippines in the final of the Plate Championship. This was as a result of fielding a young side but even winning the Plate Championship was a big achievement.
The second leg of the Asian Rugby Sevens will be worked off in South Korea on September 23 and 24 in which some senior players are likely to return to the Sri Lanka side.
