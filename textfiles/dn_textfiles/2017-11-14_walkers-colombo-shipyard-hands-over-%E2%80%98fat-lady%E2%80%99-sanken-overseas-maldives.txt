Walkers Colombo Shipyard (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of MTD Walkers PLC, has successfully completed the construction of ‘Fat Lady’, a self- propelled barge designed and constructed for Sanken Overseas Maldives Pvt Ltd. The project was completed within three months, which is a remarkable milestone.
The landing craft designed and constructed entirely by an in-house team of highly skilled naval architects and engineers under the guidance of Dr. Sarath Obeysekera, Managing Director of Walkers Colombo Shipyard (Pvt) Ltd was recently handed over to Sanken Overseas Maldives (Pvt) Limited in a ceremony held recently at the Walkers Colombo Shipyard in Mutwal Harbour.
Speaking to Daily News he said that the total investment was US$ 5 million.
The landing craft is 24.5 meters long and 7 meters wide, with a draft of 1.4 m and a deck load capacity of 75 tons which will be used mainly during the mobilization and demobilization stages of construction projects in Maldives, allowing Sanken Overseas Maldives to further optimize operations and provide an even more efficient service to clients.
Following the launching of the landing craft, Sanken Overseas Maldives signed their next agreement with Walkers Colombo Shipyard to build the second landing craft which is 35 meters in length, 8.5 meters wide and a draft of 2.00m.
