Special committee to amend Grade One admissions circular

The Minister of Education will formulate a new circular for Grade One admissions for the year 2018. A committee of scholars have been appointed for this purpose.
The reason for the new circular is that the Education Minister has found many shortcomings in the present system.
This circular according to Minister Akila Wiraj Kariyawasam will come into effect from June this year.
A senior official of the Ministry told the Daily News that here-in-after all Grade One admissions will be done according to the rules stipulated in the said circular. He said this would pave the way for parents to admit their children to popular schools in a reasonable manner.
