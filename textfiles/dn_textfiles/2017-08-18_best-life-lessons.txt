Best Life lessons!

The Thespians of St. Benedicts have received the greatest virtue of drama – fearless freedom of thought. Dramatic Moves features the Thespians of St. Benedict’s College who along with that freedom are lion hearted.
Teacher in Charge of Drama, Titus Withanage pointed out that in order to understand the true value of literature experience is important. Drama provides you with that experience. At practices and on stage you are transported back in time like a time machine. On stage you are literally in Shakespeare’s era living the bard’s dreams and the bard’s vision.
“I am an English language teacher as well, so I feel the things we teach in the classroom is not enough. There should be places for children to practice what they have learnt. That is what I expect from the Drama Club. Introducing Shakespeare or works of literature is not enough. There is no better place than the drama club for the children to comprehend real literature,” said Withanage.
‘To sir with love’ is the reward Withanage receives from his students. When he meets his former students and finds that they are successful with their own families and careers that is his greatest reward. The time they spent at practices, the lessons imparted has resulted in his students becoming pillars of society.
Within a short time the College understood that Drama was worth spending money and they provided the boys with one of the best stage directors in the country, Mr. Jerome De Silva.
“So it is an honor for us to have him here at St. Benedict’s. Currently in the island he is one of the best stage directors. We are privileged to have him here as our trainer. Here in our drama club each and every one supports the other,” stated Withanage
An undying LOVE
President Joshua Joseph said that Courage is the quality he has developed because of drama. There are many forms of courage and to face school life needs courage. At such a young age society demands that from you. You need to be prepared to face the realities out there. Doing Drama is practical. You are faced with real life situations on stage when enacting a role.
Take Macbeth for example, you learn about how greed for power can destroy a man. How greed for power can turn a leader admired by many into a despot hated by many. All these are real examples that we see today in our society. How about Romeo and Juliet? The power of love and its potent effect on a young person. We see this a lot in society. So one needs to get in touch with his or her character intimately. This involves understanding a characters motives and qualities. This is where the best lessons are learnt.
“I started Drama when I was in Grade 6, and it was because of Drama that I have come out in school a lot. I do some compering, I am a prefect at school and debating as well. All of this is because of Drama. When I first entered drama we were casting for inter-house and Jerome gave met the script which was ‘Merchant of Venice’. I was a bit scared at that time, but later when I got used to it, it has enabled me to go anywhere and speak before a crowd,” said Joseph.
United they learn lessons from Drama. The seniors still keep in touch with them. All in all it is an undying love. Joseph’s attitude is that he treats every drama like the last.
Forgetting one’s lines is a problem any ones can face. Composure here is what is needed and is what is absolutely vital. “When you face the problem of forgetting your lines, you should not think on that. You should let it go because missing that small line is not going to make a big difference. If I get worried about that small thing then my entire performance would go down. It is building it from that moment onwards. Your lines should be coming out naturally. I must think what more can I do to add to that character?’ said Joseph.
Blood, sweat and tears
Vice President Nethan Alexander said that when he takes in a breath, the breath he exhales is that of his character. This is typical of these boys of St. Benedicts who are committed 100 percent. Alexander went on to say that it is all about blood, sweat and tears.
“Every time it starts with meditation. A quiet time to think about what is going on, and when I come on to the stage, I forget everything that is going on in my personal life and live in that moment. Basically how we get through is mostly improvisation and this also relates to forgetting ones lines. When we act on stage we live as another person. Before I did drama I was a shy character. This is where I truly belong, my drama club,” said Alexander.
He points out that to play a female role you need to be very good in acting. To portray something that you are not, when it comes to gender it is hard -the way you walk and your speech patterns and you posture. Adapting to any role is possible but it depends on the commitment you have to that role.
characterization
Secretary Shimal Benedict reiterated some of what Joseph said when he spoke about learning from characters.
“When we do dramas we get into different characters, from that itself it shows us the problems that character faced during that period of time. Then we understand what the character would do to solve these problems. If I am facing a problem, what I would do is, when I come to Drama practices, I put all that away and get into the character I am playing and be the character through characterization,” said Benedict.
When doing a Shakespearean play one definitely comes across all kinds of problems and the solutions to these problems are fascinating to conjecture. In Romeo and Juliet we are confronted with the deaths of the two young star crossed loves and in Merchant of Venice we read of Shylock’s pound of flesh.
“Drama helps you develop your self-esteem. It develops your mastery of English. It develops your personality so you can speak in front of a crowd. That is the problem a lot of people have, this stage fear. They cannot even imagine themselves speaking in front of a crowd. But the Drama Club develops your character, so you can speak in front of a crowd without any fear,” said Benedict.
At St. Benedict’s, drama is a club that one never leaves. The love for the club remains even after the boys have passed out of school. This is because of the overwhelming gratitude that one has towards this club. Drama is something that is practical. Benedict recounts a Car Wash project he took part in. The boys had to speak to CEO’s and General Managers.
“You feel very comfortable talking to them and discussing matters. Drama has given us so many values and principles,” pointed out Benedict.
unforgettable
Former President Jerome Morrit feels that Drama has helped him discover himself. Through drama he has received the skills that has enabled him to boldly venture out into society. Morrit’s attitude leaves no room for doubt. This is a young man who knows himself and what he is capable of and knows his talents.
“As a person I meet a lot of people. And when I tell them I am interested in doing drama and I have done drama for a long period of time, their reply to me is –‘That is good and it will take you far’. I begin to realize and understand why drama has become so important and why my life has been a big part of it. What I have learnt through drama at rehearsals and practices and what I feel will be of great importance is the courage to never give up. Through drama and through acting on stage and seeing people in the audience, bringing out the character has helped me in numerous ways,” said Morrit
Morrit points out that if you take Drama as a whole, doing Shakespeare Drama itself, you learn more about English, Literacy and a lot about history. Through this you can teach others.
“When it comes to unforgettable dramas I have lost count of that! There have been so many unforgettable dramas we have performed. I think one production that really puts a smile on my face, each time I think of drama, is when our cast performed Richard III. That moment performing on stage I really felt something. I was happy being there on stage and sharing that stage with my fellow actors and doing what I love to do out of everything else I can do. It is one production that I really enjoyed,” stated Morrit.
These boys are ambitious and they seek to bring glory to St. Benedict’s College. The boys became champions at Drama Comp. last year and they had loads of fun.
