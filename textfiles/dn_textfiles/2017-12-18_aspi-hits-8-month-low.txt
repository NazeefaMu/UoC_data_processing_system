Point of view
Equities continued to lose steam this week, falling ~23 points W-o-W to hit an 8-month low of 6352.1 points as concerns over domestic political and policy uncertainty dominated sentiment and the US Fed raised interest rates for the 3rd time this year.
Since the first reading of Budget 2018 in early November, the broad-share price Index has fallen ~215 points (-3.3%) with consecutive losses in the six weeks since the Budget.
Average daily turnover levels also fell 24% W-o-W, as low market participation, particularly by Institutional and HNI investors dragged the average daily turnover for the week down to Rs.0.71Bb (cf. Rs.0.93Bn last week).
Crossings for the week accounted for just 36% of total market turnover, lower than last week’s crossings of 46% and reflecting the lower participation levels by HNI & Institutionals.
Crossings remained largely centered around mid-cap counters such as Teejay Lanka (28% of total crossings), Amana Bank (15% of total crossings) and LOLC (12% of crossings) while larger-cap blue chips such as JKH and COMB played a less dominant role as they cumulatively accounted for just 10% of total crossings.
Despite the lower daily average turnover levels, the YTD average remained at Rs. 0.94Bn, higher than the 2016 average of Rs.0.73Bn and reflecting relatively stronger equity market performance from earlier in the year.
Foreign investors however, retreated to a net selling position this week, recording net sales of Rs. 0.07Bn as the US Fed raised rates for the 3rd time this year in a widely anticipated move.
The move along with the expectation of 3 hikes in 2018 represents the continuation of the US Fed’s monetary policy normalization which could in turn impact the performance of Emerging and Frontier market equities. Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain dull ahead of the Christmas holidays.
Moody’s affirms Sri Lanka’s credit profile at B1
Moody’s Investor Services on Wednesday affirmed Sri Lanka’s credit rating at B1 while maintaining its negative outlook on the country’s credit profile.
The credit agency cited the balance between Sri Lanka's moderate institutional strength and strong (but volatile) growth against the country’s high debt burden, narrow revenue base, large government borrowing requirements and elevated external vulnerability risk as reasons for its rating outlook..

The credit agency also noted that Sri Lanka's 2016 nominal GDP was over 4x times the median for B1- and B2-rated sovereigns and that this comparatively large economy provides important diversification and shock absorption capacity, which supports Sri Lanka's credit profile at the B1 level1.
The Group noted that robust real GDP growth also drives its assessment of Sri Lanka's economic strength and that it expects real GDP growth to average about 4.9% per year in 2017-21. However, growth is expected to remain relatively volatile, particularly due to the economy’s vulnerability to droughts and flooding as the size and dispersion of seasonal monsoon rainfall influences agricultural sector growth and rural household consumption levels.
The Negative outlook meanwhile, represents its view that that persistently high government liquidity and external vulnerability risks continue to pressure Sri Lanka's credit profile, and that measures to build reserves and smooth the profile of external payments may be insufficient to contain imminent government liquidity and balance of payments pressures starting in 2019, when large international debt repayments come due and Sri Lanka's three-year IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program concludes.
