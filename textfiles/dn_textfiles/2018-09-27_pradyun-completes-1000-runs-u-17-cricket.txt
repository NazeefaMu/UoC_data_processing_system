Pradyun completes 1,000 runs in U-17 cricket

Teenage batting sensation Pradyun Saikia of the British School in Colombo had the unique distinction of completing 1,000 runs during the Inter-Schools Under-17 Division Three Cricket Tournament.
The Indian-born elegant left-hander finished with an aggregate of 1,442 runs from 14 innings while becoming the first batsman to achieve this feat in the current Under-17 Cricket Tournament.
Saikia joined the British School at the age of 10 and since then he has turned out be a prolific run-getter in junior and senior cricket tournaments under the guidance of coach Aruna Batapolaarachchi.
Saikia started his campaign in the most spectacular manner as he smashed an unbeaten 300 in the opening fixture against Science College Mount Lavinia.
He followed up this with back-to-back centuries against Hindu College (120) and President’s College Maharagama (102 n.o) respectively.
He then completed the first-round stage of the tournament in grand style by compiling an unbeaten 228 in the match against Rajasinghe Central College, Hanwella.
He of course started the second-round of the tournament with a duck but made amends with contributions of 48, 58 and 84 in the next three innings.
He then came into his own while scoring two successive hundreds against Subarathi MMV (188) and Raddoluwa Central College (109) respectively.
He continued his outstanding form with useful contributions of 28 not out against Tzu Chi National School Hambantota, 35 against Dudley Senanayake MV Tholangamuwa and 84 against Lyceum International School.
Saikia eventually reached his milestone by scoring a solid 58 in their last match of the tournament against Kadawatha Central College.
