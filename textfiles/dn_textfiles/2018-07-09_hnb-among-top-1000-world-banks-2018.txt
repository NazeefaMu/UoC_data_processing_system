HNB among Top 1,000 World Banks in 2018

HNB PLC has been crowned first among Sri Lankan banks in the prestigious Banker Magazine UK’s ranking of the Top 1000 World Banks for 2018.
HNB Managing Director-CEO, Jonathan Alles said: “To be ranked as first among Sri Lankan banks in the top 1000 banks globally by an institution as internationally respected as The Banker Magazine is a truly remarkable achievement and an unforgettable milestone and a testament to the remarkable transformation taking place at HNB.”
“Our digitally-led strategy that prioritizes digital innovation and service excellence continues to yield rich rewards for all stakeholders. This strength is ultimately reflected in our bottom-line with HNB’s emergence as the most profitable private sector banking group in Sri Lanka.”
HNB’s new ranking represents the most recent in a long series of local and international accolades received by the bank. Over the past year, HNB was recognized as the highest ranked bank in the country by both LMD and Business Today while being awarded as the Best Bank in Sri Lanka by the Banker magazine. Over the recent past, HNB has released a flurry of product and service innovations designed to engage and delight customers, while supporting them to enhance their savings to pursue their ambitions.
Prominent among the bank’s most recent innovations was the launch of the HNB FIT Account – Asia’s first fitness-linked savings product.
