India offers help to overcome petrol shortage

Indian Prime Minister Narandra Modi in a telephone conversation with President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday stated that India will extend all possible assistance to overcome the petrol shortage in Sri Lanka.
“In response to Sri Lanka’s request for emergency petrol shipments, Prime Minister Modi assured President Sirisena that India will extend all possible assistance,” the Indian High Commission in Colombo said.
A ship with 21000 kilo litres of petrol left for Sri Lanka yesterday from India.
The Indian Premier had said that additional petrol is made available at the Kochi refinery and further shipments of petrol are assured if needed.
Meanwhile, Indian High Commission sources also noted that the Lanka Indian Oil Company has made available 3500 kl of petrol immediately from its own stock to the CPC.
