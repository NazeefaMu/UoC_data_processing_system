World Chocolate Day at Mount Lavinia Hotel

Chocolate will forever be in demand and demands are meant to be met. That’s exactly what Mount Lavinia Hotel did on the July 7. Like ants to sugary sweets, chocoholics both young and old made their way to enjoy a splendid spread of chocolates. A saccharine haven to the sweet-tooth, the World Chocolate Day buffet was back by popular demand to both treat and delight.
The spread included the skilled expertise of the Hotel Chef’s as a variety of unconventional chocolate types such as spicy, vegan, sugar-free, alcoholic. Many present were astounded as to how this delightful treat – chocolate could be tried out in different ways.
The buffet also included a “Kiddies section” which comprised of painting with chocolate.
Adults were not left out as the “Chocolate Bar”was open for indulgence of the liquor flavored delights.
From the diversity of the chocolate spread, an ever flowing chocolate fountain and a chocoholic enticed atmosphere, the World Chocolate Day at Mount Lavinia Hotel was without a doubt a sweet-memory.
