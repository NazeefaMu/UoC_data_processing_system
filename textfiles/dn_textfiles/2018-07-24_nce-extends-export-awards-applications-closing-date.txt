NCE extends Export Awards Applications closing date

The Annual Export Awards event of the NCE will be conducted on September 28, 2018, in the main Ballroom of the Hotel Shangri-La, Colombo.
This event which is the most looked forward to business event in Sri Lanka, is attended by a distinguished audience of over 750 participants, comprising the cream of the business leaders, and special invitees comprising the Political Leadership, high State Officials and members of the Diplomatic Corps.
The Chamber has decided to extend the closing date of applications by one (01) week from the scheduled July 26 to August 2, due to the increased interest shown by a large number of applicants this year, who have requested more time to submit their applications.
Prospective applicants are requested by the Chamber to submit their comprehensive applications to the Chamber Secretariat, on or before August 2, since the Chamber will not be in a position to grant any further extensions.
