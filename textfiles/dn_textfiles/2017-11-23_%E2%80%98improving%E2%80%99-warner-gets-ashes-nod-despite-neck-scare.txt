‘Improving’ Warner gets Ashes  nod despite neck scare

Brisbane: Australia opener David Warner’s neck injury has improved and he is expected to play in the first Ashes Test against England in Brisbane, captain Steve Smith said Wednesday.
Warner, the team’s vice-captain, hurt his neck while taking a high catch at training this week, but Smith said his condition improved significantly overnight.
“He’s very confident and he says he’ll be right to go,” Smith told reporters ahead of Thursday’s Ashes opener at the Gabba.
“He’ll be OK. It’s part and parcel of playing cricket. Guys have injuries every now and then and have little niggles.
“He’s improved a fair bit over the last 24 hours and hopefully he can keep improving and be 100 percent at match time.”
Smith quipped: “He said he’ll even bat like (West Indian) Shivnarine Chanderpaul (side-on batting stance), if he has to.” -
