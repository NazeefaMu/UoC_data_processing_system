Govt wants ideas of scholars, intellectuals to build country - President

President Maithripala Sirisena said the new government's objective is to take the ideas and proposals of scholars and intellectuals to utmost consideration for the forthcoming programme to build the country.
The President said so addressing the 30th annual summit of the Sri Lanka Economists' Association, held at the auditorium of the Center for Banking Studies Sri Lanka, today yesterday.
He commended the 30 years course of the Economists' Association and expressed his confidence over its close connections with the government in the future too.
President Sirisena pointed out that the knowledge and experience of the scholars are important in the economic, political and cultural reforms of the country. "It is everyone's responsibility to join the programme carried out by the new government to build the country by transforming it to the expectations of the people," he said.
"We should not be elated over our proud history of thousands of years. We should be committed to preserve it for the future generations," the President said.
He stated that the new government's aim is to take the country once again to a self-sufficient economy by developing the indigenous economy. "The government expects to make use of the knowledge, wisdom and experience of the economists in preparing related plans and policies in this regard," the President further stated.
