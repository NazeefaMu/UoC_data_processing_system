Batticaloa graduates protests unemployment on motorcycles

 
Graduates in Batticaloa protested unemployment on motorcycles today.
They began from Gandhi Park, Batticaloa and made their way to Vantharumoolai along the Batticaloa-Trincomalee highway.
The demonstrators have waved black flags and carried their graduation certificates and placards.
President of the unemployed graduates Batticaloa district union T. Kishanth said that they have now conducted their protest for the forty-second time, as the government has failed to respond.
