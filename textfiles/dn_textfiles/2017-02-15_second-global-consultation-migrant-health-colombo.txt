Second Global Consultation on Migrant Health in Colombo

The ‘2nd Global Consultation on Migrant Health: Resetting the Agenda’ will be held in Colombo from February 21 to 23 as a result of a request made to President Maithripala Sirisena at a high-level panel on migration, human mobility and global health, Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama said.
Addressing the media at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said about 10 percent of the population of Sri Lanka (around 1.9 million persons) travel abroad.
The contribution made by Sri Lankan expatriate workers to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is eight percent, he said. Jayawickrama said said 1.8 million tourists visited Sri Lanka in 2015.
The country’s main income generating avenues are based on inbound and outbound migrants. About 1.9 million Sri Lankans work in foreign countries, while another 10,000 Sri Lankans study overseas.
According to Jayawickrama, Sri Lanka has eliminated diseases such as malaria. Such diseases can come back to the country through migrants.
New diseases such as yellow fever can also come into the country through migrants. Migrants’ health plays an important role, he said.
