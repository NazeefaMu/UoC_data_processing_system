Pepper farmers hopeful of better prices

Pepper cultivators in Divulapitiya, Mabodala, Badalgama, Walpita, Withanamulla, Dungah and Kotadeniyava are facing difficulties to sell their products as they do not get a competitive price for their products.
Pepper farmers complain that the reason for this decrease is due to pepper being imported to Sri Lanka from other countries.
Due to this crisis the Agricultural Department has taken steps to stop the importation of pepper and this will help the local pepper cultivators to achieve a good price for their pepper products in the future.
