“School standards have dropped due to poor coaching”:
Tillakaratne hoping to end Lanka’s U19 World Cup win drought

Former Sri Lanka Test captain and member of Sri Lanka’s 1996 World Cup winning side Hashan Tillakaratne said that he wants to build a Sri Lanka under 19 team as strong as the one that toured England in 1986 which included three Test players – Asanka Gurusinha (who captained the side), Roshan Jurangpathy and Sanjeewa Weerasinghe.
“We had a very strong side at that time and I want to do the same slowly and steadily with the present cricketers. I want to teach them their technical part as well as the practical part,” Tillakaratne told the Daily News.
“I have given a short term plan to Sri Lanka Cricket that our under 17 cricketers should play in our domestic Sara trophy which is two-day matches. The Under 19ers I have requested for them to play in our under 23 tournament – 3-day games and in our Premier one-day tournament,” he said.
“I am hoping to put out separate sides so that I can work with them individually. I am not in a hurry I want to prepare them for the 2020 Under19 World Cup. I am looking at their technical part as well as their practical part and I will try and do my level best.”
Tillakaratne was also one of the members of that Sri Lanka Youth side that toured England in 1986 along with Chandika Hathurusingha. They both went onto play for Sri Lanka with distinction.
Comparing the standard of school cricket at the time when he played for DS Senanayake College and today, Tillakaratne said that the standards had dropped and need to be improved.
“We used to float around. I played about six seasons for DS Senanayake first eleven from the age of 14. We were given opportunities to improve our skills by playing in the first eleven team so that by the time you leave college at about 18 you are very mature and have the maturity of a 23 or 24 year-old,” said Tillakaratne. “Today an under 19 boy who represented Sri Lanka cannot even get into a top under 23 club side. The standard has dropped. We need to improve our structure by giving them more opportunities to improve themselves.”
POOR COACHING
Tillakaratne attributed the decline in standards to poor coaching.
“It’s more to do with poor coaching. We were very lucky to have gone through coaches like WAN Silva, PW Perera, Nelson Mendis, Lionel Mendis and Raja Athukorale. Monetary gains were not important to them, they had the passion and they wanted to coach players,” pointed out Tillakaratne who represented his country in 83 Tests and 200 One-Day Internationals between 1986 and 2004 and played in four World Cups (1992, 1996, 1999 and 2003). “Today’s coaches are more concerned about results than improving the technical part of the players. They want to win games, if we can yes, that’s also very important because we all know if you don’t win you will lose the job. But at the same time they must also look at the career of the players. If you have to be successful in the system you have to be technically sound.”
Prior to taking over his new appointment as Sri Lanka under 19 head coach, Tillakaratne had worked with the Under 16 side as batting coach as well helping former coach Roy Dias prepare the under 19 team for the 2018 World Cup for about 2-3 weeks.
“Working with these youngsters I came across so many technical faults and we need to work on them. We have to be patient with the boys and correct them, talk to them nicely so that they could understand their faults,” said Tillakaratne.
“The players are very skillful and talented the only thing is if they are to be successful they have to play against stronger and better sides. In my schooldays I had the privilege of playing with Ranjan Madugalle, Rumesh Ratnayake, Ravi Ratnayeke and AmaI Silva at NCC. I was given the opportunity to play against the best sides at division I Sara level. We must try and give the players stiff opposition so that they will improve themselves.”
“If you look at our school cricket structure we need to improve it. I am sure the schools’ cricket association is doing their level best but still I think it’s not good enough,” Tillakaratne continued. “There is a bit of a communication gap between Sri Lanka Cricket and the Schools Cricket Association. We need to sit with them and talk and get their support.”
LESS PRESSURE UNLIKE TODAY
Tillakaratne (50) was renowned for being a technically sound left-hand middle order batsman who began his international career as a wicket-keeper but later turned out to be an outstanding close-in fielder as well. Despite being recognized more for his obdurate batting in Test matches where he had played many memorable and match saving innings for his team Tillakaratne still managed to find a place in the one-day side as well.
“We didn’t have that much pressure when we were playing because we had a superb one-day as well as a Test side. Today because we are playing in three formats everyone is under pressure and expecting results to win all the games. We didn’t have that much pressure when we were playing, we enjoyed the game and the company,” said Tillakaratne. “We knew our strong points as well as our weaknesses. We had rest days between matches so that we can go back to the drawing board and correct ourselves if we are doing any mistakes. Today every other day we have a match.”
“Playing under Arjuna (Ranatunga) we were given responsibilities and I was one of them. We were not too keen about our personal milestones but just that we were ready to play and bat at any number. I was batting at no. 6 and at times I went down to no. 9. Whatever the team required we were prepared to do it,” Tillakaratne continued.
“Luckily we had two superb openers in Kalu (Romesh Kaluwitharana) and Sanath (Jayasuriya) and with Arjuna batting at no. 5 the responsibility and pressures were taken away from us. Sometimes I didn’t get to bat.”
Tillakaratne said the key factor in Sri Lanka winning the 1996 World Cup was the experience and playing as a team. “Everyone knew what their roles were and they helped each other they knew their strong and weak points.” Tillakaratne who is a qualified Level II and III Global ICC qualified coach is currently coaching the Galle side that is due to play Colombo in the Super Provincial 50-over final at the R Premadasa Stadium on Sunday. He coached them to finish runner-up last year and he was also till recently the batting coach of the Sri Lanka team.
Tillakaratne’s immediate goal is preparing the under 19 players for three important series during the year.
“We are expecting India Under 19 to be here on July 10 for two 4-day games and 5 ODIs, the Bangladesh Under 19 here in October also for two 4-day tests and 5 ODIs and we are expected to go to the Under 19 Asia Cup to India in December,” said Tillakaratne. “My immediate focus is to prepare the players for these series but the ultimate goal is the World Cup which we are working towards. My first goal is to reach the first four of the World Cup and work it on from there. If we can win the World Cup, all the problems will be sorted.”
Sri Lanka has never won the Under 19 Cricket World Cup their best performance being runner-up to India in 2000 when it was played in Colombo.
