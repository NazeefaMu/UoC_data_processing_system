Gallant Army tame spirited Air-men 29-21

The gallant Army sports club rugby team carried out a superb performance to beat a spirited Air Force sports club by 29 points (4 tries, 3 conversions, 1 Drop Goal) to 21 (3 tries, 3 conversions ) in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club league rugby first round match played at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana yesterday.
At half time Army led 19 points to 14.
Both teams dished out a spectacular display of running rugby in the whole game but Army was the pick of the lot where they had an outstanding game both in attack and defence there by coming on top victorious in the end.
Air men staged a spirited performance but could not play the same game plan which they played against the defending champions Kandy SC last week, hence they ended up in the losing side.
The victorious Army Sports Club scored their tries through captain Upul Abeyratne (one), Danushka Pushpakumara (one) Krishantha Liyanage (one) and Sameera Bulathsinghela (one) while full back Gayan Salinda who had a superb game put over the three conversions and fly half Ashen Bandara slotted in the solitary drop goal for the winners.
For the losing Air Force Sports Club Lahiru Udayanga (one) and Thilina Bandara (two), scored the three tries while fly half Gayan Iddamalgoda (two) and full back Nuwan Fernando (one) put over the conversions..
The final score stood at Army Sports Club 29 points to Air Force Sports Club 21.
