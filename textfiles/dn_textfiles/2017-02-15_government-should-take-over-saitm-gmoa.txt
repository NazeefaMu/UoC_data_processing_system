Government should take over SAITM: GMOA

Many persons who deposited money with Golden Key and Sakvithi died of heartbreak after been cheated of their life-savings. Similarly many parents of SAITM students too are undergoing the same trauma. Association (GMOA) Secretary, Dr. Navin de Zoysa said, "We cannot ignore the situation and turn a blind eye and let patients die from wrong treatment. We informed the President that SAITM should be taken over by the Government, Government Medical Officers," he said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA head quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the Sri Lanka Medical Council can appeal to the Supreme Court on the SAITM judgement and other parties too can file cases. "The Presidential Committee is yet to be appointed."
There are about 900 students at SAITM and there are two groups of parents with two different opinions. We have to solve the SAITM issue before commencing the discussion on private medical colleges. We have to stop adding dirt to the existing mountain of dirt," said de Zoysa.
According to the GMOA Secretary, the `minimum quality' for medical education is not the best and highest quality. "The minimum quality only ensure the safety of patients' lives. It is the duty of the Health Minister to ensure the safety of patients who obtain health care services from Sri Lanka. The decision makers will obtain health care services from Singapore, but the poor people are the ones who have to suffer," he said.
"The globally accepted procedure of establishing private medical faculties is to set up a complete teaching hospital, followed by the medical faculty with all facilities and recruiting medical students is the final stage. But in Sri Lanka the procedure has been from the last step to the first," he said.
Dr. Zoysa pointed out that if an effective solution is not given in a week, the GMOA will resort to stern trade union action. The country will be educated on the issue.
The SLMC is a Technical Judiciary. If the Health Minister says the GMOA is not up to standard, his own standard stands questionable as he is also registered with the SLMC.
The SLMC was established through a Parliament Act passed in 1927 and 19th article has clearly vested power on the SLMC to regulate medical education institutions," he added.
