Water management issues deter investors, says Minister

Water management issues prevailing in various part of Sri Lanka have become an impediment to attracting and sustaining investments, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
At a workshop held under the theme ‘Water Resource Management and Allocation for Drinking Water’ at the Cinnamon Grand, Colombo, the Minister said issues in areas such as Iranamadu and Rajanganaya in the distribution and sharing of water had made it difficult for development partners to plan funding within their loan cycle with a projected possibility.
He said that it is timely to set up an authority to look into these matters and find solutions.
In our country, there is still a lot of water flowing to the sea without serving any purpose. In order to ensure the optimum utilisation of water resources, the difference between various stakeholders had to be rectified, the Minister said.
This workshop, jointly organised by the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry and National Water Supply and Drainage Board, was chaired by Minister Hakeem with the participation of of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake and a number of donor agencies.
The objective of this workshop was to enhance the understanding between the Mahaweli Authority, Irrigation Department and National Water Supply and Drainages Board.
The necessity of planning and coordination of water resources, history of water resource management, and combined water resource management and water distribution are some of the topics that were discussed at the workshop.
An active committee was formed to look into the issues that were raised during the session.
