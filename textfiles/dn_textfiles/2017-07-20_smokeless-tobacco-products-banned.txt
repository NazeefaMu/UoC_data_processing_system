Smokeless tobacco products banned

No person shall manufacture, import, sell or offer for sale any specified tobacco products, any smokeless tobacco product or mixture that contains tobacco, any flavoured, coloured or any electronic cigarettes that contains tobacco, National Authority of Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykoon said.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department in Colombo, he said products now available in the market such as Babul, Beeda, Mawa, Pampara and Gurkha are banned in the country. Importing or selling such items is a punishable offence since September 1, 2016 (last year). But still people are not aware of this, he said.
The Dean of the Dental Faculty of Peradeniya University Prof. W. M. Tillakaratne said daily, four persons die in Sri Lanka due to smokeless tobacco use and oral cancer has become the most common cancer in Sri Lankan men.
A recent NATA research revealed that sportsmen in popular Colombo schools use illegal products in order to get a `kick'.
Those illegal products such as Babul, Beeda, Mawa, Pampara and Gurkha are available in the Sri Lankan market in various names including rural women's names. They cause oral cancer. When a person gets an oral cancer, the government spends millions to save him or her and the surgeon has to perform over 20 hours of long surgery. Even after all that, some patients die. Around 1,000 oral cancer patients die annually in Sri Lanka, he said.
