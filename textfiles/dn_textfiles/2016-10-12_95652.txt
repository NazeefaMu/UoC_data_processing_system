When Gleeson brought an aura of mystery to Sri Lanka

When the Australian team led by Bill Lawry arrived in Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) in October 1969 for a four-match tour that included a 3-day unofficial test, the official souvenir put out by the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL as it was known then) described John Gleeson in its pen sketch as follows: “He is a right-arm spin bowler whose unorthodox action puzzled many of the West Indies batsmen early in the Test series. Age 28 he is an accurate bowler who took 26 West Indies Test wickets for an average of 32.4.”
The Ceylon team that was picked to face Lawry’s Australians knew little or nothing of Gleeson. There was no technology or videos unlike today for the national cricketers to prepare themselves before hand. They simply banked on their batting skills, temperament and common sense in dealing with such a mystery bowler who arrived in Sri Lanka with a huge reputation having played a pivotal role in Australia’s 3-1 triumph over West Indies.
“He was like (Jack) Iverson flicking the ball with his middle finger someone like Ajantha Mendis. You didn’t know whether it was a leg break or an off break. We had to play him as best we could - play for the off spin and hope that the leg spin will beat the bat,” was how Michael Tissera who led Sri Lanka in the unofficial test against Australia described Gleeson’s bowling.
Tissera was one of the few Sri Lankan batsmen who got runs against Gleeson in that ‘test’ in fact he made an unbeaten half century (53 n.o.) after they were set a target of 208 for victory. Sri Lanka finished on 132 for five to draw the match. Australia scored 197 and 158-6 decl; and Ceylon 148 and 132-5. Top scorer for Ceylon in the first innings was opener C Balakrishnan (now domiciled in USA) who made 55.
The Ceylon team comprised (in batting order): Dr. Buddy Reid, C Balakrishnan, Anura Tennekoon, Dhanasiri Weerasinghe, Michael Tissera (capt), Dr. HIK Fernando (wk), David Heyn, Neil Chanmugam, Abu Fuard, TB Kehelgamuwa and Daya Sahabandu.
The Australian team comprised (in batting order) Bill Lawry (capt), Keith Stackpole, Ian Chappell, Doug Walters, Ian Redpath, Jock Irvine, Ray Jordan (wk), Graham McKenzie, Ashley Mallett, John Gleeson and Laurie Mayne.
“Those days we didn’t have television, no trainers, no managers nothing we just practiced and played the match. We didn’t do badly against him,” said Tissera.
“The Oval wicket then was a green top it was full of grass all the time and quite often we had never played pace like most of these sides had. It was a matter of just surviving half hour and after that you can bat. The Oval wicket even though it was green was a very true wicket, even bounce. Once you got the hang of it it’s easy to bat on,” he said.
“I am very sorry to hear that John has died. He was a very nice character who sort of went out of his way to get friendly. He even rang me some years later when he was passing through from the airport. It was too short a period for me to rush even and see him.”
Gleeson took 2 for 63 off 30 overs in the first innings of the unofficial test dismissing Chammugam and Kehelgamuwa and 3 for 32 off 15 overs in the second innings scalping Reid, Tennekoon and Weerasinghe.
Prior to the ‘test’ Australians played three one-day matches and in one of them against Central Province at the Asgiriya Stadium, Gleeson ran riot taking 4 for 16 off 12 overs (6 maidens) dismissing Ralston Burke, TD Rajapakse, M Zarook and M Sunderam. Central Province was put out for 72 and Australia who scored 261-5 decl won by 189 runs.
Gleeson who was inspired by Iverson once described his bowling as thus: “It was quite natural for me to bowl a leg-spinner even if it looked like an off-spinner - it was basically a reverse wrong’un: looks like an off-spinner but is a leg-spinner.”
Like all mystery spinners Gleeson didn’t last long enough in cricket. Australian Jack Iverson who was the first of such mystery bowlers played in only one Test series against England in 1950-51 taking 21 wickets (avg. 15.23) in five Tests, Gleeson appeared in 29 Tests in a span of five years and took 93 wickets (avg. 36.30), while Sri Lanka’s Ajantha Mendis who began so promisingly in 2008 has taken 70 wickets (avg. 34.77) in 19 Tests. He has not appeared in a Test for his country since 2014.
Mystery bowlers are good for the game because the aura of mystery they bring about keeps everyone guessing and on their toes for as long as they last.
