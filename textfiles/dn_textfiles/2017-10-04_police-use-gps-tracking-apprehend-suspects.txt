Police to use GPS tracking to apprehend suspects

Police are appealing for information regarding the whereabouts of two suspects following Monday’s discovery of three T 56 rifles from a parked car near the Gampaha hospital.
Meanwhile, Gampaha Police have launched an operation to track down the suspects using satellite-based Global Positioning Systems(GPS), Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekera said.
“The suspects have left the vehicle, which contained the firearms near the hospital. The car is a black hybrid type,” Police said.
Investigations so far have revealed that the suspects had obtained the vehicle from a car hire company in Pannipitiya and changed the number plates.
Police said the two suspects are from Samithpura, Mattakkuliya and Amaratunga Mawatha, Udahamulla.
Any information regarding them may be provided to the Gampaha Police Headquarters on telephone Nos 033-2222226 or to HQI 071-8591611.
