Pathfinder Foundation to conduct conference  on enhancing Indo-Lanka connectivity

The Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives of the Pathfinder Foundation, Carnegie India together with Vivekananda International Foundation (India) will conduct a conference on April 28, 2017 in Colombo.
Leading academics, professionals, subject matter experts and scholars from both the countries will discuss six major areas of concept of connectivity.
This conference will focus on three broad themes; past connectivity and the sources of decay; identifying the current possibilities; assessing the enduring obstacles and exploring ways to overcome them. At the second stage of the project, specific sectors could be taken up for more detailed examination.
The six major sectors will be cover with this conference included coastal shipping in the Bay of Bengal framework, multi modal surface and air links between Sri Lanka and Peninsular India, developing and promoting religious tourism, power grid connectivity and finally energy security through the strategic storage of hydrocarbons; resilient international telecom connectivity in the context of UN ESCAP’s vision of an Asia Pacific Information Superhighway.
The main outcome from the workshop could be a report to be circulated among the policy makers in both capitals and interested stakeholders in regional and global institutions.
Enhancing connectivity, which has been a subject of discussion in the SAARC and BIMSTEC context, has also been a major national priority for both India and Sri Lanka. Promoting internal, trans-border and regional connectivity have become an urgent imperative for both nations, as they seek to sustain their rapid economic growth into the coming decades. Both Delhi and Colombo have rediscovered their geographic advantages and are determined to leverage these. India is now acutely conscious of its geo-economics location at the cross-roads of Asia and the heart of the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka has begun to emphasize its Indian Ocean identity and wants to leverage its position as the maritime fulcrum of the trade routes in the Indo-Pacific littoral. While past policies of self-reliance and the dynamic of local conflict devalued connectivity between the two nations, two and a half decades of economic liberalization have compelled Delhi and Colombo to focus on privileging their physical proximity. Trade volumes have rapidly grown in recent years, and so have mutual investments. The growing infrastructure linkages between the two countries are reflected in the fact that Colombo has become the second largest port (after Mumbai) for the movement of goods in and out of India.
Delhi and Colombo have signaled the political will to build on this interdependence and deepen connectivity between the two nations. But a host of problems have limited the progress.
These include political, economic, financial and institutional issues as well as entrenched popular apprehensions. Any effort to promote connectivity between the two countries must be understood by the ease of movement across the frontiers in the past and its deterioration in the second half of the 20th century due to the armed conflict and changing political dynamics.
