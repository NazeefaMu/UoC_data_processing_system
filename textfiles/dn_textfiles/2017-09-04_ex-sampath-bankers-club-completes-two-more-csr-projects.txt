Ex Sampath Bankers  Club completes two  more CSR projects

Ex Sampath Bankers Club completed its first CSR project when it set up a Children’s Library at a school which lacked many facilities as the children were all from very poor families in the area.
Duwegoda Primary School which is located in Halkadawala a remote area in the Kalutara District. The Executive Council of the Club took a decision to continue to assist the same school by engaging in more CSR projects in order to stay focused and continue to improve the school’s facilities .
The representatives of the Club who visited the school observed that the standard of English of the students was very poor. It was impossible for the only English teacher in the school to single handedly handle the gigantic task of teaching English to all students in the school.
Almost all the parents were not literate in English which added to the problem. Therefore the Executive Council of the Club decided to engage a teacher from a school nearby to provide English tuition to the students.
The classes were started in March 2017 and it was heartening to see that the students can now have a simple conversation about their personal details in English. Furthermore, they were very keen and were happy to be learning the language.
Sampath Bank provided the thirty nine school with bags along with tills and they were presented to the new students at this ceremony.
The school principal, teachers and the parents in their speeches expressed their appreciation of the contribution made by the Club to fulfill a long felt need of this poor remote school. Ex Sampath Bankers Club thanked all those who contributed towards this worthy cause and looks forward to their continued support for its future projects as well.
