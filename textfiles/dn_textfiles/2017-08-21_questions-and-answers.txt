Questions and answers

Asking for a sample under RTI Act
Question
I reside in a house close to a main road which is under construction. We complained to the Urban Council several times to construct the road properly. However, the construction work had been given to a private constructing company. We doubt whether quality of the concrete is up to standards. Can I ask on behalf of all the villagers for a concrete sample under the Right to Information Act? From whom should I ask for information?

Answer
Under the Right Act No. 12 of 2016 “information” includes any material which is recorded in, in any form including records, documents, memos, emails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, log books, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, correspondence, memorandum, draft legislation, book, plan, map, drawing, diagram, pictorial or graphic work, photograph, film, microfilm, sound recording, video tape, machine readable record, computer records and other documentary material, regardless of its physical form or character and any copy thereof;
Therefore, you can request for a concrete sample under RTI Act. The next question is from whom you should ask? First you can request for information about the construction company. After finding details, you can ask them to provide sample of concrete they are using to construct the road. Because according to the interpretation section of the RTI Act (Section 43), ‘Public Authority’ includes ‘a private entity or organization which is carrying out a statutory or public function or service, under a contract, a partnership, an agreement or a license from the government or its agencies or from a local body, but only to the extent of activities covered by that statutory or public function or service.
