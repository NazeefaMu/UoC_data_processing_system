Fast unto death over transfer of colleagues

Two drivers attached to the North Central Province Health Department, climbed the roof of the Provincial Health Directors Office carrying cans of petrol and kerosene and staged a fast protesting against the transfer of four of their driver colleagues to another department yesterday.
The two drivers Roland Mendis and R. B. Dissanayake threatened to commit suicide by setting themselves ablaze unless authorities differed the transfer orders by noon yesterday.
They were supporting the four transferred drivers staging a satyagraha opposite the Health Directors Office for the 12th consecutive day yesterday, to protest against their transfer.
