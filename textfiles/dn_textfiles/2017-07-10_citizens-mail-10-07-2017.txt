KANDY’S HEARTBREAKING AMBULANCES
Recently for two consecutive weeks, I happened to be in Kandy on some work and stayed on Mahamaya Mawatha, above the Kandy Garden Club, at a Guest House for three successive weekdays each time. Each morning between 6.30 and 8 a.m. one could hear the roar and the horns of the traffic below on the Lake bund road.
What was most distressing was the wail of sirens of many an ambulance heading to and from Kandy General Hospital. Today everyone is very concerned about the Dengue epidemic and they are further concerned about the dumping of garbage and pollution of the environment, quite rightly.
Similarly, don’t we have a heart for those who could be terminally ill and needing emergency treatment at the Kandy General Hospital? The time saved going directly to hospital past the Dalada Maligawa could save many lives, I am sure. I appeal to the Most Venerable Mahanayakas of Malwatta and Asgiriya together with the authorities concerned to consider opening up the road by the Dalada Maligawa and save lives, by permitting at least the travel of ambulances carrying patients, which could be security checked before the Maligawa and Queens Hotel.
They should be allowed to pass through without stopping (preferably with only lights flashing), preserving the sanctity of the Dalada Maligawa.
