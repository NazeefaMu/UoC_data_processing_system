SriLankan cautions Public on fake survey

SriLankan Airlines informs the public of a fake airline survey circulating on internet and social media including messenger apps, mentioning SriLankan Airlines offering free tickets.
This is not a SriLankan Airlines promotion,the company said yesterday. “This is a malicious and false site that is attempting to prey on our valued customers. Please do not access any sites that are not directly linked to SriLankan Airlines webpage.
The airline is currently offering a “Partner flies free” promotional offer that can only be accessed via www.srilankan.com.
“SriLankan Airlines will not undertake any responsibility with regard to promotional campaigns not carried out directly by the airline. Public are advised to log onto www.srilankan.com for any promotional offers and refrain giving personal information to any other websites mentioning SriLankan Airlines,” the release said.
