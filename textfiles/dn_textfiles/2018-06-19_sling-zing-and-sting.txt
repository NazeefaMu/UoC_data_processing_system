The sling, the zing and the sting!

If you really want to grab the attention of your classmates or co-workers, shoot them in the neck with a rubber band. That’s right, I said a rubber band. You graduated from middle school and found your way to a desk job, but that doesn't mean you have to leave rubber-band-powered projectile launchers behind.
But have you ever wondered what the relationship is between a stretched rubber band at rest and the energy it holds? The energy the rubber band has stored is related to the distance the rubber band will fly after being released.
Every child who has been in a rubber band battle instinctively knows the longer you stretch a rubber band, the farther it will go. This is true unless the rubber band is pulled too far and begins to break. So you see, the case does involve some very fundamental idea of physics.
Growing up, a rubber band war was something my friends and I engaged in for fun. In fact, we would collect discarded rubber bands and use them as ammunition to launch at our friends when the teachers had their backs turned. They would be completely scattered throughout our classrooms. Yes, rubber band wars were darned exciting and every one had a sore finger by the end.
Yes, I know what you are thinking … very immature. However, if my personal experience is any indication, your ability to master this skill will mean the difference between being bored and being joyfully occupied even in the most jaded times. This classic game is fun to play and will improve your hand-eye coordination skills and ability to aim correctly while judging the level of force required to hit target.
Since they were patented in 1845, rubber bands have been put to a staggering variety of uses. The humble rubber band, I learned, has a very curious history and if one rubber band manufacturer is to be believed, there’s about to be a lot more, as science is set to create a major upgrade to the old office standby. And that is not stretching things too far.
There are many uses for rubber bands, inside and outside the classroom and workplace. They are used to wrap around flowers for a special occasion, bind wads of money at the bank, hold vegetables together in the supermarket and in foreign climes to secure the newspapers when landing on your front lawn.
Bands are used at the hairdressers for ponytails, horses’ tails at show jumping events, holding dental braces at the orthodontist, packaging in the warehouse, specialist industrial and engineering applications, art and craft lessons at school and of course slingshots anywhere.
You actually don’t need to buy or turn out a shooter to make a rubber band fly across a room. You can ingeniously make a cheap and safe version of a rubber band gun using only your hand! The most-complicated, but also most-classic way of firing a rubber band is by shaping your hand into a gun and wrapping the band around to really let it fly. To fire a rubber band this way: Make your hand into a gun shape, with your thumb as the hammer and your index finger as the barrel.
Point your index finger in the direction you want the rubber band to go. Hook the band around your pinkie, (little finger) pulling it back toward the inside of your wrist. Hook the band all the way around your thumb. Secure it on the very tip of your pointer finger. To release the rubber band, let go with your pinkie.
I learned these methods some four decades ago from a translator on the very newspaper this column is published in. We called him Jules, which of course was close to his unlikely real name. He was the supreme office sniper and expert at shooting rubber bands with his hand. Jules claimed that work never got boring when there were elastic bands lying around the office. Being a great aerodynamicist he claimed that shooting bands at his colleagues with unerring accuracy was simply a snap.
Besides his incurable obsession to spring elastic bands at people there were other reasons why you would have wanted to slug him. The guy wore his hair long, sported a Zapata moustache and walked with his arms flailing like a tight-rope walker frantically trying to balance himself.
He found the itch to sling rubber bands into co-workers’ backsides irresistible. He was no spring chicken but never thought himself too old for that type of horseplay. In similarity to James Bond he imagined he had the license to sting whenever a tempting rump was within his sights. There were times when he sparked a contretemps in the editorial for this particular transgression, such as when he seared the bottoms of a brace of hot-tempered sub-editors.
It can’t be all work and no play in the office. There were few things more satisfying to your childhood self than hearing that sharp thwack as a flung rubber band hit its target. Some people may think they are too old for that type of tomfoolery now. But who can resist shooting an adversary and hear him yelp when you hit target.
Rubber bands were made to be fired. Well, okay, maybe they were made to ‘hold stuff in place,’ but come on, chappies. It's just too tempting to give the back of someone’s ear or their rump a bit of a sting from the back of the classroom when the teacher is not looking. If you've ever been shot with a rubber band from behind then you know it has energy in it — enough energy to smack you in the ear or neck and cause a sting!
This is what happened in the newspaper editorial offices of old: Someone shot a rubber band at someone else. They returned fire. Soon, things escalated into a full-scale battle in the editorial. Staff were ducking behind their desks and firing off paper clips at coworkers, rubber bands were flying through the air and no actual work was getting done.
Editorials are places with stressful deadlines. No editorial would be complete without rubber bands to fiddle with or ping. Whether you're tormenting your enemies or enforcing elastic justice, you won't find a better tool for the job.
Here is my advice for livening up any editorial. The rubber band is capable of inflicting first and second degree welts, contusions, and bruises, on the supple flesh of its targets. For safety's sake, it should only be wielded by a trustworthy and licensed adult. For fun's sake, place it in the hands of your craziest, most demented, deranged, unbalanced, loose-cannon of a friend and watch the rubber fly!
