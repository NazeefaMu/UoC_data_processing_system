Harvest of Buddhist books

Renowned scholar Chamika Munasinghe recently published a host of Buddhist books: Budu Himi Piriniveemata Pera (authored by Ven Dodampahala Sri Rahula Thera), Budun Davasa Asirimath Katha and Tirisan Kulaye Upanath Bosath (authored by Halaliye Karunatilaka). Budun Piriniveemata Pera deals with the core teachings found in Parinibbana Sutta.
The other two books authored by Halaliye Karunatilaka will be launched at Sahitha Poth Piyasa premises, 717/1 (near Ananda College) on May 27 at 10 am. The copies will be available with the author’s signature.
