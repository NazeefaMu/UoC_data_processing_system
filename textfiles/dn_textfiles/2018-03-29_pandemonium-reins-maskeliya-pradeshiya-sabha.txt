Pandemonium reins at Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha

Police had to be summoned to restore order to the inaugural meeting of the Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha held at the ‘Ambal’ hall to elect the Chairman and Vice Chairman, which ended up in a clash between the Ceylon Workers Congress supporters and Jathika Kamkaru Sangamaya supporters outside the venue, yesterday.
When the meeting started, presided by Central Province Local Government Commissioner Menaka Herath, all 7 CWC members and 6 of the 7 UNP members were present. The CWC proposed G. Sembalawalli for the post of Chairman and she was elected uncontested as no other names were proposed for the post.
Thereafter, the SLFP appointed member P. Periyanan Pradeepan was elected uncontested as the Vice Chairman as no other names were proposed. Thereafter, the six members of the Jathika Kamkaru Peramuna representing the UNP submitted a letter to the Local Government Commissioner protesting against the election of the Chairman alleging that one member appointed to its list from the UNP had been abducted by the CWC group and the election was illegal. However, the Commissioner maintained that the election was legal as 8 members were present to fulfill the quorum.
Thereafter, members of the Jathika Kamkaru Peramuna conducted a protest campaign outside the 'Ambal' hall with their supporters obstructing the access road to the Maskeliya town and the Maskeliya-Samimale road.
This led to a clash between the CWC supporters and Jathika Kamkaru Sangamaya supporters hurling bricks and stones against each other. Several people were injured in the attack.
A police team deployed by Hatton SP Ravindra Ambepitiya managed to restore order. Several police teams were also deployed in the Maskeliya town to maintain law and order.
The national organiser of the Kamkaru Jathika Peramuna Kanapathi Naguleswaran speaking to the media said they would go to Courts and seek a remedy against the injustice caused by certain politicians.
