Cricket Australia chief Sutherland to stand down

Sydney, Wednesday: Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland announced Wednesday he will stand down in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal that rattled the game and an acrimonious pay dispute with players.   
Sutherland, who has been chief executive for 17 of his 20 years with Cricket Australia, has given 12 months’ notice and will continue in his role until a suitable replacement is found.   
“After nearly 20 years at Cricket Australia, the time is right. I feel very comfortable that this is the right time for me and a good time for the game,” he said.   
Sutherland becomes the latest in a growing list of changes in Australian cricket over recent months.   
He came under intense pressure in March when former captain Steve Smith, his deputy David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft attempted to alter the ball in the third Test in South Africa. AFP
