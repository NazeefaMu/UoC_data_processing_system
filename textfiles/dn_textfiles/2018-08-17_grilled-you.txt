 Hilton Colombo’s Japanese restaurant Ikoi Tei located at the Dutch Hospital Shopping Precinct is serving Okonomiyaki; a delicious and tempting Japanese savory pancake containing a variety of ingredients. The name is derived from the word okonomi, meaning “how you like” or “what you like”, and yaki meaning “grill”. The promotion is on from August 15 to 24 during lunch and dinner at Ikoi Tei.
The a la carte menu consists Mix Okonomiyaki (Pork, shrimp, squid), Big Prawn Okonomiyaki, Cheese and Corn Okonomiyaki, Pork Okonomiyaki, Chicken Okonomiyaki, Seafood Okonomiyaki and Vegetable Okonomiyaki.
