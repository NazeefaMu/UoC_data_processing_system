RPCs profitably diversify through sustainable oil palm cultivation

Under the management of Sri Lankan Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs), the domestic plantation sector has been able to achieve important progress towards the diversification of its traditional mix of cash crops.
Internationally, palm oil remains a ubiquitous part of modern life, being commonly utilised as primary ingredient in food, soaps, cosmetics, candles, bio-fuel, animal feed and many other consumer products.
While approximately 64.5 million tonnes of palm oil was produced globally in 2016, demand for the commodity has outpaced global production.
The first efforts towards the establishment of the very first oil palm plantations in Sri Lanka were carried out by Carson Cumberbatch in the 1960s, before subsequently coming under the management of Watawala Plantations PLC, currently the largest oil palm cultivator in the country with approximately 3,157 hectares under cultivation under a diversification effort that began over a decade ago.
Following in these pioneering footsteps, several other RPCs have since entered the sector. Namunukula Plantations PLC manages an extent of 2,020 hectares of oil palm under cultivation, followed by Elpitiya Plantations PLC with 1,571 hectares and Agalawatte Plantations PLC with 1,294 hectares at the start of the current financial year.
Together, these top three producers also operate an oil palm processing plant as a highly successful joint venture.
Kegalle Plantations PLC is planning to plant 1,125 acres of oil palm in its current rubber fields, while Bogawantalawa Tea Estates PLC has also announced its intentions to plant 700 hectares of oil palm in the near future.
Among these prominent RPC diversifications into the oil palm industry is Elpitiya Plantations PLC. of Talgaswala Estate, a low country plantation situated in close proximity to Galle, which is the site of one of the island's most successful oil palm plantations. Managed by the Aitken Spence Group since 1997, the company's seven low elevation estates have undergone a strategic realignment following a more concerted diversification into oil palm cultivation that expands on the preliminary oil palm crop established in Sri Lanka during the 1960s. Its General Manager - Low Country, A.G. Geethkumara is a veteran of the industry who possesses extensive academic qualifications in agriculture and plantation management.
“Oil palm is an extremely valuable crop that is highly prized on international markets due to the sheer variety of applications for the oil it produces. While demand for oil palm is already extremely high, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental impact of irresponsible oil palm cultivation, they are also more willing to pay a premium for sustainably cultivated alternatives, and this is an area which we are confident that Sri Lankan RPCs can tap into, given the exemplary and extremely stringent environmental conservation standards in place within the RPC sector,” he said.
“At present there is almost no evidence whatsoever to show that oil palm is in-and-of-itself, detrimental to the environment and these findings are based on extensive research over an extended period of time across globe.
In fact most of the resistance to oil palm cultivation stems more from a reluctance to adapt mindsets than it does with the actual physical properties of oil palm. But here too, attitudes are changing very quickly, and within our own plantations, we've had no real issues with oil palm, and this too is because our employees themselves are strongly in favour of oil palm cultivation. Simply put, it requires less labour to earn substantially more per harvest than any of the other major cash crops,” he said.
“The fact that Sri Lanka has such strict regulations in place around the plantation industry, both through our statutory obligations and through voluntary binding standards imposed on the companies as part of securing the numerous international certifications in which Sri Lankan regional plantation companies (RPCs) have set international benchmarks,” Geethkumara said.
“Oil palm requires far less labour to harvest and the harvesting work is less frequent and less intensive than what is required to maintain our tea plantations. These factors align extremely well with the current trends in our industry, at a time when labour shortages are a serious challenge."
“Given this fact we are able to gather significantly greater value out of each harvest since 25% of the total weight is oil. Hence, this crop stands as one of the most promising options for crop diversification in Sri Lanka,” Geethkumara said.
