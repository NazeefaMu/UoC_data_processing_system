Plantation housing scheme used for political advantage: CWRFU

The Ceylon Workers’ Red Flag Union (CWRFU) accused Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Ministry officials of using the plantation housing development scheme to increase the number of members to the trade union and party affiliated with the minister.
In a statement to the media, CWRFU General Secretary Menaka Kandasamy stated that the high ranking officials were using development projects as a means to coerce and intimidate workers to join the party and its trade union.
“It is the right of every worker to join a trade union of his or her choice. During the membership drive in December, we have evidence that in areas such as Deniyaya and Maskeliya, workers have been told that they would not get houses if they did not join the trade union of the minister and his party. In Deniyaya, officials have publicly stated thus,” the CWRFU release added.
The release added that political and resource powers of Deniyaya Pradeshiya Sabha were being used for such activities.
“It is the responsibility of the minister and ministry including the government to ensure that all citizens gain benefits from development projects regardless of their political affiliations and not use it to their own political advantage. This is clear misuse of state resources and constitutes as corruption,” it added.
The plantation housing scheme which was initially promised during the 100 day programme built 400 houses during that period. In 2016, the ministry stated that they built a further 1,100 houses and in 2017 they plan to build 10,000 houses.
The target is to have 50,000 houses built for those in the plantation sector by 2020. 
Minister says...
Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister P. Thigambaram who is also the leader of the National Union of Workers, contacted by the Daily News with regard to the allegations, said all houses were given through the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT) and Estate Administration Offices and that they knew of it better than he.
