Film Corporation ex-employees’ union lauds distribution decision

The decision taken by the government to restore the right of distribution of films to the National Film Corporation would augur well to ensure a bright future for the local cinema industry and staff of the National Film Corporation, states the National Film Corporation ex-employees’ union in a press release issued on June 21.
The removal of the right of distribution from the Film Corporation nearly two decades ago, not only sent the local film industry into deep crisis, but also denied film goers the opportunity to view quality films, the release signed by union President N.H. Ratnapala said.
The decision taken by the government to restore this right to the Corporation, even belatedly, is highly appreciated by the union members who are in retirement.
While thanking Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and his ministry for taking this bold decision, the statement wished him and the Chairman and Board of Directors of the Film Corporation strength and courage to cater to the welfare of the local film industry without falling prey to the machinations of cunning and opportunist sections.
