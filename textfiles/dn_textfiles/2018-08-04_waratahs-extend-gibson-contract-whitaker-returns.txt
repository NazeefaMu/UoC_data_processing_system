Waratahs extend Gibson contract, Whitaker returns

Sydney, Friday: Daryl Gibson has been given a one-year contract extension as NSW Waratahs coach, the club said Friday, after a “remarkable” season that saw him lead the team to the Super Rugby semi-finals.
Gibson, who has been in charge of the Sydney club for three seasons, will be assisted by former Wallabies scrumhalf Chris Whitaker as Chris Malone departs after three years.
Whitaker, who raked up 107 caps for the Tahs between 1997 and 2006, is returning to the harbour city after two years as co-head coach of French club Montauban, and stints with Stade Francais and Irish club side Leinster. “The knowledge and experience you gain overseas is great but it is time for me to come home and contribute to the game and a state that has given so much to me and my family throughout my career,” Whitaker said in a statement.
“Rugby in Australia is improving and I couldn’t pass on the chance to help further develop and grow the potential we have here.” Gibson said he was proud of the team’s achievements over the past year, and that he was “excited about what’s to come”.
He also bid farewell to assistant coach Malone, who has finished up with the club after the losing semi-final clash with the Lions in Johannesburg last weekend. AFP
