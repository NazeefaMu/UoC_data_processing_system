HFHSL celebrates National Housing Day providing homes for landslide victims in Kegalle

In celebration of National Housing Day, Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka (HFHSL) ceremoniously handed over 80 houses constructed for families affected by landslides in the Kegalle District in Aranayake, Sri Lanka.
This project was launched by Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka in partnership with Alwaleed Philanthropies in January 2017, as part of a Disaster Response initiative to assist families affected by Cyclone Roanu which struck Sri Lanka in May 2016.
In response to this disaster HFHSL launched the ‘Kegalle Housing Project’, estimated at nearly Eighty Million Sri Lankan Rupees to construct homes for 80 families in the Divisional Secretariats of Aranayake, Deraniyagala and Yatiyantota.
Providing safe housing solutions to more than 350 affected people, each completed house constructed through this project contained disaster resilient features recommended by the National Building and Research Organization (NBRO).
Commenting on the project, HFHSL President and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Lakshan Madurasinghe said, “At Habitat for Humanity, we believe that every Sri Lankan deserves a decent place to live. I am very proud of the impact Habitat Sri Lanka has been able to create through the Kegalle Housing Project. In merely six months HFHSL has been able to help rebuild the lives of 80 families who lost their homes and livelihoods, which is indeed a great achievement. We are sincerely grateful to Alwaleed Philanthropies for their generosity and their support.”
Operating in Sri Lanka since 1995, Habitat for Humanity has supported more than 23,000 families by building and improving places they can call home.
HFHSLis currently engaged in implementing a project funded by the European Union which aims to construct and repair nearly 2,400 houses in Batticaloa, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu by 2019.
Apart from housing construction, Habitat Sri Lanka also helps families to build or repair water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities and provides WASH training in communities, and is currently supporting rural communities in the Matale District to gain access to safe drinking water and to construct adequate sanitation facilities.
