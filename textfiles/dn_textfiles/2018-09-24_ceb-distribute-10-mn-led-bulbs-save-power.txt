CEB to distribute 10 mn LED bulbs to save power

The CEB plans to purchase 10 million LED bulbs through an open international tender and provide them to consumers at a subsidised price to encourage them to use electricity sparingly, Power and Rrenewable Energy Minister D. Ranjith Siyambalapitya said.
“Using electricity sparingly is equally important as generating it,” the Minister said. “Today more than two million people use ordinary electricity bulbs for lighting as they cannot afford the more expensive LED bulbs.”
The Minister was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the Rupavahini Volleyball Tournament at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium, Colombo, on Saturday.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said in the future they hoped to provide these LED bulbs to consumer houses using less than 90 units of electricity per month, through the meter readers. One could save 60 percent of electricity by using an LED bulb instead of a normal bulb.
According to projections, by using these 10 million LED bulbs during peak hours, they hoped to save 300 megawatts of electricity, which is almost equal to installing an additional power plant, the Minister said.
