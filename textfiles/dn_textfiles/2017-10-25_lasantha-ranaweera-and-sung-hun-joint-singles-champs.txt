Thailand Open Wheelchair Tennis C’ship
Lasantha Ranaweera and Sung Hun joint singles champs

Sri Lanka’s wheelchair tennis ace Lasantha Ranaweera achieved another milestone of Sri Lanka’s wheelchair tennis history when he emerged joint singles champion with Korea’s Sung Hun in the ITF Futures Series’ Thailand Open Wheelchair Tennis Championship concluded in Thailand yesterday.
Ranaweera registered a comfortable first set win 6/4 over his Korean opponent in the final and was 2/5 down when the game was abandoned due to rain, where referee declared both finalists joint champions. Ranaweera beat Korean number one, Im Ho in the quarters and went on to defeat number two Korean player, Lee Ha Gel in the semis to enter the final against another Korean. Ranaweera with his team mate D.S.R. Dharmasena secured the third place in the main draw doubles event adding more value to Sri Lanka’s international wheelchair tennis profile.
Ranaweera’s achievement ended Sri Lanka’s long standing title drought in Thailand Open, making him the first Lankan to clinch the singles title. Sri Lanka has been participating in this prominent regional tournament for the past 16 years and this is the highest achievement so far on Thailand soil.
Speaking to the Daily News, national wheelchair tennis coach Jagath Welikala said that these victories will surely boost confidence in our players as both Ranaweera and Dharmasena will take part in back to back tournaments, Bangkok Open Wheelchair Tennis Championship from October 26 to 28 and Malaysian Open WTC from November 30. “Our players participated in ITF Series one wheelchair tournament in Belgium last July where they had the opportunity to play with some of the world’s top contenders. That highest level international exposure helped them a lot to prepare for this tournament and I hope that they will perform much better in Bangkok and Malaysian Opens. Our main focus is the forthcoming two important international events, Paralympics and World Cup qualifiers which will be held next year, Welikala revealed.
