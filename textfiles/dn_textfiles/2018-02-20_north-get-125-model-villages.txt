North to get 125 model villages

The National Housing Development Authority will build 125 new model villages in the Northern Province this year for the benefit of families displaced by war, Chairman of the Authority Lakvijaya Sagara Palansuriya said.
The model villages will be located in Mannar, Vavuniya, Killinochchi and Mullaitivu districts, he added. Last year, 48 model villages were built in these areas for the war displaced.
The construction work would be undertaken with the labour contribution of beneficiary families themselves. The political leadership in the Northern Province was also supporting this programme without any political bias and this was a great victory achieved on the part of Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, he said.
Similar housing programmes were being implemented in the Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee district in the Eastern Province too for the benefit of affected families, Palansuriya said. Work on the model villages programme in the North had been already launched since the Minister had directed that construction work be completed by October this year.
