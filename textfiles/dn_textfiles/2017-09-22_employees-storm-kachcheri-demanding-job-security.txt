Employees storm Kachcheri demanding job security

A group of employees attached to the North Central Provincial Road Development Authority stormed the Anuradhapura Kachchri yesterday after a protest demonstration demanding job security, following the plans to transform the Authority into a Department.
They said their jobs in the Authority are at stake following the conversion of the Authority into a Department without prior notice with effect from September 1. North Central Provincial Governor P. B. Dissanayake rushed to the scene and promised to provide a solution today after discussions with Minister Duminda Dissanayake.The protestors then dispersed saying they trusted the pledge made by the Government.
