Entry fee to be charged at Unawatuna beach

A special entry fee is to be charged from both foreign and local tourists entering the picturesque Unawatuna beach area shortly by issuing entry tickets. This decision was taken by the Habaraduwa Development Committee at a meeting held at the Habaraduwa Divisional Secretariat auditorium on August 14.
This followed a proposal made by Habaraduwa MOH Sundara Mudalige. Committees Co-President Habaraduwa UNP Chief Organiser Chandralal Abeygunawardena presided. Mudalige said a special levy charged from tourists would help facilitate environmental protection as well as safeguarding the health of visitors to the tourist spot.
Abeygunawardena, who directed officials to implement the proposal, suggested that an entry ticket could be priced at least Rs. 20 each.
“The environment could not be protected through popular decisions. Such decisions had to be taken in public and environment interest even though it would be unpopular,” he added. Habaraudwa Divisional Secretary Tharanga Wickramaratne, who said that it was a very important step, promised to implement it without delay.
