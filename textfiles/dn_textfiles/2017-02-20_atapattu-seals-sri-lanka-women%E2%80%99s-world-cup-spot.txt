Atapattu seals Sri Lanka Women’s World Cup spot

Former captain Chamari Atapattu starred with the bat as Sri Lanka clinched a rain-curtailed game played at the NCC grounds by 42 runs on D/L method against Bangladesh yesterday to seal their World Cup berth.
India, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Pakistan complete the eight-team line-up for the 2017 ICC Women’s World Cup, slated to be held in the UK in June-July. Australia, England, New Zealand and West Indies qualified directly, having finished in the top-four of the 2014-16 ICC Women’s ODI Championship.
Put into bat first, Nipuni Hansika and Hasini Perera got Sri Lanka off to a decent start, before Atapattu added fifty runs for the second wicket with the latter.
Bangladesh then managed to take wickets at regular intervals to restrict the hosts, but the left-hander stood tall, making 84 off 114 balls with eight fours and a six, as Salma Khatun bowled a tight line to take three wickets.
Chasing 198, Nigar Sultana fought hard in the top-order, but Bangladesh were never really in the hunt as Udeshika Prabodhani took two wickets in her first two overs. Shaila Sharmin looked determined to take the attack to the opposition, but lost partners cheaply, before rain ensured no more play was possible after 21 overs with the scoreboard reading 68 for 5. The loss confirmed Bangladesh’s exit from the World Cup race.
