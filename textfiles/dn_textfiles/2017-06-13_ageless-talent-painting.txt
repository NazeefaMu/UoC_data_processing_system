Ageless talent in painting

E. Wijesinghe of Jayanthipura engages in paintings at 'Pathana', along Hatton-Nuwaraeliya road, depicting mostly beauties of the Devon waterfall and its surroundings.
He has been creating landscape paintings for nearly three decades. He is 70 years of age now but his ability in painting is ageless.
Every passing day art lovers gather around him and ask him many questions about his creations and the painter answers them softly.
"I use fabric for my paintings. It adds an extra shine to my paintings. I already drew and sold a large number of paintings, he said. "Foreigners admire my paintings and they encourage me and pay for my creations very well, Wijesinghe said. "I thank guides who direct tourists towards me," he said.
