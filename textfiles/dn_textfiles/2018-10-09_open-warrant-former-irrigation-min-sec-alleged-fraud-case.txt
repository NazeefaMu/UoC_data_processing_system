Open warrant on former Irrigation Min. Sec. in alleged fraud case

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne yesterday issued an open warrant for the arrest of former Irrigation Ministry Secretary Ivan de Silva over a Rs.4012 million financial fraud alleged to have taken place in the Gin-Nilwala Diversion Project.
The Magistrate also instructed that the warrant be issued in English to Interpol and for a copy of it to be sent to the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration as well.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order pursuant to a request made by the FCID who requested that the open warrant be reissued since there was no responses from Interpol to the previous warrant.
The FCID has informed the Courts that the suspect has evaded the investigations and he is now reported to be living in New Zealand.
His banking records have shown that Rs.7,822,000.00 of this money has being circulated through 11 cheques. It has also been revealed that Rs.2,220,000.00 from this money has been encased and allegedly deposited in the suspects’ sisters’ husbands account some time back.
