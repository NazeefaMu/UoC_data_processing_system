The Weekend stayed by Selena’s side

It was recently reported that Selena Gomez underwent a kidney transplant. During this period, The Weeknd, was her source of support. A source told People.com that the singer scheduled his performances according to her medical emergencies. “It was a super serious operation and all her friends were worried,” the source added.
The Weeknd was in between dates of his Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour from July 22 to August 6, then again until September 6. He took some time off from the tour to stay with his girlfriend. While he was initially announced as a performer for the 2017 MTV VMAs, he was a no-show. His Grey Goose-sponsored show was also canceled last-minute. Agencies
