Shifting sands of national rugby

The club 2016 season gave Kandy SC their best account yet again, and much credit to the management and coaching staff headed by newly stepped up Sean Wijeysinghe, Nalaka Weerakody and company. Lasantha Wijesuriya is rugby chairman Kandy SC and needs to clear two more spaces in the trophy cabinet to welcome the league and knockout silverware.
Grand celebrations marked the clubs return to winning ways and their special brand of rugby - good teams are built on the quality of players and hardwork. Simple principles that drill the mind more than the body ...instilling confidence belief and work rate in the middle.
Playing styles and strategy may vary ...but the fundamental ability to finish better ...has given them a cutting edge skill down to the wire. Good teams have solid reserves for the last 15mins ...that inspiration could be impact players off the bench or sheer guts from the rapidly tiring warrior in the middle.
Kandy's survival against CR and Havelocks is a good example of this skill factor. The modern game is all about the depth and strength of your 23 squad for the match...not just your best 15 on paper. The RWC 2015 in England easily the best example of depth and remarkable All Black skills that made them favourites from the start.
The pressure to get quality players becomes the fundamental priority for all teams with serious ambition to succeed. The gene pool for such players a hot button topic of much debate at club and a lot more animated at school level.
Talented young hopefuls get a fab break to transfer from district school to one of the major rugby stables ...a sort of skill draft to beef up that team.
The current Sri Lanka squad bubbling with such natural ability - Sandun Herath, Shenal Dias, Dhanushka Ranjan ...plus a host of others equally hungry and talented.
The need is to have a regulated draft process with adequate compensation for the school of origin ...most practical and a sensible incentive that will drive the quality to the next level.
The Singer schools season is already causing waves islandwide ....still running to form and the big established seats of learning, holding on to their pre season hype. Trinity and Royal College discovering the power of Wesley rugby. The result shows wins for both schools ...but just. Wesley have their lack of finishing, lack of running straight in the threes and missed kicks to mark as blame. 7/5 v Trinity was too close to call.
Let's hope more belief and less hesitation that cost them the Royal match at Longdon Place. I am hoping they get those basics right this week and have a good celebration for April season.
S Thomas' seemed to have spent time on their departments and have certainly given a warning to all teams ahead of them. Coach Lagga and his team enjoying the initial stamp of authority ...controlling the game from the whistle. Expect some bone jarring tackles and max impact, this Saturday when the traditional rivals line up for their annual shield ...Royal grit v Thora belief, and it's the pack play that will decide the result.
If unable to watch it live...you are definitely missing out. Catch the live stream and commentary on the papare.com as they netcast the intensity around the world, delighting old boys on many levels.
National rugby turns to Asian division 1 and matches against Malaysia, Korea, Kazak and Philippines to target a slot with the big Asian unions. The team very likely to be handed to Johann Taylor once the selectors name the tour squad.
The national Women 7s are in Hongkong for the World Series invitation ...host HK, Thailand, and Argentina make up our group. ARFU are keen to grade us and our performance level at the highest mark in Asia. Linda Itunu has a tough task to mentally prep the side for their step up...it's a massive ask and blessings to the SRi islanders for courage and pride.
It's a grand prospect to imagine our future for island rugby and the unions push to broadbase the rapid development of this global game.
I am still hoping that the union will harness the enormous bank of local player and coaching experience ...to pull in the numbers and grade each player forward. We need to certify as many coaches from first class and national rugby to handle the specialist tasks to mentally and physically prepare them.
Elite athletes are required for the creation of a high performance facility ...which gives our home union a step up on the Asian platform. The full requirement is for gladiators ...players with bigger hearts than average. A mind for intense work and an appetite never to give up despite the pressure.
Success is a lethal combination of mind over matter and a relentless attitude that redefines all conventional systems. Positive thinking and cold steel belief that shatters normality is the ask...I believe it's all ahead and just a matter of time before we discover our warriors with that special kryptonite.
Bula bula Sri rugby!
