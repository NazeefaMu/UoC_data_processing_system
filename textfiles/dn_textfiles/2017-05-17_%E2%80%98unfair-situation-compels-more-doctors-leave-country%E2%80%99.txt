‘Unfair situation compels more doctors to leave country’

More and more doctors are leaving the country to serve in foreign countries due to unfair situation that they experience in the health service, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said several Health Ministry officials ignore the orders given to them by the Health Ministry Secretary and the Health Services Acting Director General, using the `connections' they have with the Health Minister.
He said the Health Minister has totally ignored the affairs of his ministry and is busy with suppressing trade unions, protecting SAITM and warning about a coup against the government'. Dr. Zoysa said the transfers agreed by the transfer boards were changed by certain persons in several occasions. One female Deputy Director General changed a transfer list of specialist doctors according to her likings. The GMOA has already informed its disapproval to the Acting Director General in this regard, he said.
