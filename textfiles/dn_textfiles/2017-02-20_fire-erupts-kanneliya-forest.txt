Fire erupts in Kanneliya forest

A fire erupted in the Kanneliya forest reserve in Panwilahena around 7 p.m. on February 17 destroying nearly 10 acres of forest land.
The fire destroyed pipes laid to get drinking water from sprouts in the area causing a water scarcity to nearly 100 families.
Thawalama forest range officer Jagath Kahatapitiya said his department would launch a reforestation programme in the area.
