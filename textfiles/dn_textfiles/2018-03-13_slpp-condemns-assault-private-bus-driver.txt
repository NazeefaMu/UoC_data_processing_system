SLPP condemns assault on private bus driver

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna yesterday vehemently condemned the assault on a private bus driver at Battaramulla by Southern Provincial Councilor M. K. Kasun and his wife.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G. L. Peiris told media in Colombo that his party condemns the assault by Kasun and his wife and also believes they should be dealt with according to the law.
The media reported that both Kasun who was elected to the PC from UPFA and his wife were ardent supporters of the SLPP.
Peiris went on to say that Kasun’s action was not fit for a people’s political representative.
