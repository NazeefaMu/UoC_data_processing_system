‘Govt’s policies in resolving power  crisis should be implemented’

Policies of the government to resolve the power crisis should be implemented to find solutions to the increasing demand of power without being subjected to the CEB officers’ arbitrary decisions, Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) Chairman Ashoka Abayagunawardena yesterday said.
He was delivering a lecture on ‘solution for the power crisis’ held at the SEMA auditorium.
He said the country would face a severe power issue in March next year provided that ample rain would not fall to the catchment areas of the hydro power plant reservoirs. He said power crisis would be severe by 2023 as major power plants are not being constructed to provide 5 percent annual increase of power demand.
He said the Government has policies to set up renewable energy power plants, mini hydro power plants and so on as solution to the power demands. “They have been prevented by the new General Manager bringing about legal points,” Abeygunawardena said.
“The government should implement them without being subjected to CEB officials’ arbitrary decisions.”
