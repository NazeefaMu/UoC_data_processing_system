Kalutara tragedy due to security lapse?

The Kalutara tragedy that cost the lives of several suspects and two prison officers posed several questions which should gain the attention of relevant authorities.
It posed the question as to whether proper procedure was adopted in transporting suspects who had threats to their lives, adequate security was provided for their protection and the vehicle and officers had proper safety measures, stated a group of aggrieved prison officers in an open letter issued yesterday.
Following is the letter:
Although we never had an intention to write a letter of this nature relating to our institution or matters connected to it, we were compelled to write this with the motive of creating awareness among the people about the actions of groups who failed to prevent a tragedy of this nature due to negligence, without causing any prejudice to the investigations or disrespect to the law.
Earlier too there were two failed murder attempts on this suspect. There was a shooting incident targeting this suspect in the Kaduwela Magistrate Courts complex and another opposite the Welikada Prison which injured a woman.
When the superintendent of the Kalutara Prison and the Chief Jailer were aware of these previous incidents, it is questionable as to why they disregarded it and failed to take necessary steps to obtain police protection which was required, knowing that there was no police protection deployed for their officers on duty with the impending danger and proper advise and whether proper action was taken by the armed officers in keeping with the advise given to them.
The action taken by the previous Chief Jailer in transporting suspects of this nature was to transport them to the express-way with security provided by two groups, armed police in uniform and in civilian dress (mufti). Why wasn’t this practice adopted in this instance?
The other question is whether instructions were obtained regarding the transport of this suspect on the day pprior to the incident from the Commissioner of Prisons or the Commissioner General of Prisons either on telephone or in writing.
The next question in why the Special Court situated within the prison itself is not used for legal action regarding these suspects, when noted persons of this nature and those with death threats are transported the procedure to be adopted was to inform the Court, Prison Headquarters and the Ministry and seek necessary advice and obtain adequate police protection. If police protection is not supplied the Court should be informed and necessary advice obtained.
Earlier when security was provided to suspects of this nature or prisoners, the prison administration used to transport them during times unexpected by people or at random. The transport of the underworld character known as ‘Wambotta’ from the Colombo Remand prison to the Tangalle Court could be cited as one such example. Similarly the underworld member nicknamed ‘Prince Column’ was provided security in this manner.
Although decisions regarding the protection of these type of persons should be taken after directly consulting higher officers in the police and Judges of Courts of Justice, certain higher officers are reluctant do so due to their lack of fluency in English.
Due to these reasons the people who ultimately have to pay with their lives are the innocent officers who had to look after their families and children. Although the void created in the families by their demise cannot be erased by paying compensation, steps can be taken to prevent incidents of this nature in future.
In order to prevent incidents of this nature in future
1. Our officers in the Prisons Department engage in prisoner transport service without wearing body armour or bullet proof helmets. These equipment can be used for along periods according to the manner they are maintained and used. The question is why these equipment were not provided to the officers who engage in duty, leaving their lives at stake.
2. Leyland buses with wire mesh netting are provided for the transport of prisoners. The so called safety of these buses need not be described to the public who travel in them daily. Therefore the government should take steps to provide ‘armoured vehicles’ which are the world accepted vehicles used for prisoner transport moving away from the protection of the four plates of the Leyland buses equipped with wire mesh. Urgent steps should be taken to obtain armoured vehicles with bullet proof shutters. This was not only a right of the officers on duty but detainees as well.
3. Finally killing of prisoners or suspects cannot be considered as trivial for several reasons. That is because it amounts to illegal homicide, obstructs administration of evidence and gives an opportunity for another group of criminals to escape from the law. This may be the target of these escaping criminals.
