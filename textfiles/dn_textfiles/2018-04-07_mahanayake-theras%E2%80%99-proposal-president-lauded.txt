Mahanayake Theras’ proposal to President lauded

The Colombo Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA) yesterday praised the proposal of the Mahanayakes to President Maithripala Sirisena that it is high time to take measures to identify imposters, ordained as Buddhist monks, engaging in various nefarious activities being in the Buddhasasana and to take action to excommunicate them from the monkshood.
The association in a statement said that King Parakramabahu and King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe had taken action to preserve the purity of Buddhist monastic order by excommunicating those who behaved against the norms of the Monastic order.
Full statement:
Having received information to the effect that the Most Ven. Mahanayake Theras have addressed a memorandum to the President bringing to his notice that there has arisen an urgent need to identify those imposters, though ordained as Buddhist monks and are wearing yellow robes, are engaged in nefarious and irreligious activities violating the norms of Monastic Discipline, we hereby urge the President to take necessary action to excommunicate them from monkshood.
The Colombo Young Men's Buddhist Association wishes to take this opportunity to offer its appreciative veneration to the Venerable Mahanayake Theras for making this timely magnanimous proposal to the President.
Issuing Official and Authentic Identity Cards to traditionally ordained Bhikkus and female novices popularly known as “Sil Mathas” who are observing 10 Precepts is an urgent and essential requirement in Sri Lanka, which still retains the longstanding reputation as a country that preserves the pristine purity of the Theravada Buddhist tradition. It is known that the Venerable Mahanayake Theras representing the Three Nikayas have made reference to their Memorandum to historical facts that, subsequent to the establishment of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, King Parakramabahu the Great during the Polonnaruwa Period had taken action to excommunicate miscreant Bhikkus who behaved in violation of the norms of monastic discipline and King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe, during the Kandyan Period, had taken necessary action, in similar manner, to preserve the parity of the Buddhist Monastic Order and thereby strengthening the Buddhist Sasana in Sri Lanka.
While cherishing the earnest hope and expectation that this paramount important task aimed at safeguarding the security of the Venerable Maha Sangha who are performing a monumental service in preserving the sublime teachings of Buddha and the stability of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka would receive the earliest attention of the President.
We take this opportunity to assure, with a feeling of utmost dedication towards Buddhism in Sri Lanka, the maximum support that the Colombo Young Men's Buddhist Association can extend towards successful accomplishment of this noble task whenever such support is deemed necessary.
