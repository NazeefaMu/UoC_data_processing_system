Cinnamon’s city hotels reduce usage of plastic straws

In an effort to reduce harm to marine life and the overall usage of single-use plastic, Cinnamon’s city hotels have implemented their “Last Straw” campaign beginning in the month of November. The City properties aim to change attitudes toward the plastic tool that is largely a convenience for most people.
All restaurants and bars at Cinnamon Grand, Cinnamon Lakeside and Cinnamon Red will display awareness posters and tent cards accordingly, informing guests that plastic straws will be provided only on request. By doing so, the hotels hope to encourage guests to refrain from asking for straws and help in the long-term goals of reducing single-use plastics. Not only will the campaign reduce the hotels’ usage of single-use plastic, but will create awareness of the destruction caused to the environment and threats to marine life, both through guest awareness, as well as that of hotel staff. -TG
