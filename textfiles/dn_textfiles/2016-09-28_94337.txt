Kapil Dev to ring the bell on first day of Kolkata Test India to follow Lord’s tradition

Kapil Dev, the former legendary all-rounder and India captain, will ring the bell to signify the start of play on the first day of the second Test between India and New Zealand, scheduled to be played at the Eden Gardens,Kolkata, on Friday (September 30).
Following the tradition of Lord’s, this will be the first instance where a bell will be rung to signal the start of each day’s play in an Indian stadium.
While Kapil Dev is slated to do the honours on the first day, it isn’t known as to which eminent personalities will ring the bell on the remaining four days of the Test. Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) joint secretary, Avisek Dalmiya, confirmed the news and said: “This was (president) Sourav Ganguly’s idea and Kapil (Dev) has agreed to ring the bell on the morning of the Test.”
The ringing of the bell to commemorate the start of each day’s play is a tradition followed at Lord’s since 2007 and the Sourav Ganguly-led CAB have now decided to have their own on all days during an Eden Gardens Test.
A silver-coated giant bell will be hung near the Eden clock and is expected to be installed over the next couple of days.
The second Test will also mark India’s 250th Test at home and Anurag Thakur, President, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), has confirmed that the occasion will be marked with a special felicitation to both teams. The players from both teams will be gifted with specially minted silver coins, each of them weighing 100 grams.
“The Board president will arrive on October 1 and the next day, on day three of the match we will have the felicitation to mark the 250th landmark Test,” Avishek said. The CAB has also arranged for a special gold coin to mark the toss and Ganguly has said that the coin will be used for every match at the Eden Gardens henceforth.
The two teams are expected to arrive in Kolkata on Tuesday evening (September 27). India hold a 1-0 lead in the three-match series after completing a comprehensive 197-run victory in the first Test in Kanpur.
