Prints so fashionable

The Kingsbury high tea monthly fashion show featuring a vibrant collection by ‘Kadapatha’ was held on January 25 at The Gourmet Station. The collection featured some fabulous designs from the label ideal for any occasion. The event received a good turn out as the high tea buffet at The Kingsbury delivered great flavours and variety.
