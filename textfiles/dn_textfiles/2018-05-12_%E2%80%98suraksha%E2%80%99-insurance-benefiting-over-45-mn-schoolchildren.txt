‘Suraksha’ Insurance benefiting over 4.5 mn schoolchildren

One year after the student health insurance programme ‘Suraksha’ was introduced, 4.5 million schoolchildren between the ages of 5 - 19 island-wide are reaping benefits.
The scheme worth Rs. 200,000 functions in 11,242 schools allowing children to access both government and private hospitals for treatment. The Budget 2017 allocated Rs. 2.7 billion for the scheme to be implemented through the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation.
‘Suraksha’ covers those in government schools, assisted private schools, non-assisted private schools, international schools and student monks in Pirivenas. All of them have been compulsorily registered in this insurance.
When a child is admitted to a government hospital, he/she can also apply to receive Rs. 1,000 per day for 30 days. Further, with regard to external tests and medication, a claim of up to Rs. 10,000 can be made each day.
The insurance scheme covers parents as well and in the event of an accidental death of a parent, Rs. 75,000 will be paid towards the child’s education. Further, Rs. 100,000 will be paid to parents as compensation in an event of an accidental death of a child.
Permanent disability of a child has a claim of up to Rs. 100,000 while partial disability claims can cover up to Rs. 50,000. Up to Rs. 30,000 will be paid for private wards at government hospitals. The medical fee will be covered up to Rs. 30,000.
For other medical and laboratory tests Rs. 40,000 will be paid. The maximum annual cover for hospitalization and medical services for a child is Rs. 200,000 with Rs. 100,000 cover for one hospitalization.
