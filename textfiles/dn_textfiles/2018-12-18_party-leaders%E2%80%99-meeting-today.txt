Party Leaders’ meeting today

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will chair a Party Leaders’ meeting at 12 noon today to decide on the business of Parliament this week, Parliament Deputy Secretary General and Chief of Staff Neil Iddawala said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday he said the UPFA MPs have been allocated Opposition seats.
He said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya would make an announcement on the Leader of Opposition and Chief Opposition Whip posts in Parliament.
According to the UNP sources, about 10 UPFA MPs are expected to join hands with the UNP. UNP MP Mayantha Dissanayake said that it was the decision of the UNP to only accept about 10 crossovers even though many UPFA MPs have expressed their willingness to join the Government.
He however said a final decision as to whom they would accept would be taken at a Group Meeting scheduled at 7pm yesterday. Media Secretary to the Speaker Chaminda Gamage said the Speaker would make a decision on the Opposition Leader post after these pending crossovers. UPFA MP Shehan Semasinghe said the Opposition Leader post must be given to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as he commands the majority in the Opposition. He said his group is most likely to nominate UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena for the post of Chief Opposition Whip.
