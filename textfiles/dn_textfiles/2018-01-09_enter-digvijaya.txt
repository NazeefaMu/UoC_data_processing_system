Enter Digvijaya

Long before Napoleon’s great defeat in Waterloo, Belgium in 1815, Greek sources revealed that a great king and a conqueror was defeated in the Kingdom of India.
This great battle took place at Jhelum on the Indus River in the spring of 326 BC between King Porus and King Alexander, the great conqueror who thought he had the right to rule the entire world.
Capital Maharaja Group director Aditya Ray

Historians opined that based on his name and the location of his domain, Porus was likely to have been a descendant of the Puru tribe mentioned in the Rig Veda.
Alexander’s army engaged King Porus’s force of 35,000 infantrymen, 10,000 cavalry and 200 battle-trained elephants. Porus with an unusually large physique had ridden an elephant which towered above other beasts. His armour with its gold and silver inlay had lent distinction to his seven foot body.
Had Alexander emerged victories at this battle with Porus, his next destination of invasion would have been Sri Lanka. Hence King Porus’s valiance centuries back in a way had contributed towards safeguarding Sri Lanka from an invasion that would have been disastrous and would have changed the course of the country’s history.
