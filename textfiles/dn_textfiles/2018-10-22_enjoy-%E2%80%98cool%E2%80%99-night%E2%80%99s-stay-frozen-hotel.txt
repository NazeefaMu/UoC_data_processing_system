Enjoy a ‘cool’ night’s stay at a frozen hotel

When planning a trip, summer destinations are likely your go-to getaway. However, hotels around the world are proving that winter trips can be just as exciting. On top of glass igloos and floating cabins, ice hotels are a fun way to enjoy the frosty weather.
While most of these icy inns are nestled in Nordic landscapes, the Hoshino Resort Tomamu ice village in Hokkaido has brought the snowy trend to Japan.
Situated in the sleepy town of Shimukappu, the Hoshino Resort Tomamu is an ideal way to experience below-freezing temperatures in Japan. From January through February, it transforms into a winter wonderland, complete with a luxurious ice hotel.
With the exception of its snuggly sleeping bags, everything in the the hotel’s igloo-inspired rooms is made out of ice, from its curved walls to its stylish furniture. This is also true of its outdoor spaces, where you will find a warm-water rotenburo (outdoor bath) encased in-you guessed it-ice. After taking a dip and bundling back up, you can chill out in the hotel’s ice lounge-an ideal setting for sipping on a hot drink and stargazing.
In addition to this incredible inn, the ice village boasts a cafe with frozen bookshelves, fun and frosty children’s activities, a skating rink, and an amazing ice slide-everything you need to have a happy holiday. My Modern Met
