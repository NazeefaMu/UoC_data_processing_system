Easter messages

Resurrection, a symbol of hope: President
Easter is one of the most important Christian festivals which commemorates the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Christian devotees around the world choose to spend the period leading up to Easter, by performing prayers, fasting and indulging in acts of self-sacrifice, while engaging in religious activities, President Maithripala Sirisena said in a message marking Easter.
The message added:
"Easter reflects the complexities and pain suffered by Jesus Christ, who sacrificed his life for people and the greatest joy received as a result his Resurrection.
The message delivered to people through Easter, is the hope of Resurrection; the conquering of death. Furthermore, it reflects divine sacrifice.
All living beings dislike cruelty and violent suppression. Sustenance of human beings depends entirely on life.
The world will become a better, more beautiful place when there are people who love each other, value reconciliation among themselves as well as honour the dignity of each other. All of us must pledge to create that kind of heaven in this world, as well as to build a new future by utilising the path shown to us this Easter.
I extend my warmest greetings for a Happy Easter celebration, full of peace and joy to all Christians around the world."
Time for rejoicing: Amaratunga
Easter, celebrating the glory of the Risen Lord, marks the end of the Holy Week commemorating the Crucifixion, Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. His Resurrection from the dead is the best attested fact in human history, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said in his message marking Easter.
The message added:
"The glorious rising manifests the Divinity and Humanity of Our Lord, which forms the bedrock of our Christian faith. The Resurrection of defeating death and triumphing over the forces of sin and evil, opened the gates to the Kingdom of God to mankind for eternal life in union with God Himself. As such, we should not fear death, for Resurrection lifts humanity above matter and elevates to a state of peace on earth and eternal life after death.
Therefore, Easter is a time for rejoicing, thankfully assured that sin is forgiven and life extends beyond the soil of the earth.
Jesus stood against a corrupt ruling system, politically and religiously mixed, which threatened the Jews of the day. Historical records and testimonials have found that the crucifixion was filled with political and religious intrigue of which factors pervade society even today.
Let us awaken to demonstrate our committed gratitude to Our Lord the Saviour by contemplating and reflecting on his message of love, reconciliation and justice realistically extending to our neighbour and society at large for peaceful co-existence.
I wish you a blessed and meaningful Easter and may its message bring you a re-awakening with new aspirations and hope contributing to the way forward in a peaceful country."
Let us embrace compassion: Sampanthan
As Christians across the world celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, my heartiest wishes go to the Christian community in Sri Lanka, Joint Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said in a message marking Easter.
The message added:
"The selfless, humble and sacrificial life of Jesus Christ always challenges humankind to treat everyone with self-respect and equality.
As we reflect on the message of Easter which brings hope, renewal of life and compassion, may we also embrace those features in our lives to build a country that will cherish diversity and equality.
The Message of Easter also reminds us not to lose courage and hope on account of short-term adversaries, but to remain confident and steadfast to seek a triumphal end.
While we celebrate, let us also take a step forward to show our solidarity with the less fortunate and downtrodden and make this Easter meaningful."
