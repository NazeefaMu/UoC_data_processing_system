Cabinet Paper soon to ban tuition classes during school hours
 
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said a Cabinet Paper will be presented in Parliament shortly to ban private tuition classes during school hours between 7.30 am and 1.30 pm.
The minister said this in Parliament yesterday in response to a question raised by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara during the round of questions for oral answers.
The minister noted that private tuition classes has become a fashion and as such children attend these tuition classes by not attending school.
According to the minister, the majority of existing shortages of principals and teachers have already been filled and 4,000 principals have also been recruited.
“Usually, students can sit for their A/L examinations twice through their respective schools, but we are looking into the possibility of allowing students who were affected by the recent floods to be given the opportunity to sit for their A/L examinations for the third time through their schools. We are discussing this possibility with the Examinations Department,” Minister Kariyawasam said.
Meanwhile, raising a supplementary question, Matara district MP Buddika Pathirana said that in Matara, the 80 percent attendance for A/L students is strictly adhered to but the students who were affected by the floods have been unable to fulfil their 80 percent attendance requirement.
He further noted that due to the floods, some of the A/L students in the Matara district were unable to even apply for the A/L examination and several schools were facing this predicament.
In response, the Education Minister asked for details of schools that had faced this issue and said that if these schools had been affected, the Principals should submit such information to the Education Ministry and obtain a solution to the issue.
 
Debate on Judicature (Amendment) Bill postponed
 
Debate on Judicature (Amendment) Bill due yesterday was postponed until the inconsistencies pointed out by the Supreme Court (SC) in the bill be properly amended and presented to Parliament.
Leader of the House Minister Lakshamn Kiriella informed the House that the Judicature (Amendment) Bill will not be presented until the necessary amendments are drafted.
The SC recently determined that three sections of the Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution and need to be passed by a two thirds majority in Parliament. The SC has determined that Sections 12 A (1), 12 A (2) and 12 A (7) are inconsistent with the Constitution.
The Government presented the Bill on March 6 to set up a permanent High Court-at-Bar to expedite cases of large scale corruption and financial crimes.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera speaking on the bill said that some may have misunderstood the determinations given by the SC. He pointed out that there is only a matter with regard to the two thirds majority and a simple majority when passing the Bill. There is no refusal on the proposed permanent trial-at-bar system or the anti-corruption high court.
He said the Legal Draftsman Department has requested time to draft the amendments needed in the Act, as determined by the SC. “Initially, they were only given two days, which is not enough. They have requested more time on this, and we will present the Bill to Parliament in due course," he said.
Deputy Minister Perera said the establishment of the Anti-Corruption High Court is timely. Some groups cannot tolerate it, he said.
“The establishment of these high courts was strongly challenged at the SC. I need to commend J.C. Weliamuna PC, Saliya Peiris PC, Jayampathi Wickremeratne PC, lawyers Pulasthi Hewamanna, Suren Fernando, N. Kodithuwakku, V. Corea, J. Anagaratnam, Shamika Jayawardena, who appeared on behalf of the State without any charges. I should also thank the talented Attorney General’s Department officers who countered the arguments to establish these high courts,”the Deputy Minister said.
Supplementary allocation seeking Rs. 7,000 million tabled in Parliament
The Supplementary allocation seeking approval of the House for Rs.7,000 million was tabled in Parliament yesterday, while certain expenditure heads in it were questioned by the JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake.
Several items in the Supplementary Allocation included that Rs.100 million was provided as an additional allocation to settle the outstanding bills of 2017 flood and drought reliefs .
According to the Cabinet decision on January 30, Rs. 1,450 million was allocated to provide further relief to drought affected people, Rs.1,500 million to implement the fertiliser subsidy programme for tea smallholders, rubber and coconut sectors.
Rs.21.39 million was allocated to procure vehicles for Sri Lanka Amarapura Sanga Sabha Mahanayake Ven. Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera, Rs.43 million to provide vehicles for State National Integration and Reconciliation Minister, Rs.10 million to procure vehicles for the Prime Minister's security division, and Rs.342 million to settle the outstanding contractual payments to the Colombo Municipal to provide infrastructure facilities to the Shangri La Hotel project.
However, JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake Challenged certain expenditure heads in the Supplementary Allocation, including the Shangri La payment and the vehicle leased for the Minister of Special Assignments. He noted, “Rs.4.1 million is allocated to the Ministry of Special Assignments to meet the expenditure of the lease rental for a vehicle procured under the operational leasing method. What did the Special Assignments minister do for the country and why he needs a vehicle. Further, we want a background report for the additional allocation of Rs.342 million to settle the outstanding contractual payments to the Colombo Municipal Council for providing infrastructure facilities to the Shangri-La Hotel project as per the Cabinet decision dated 30th January 2018.”
Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella responding to the JVP- MP said if required the issue could be debated at a later date.
The Supplementary allocations are provided in terms of Clause 6 (1) of the Appropriation Act strictly for the purposes specified in approved Budget Estimates, after assessing their needs, giving consideration to relevant financial regulations, and approved procedures.
However, the supplementary provision presented in Parliament yesterday did not change the approved total expenditure limits of the annual estimate. The allocation of such purposes has been made under the Project of Budgetary Support Services and Contingent Liabilities of the Department of National Budget, and it is under the limit of the Approved Annual Budget.
