Aussie BMX star partially paralysed after accident

SYDNEY, FRIDAY: Australian former BMX world champion and two-time Olympian Sam Willoughby has been left partially paralysed after a training accident in the United States, with no movement from the chest down.
The 25-year-old, who won silver at the 2012 London Olympics but could only manage sixth in Rio this year, underwent surgery for fractures to his vertebrae which compressed his spinal cord after a crash near San Diego on September 10, his family said.
“Fortunately, this surgery was successful enough at decompressing his spinal cord and aligning his vertebrae that a second operation for further stabilisation was not necessary,” they said in a statement issued through Cycling Australia late Thursday.
“At this stage, Sam still has no movement from his chest down but has regained use of his arms and is slowly regaining some sensation in his legs.
“Sam’s next step is to begin a long road of recovery at a rehabilitation centre and while the details are still to be finalised, at this stage it is expected that Sam will be transported to a USA-based rehabilitation centre in the next few days.”
Willoughby started competing aged six in Adelaide, and burst onto the scene by claiming the junior world championship in 2008. AFP
