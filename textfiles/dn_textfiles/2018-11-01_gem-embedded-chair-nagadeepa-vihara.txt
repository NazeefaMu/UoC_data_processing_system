Gem-embedded chair for Nagadeepa Vihara

Businessmen and residents of Ratnapura will soon donate chair embedded with gems to the historic Nagadeepa Purana Vihara.
A ceremony was held on Tuesday to commence the embedding of gems, gold and silver. According to folktales, two brothers called Chulodara and Mahodara had donated a similar chair to the Kelani Vihara.
This would be the first time such a chair was to be donated to a temple since.
