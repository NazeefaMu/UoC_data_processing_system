SL vs NZ 1st Test: match drawn

Sri Lanka battled to a rain-affected draw in the first Test against New Zealand today after the Black Caps were unable to break an epic stand by Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews.The tourists were 287 for three in their second innings – still nine runs away from an innings defeat – when the umpires called time with only 13 overs bowled on the final day.Mendis was unbeaten on 141 and Mathews 120 not out at stumps after a 274-run stand that, along with the weather, allowed Sri Lanka to salvage a draw.New Zealand will view the draw as a missed opportunity after they took control of the Test with a mammoth 578 in the first innings, anchored by Tom Latham’s unbeaten 264.
