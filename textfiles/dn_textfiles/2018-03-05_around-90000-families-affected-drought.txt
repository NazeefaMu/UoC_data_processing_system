Around 90,000 families affected by drought

About 90,000 families in five administrative districts in the island are suffering due to the prevailing drought, Disaster Management Minister and Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said recently.
Accordingly, 293,000 persons are affected in the Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura, Puttalam and Mannar districts.
The Disaster Management Centre has made arrangements to provide drinking water to all affected people at a cost Rs. 1,230 million. As Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa are receiving rains, the existing issue may subside, the minister said.
