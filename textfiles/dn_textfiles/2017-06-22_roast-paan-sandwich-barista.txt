Roast paan sandwich from Barista

Barista’s outlets now bring an entire gastronomic experience endemic to Sri Lanka, in the form of its latest Roast Paan sandwich range.
The pol sambol, mild chicken curry and cheese roast paan sandwich is oozing with cheese, and simply melts in your mouth releasing a plethora of flavours from the pol sambol and the chicken curry. Not too spicy this sandwich is easy on any palate for locals and international visitors. For those who prefer the kick of spice, Barista also introduces the mutton curry, green chili and coriander roast paan sandwich for the daring food lover. With a distinct flavour of coriander leaves used in moderation so as not to overpower the succulence of the mutton, this sandwich is a treat at any time of day.
Both varieties of the sandwich are best washed down with one of Barista’s signature tropical coolers or even one of the latest frappes.
