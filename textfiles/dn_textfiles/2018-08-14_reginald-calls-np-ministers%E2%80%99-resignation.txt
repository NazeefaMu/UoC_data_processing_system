Reginald calls for NP ministers’ resignation

Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray said the best option for the entire team of Northern Province ministers to resign and appoint a new team of ministers.
According to the Constitution, the Governor has no powers to remove or appoint ministers as the powers are vested with the Chief minister of the Province.
Cooray said the Chief Minister should sort out the problem as soon as possible.
The composition of the Northern Province ministers had changed entirely with the Interim Order issued by the Court of Appeal restraining the Northern Province Chief Minister from removing the Provincial Minister of Transport and Fisheries Balasubramaniam Denishwaran from his post.
