Five factories for Uva under Korean funds

Uva Provincial Council Opposition Leader R. M. Ratnayake said a Korean company has agreed to establish five factories in the Uva Province to promote agricultural activities and introduce a new agricultural system to farmers.
Ratnayake was addressing the Uva Provincial Council monthly meeting. The meeting was held under the chairmanship of A. M. Buddhadasa. Ratnayake said 2,000 milch cows imported from Australia will be distributed among farmers. He also suggested to establish a factory to produce milk powder, butter, cheese, yoghurt and liquid milk. He added that another factory needs to be established to produce composed manure and liquid manure for the production of sugar cane jaggery and sugar.
Direct employment for nearly 2,000 people and indirect employment for another 2,500 would be opened by providing new knowledge to Uva farmers. Ratnayake added that new technology could also be introduced to farmers.
The first phase of the project is to start a waste recycling project.
In this respect, a 15 year interest free period has been declared. USD 350 million grant had been provided to promote agriculture, education and industries of developing countries by the company.
Apart from the Badulla district, Moneragala district is also covered in the waste water proposal.
A new milk factory will also be opened with all facilities including the production of yoghurt, cheese etc.
A proposal is also made to promote the sugar cane and jaggery industry and to produce sugar. Action will be taken to cultivate sugar cane in barren lands, thereby creating employment. The workers of the new factories will be offered one percent of the profits. The investors also agreed to open a branch bank which exists in Korea, and agriculture loans will be considered when it opens.
For the operation of the waste management project, two offices will opened in Badulla and Moneragala. The company will recruit 20 degree holders and 25 Advanced Level qualified persons. The two offices will be monitored by the Provincial Council. With the commencement of the project, five industries will be opened in the near future.
With the launch of the five industries, 2,000 Australian milch cows will be handed over to farmers of the Uva Province.
