New site for Kataragama shops, stalls

Shops and stalls in the Kataragama sacred area will be relocated at one site, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday said. The Minister was addressing the gathering after opening the third phase of the Kataragama Sacred City Development Program.
He said the relocating will make shopping more convenient.
|”It will not affect the sellers but benefit them and devotees,” Minister Ranawaka said. “Over 300 stalls will be built to relocate the sellers,” the Minister said. He said the project will address sanitary issues as well. Nearly Rs. 500 million will be spent on the project.
