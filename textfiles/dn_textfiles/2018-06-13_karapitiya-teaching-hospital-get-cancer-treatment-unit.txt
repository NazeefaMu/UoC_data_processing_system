Karapitiya Teaching Hospital to get cancer treatment unit

A new cancer treatment unit will be set up at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, at a cost of US$ 5 million, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the agreement was signed recently at the Temple Trees between the Health Ministry, Colours of Courage and the National Health Development Fund.
The project to build cancer treatment units was launched in 2011. A cancer treatment unit has already been set up at the Tellippalai state hospital at a cost of US$. 2.6 million. Around 4,500 cancer patients receive treatment at this unit, he said.
The total cost (US$ five million) of the cancer treatment unit to be set up at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital was collected from 250,000 donors, during a 670 km-long walk that took place from the north of the country to the south in 2016, he added.
