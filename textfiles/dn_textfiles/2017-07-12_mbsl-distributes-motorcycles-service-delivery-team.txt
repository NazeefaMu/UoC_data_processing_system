MBSL distributes motorcycles to service delivery team

Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Finance PLC (MBSL), a leading financial institution, which is a fully-owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ceylon, distributed motorcycles to its service delivery force at a ceremony held in Colombo recently.
Expressing his views at the event, Chairman of MBSL, Dr. Sujeewa Lokuhewa said: “The success of any business establishment depends largely on the strength, determination and capabilities of its service delivery team. MBSL has a top-class, islandwide especially trained team scattered across the country. They are our pride and the remarkable success story behind the institution. It is, therefore, our duty and responsibility to afford them all necessary facilities to perform their task in a more methodical and streamlined manner. It is with this objective in mind that MBSL provided them with motorcycles”.
Sharing his thoughts on this initiative, Chief Executive Officer of MBSL, T. Mutugala said: “We consider our loyal customers as our most valuable asset. In this backdrop, we remain profoundly committed towards providing an unparalleled service to our clientele. We distributed new motorcycles amongst our service delivery force to enable them to render a more efficient and expeditious service to our customers. They can now visit our customers at their doorstep - in their homes or offices to extend a more personalized service which guarantees 100% satisfaction. Our customers can now access our diverse financial services through the sales team with trust and confidence, without the hassle of travelling to visit our office. It is to facilitate and streamline this process that motorcycles were given to members of the team”.
