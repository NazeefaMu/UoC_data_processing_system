Navin justifies Wimal's arrest

Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said the charges against Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa had been investigated for almost two years before he was arrested while the charges against Namal Rajapaksa had been investigating under the Money Laundering Act.
He was addressing a press conference at the Plantation Industries Ministry auditorium. Responding to a question raised by media personnel whether the MPs' arrest were results of political victimisation, he said some can interpret the legal actions in that way, but arrests were made with clear evidence in hand.
He queried if the government could keep silent for fear of rumours and leave the thieves at large.
The law is applied equally to all, he said.
Dissanayake said his father was charged on the instructions of former President R. Premadasa on the alleged abduction of Prof. Ralph Buultjens in 1988.
The minister said there was not a single evidence against his father. He said despite the AG's instructions not to charge, the President instructed to file a case. "But court acquitted my father," the minister said.
He said it tarnished the image of President Premadasa. “Likewise, if a case is filed against a member without evidence, it will harm the government,” the minister said. The government will not file false cases knowing that such action will tarnish its image, he said.
