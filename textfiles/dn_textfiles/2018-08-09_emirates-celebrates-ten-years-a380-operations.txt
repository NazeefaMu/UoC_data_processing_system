Emirates celebrates ten years of A380 operations

Emirates is celebrating 10 years of A380 operations. Since its first flight to New York from Dubai on August 1 2008, the Emirates A380 has carried more than 105 million passengers, clocking in more than 1.5 billion kilometres on 115,000 flights, equivalent to 39,000 trips around the globe.
Emirates is the world’ largest operator of the A380 aircraft, with 104 double-decker aircraft flying to 49 cities on 6 continents on scheduled services with more than 80 daily departures from Dubai, the airline’s hub. In addition to its 104-strong fleet, the airline has a further 58 A380s on order. Today, Emirates also operates the world’s shortest A380 route from Dubai to Kuwait and the world’s longest A380 non-stop route from Dubai to Auckland.
Sir Tim Clark, President Emirates Airline said, “It has been ten extraordinary years since the first Emirates A380 flight took to the skies, and today it has become one of the most recognisable and admired aircraft in the world.
The Emirates A380 has also had a significant impact on the aerospace industry and its high-value supply chains, fuelling hundreds of thousands of jobs for skilled workers, and creating significant economic benefits in countries which have A380 production facilities.”
The Emirates A380 has been at the centre of a number of aviation firsts over the last decade, including the unprecedented formation flight in 2015 with the Jetman Dubai duo. The stunning formations were conducted over the Dubai skyline and the Palm Jumeirah, showcasing how far aviation has come.
