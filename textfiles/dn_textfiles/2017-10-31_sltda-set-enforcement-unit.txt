Action against unregistered tourist establishments
SLTDA to set up Enforcement Unit

The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) is to set up an Enforcement Unit to take action against tourist establishments not registered with the SLTDA.
A senior official from the SLTDA speaking to the Daily News said it was mandatory that all tourist establishments register with them and that they receive a license to operate.He added that they were developing their resources to have the Unit operate around the country.
According to SLTDA data, only 50 percent of all tourist places in the country are registered with them, making it harder for the Authority to monitor whether these establishments are up to standard and in accordance with the SLTDA regulations.
The Tourism Businesses Licensing System registers classified tourist hotels, boutique hotels, boutique villas, tourist hotels, guest houses, restaurants, travel agencies, spa and wellness centers, rented apartments, heritage bungalows, rented homes, bungalows, heritage homes, home stay units, tourist shops, spice gardens, tourist guides and water based adventure sport centres.
The SLTDA official further noted that the Authority was also in the process of updating their structure and that they would take legal action against any persons not registered with the Authority. This would also include larger hotels which are yet to obtain the SLTDA registration.
