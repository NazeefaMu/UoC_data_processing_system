Son Zion’s 16th birthday bash

Floyd Mayweather buys a £31,000 Mercedes C-Class Coupe:
Floyd Mayweather continues to live up to his nickname ‘Money’.
The former five-weight world champion is renowned for splashing out on private jets and placing million-dollar bets.

And Mayweather has now treated his son, Zion, on his 16th birthday to a Mercedes C-Class Coupe worth around £31,000.
Mayweather claims to have made more than £640million during a 19-year-career in which he beat some of the best fighters of his generation.
And it is not the first time the 40-year-old has bought such extravagant gifts for his children.
Last year he bought his other son Koraun a £30,000 Mercedes for his 16th birthday, a year after treating him to a Bentley golf cart for his 15th birthday.
Mayweather presented Zion the gift at a 16th birthday bash at which Young Thug performed for him and dozens of friends.
The 40-year-old was in Los Angeles on Sunday night to watch the LA Lakers take on the Memphis Grizzlies at the Staples Center alongside David Beckham.
‘Money’ has not fought since he beat Andre Berto and stretched his perfect professional record to 49-0 in September 2015.
But talk of a cross-over fight with UFC star Conor McGregor has been rumbling on for months and last month, Mayweather ‘officially’ came out of retirement to fight the Irishman. – Daily Mail
