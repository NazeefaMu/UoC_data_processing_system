Walasmulla development work at a standstill

With the intention of developing the Walasmulla town, ancient buildings and shop buildings were demolished in 2007. Now, even seven years later, no development work has yet been initiated, former Walasmulla Traders Association Chairman Sisira Jayasinha said.
He said that the roads in the town limits are so narrow that two vehicles cannot pass each other at a time. Meanwhile, Walasmulla Pradesheeya Sabha Secretary P. Nambukarawasam said that the construcrtion work of the weekly pola is underway, but the construction work of the bus stand has been curtailed for reasons undisclosed. But the traders of the Walasmulla town said that there are no proper health and sanitary facilities in the town's limits. There is no drain complex in the heart of the town, and as such, the entire town gets inundated during heavy rains. There is also no proper water supply system. Hence, traders and consumers are the worst affected. Fifty three Grama Niladhari divisions of Katuwana, Weeraketiya, and Okewela come under the purview of Walasmulla, the traders said.
