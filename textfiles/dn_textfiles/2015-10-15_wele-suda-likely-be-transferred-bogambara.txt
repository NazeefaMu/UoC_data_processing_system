Wele Suda likely to be transferred to Bogambara

Wele Suda who was sentenced to death recently over the possession of heroin is likely to be transferred from the Welikada prison in Colombo to the Bogambara prison in Kandy, according to prison sources.
The transfer according to prison sources is due to security reasons.
As Wele Suda has identified several bribe taking prison officers and has revealed the names of other underworld characters allegedly involved in the drugs trade, prison officials believe that there may be a threat to his life at the Colombo prison.
