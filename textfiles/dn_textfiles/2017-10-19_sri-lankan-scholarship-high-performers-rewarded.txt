Big Bad Wolf for a good cause!
Sri Lankan Scholarship high performers rewarded!

The Big Bad Wolf Book Sale which was launched in Sri Lanka from October 5 to 15 at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre (SLECC) proved to be a success amongst the masses in the country. In keeping with their objective of promoting reading and English proficiency in countries where English is not a first language, The Big Bad Wolf book sale embarked on another initiative that came up as timely with the concept of education.
With the recent results announcement of island top scorers from the Grade 5 scholarships, high performing students were invited by the Big Bad Wolf Books representatives to be rewarded with books and gift donations. Generous sponsorships of school uniforms, educational appliances and books were made by the Big Bad Wolf Books, PromoWatch, Nations Trust Bank and DSI, who provided the students with gift vouchers for school footwear.
The rewards ceremony took place within the sale venue itself and book shoppers present were able to witness the event unfold whilst showing their support and enthusiasm to the young students.
Top performers present at the ceremony were Sanjana Nayanajith, Sahas Dharmaratne, Dulanjali Madhumali, Sewmini Udayangi, Tharushika Wijewardene and Shashikala Sewmini. The organizers also invited a student from Sri Sumangala Primary School in Aranayake, which was recently affected by landslides.
The students were present with their families and respective teachers from their schools to witness this occasion. The Big Bad Wolf book sale organizing team welcomed the students with flower garlands and the children received an ovation from the shoppers who were present at the venue.
“The results for the scholarship scorers arrived as a timely event and we, at the Big Bad Wolf books decided to take this opportunity to help make a difference in the lives of these students by gifting them with books and we also give them the exciting opportunity to go home with a trolley full of books selected by themselves, free of charge,” Nishan Wasalathanthri, local partner of Big Bad Wolf Book Sale Director of ProRead Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. Said.
The Big Bad Wolf books also took the opportunity to invite teachers from each of the schools involved and donate a generous amount of English books which can be utilized in their school libraries. The high performers were students from the Thulhiriya Primary School in the Kegalle District, Diggala Primary School in the Matale District, Kirillawala Primary School in the Gampaha District, Sri Sumangala Primary School in the Kegalle District and Kotelawala Primary School in Colombo District.
Commenting on this initiative, Andrew Yap, Founder and Managing Director of Big Bad Wolf Books said, “We are delighted to have been able to become part of such an initiative and reward these students for their hard work. The Big Bad Wolf books has always been involved with supporting under-privileged students in the countries where we have operated. But, this is the first time where we have recognized students with an academic related instance such as this. We also decided to allow them the pleasure of choosing any book they like and fill a trolley with it. This in a way is like a dream coming true since for many, books inspired for children might turn out to be a luxury at times for children today but, with the Big Bad Wolf books we have made it possible.”
