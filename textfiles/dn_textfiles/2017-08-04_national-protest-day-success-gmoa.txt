National protest day a success: GMOA

The national protest day was conducted on Wednesday with the collective effort of trade unions in the country, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) General Secretary Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters yesterday, he said the national protest day was conducted to request the government again to abolish the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). Aluthge said a trade union action would be conducted islandwide if a favourable response would be received from the government within a week in relation to the request to abolish SAITM.
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Politburo Member Lal Kantha said the government’s aim would be to convert the medical degree into a commodity.
Lal Kantha said it would be a threat to free education and to the middle and lower class people in the country. He said they would battle against SAITM until it would be abolished. Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee Convener Rayan Jayalath said, “SAITM is an organisation which contributes for corruption.
It can never be standardised to provide quality medical education,” he said. Ceylon Teachers’ Services Union General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe and Inter-University Students’ Federation (IUSF) Acting Convener Sanath Bandara also participated.
