Flashback 2018
Winners, losers and blockbusters!

The year 2018 will be remembered by many for re-defining cinema and movie watching experience of the viewers. Probably for the first time in the last few decades the focus of the filmmaking has been shifted to content rather than making star vehicles. Another interesting thing about the year is that great movies have been made across genres. From Hollywood’s musicals like ‘A Star is Born’ and ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ to animated movies like ‘Incredibles 2’ and Marvel productions like ‘Black Panther’ and ‘Venom’ and Bollywood big budget magnum opuses like ‘Padmaavat’ to comedes like ‘Badhaai Ho’, biopics like ‘Manto’, and an intimate slice of life like ‘October’, we got a mix bag of stories put through the lens of cinema this year as well. As the year comes to an end, we take a trip back to the glorious year that 2018 was.
