Sri islanders rugby and the happy beyond?

Happy are those who instinctively know....
It is a brave rugby heart that would give Sri Lankan hopes that ultimate step up to world cup status and rank us among the rugby elite...
This globally fascinating discipline has little time or quarter for amateurs and hesitant islanders, who are unable to clear their lines.
Sri Lanka Rugby ...formally the Ceylon Rugby Football Union, then the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union....history, pride, respect, courage and a potent recurring dream to be counted and considered among the greatest rugby nations.
Grand ideals that still remain outside the hallowed committee chambers of the IRB gentleman’s club in sunny Dublin...and observer status for Asian rugby still reaching and hoping.
Japan’s remarkable journey to world recognition...certainly stayed resilient through several world cups, to shine brighter in the last hosted by England.
Was Asian rugby finally on the map? ...would our mania be marked and rewarded with elevated status to the top 30 list?
But before we embrace and embark ...should we not consider, since it’s necessary to upgrade our ranking thoughts.
Can you conceivably envisage Hong Kong or South Korea stepping up behind Japan as the next Asian super rugby union?
Hold that bold grey matter utterance...South Korea did dispatch the defending football world champions Germany ...on an early shuttle back home....remarkable, mesmerizing and true.
But alas the comparisons end at the tunnel entrance to the stadium ....Hong Kong v England or Korea v Australia, is still a loaded dream and possibly after Japan hosting the Rugby World Cup next year ...some food for impact thoughts?
On that inspired thought how about Ireland v Sri Lanka? ....our dream continues for XVs ...but is very much reality for 7s.
On that perfect pass, our 7s team, led by the hardworking Muthuthanthri ...are currently in Paris for an extended experience tour.
The Sri Union finally able to get on board and some practical game time for the squad to absorb pressure and mature under different conditions.
This is very much the tip of the iceberg...and positive impact for our Asian series ambitions.
Let’s hope it’s not anywhere close to the iceberg that re-wrote the Titanic trip from Southampton...?
Fiji the 7s islanders super force play more than 10 tournaments as the national squad before they land in Hong Kong for the 7s .....some wisdom and generous servings of traditional kava certainly make them invincible, and very much the mighty islanders that pretty much own the Hong Kong stadium.
Over the last 5 years, Fijian 7s magic and running style has ignited the former British colony beyond conventional imagination and added new dimension to the games global charm.
Let’s wish our national 7s team the strength and skill to outplay and push past, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea on the circuit ...then step up physically to own the Asian series 2018..
Grand thoughts indeed.
At home in our city by the sea....it was all Milo Knockouts final under lights at the impressive Racecourse rugby arena.
Traditional rivals St Peter’s v St Joseph’s was the cracking duel to decide the President’s trophy championship.
Joes the defending champions under the careful eye of coach Nilufer Ibrahim, and very much the favorite to retain the title, given their blackrock defence with 14players for 50 minutes of their league encounter.
Gemunu Chetiya and company looking for some pure icing on that season’s cake ....and more celebrations for an absorbing season.
St Peter’s and the mistakes from their 10/5 league loss ...more pressure on coach Martis and staff to sort ...can they match Joe’s forward power and dictate terms on the day or maybe Peters threes break free...all..in the middle?
Will history repeat itself and a resounding win for the Maradana marauders? Or will the Bamba brigade finally live to expectations?
All answers ...in the middle after 70 minutes.
What a relentless final and a match to wax lyrical about.
Joes hearts...On fire and 15 points lead with 20 mins remaining.
It’s just as they planned...all in order and controlled...just the last bits ....
Peters for their worth and pride had not given up hope ....and despite mighty pressure, they clawed back the 15 points by stepping up the pace and mind on the scoreboard.
There was the slightest chance and only adrenaline, skill and sheer belief that carved the blue white and gold name on that Milo trophy 24/21 final score magical impossible.
It was a classic as finals go ...and the nature of deciders...that one team should triumph 21-all might have been a fitting result?
History will gleefully record that it was an epic final that was all the way down to the wire and easily either contender for the impressive Racecourse podium.
Most importantly, the game climbed beyond expectations and reinforced the pleasing standards of schools rugby in paradise...in spite of its governing structure that definitely require a healthy spring clean at best.
The skill and talent far too rich to take for granted.
Let’s hope sanity and wisdom prevail and we can all hail our divisions of this remarkable union code.
Sri Lanka Rugby will need to harness new solar power in the months ahead post AGM and administrative requisites.
The games stakeholders need to consciously cooperate and create our new generation...high performance union sooner rather than later.
Blessings Sri rugby hearts ...the future is upon us ....lets step up and back our islanders abilities.
Cheers indeed!
