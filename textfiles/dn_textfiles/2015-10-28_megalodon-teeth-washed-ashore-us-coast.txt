Megalodon teeth washed ashore on US Coast

US: North Carolina has been shocked by the fossilized teeth of an ancient shark washed ashore which are believed to have belonged to a 60-foot (18 plus meters) Megalodon.
Beach goers in Surf City, North Carolina recently bumped into giant 6-inch teeth specimens which once belonged to the king of the ocean, a Megalodon.
The massive shark-like creature, believed to be the size of a large bus, roamed the ocean waters 15 million years ago, long before humans existed.
According to experts, the enormous size of the teeth is indicative of the size of the Megalodon whose massive jaw once housed them. When measuring sharks it is believed that every inch of tooth equals 10 feet in length so the 6-inch teeth are thought to have belonged to a 60-foot creature. Megalodons grew up to 60 feet in length weighing up to 100 tons and became extinct around 2.6 million years ago. It is still unclear as to why the humongous prehistoric sharks died out, but it is thought that ocean cooling may have contributed to the extinction of the species, whereas some also cite a decline in food supply.
