Plucker falls unconscious on treetop

A coconut plucker who climbed a coconut tree at the Wadduwa Police Station on Sunday (22) fell unconscious while at the top of the tree. The public who were participating at the New Year celebrations at the police station premises at the time, saw the unconscious plucker and, together with the police, rescued him with difficulty. He was given first aid thereafter.
