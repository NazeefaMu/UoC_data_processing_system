Gopallawa Shield first leg: Holders Vidyartha given a fright by Ananda

Gopallawa Shield holders Vidyartha College ruggerites coming out for the first time this season were made to fight hard before beating Ananda College by 20 points (1 goal, 2 tries and 1 penalty) to 18 (3 tries and 1 penalty) in their Division I Segment 2B rugby match played at the Bogambara Stadium yesterday. The winners led 17/5 at half time.
The Vidyartha backs were outstanding together with the forwards. The heavy and keen Vidyartha forwards used their weight and knowledge to win a major share of the ball in forwards play, especially in the first half.
Ananda forwards and three-quarters staged a grand rally and attacked and displayed a good game of rugby. They dominated play in the second half and if they had exploited all the opportunities that were afforded to them, they could have won.
For Vidyartha D.C. Athukorale (two) and S. Samaraweera (one) scored the tries. T.M. Hettiarachchi did the kicking part. For Ananda S. D. Ratnaweera (two) and P.C. Perera (one) touched down with H.S.D.S. Wijesuriya putt over the solitary penalty. Referee: Asela Muthumala.
