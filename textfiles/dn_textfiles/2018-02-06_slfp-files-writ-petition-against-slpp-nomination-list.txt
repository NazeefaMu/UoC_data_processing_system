SLFP files writ petition against SLPP nomination list

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) yesterday filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking a writ order to quash the nomination papers of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and Janasetha Peramuna (JP) submitted in respect of the Attanagalla Pradeshiya Sabha.
This petition was filed by the SLFP General Secretary and two others naming Election Commission chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, Gampaha District returning officer and candidates contesting for Attanagalla Pradeshiya Sabha from SLPP and JP.
The petitioners further sought an interim order preventing candidates contesting for Attanagalla Pradeshiya Sabha from SLPP and JP from being declared elected as members of Attanagalla Pradeshiya Sabha until the final determination of the petition.
The petitioners alleged that the fifth respondent Harsha Lakmal Dayaratne is contesting from the SLPP in the Ranpokunagama ward in addition to contesting the Kahatovita ward from JP.
The petitioners stated that the fifth respondent has been actively involved in Attanagalla from both political parties and their political parties deceived the Election Commission and the public and have acted in a fraudulent manner in gross violation of Local Government Ordinance.
This petition had been filed through Counsel Sanjeewa Kaluarachchi.
