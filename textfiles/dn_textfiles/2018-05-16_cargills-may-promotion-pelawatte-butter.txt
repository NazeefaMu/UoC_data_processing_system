Cargills May promotion  for Pelawatte Butter

Pelwatte Dairy Industries Limited is offering its Pelwatte Butter tub at 10% off at Cargills outlets islandwide. The offer which began on May 1 will be in place until the May 31.
Pelwatte Dairy is a leading home-grown dairy company that produces many different dairy products such as milk powder, yoghurt, ice-cream and both home use and bulk butter for industrial use.
The brand is widely known for the natural approach taken in the production of their products.
Pelwatte butter is considered natural due to many reasons; one being that the butter is made from the fat in fresh milk with no added preservatives. Fresh milk contains about 4-5% fat and the process of butter production tends to increase the fat percentage in order to control the fat percentage, a standardization process is used which is also another reason as to why Pelwatte Butter is considered all-natural.
