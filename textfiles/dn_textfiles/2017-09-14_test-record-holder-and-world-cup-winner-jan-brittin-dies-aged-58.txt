Test record-holder and World Cup winner Jan Brittin dies aged 58

Jan Brittin, who was part of England's World Cup-winning side in 1993, has died from cancer aged 58.
Brittin is the leading run-scorer and century-maker in Women's Test cricket with five hundreds in her 27 matches between 1979 and 1998.
She played 63 ODIs, and top-scored with 48 when England beat New Zealand at Lord's to win the World Cup and also took the final catch to secure victory.
Her Test best of 167 came against Australia at Harrogate in 1998 - in the penultimate match of her career - and she opened alongside Charlotte Edwards, who paid tribute on Twitter calling Brittin "her idol."
