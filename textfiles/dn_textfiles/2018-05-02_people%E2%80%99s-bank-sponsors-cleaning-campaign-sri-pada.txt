People’s Bank sponsors  cleaning campaign at Sri Pada

People’s Bank recently sponsored the ‘Environmental campaign at Sri Pada sacred grounds 2018’ under its corporate social responsibility program (CSR). Accordingly, a cleaning campaign was driven at the sacred grounds to remove plastic, polythene and other litter polluting the area.
The drive was implemented under the annual ‘Parisaraya Pujaneeyai’ initiative, a concept of Chief Minister Central province and Environmental Affairs Minister Sarath Ekanayake, in conjunction with the People’s Bank’s environmental sustainability program ‘People’s Green Pulse’ initiative.
