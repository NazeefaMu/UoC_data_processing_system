Parents demand opening of Peradeniya Medical Faculty

The Parents' Union of the State Medical Students demands opening of the Medical Faculty of the Peradeniya University immediately, Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
The union has sent the demand in writing to the Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. Closing down the university, especially the Medical Faculty is unacceptable due to an issue of another faculty, he said.
The State medical faculties including the University of Peradeniya Medical Faculty commenced academic work after a long break.
They did not function for nearly one year because of the SAITM issue, he said.
Minister Rajapakshe should intervene and open the Medical Faculty as soon as possible.
If the faculty is not opened soon, the union will stage a major protest in the Peradeniya University shortly, he said.
