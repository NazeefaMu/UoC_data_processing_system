Hapag-Lloyd supports liberalization of Lanka’s shipping, logistics sectors

Hapag-Lloyd India has expressed support to the government’s move to liberalize the country’s shipping and logistics industry. The government’s initiative was announced last week by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera presenting the 2018 Budget proposals.
Managing Director (India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) of Hapag-Lloyd India Pvt. Ltd, Dheeraj Bhatia referring to the move to liberalize the shipping and logistic industry says, “We fully support the liberalization of shipping industry in any country. We have experienced wide ranging benefits for the local shipping industry in countries where foreign direct investments are welcome.”
Bhatia explained that the presence of global players encourages free competition, which in turn results in cost efficiencies, higher quality and more efficient operations.
“We welcome the Budget 2018 proposals in Sri Lanka in this regard,” Bhatia said.
