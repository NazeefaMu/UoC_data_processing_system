SPEAK UP!

For youngsters looking to ready themselves for the real world, public speaking is a must. Building confidence in public speaking is an important life skill with many important real-life applications. Toastmasters helps youngsters across the world to voice their opinions on a public stage without passing out. 
Speech contests are a Toastmasters tradition. Each year thousands of Toastmasters compete in the Humorous, Evaluation, Table Topics and International speech contests. Shamen Sameera from Serendib Toastmasters Club became the second Sri Lankan to win the Humourous Speech Contest Championship of District 82 Toastmasters International at Reverberations 2017 held in Chennai, India, from December 1 to 3, 2017. The 26 year old competed against around 700 Toastmasters from Sri Lanka and India to win the competition.
“Humorous Speech is poles apart from stand-up comedy. You deliver a structured speech which includes a story. You need to insert humour into the tale. The speech should not exceed seven and a half minutes. The judges grade you according to the reaction of the audience. Therefore you need to connect with the viewers to score,” Shamen said.

He noted that they are allowed to select any topic of their choice and practice their speeches. Love, marriage, social issues like traffic etc are some of the most frequent topics that past contestants have focused on. Shamen wished to try his hand at giving something different to the audience.
“I selected topics like being bullied and cowardice. Such speeches also embody a message like just because you look fragile you need not give into such treatment. You need to survive and stand up to such people. I wanted people to accept the fact that it is ok not to be a very aggressive person. I also informed them not to put themselves down because they feel afraid when I spoke about being a coward at Reverberations 2017,” Shamen explained.
He believes that this out of the box thinking was his success formula.
“Everybody has faced odds that they cannot beat. Therefore they were able to relate to the topic. I kept my terms simple so that even a small child is able to understand my jokes. Sometimes contestants get carried away and they try to incorporate humour which is not appropriate for everyone. The best kind of humour is the kind that is directed at your own self. I follow this rule and make sure that everybody is laughing with me,” he added with a smile.
The judges were scattered among the audience. The contestants have no idea who they are. Therefore they need to give equal attention to each and every member in the audience.
Shamen notes that generally the speakers deliver their speeches with a straight face. However Shamen took a different route yet again and managed to win over the audience with his strategies.
“How do you expect others to laugh if your speech cannot make you laugh? I did not hide the fact that I am enjoying myself on stage. So I joined in with the audience’s laughter. I connected with the audience by smiling and waving at them even on the way to the stage,” he said adding that he believes that is why people reacted to his speech more than they did to those of the other contestants.
As an active Toastmaster Shamen has been contesting in all four types of Toastmasters contests: International Speech Contest, Evaluation Contest, Table Topics Contest and Humourous Speech Contest at the Division Level in Sri Lanka for three consecutive years. He notes that the Table Topics Contest is the toughest because you are not given any preparation time since the topic is given then and there at the contestant chair.
“However for Sri Lankans, the most challenging competition is the Humourous Speech because Indians are gifted with the ability to make the audience crack up. They have a simple storytelling technique too,” he stressed.
He said that since he has taken part in the competition for three continuous years, he felt that he has taken a stride forward to better his techniques each year.
An old boy of Royal College, Colombo, Shamen said that he has been mainly focusing on his studies during his school days.

“I was very studious. I even slept for about three of four hours a day because I was so into studies. I was not involved in extracurricular activities but soon realized their worth when I took part in the CIMA Global Business Challenge. I had all the knowledge with me to win that competition but when it came to delivering the presentation I felt that I could not deliver my ideas in a manner which will convince the judges to send me from the Sri Lankan finals to the global finals. I realized that I need to brush up my soft skills. I joined Serendib Toastmasters club in early 2015,” he recalled how it all began.
Queried on what makes a good speaker and Shamen said that a person has to be patience and humble enough to learn from others.

“Accept others’ advice and try to sharpen your skills. Spend time on gathering more knowledge by listening to other speakers on the Internet. Pick a role model and take whatever you feel suits your setup. Build up your own unique identity without being a copy of another,” he opined.
Shamen had ranked Island 11th and Colombo district sixth place in the Commerce stream at the 2010 GCE Advanced level examination in 2010. He graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration Degree at Colombo University with first class honours. He is also a CIMA Sri Lanka prize winner and had achieved world rank sixth place in the TOP CIMA case-study examination held in May 2013. He is the Vice President for Public Relations of Serendib Toastmasters for 2017/18.
Shamen is employed at the Strategy and Risk Department of L B Finance PLC. He was a part of the team which had been instrumental in setting up of the first overseas subsidiary of LB Finance PLC in Myanmar recently.
He notes that he has two role models: Bimal Perera who is his supervisor at work and America’s Got Talent 2015 contestant comedian Drew Lynch.
“Lynch has a stutter but despite his disability he inspires people by getting on the stage and delivering brilliant speeches. I was motivated by his talent,” Shamen expressed.
“Becoming a member of a Toastmasters club adds immense value to your life. There is nothing called a free meal. You need to sacrifice a bit of your time to gain something. Consider it as an investment. If you can invest in one area and develop in multiple areas I believe that you can achieve greater success in life. I was a Toastmaster for about one year when I faced my first interview. I managed to pass it with flying colours because I was able to project my talents in a manner to win over the interview panel’s trust and confidence. Now I have the ability to go to board meetings and do presentations because I know how to address the listeners and what they wish to hear,” he concluded.
