LAUGFS holds annual  book distribution  campaign for 12th year

LAUGFS Holdings recently carried out their Annual Book Gifting Campaign for the 12th consecutive year to over 200 staff members school going children.
The event was organized by the LAUGFS Welfare society, which has been driving this annual programme since 2005.
The project was initiated with the intention of facilitating and supporting staff members to encourage early literacy and further education for their children.
“This annual programme reinforces our commitment to support education in Sri Lanka, by especially focusing on the children of our staff members. As a company with a strong family culture, we believe in looking after each other and continuously creating a strong bond with our colleagues and their families. With this initiative, we hope to support some of our colleagues to meet the basic educational needs of their children and to help them broaden their knowledge and secure a better future,” commented LAUGFS Holdings Group Managing Director, Thilak De Silva.
This year’s campaign benefited over 200 families, who gathered at the LAUGFS Head Office to celebrate the occasion. Those who excelled in the grade five scholarship examination and students who gained university entrance in 2016 were also recognized for their achievements during the event.
A special segment was further conducted in honour of deceased employees of the company and their families. LAUGFS Welfare society has been assisting these families and providing them with financial support from the inception of this initiative.
The funding for the project was provided with personal contributions by LAUGFS Chairman, W.K.H. Wegapitiya and the Group Managing Director, Thilak De Silva along with financial assistance offered by several LAUGFS subsidiaries.
