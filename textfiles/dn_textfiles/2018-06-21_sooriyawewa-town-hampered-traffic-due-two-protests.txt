Sooriyawewa town hampered with traffic due to two protests

 
The Sooriyawewa town is hampered with traffic due to protests carried out by two groups.
Of the two groups, one group is protesting the human-elephant conflict by which farmers in the area are adversely affected and the other group is protesting in demand of compensation to lands taken over by the previous government during constructions conducted to enlarge the Hambantota – Sooriyawewa road.
