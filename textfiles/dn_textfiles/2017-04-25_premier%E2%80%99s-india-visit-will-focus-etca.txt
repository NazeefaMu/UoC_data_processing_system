Premier’s India visit will focus on ETCA

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s visit to India will focus on the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), UNP MP Nalin Bandara said.
He made this observation while insisting that Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm Agreement was not on the cards of the Premier’s visit to India.
He however said critical political and economic decisions would be made during the Premier’s visit to India and Indian Premier Narendra Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka.
The UNP backbencher also said the Hambantota Port Agreement would be signed within the next two weeks.
He noted 90 percent of the Agreement has been finalized, adding that last minute negotiations were to reduce the 99-year lease period.
He pointed out the Ceylon Petroleum workers’ strike was triggered by misinformation campaign that the Trincomalee oil tanks would be sold to India.
Refuting this claim, the MP said the Government’s intention was to develop the oil tanks, which were idling for many years, in a manner that benefits the country.
Responding to a question on the Cabinet reshuffle, the MP said they were against making changes to cabinet portfolios just because of personal rifts between the SLFP and UNP ministers.
However, he said they have no objection for a Cabinet reshuffle done in a scientific manner.
