Possible fuel crisis looming, warns Union leader

The inclement weather has delayed the unloading of a shipment of fuel at the Muthurajawela terminal with further delays being experienced due to a breakage of a hose, which could lead to a fuel shortage in the country if the situation is not brought under control, the Ceylon Petroleum Common Workers Union Secretary, D. J. Rajakaruna warned.
He warned that in the event there is a delay in a shipment, the country could once again face a serious fuel shortage.
“Currently too there is a crisis brewing with the unloading at Muthurajawela being delayed by several days due to the inclement weather conditions and now that the weather has improved, a hose has been damaged, further delaying the fuel unloading,” said Rajakaruna, adding that currently 75 percent of the fuel requirement is distributed through Muthurajawela and if there is a delay, this could affect the country’s fuel distribution process.
In addition, as crude oil, petrol and kerosene oil is being pumped through the two pipelines at Muthurajawela, these pipelines too have to be rinsed using sea water. It is said that this situation too would lead to a huge fuel crisis before long. Currently, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) only holds fuel buffer stocks for just 15 days and if a fuel shipment is delayed, as experienced previously, the country would inevitably face a serious fuel crisis.
Further compounding the problem, three of the five oil pipelines that pump crude oil from ships to the Kolonnawa refinery are out of service and as a result, the CPC is losing millions of rupees from each fuel shipment, he said.
Speaking to the Daily News, Rajakaruna said these pipelines are over 60-70 years old and currently, oil is being pumped through one operational 10-inch pipeline from the Port to the Kolonnawa refinery and furnace oil is being pumped through a 14-inch pipeline. However, unloading which should take around two days, now takes around eight days to complete a single shipment, causing the CPC millions of in demurrage charges.
“The last pipeline to be operational was the 12-inch pipeline, but due to the wear and tear over the years and lack of maintenance, there were several leaks that eventually led to several houses catching fire.
Previously, a project was initiated for the restoration of these pipelines and in certain areas, offices were also established and some were also paid, but eventually it never materialised and the project was abandoned,” he added.
The pipeline network that pumps the fuel from the harbour to the Kolonnawa refinery is parallel to the rail track and many squatters have constructed illegal houses along this pipeline network, hindering any repair or maintenance work on the pipelines. “Some of them were even given compensation previously and evicted, but they have now returned and are still living in the same spot.”
Meanwhile, tenders were called for the repair of the 12” pipeline, but it was later decided to deploy the CPC workers to repair and restore this pipeline.
However, although parts of the pipeline have been restored, it is not possible to test the pipeline, due to the illegal squatters.
Meanwhile, it is reported that due to the delay in unloading the oil shipments these ships are docked at the harbour for longer periods and the CPC has to pay demurrage fees of Rs. 3 - Rs. 5 million per ship per day.
It is also reported that as only two pipelines are operational for the pumping of diesel, petrol and aviation fuel, after each pumping operation, the pipeline has to be rinsed with sea water before the next type of fuel is pumped, which leads to the corrosion of the pipelines.
