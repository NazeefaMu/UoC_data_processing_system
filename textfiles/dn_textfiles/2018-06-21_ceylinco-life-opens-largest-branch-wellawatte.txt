Ceylinco Life opens largest branch in Wellawatte

The largest branch office of Ceylinco Life was opened recently in Wellawatte by Sri Lanka’s Life Insurance leader, to better serve policyholders in Colombo South and its suburbs.
The new branch is located in a building acquired by Ceylinco Life at Galle Road Colombo 06 with a fully-equipped training facility. It will accommodate four Ceylinco Life branch units covering the Wellawatte area.
The office is fitted with energy-efficient lighting and has its own space for convenient customer parking.
“Wellawatte has maintained a steady performance in the 14 years since dedicated branches were set up for the area. This is one of the key reasons to have opened a larger office. The acquisition of this building will be one of the milestones of our 30th anniversary year,” Ceylinco Life Managing Director and CEO R. Renganathan said.
Ceylinco Life also owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena and Mount Lavinia, many of which have been converted to solar energy. New branch buildings purpose-built to the company’s sustainable energy model are those at Horana, Panadura, Wennappuwa, Bandarawela,Chilaw and Kadawatha.
