Craig back to being Bond?

For fans of British actor Daniel Craig this might come across as some great news. The actor is reportedly said to be making his appearance as James Bond, after talks with the franchise’s producer Barbara Broccoli went well, reported DailyMail.co.uk.
Daniel had once stated that he would prefer to “slash his own wrists” instead of taking up another Bond role. However, Page Six reported that Tom Hiddleston, who was in the running to be the next Bond, might have been ruled out after the producer had a talk with Daniel.
A source also told the publication, “Broccoli doesn’t like Tom, he’s a bit too smug and not tough enough to play James Bond.” According to the source, Tom’s romance with Taylor Swift and his speech where he spoke about aid workers in impoverished South Sudan and how they warmly welcomed him after they watched his TV show, failed to impress Broccoli.
