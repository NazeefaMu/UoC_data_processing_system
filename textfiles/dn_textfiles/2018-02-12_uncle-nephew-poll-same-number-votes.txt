Uncle, nephew poll the same number of votes

Anuradhapura GA and Returning Officer E.M. Wanninayake had to draw lots between an uncle and nephew who contested the Palagala Pradeshiya Sabha from two different parties, under the proportional representation system, on Saturday.
UNP candidate Suranga Ratnayake and his uncle, SLPP candidate Anura Prabath Ratnayake contested the Palagala PS polls from the Dambulu Hammillewa ward.
Despite several recounts, each had polled 1,681 votes. The provincial leaders of the two parties entrusted the returning officer with the power to select the winning candidate in keeping with election laws.
At the drawing of lots, Suranga Ratnayake was the winner. He contested elections for the first time.
