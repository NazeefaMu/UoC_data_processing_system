The Sri Lanka – France Business Council of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce organized an evening of cocktails and networking on November 7, 2018 to welcome the new Ambassador of France, Eric Lavertu to Sri Lanka. Ambassador Lavertu presented his credentials to the President of Sri Lanka last week.
“On behalf of the members of the Sri Lanka – France Business Council, we are happy to welcome Eric Lavertu to Sri Lanka and look forward to working closely with him to further develop trade and economic ties between France and Sri Lanka, and we look forward to his unstinted support to drive the activities of the Sri Lanka – France Business Council to greater heights,” said Senaka Amerasinghe, President of the Sri Lanka – France Business Council addressing the gathering.
The Sri Lanka – France Business Council was established in 2004 and has a current membership of 70. Bilateral Business Councils are an integral part of the Ceylon Chamber, playing a vital role in the promotion of international business.
The 19 Bilateral Business Councils of the Ceylon Chamber have a great impact on promoting exports and attracting investments through joint meetings with partner countries.
The Business Councils facilitate business matchmaking events through business promotion missions, knowledge sharing events such as seminars and conferences, trade fairs and product/service catalogue exhibitions as means to promote bilateral business.
The Sri Lanka – France Business Council, in an effort to promote Sri Lankan Business, organized a delegation to France last year, headed by Dr. Asanka Ratnayake who was the Council President during that time.
