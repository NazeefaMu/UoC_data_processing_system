Step forward to polythene free environment

The meals provided to state officials attending the Galle District Development Committee Meeting held on June 19 were offered in brown paper bags instead of in polythene bags for the first time.
The measure was taken as an initiative towards providing a solution to the problem of accumulation of non-degradable waste. The request in this regard was made by committee's co-chairman parliamentarian Wijepala Hettiarachchi to Galle GA S.T. Kodikare.
