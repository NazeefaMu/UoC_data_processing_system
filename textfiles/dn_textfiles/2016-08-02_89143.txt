Hrithik’s ‘Mohenjo Daro’experience

Makers of ‘Mohenjo Daro’ have extensively shot in Bhuj for the film. In fact, the bigger coincidence was that Ashutosh had also shot one of his hit and critically loved films, ‘Lagaan’ in the same place. The ‘Mohenjo Daro’ set was constructed on the same land where the ‘Lagaan’ cricket ground was made.
The team was pleasantly surprised to see that the cement platform created to make the cricket pavilion during ‘Lagaan’ was still there in Bhuj when they arrived for ‘Mohenjo Daro’ and it continues to be there.
During ‘Lagaan’, the crew and the unit of the film stayed in residential apartments as back then Bhuj didn’t have many hotels or infrastructure. However now, Bhuj has become far more developed with so many more hotels and infrastructure. But at the same time, it continues to be a very sweet, positive, clean town which made the experience so memorable for the entire team.
With the kind of vision that Ashutosh had for the film, there were about 300 crew people on set all the time during the shooting in Bhuj.
Also what many don’t know is the fact that there are several localities of Bhuj who have also got cast in the film! The makers held a full-fledged audition for all the locals of Bhuj.
Hrithik will be seen romancing Pooja Hegde on the celluloid which has also created intrigue amongst audiences. ‘Mohenjo Daro’s trailer released and proved to be a visual spectacle, rising anticipation levels of the audience. Presented by UTV Motion Pictures and Ashutosh Gowariker Productions, and produced by Siddharth Roy Kapur and Sunita Gowariker, the film will release worldwide on August 12.
