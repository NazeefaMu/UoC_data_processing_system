Arpico Supercentre partners Thomian 1st XI Hockey

In a bid to engage with sporting activities and increase interaction with a younger audience, “Arpico Supercentre is set to take on a role of corporate partner of the S.Thomas’ College first XI hockey team. The official partnership was acknowledged recently at S.Thomas’ College Mt.Lavinia in the presence of college officials and representatives from Arpico Supercentre.
“ Schools sporting season attracts school children and parents from across the country and mainly in the Western Province and this gives us a viable platform to engage effectively with the younger generation and their parents who are also our main target market” said Minodh De Sylva, Head of Marketing at Richard Pieris Distributors Ltd.
Incidentally it was the first time in its history that S.Thomas College hockey team has had a corporate partner. Many of the college sports teams continue to be partnered by top corporates in the country. S.Thomas’ has been playing Hockey for over half a century and has been producing many national players. The school participated in all age groups in the provincial and national tournaments. The Old Thomians Hockey Union (OTHU) has been instrumental in the affiliation of Arpico Supercentre with S.Thomas’ college. OTHU has been involved in developing hockey at STC in the recent years.
The Thomian 1st XI team’s performance has been exceptional this year. The team emerged joint Champions at the TPT six a side tournament, they beat Trinity College Kandy in their annual encounter and were joint champions in their annual encounter with traditional rivals, Royal college in what was a nail biting finish having dominated the game throughout.
