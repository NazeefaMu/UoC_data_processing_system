Padmavati  becomes Sanjay Leela  Bhansali’s longest film

Sanjay Leela Bhansali is known to make larger-than-life films that are long enough to give every character enough time in the narrative. His films like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Devdas, Ram-leela, and Bajirao Mastani amongst others are proof enough of the fact. This time around though, the opulent filmmaker has taken things to a higher level. Bhansali’s Padmavati is his longest film yet. Yes, you read that right.
According to a report in a leading daily, the Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor starrer has a runtime of 3 hours and 13 minutes. A source told the daily, “The runtime of Padmavati is somewhere around three-hours-and-13-minutes. The makers had shot material of over four-and-a-half hours and the director sat with his editor to chop the film down to somewhere around 200 minutes.”
What comes as a surprise here is the fact that till date the Salman Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Ajay Devgn starrer Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam was considered as Bhansali’s longest film with a run time of 3 hours and 8 minutes backed by Shah Rukh Khan starrer Devdas which was 3 hours and 5 minutes. With the new report, looks like Padmavati has broken all previous records of SLB films. Surely this is going to add to the already booming buzz around the film. Exciting!
