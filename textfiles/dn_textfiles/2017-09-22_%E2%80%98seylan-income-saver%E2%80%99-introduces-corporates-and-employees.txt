‘Seylan income Saver’  introduces for corporates  and employees

Reiterating its commitment in adding value to the citizens of Sri Lanka, Seylan Bank introduced the ‘Seylan Income Saver’, a novel proposition devised for corporates and employees to offer a wide array of benefits for savings account holders and their fixed incomes.
Seylan Income Saver encompasses a two in one offering that includes the Seylan Income Saver payroll, a service that offers corporates to automate their salaries in real time to employee’s accounts and the Seylan Income Saver service which is the only account that values salaries and all other fixed incomes with a multitude of benefits.
Commenting on the launch Tilan Wijeyesekara, Deputy General Manager- Retail Banking at Seylan Bank said “The Seylan Income Saver service was conceptualized to fulfill the aspirations of both corporates and employees alike. This proposition will enable companies to transform its traditional way of depositing salaries to a faster and efficient salary upload system. Therefore, employees will experience fast and convenient transactional solutions with multiple benefits that not only value their salary account but all other fixed incomes as well.”
A saving can be enjoyed for corporates that enroll with Seylan Payroll and enjoy special interest rates for credit packages subject to business volumes. Companies under Seylan Payroll are eligible to obtain a business credit card, which can be used to carry out safer and faster business transactions.
Seylan Income Savers will receive free Mobile and Internet banking services coupled with the opportunity to win gifts and rewards from Seylan Sure rewards scheme, a benefit scheme designed to offer special gifts for occasions such as weddings, during birth of a child, and in the event of passing the grade 5 scholarship exam, O/L with 8 A’s and A/L with 3 A’s.
