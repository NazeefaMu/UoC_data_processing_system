TNA presses conditions on UNP to extend support

United National Front (UNF) MP Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said the Ranil Wickremesinghe-led United National Party had discussed with R.Sampanthan and several other Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MPs about how they could go about serving Tamil people in the North.
Senaratne said this on being asked about Monday’s reports that said that the TNA members,leader Sampanthan, M. Sumanthiran, Selvam Adakkelanaden and D. Sidharthan had put forward several conditions upon UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees to extend the TNA’s support to the UNP.
TNA sources said the meetings they held with UNP higher-ups were successful than with any other political parties.
On being asked whether they discussed context of a new Constitution, freeing of political prisoners, release of lands currently under Sri Lanka Army to their original owners, full implementation of the 13 th Amendment, and merging of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, Senaratna said, they talked about these problems with the TNA.
“We did not talk about anything eccentric. What had been discussed with the TNA, had also been discussed with President Maithripala Sirisena in no simple terms,” said Senaratne.
Asked if the UNP agreed with the conditions laid out by the Tamil National Alliace, Senaratne charged that our newspaper was trying to create a bleak picture about a UNP-TNA aggregation that would divide the country.
On being pointed out that we are only interested in knowing whether the UNP has struck an agreement with TNA on the basis of some conditions laid out by the latter, Senaratne said,”You may write what you want. Anyway this is going to be for a few days.”
United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Gamini Lokuge said they have no reservations that UNP leader Wickremesinghe would sign anything to stay in power, irrespective of any concern to policy, national security or integrity of the country.
Asked if he meant that they do not have the support of TNA, Lokuge said, “For TNA to support us we should agree with the condition put by them. “
“We have clearly stated that we are against any federal or constitutional move that would put the country at the risk of being divided. Our stance is clear as regards the removal of military in the North and we will not merge the Northern and Eastern Provinces,” he explained.
UNP MP Eran Wickramaratne said about this that UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinge made his stance clear about it the preceding day in Parliament when he said that the solution to the national question is in an undivided unitary Sri Lanka.
“A Federal solution is totally out. The TNA is also for it. They have stayed away from it and encouraging a different settlement to their problems,” explained Wickramaratne.
UPFA MP S.B. Dissanayake said , “All these words come from a party whose leader had actually tried to write off a portion of a three- fourths of the country to LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.”
“The countrymen know so well what Ranil did in 2001,” he said.
As regards the TNA’s condition for the full implementation of 13 th Amendment, this was exactly what the UNP was trying to do all these years.
“I have reasons to think that Ranil has already signed an agreement with the TNA to give away the provisions for Police Powers and Land Powers to the North. This is no big deal for him, if he sees an opportunity to stay in power,” he added.
Commenting on the prevailing conflicting situation in the country and on what Dharmallingam Siddarthan had stated, veteran archeologist Ven. Ellawala Medhananda Thera said:” Which-ever political party that supports or collaborates with proposals detrimental to the well-being of the country, put forward by another political party merely to get their backing and vote for their survival, such a political party is a party that betrays the country”.
While commending the Tamil community at large willing to live in harmony with other communities, Ven. Medhananda Thera pointed out that those Tamils living the Northern part of the country, said they love to preserve what is old and sacred and they have no grudge against the Sinhalese. There is a very close and cordial relationship between the Sinhala and Tamil people.It is the Sinhala and Tamil power hungry politicians who are trying to create a division between the two communities for their political survival.” I have said this to the face of R. Sambandan in Parliament, while I served as a MP,”, the Thera added.
“Small political parties extend their support to major political parties to form a Government on conditions that are beneficial to them. The main political parties should understand this. The small parties are waiting to get the maximum benefits by bargaining for various things. They extend their support to which ever party that is ready to give in to their demands,” the Thera said.
Which-ever major political party that supports or collaborates with proposals detrimental to the well-being of the country, put forward by another political party merely to get their backing and vote for their survival,this si something that cannot be tolerated as it a betrayal of the country and people,” Ven. Medhananda Thera added.
Meanwhile, Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella said “If the Supreme Court announces its decision on the Fundamental Rights petitions filed challenging the dissolution of Parliament today or tomorrow, it will help find a speedy solution to the current political impasse, .
“This situation has arisen due to postponing of the hearing of the petition on the the appointment of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa until January 2019,” he added.
Rambukwella said the Courts have taken time to resolve the political issue and in this backdrop, if a decision by the SC too gets delayed and if Mahinda Rajapaksa does not resign from the post of Prime Minister, it will be difficult to solve the issue.
He said the decision by the Court of Appeal to postpone the hearing may indicate that although some think the current political crisis is very serious, the Appeal Court may not be of the same mindset.
Speaking on the current political scenario, CAFFE Director Keerthi Tennakoon was of the view that steps need to be taken to resolve the issue without further delay.If not, it would have a major impact on the country’s economy. It would be disastrous if one allows the present crisis to prolong, as it could adversely affect the economy.
According to Tennakoon, there are three ways to resolve the present political crisis:Firstly,to get the verdict from the Supreme Court in quick time; secondly, to create the necessary atmosphere to appoint a new Prime Minister and thirdly, to take prudent measures to resolve the crisis and stabililise the political and economic situation by forming an All Party Government.
He also said that an Interim Order of the Supreme Court does not prevent the appointment of a suitable person as Prime Minister together with a Cabinet. It has only temporally stopped Mahinda Rajapaksa and 49 other Members from functioning in their posts.
