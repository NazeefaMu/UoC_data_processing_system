Arpita opens up about Salman Khan’s wedding

The rumours about Salman Khan tying the knot with Iulia Vantur have been doing the rounds for quite a while now.
In fact, some time back, ‘Bhai’ stated that he would be getting married on November 18 but the year had not been finalized. During a recently held event, Salman’s sister Arpita was asked a question about his impending marriage. Replying to the query, she refused to offer a comment, reported Pinkvilla. “I am not answering that question, you can ask him to talk about it,” she added.
Interestingly, this is an exciting time for Salman. His latest release Sultan opened to a thunderous response at the box office earlier this month.
At present, he gearing up to begin work on his next film Tubelight which will be directed by Kabir Khan.
Moreover, on the personal front, the Rajasthan High Court recently acquitted him in the 18-year-old Chinkara/ black buck poaching case. Pinkvilla
