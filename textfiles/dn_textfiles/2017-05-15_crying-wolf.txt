Crying wolf

“All stories are about wolves. All worth repeating, that is. Anything else is sentimental drivel”, declares the nameless male protagonist of the nested novella in Margaret Atwood’s The Blind Assassin. Lay that next to Harold Pinter’s much-quoted epitome that his plays are about “the weasel under the cocktail cabinet”. And finally Angela Carter, in her short story “The Company of Wolves”: “We keep the wolves outside by living well”.
What is the difference between a weasel and a wolf? Perhaps it’s pedantic to make a distinction, if we accept that we are talking about latent menace. But of course the difference lies exactly in the pedantry, the precision, of “weasel” and “cocktail cabinet” as compared to the great shaggy archetype of the wolf. Contemporary fairy tales, from Carter and Atwood onwards, often seek to relaunch the wolf as an emblem of all the things we try to keep outside by living well. The cruelty and wildness inherent in sex, bodies, society; the animal at the heart of the predatory male or long-repressed female; the untamed subconscious. Ironically, through sheer over-exposure, these writers have domesticated the figure of the wolf and neutralized his menace. His teeth are pulled; his claws clipped. But a weasel – now, a weasel might still make you jump.
Intertextual references
In her introduction to the Vintage edition of The Bloody Chamber (1995), Helen Simpson gets all hot and sweaty fighting off possible objections to Carter’s short stories. Are they just a bunch of gussied-up fairy tales? Oh, no they’re not: “The Bloody Chamber is often – wrongly – described as a group of traditional fairy tales given a subversive feminist twist. In fact these are new stories, not retellings”. Simpson reminds us that Carter’s self-described intention was “to extract the latent content from the traditional stories and to use it as the beginnings of new stories”. Does this perhaps sound a bit too simple? Certainly not: “Nearly all Carter’s writing is strikingly full of cultural and intertextual references – you could spend five years on an annotation of The Bloody Chamber”. Daunted at the prospect of all those layers of meaning? Never mind: Carter is “good at surfaces”, too. Once again, Simpson quotes Carter herself: “I’ve tried to keep an entertaining surface . . . so that you don’t have to read them as a system of signification if you don’t want to”. And what about all the repetition in the collection? The answer is that it is intentional, and very, very clever. “Three disparate werewolf tales work and rework the story of Red Riding Hood, borrowing variants from different centuries, compulsively circling the figures of the werewolf, the old woman and the young girl.”
Of course this is all catnip to A level students and academics. For the former, it’s a crash course in “things-that-have-more-than-one-meaning”. And for the latter, what could be better than a pile of borrowed variants from different centuries to sift through and analyse? But for everyone else – werewolves? Really? Simpson praises the way that Carter’s imagination was fired by “the landscapes and imagery of fairy tales . . . bloodstains and ravens’ feathers on snow, moonlight on a dust-grimed mirror, graveyards on Walpurgisnacht”. Does this list “fire your imagination”, or do you find raven’s feathers and dust-grimed mirrors clichéd – and frankly rather boring?
folkloric heritage
As soon as you have a young girl intercepted by a wolf on her way to Grandmother’s house (as in Carter’s “The Company of Wolves”), then, however they interact, however the story ends, it is difficult to argue that this is anything more than a retelling. In theory, tellers of modern fairy tales are being ingeniously, subversively playful with the folkloric heritage we all know so well. (Think of Haydn, whose audience at Esterházy was so familiar with his music that he was able to include formal musical “puns”.) But it is very hard to make this moth-eaten material new again. And in 2017 it is even harder, because Carter’s own success has encouraged so many imitations that the old stories are now wearing thinner than ever. Four of the five books under review mention Carter and/or Atwood in their publicity. The exception is Marisa Silver’s Little Nothing, which instead tries to distance itself with the bold claim that the author “takes readers to a place few novelists go, a netherworld between literature and fantasy” .
unspecified time
In the case of the two novels by old-handers – Little Nothing and Neil Jordan’s Carnivalesque – it is tempting to detect a late-career laziness, a sense that fairy tales are low-hanging fruit. Silver’s novel is indeed firmly in the Carterian tradition, patching together some of the most familiar stories in unfamiliar, feminist ways (so not that unfamiliar after all). Pavla Janácek is born to an elderly couple, Agáta and Václav, in an unnamed country at an unspecified time. To their shame and disappointment, she is a dwarf. The first twist? She’s a pretty one. “When most people hear of a dwarf, they imagine court jesters or circus clowns.” But although her parents come to love their beautiful dwarf, they’d still like her to be a normal height, so they agree to let a charlatan doctor stretch her on a homemade rack.
The procedure is technically a success – Pavla is now a normal height – but she is also, subtly, a wolf. “Subtly” in the mode of Carter’s “Wolf-Alice”, of whom we learn that “nothing about her is human except that she is not a wolf; it is as if the fur she thought she wore had melted into her skin and become part of it, although it does not exist”. Similarly, Pavla’s paramour Danilo can’t work out whether she’s woman or wolf. Together they end up working for the charlatan doctor in a travelling freak show (of course there’s a travelling freak show). At first, Pavla is displayed as “the Were-Woman”, but “Wolf Girl” attracts more punters. “It turns out there is nothing remarkable in people’s minds about the idea of a grown woman with hair on her face.” Both Carter’s story and Silver’s novel use the wolf-transformation to explore ideas surrounding adolescence, female identity and aesthetic norms. (Yawn.) Wolfish Pavla “is, after all, the synthesis of two things men have a need to routinely destroy: animals and women” – which is a modern fairy tale as oversimplified and over-told as the rest. Eventually Pavla eats the oppressive doctor and completes her transformation. The rest of the novel follows her and Danilo as they make their way separately through the world, Danilo now helplessly in love with a wild, language-less wolf. Allegory abounds. Go on, boy, fetch!
Jordan directed the film version of Carter’s “The Company of Wolves” and worked on the screenplay with her. His seventh novel, Carnivalesque, shares tent space with Nights at the Circus. Carter’s protagonist in that novel, Fevvers, may or may not have real wings growing out of her back; she makes her living, and her name, by working as an aerialiste in Colonel Kearney’s circus. The magical creatures in Jordan’s less successful offering are near-immortal “carnies” who hide their supernatural powers by performing in the big top. Our protagonist is a sweet human boy called Andy whose parents are braced for him to change as he enters adolescence. They don’t expect him to be changed, however – quite literally switched for his evil reflection in Burleigh’s Amazing Hall of Mirrors during a family outing to the carnival. Andy accepts his new life as a gravity-defying changeling just in time to do battle with the Dewman, fighting on the side of the carnies’ own Mulciber (the Hall of Mirrors is Pandæmonium). Before long, we are up to our ears in Adam and Eve by way of Milton. “There was an Eden from which carnies fell. A mirror of the biblical one.” This is a story that, in Jordan’s hands, feels as tired as all those over-worked werewolves. Philip Pullman’s Northern Lights trilogy has just as much Milton, and it is more expertly wielded, with ten times the invention and none of the pomposity. It is intended for teenagers, and it is cleverer, better. This is another difficulty with the fairy tale genre: it overlaps with fantasy and children’s stories, and is often outclassed by writers from these ostensibly less sophisticated modes. The much-parodied Twilight trilogy does a better job of rejuvenating the werewolf trope than does Marisa Silver; and J. K. Rowling’s appropriation of mythology and the fairy tale is (whisper it) every bit as intricate as these more “adult” reworkings.
Benign nonsense
Sara Flannery Murphy’s debut novel, The Possessions, uneasily straddles the border between fantasy-thriller and something worthier. The result is benign nonsense, a book that delivers everything you expect from its tagline: “Who will prevail – the woman or the ghost?” (Prevail!) The wicked fairy godmother here is Atwood, not Carter; we are in a conveniently detail-free dystopia in which our narrator Eurydice (not her real name) works for the madame-like Mrs Renard as a “body”. A “body” is a sort of prostitute-cum-medium who is paid to swallow a pill known as “lotus”; for a short amount of time, Eurydice effectively leaves her body to make room for the spirit of a client’s dead loved one. Flannery makes heavyish weather of a “body”-related mystery involving a murder and a drowning. You sense that this is meant to be a more respectable, Atwoodian equivalent to Gone Girl, but it’s likely to end up thrilling neither camp.
The Possessions shows how even the peripheral presence of the fairy tale invites an automatic overwriting: a woman’s hair here is as “black as a raven’s wing”; a mourner’s eyes are as “dry and clear as shards of glass”. Silver, Jordan and Carter herself all write from stock in this way, the get-out clause being that fairy tales are stock, silly, it’s all part of the act. But do you really want to watch Carter limping through this tired routine? “He was as rich as Croesus.” A necklace is as “cold as ice”. “His face was as still as ever I’d seen it, still as a pond iced thickly over.” (Compare Sara Flannery Murphy: “I’m an endless expanse of ice”.) “I felt as giddy as if I were on the edge of a precipice.” “The key slid into the new lock as easily as a hot knife into butter.” “His feral muzzle is sharp as a knife.” (All of these are examples from stories in The Bloody Chamber.) - Times Literary Supplement
