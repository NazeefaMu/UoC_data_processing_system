Foreign employment agent dies during scuffle

A foreign employment agent, A. P. Don Nimal, 57, of Walahapitiya, Nattandiya allegedly embroiled in a scuffle with a job seeker, died on admission to the Marawila hospital.
Investigations by Marawila Police revealed that the job seeker who had made a payment to the agent in anticipation of a job placement had visited the agent to find out about an inordinate delay in sending him for a job abroad. An argument had ensued over the issue after which the job seeker is alleged to have beaten up the agent who had received injuries.
Although he was rushed to the Marawila hospital, he had died on admission. Hospital sources said Nimal had been suffering from a heart ailment for some time.
Investigations are continuing.
