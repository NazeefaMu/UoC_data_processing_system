Lanka second string pitted against Lithuania today

Sri Lanka “B” team will play the visiting Lithuania side in a football match at the Race Course grounds under lights. On Sunday the Sri Lanka “A” team played this side and the match ended in a nil-all draw.In a good game of football, a big hand should go to the players and the national coach Nizam Packeer Ali for an excellent display of football. The visitors too addressed the match in the same manner. It was a thrilling encounter; both teams controlled the ball well with their feet.
The 200th ranked Sri Lanka side played a tireless game showing greater ball control. The 126th placed side Lithuania too gave a good display, but the Sri Lanka defence held them from scoring. It was an action packed game of football, where Sri Lanka football lovers enjoyed a game with a foreign team after many years.
It was nice to see former king maker of the game Manilal Fernando at this match with some past officials, after the final whistle he said Sri Lanka has speed, and the technique to take step high.
The co-ordination of the team he said was better than Lithuania
Soon after Sunday’s game in the early part of Monday, the Sri Lanka “A side left for Japan for training in preparation for the SAFF tournament.
They will be also visiting Korea.
For today’s game Sri Lanka will be fielding a talented side and they are guided by Thilak Alponso. The final side will be selected just before the start. Sri Lanka “B” side should do well, for that they will have to play as a team.
The visiting Lithuania side are favorites to win. They played good football last Sunday and they will be playing their full side. Their players will go all out to deliver a morale-boosting performance.
