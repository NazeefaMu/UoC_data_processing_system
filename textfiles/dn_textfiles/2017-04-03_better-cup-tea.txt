For a better cup of tea

Sri Lanka’s tea industry has been facing immense hardships in recent times, declining in exports, revenue, and production, while operational and labour costs increased. Tea growers in the country faced unprecedented challenges, particularly in the last two years due to extreme weather patterns, weak demand in the tea drinking world, especially the Middle East, Russia, and Ukraine, and tea landscape degradation.
Tea exports are one of the main sources of foreign exchange to the country, and according to available statistics, this amount stood at about USD 1.6 billion in 2014. The annual output usually totalled around 330 million kilograms, but dropped to around 292 million kilograms last year.
Tea plantations and estates provide employment to about one million people directly and indirectly, while the total number of dependents amounts to about 2.5 million. This is to say one in eight people in the country are dependent on this commercial crop.
Drop in production
The tea industry, which was introduced to the country during colonial times, has a history of over a century. Since colonial times, ‘Ceylon Tea’ has made a name for itself as the finest and cleanest tea, securing the highest unit price at tea auctions and also making the country the third largest tea exporter in the world after Kenya and China.
The drop in production over the years however, has been a worrying factor to those involved in the tea business. It is widely believed that long term application of chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and weedicides to enhance commercial production of tea has resulted in poor soil fertility and land degradation in tea estates.
Added to these, the prolonged dry spell has also contributed to the backward trend in crop yield. Less tea leaves also mean less income for tea pluckers as they cannot match the given target.
Making tea-producing landscapes socially and environmentally sustainable without compromising on the commercial output is a contemporary challenge before the tea sector. Various novel methods have been experimented to achieve this end, while some of them have shown good results with improvements made over time with extensive research.
Arresting land degradation
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has come forward to mainstream sustainable management of tea production landscapes in a project earmarked in selected locations in India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and China, with an overall budget of USD 2.1 million. Under the project, sustainable land management practices, have been introduced with the aim to mitigate and reverse land degradation.
It is being carried out in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Rain Forest Alliance.
The project launched in October, 2014, continues till April, 2018. It promotes eco-friendly weed management practices while doing away with herbicides and pesticides.
The use of chemical fertilizer is also curtailed over time and gradually stopped.
Alliance for Sustainable Landscapes Management Director Giri Kadurugamuwa explaining as to how this weed management system works, said what they do is to remove only the noxious weeds, while allowing natural vegetation to grow only to slash it periodically. Though this appears to be simple, this system requires more labour input at its initial stage—to identify and remove noxious weeds manually as against chemical weed management.
Yet in the long run, it has proven to be more cost-effective and helpful in reversing land degradation. As it allows beneficial weeds to remain and spread, it contributes positively to the health of the soil and largely contains soil erosion—a common problem found in tea estates in the country.
Tea smallholders in the vanguard
This methodology has been promoted among tea smallholders in the country with the help of the Tea Smallholdings Development Authority. Seventy two percent of the total tea production is coming from smallholder farmers numbering to about 400,000, while they hold about 59 percent of the total extent of tea cultivations. According to Kadurugamuwa, 11,000 tea smallholder farmers have already been familiarized with this methodology over the past two years.
Saman Udaya Kumara, a tea smallholder who had adopted herbicide-free integrated weed management practices in his 17 hectare property in Itthegala, Henyayawatte in Udahaupe, Kahawatte, said it helped him raise his income by 60 percent.
“The expenditure for cultivations drastically came down as I could save the money spent for herbicides and chemical fertilizer. I commenced reducing herbicides from June, 2014, following the training I received, and stopped herbicide usage by end of 2015. I used to apply about 15,000 kg of Urea fertilizer back in 2013, but reduced it to 4,400 kg in 2016,” Kumara said.
Corporate lobbying
Mahendra Peiris, former Superintendent of the Hapugastenne Estate belonging to the Maskeliya Plantation PLC, had been doing extensive research on these eco-friendly weed management practices and has achieved successful results by applying them in the field. It has been found out in his research carried out jointly with Peradeniya University Crop Science Department Prof. S.P. Nissanka that 20 out of the 23 identified noxious tea weeds are tolerant to widely used herbicides, even including the recently banned glyphosate. Thereby, he pointed out that these acutely problematic weed species, which cause great damage to tea crops, cannot be controlled by them.
This finding is a blow to those lobbying to get the glyphosate ban relaxed when it comes to the tea industry. The ban on glyphosate, a widely used herbicide that is also believed to be a silent killer, has not been easy despite the commitment coming from the topmost political authority in the country.
The ban which initially came into force in March, 2014, lasted barely two months, but it was re-imposed in May, 2015. Those who are lobbying against the ban have been arguing that the blanket ban on glyphosate-based weedicides was a factor that contributed to the slow and steady collapse in the tea sector. Reportedly, glyphosate has a black market since the ban came into force.
UNEP GEF Task Manager Max Zieren, who recently visited Sri Lanka, said their project would naturally not go down well with the agro-chemical companies as it is unfavourable to their business. He also cautioned that some of the chemicals he encountered during his field visits to tea estates were already banned in other countries. Commending the ban on glyphosate, he said, was a bold decision to make and called on the politicians not to roll back the policy.
“The political authority in the recent times blocked a number of very dangerous chemicals, but last year, there has been very strong lobby by the chemical industry to influence Parliamentarians to remove that Government regulation. The politicians must be wise and responsible enough to ignore these lobbies by the chemical industry,” he said.
