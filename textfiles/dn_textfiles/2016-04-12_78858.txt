Q: Music Advice:
A: Musically nowadays bands and artists are really good and they use all latest technology and come out with good compositions. But the Local market is such where they have become greedy for money and charge cash to play an artist’s song on their channel. Whereas on the other side of the world its totally the opposite. Not all do it but certain channels in this country do it. By this, the local talent is not been shown or promoted to the country.
