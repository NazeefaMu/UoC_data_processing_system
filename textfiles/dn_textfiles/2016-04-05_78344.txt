MR yearns for reconciliation within SLFP

 
Priority should be given to achieve reconciliation within the SLFP before trying to achieve it in the country, former President and Kurunegala district Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was addressing the gathering after participating in an Asheervada pooja at the Sri Sambuddha Themagul Viharaya in Tract 4, Maha Vilachchiya on Sunday.
Rajapaksa who referred to the recent finding of a terrorist suicide kit and cache of arms in the North, stressed that they had called upon the government to give priority to national security from the very beginning.
He said although terrorism had been wiped out in the country, the entire outside world was engulfed by terrorism today.
The fact that a few LTTE terrorists had taken refuge abroad was an open secret, Rajapaksa said. He said although reconciliation was an urgent need, he was of the view that reconciliation did not mean dancing to the tune of terrorists.
Rajapaksa said as members of the Opposition, they too considered reconciliation as a good thing.
"But before everything, reconciliation should be first be achieved within the SLFP. The way SLFP organisers were dismissed and shuffled we have suspicion whether reconciliation could be achieved with the SLFP," he said. He said the previous government led by him did much to achieve peace and reconciliation after the war victory by building houses for the displaced, roads and other infrastructure in the North and East to promote peace and reconciliation.
Rajapaksa said it was due to their services that the people in the South and North were able to move about freely in any part of the country.
