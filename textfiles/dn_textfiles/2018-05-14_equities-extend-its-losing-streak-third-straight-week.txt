Point of view 
Equity markets extended its losing streak for the 3rd consecutive week, hitting a one-month low on Friday as the CBSL’s expectations of a modest recovery in 2018 and decision to hold policy rates steady failed to conciliate markets.
The benchmark ASPI fell 28 points over the week to slip below the key 6500-mark around which it has hovered around for the last 3-weeks.
Despite the dull sentiment which has kept retail investors largely on the sidelines, local HNI and institutional investors made a comeback this week, helping prop weekly average turnover levels. HNI and Institutional investors who remained largely away from the market over the last week of April and 1st week of May, accounted for 40% of this week’s market turnover (cf. average of 24% in the prior two weeks) as large transactions in 3-stocks (JKH-35% of week’s crossings; Melstacorp-25% of week’s crossings and UAL- 23% of week’s crossings) drove investor activity.
Weekly average turnover levels consequently rose to a 5-week high of Rs.0.80Bn, helping push up the YTD weekly average turnover levels to Rs. 1.03Bn.
Foreign investor’s meanwhile continued to slow its pace of buying domestic equities, reflecting the broader global theme of declining foreign inflows to EM/FM markets over April amid rising US yields, a stronger dollar, increasing crude oil prices, and doubts over the continuation of synchronized global growth.
Despite foreign inflows to the CSE ending on a positive note this week, the net position on the Colombo bourse declined 32% W-o-W.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from corporate earnings from the Mar’18 quarter which have begun to trickle in.

CBSL keeps policy rates unchanged
The CBSL held policy rates steady at its 3rd monetary policy review for the year (SDFR-7.2%; SLFR-8.50%), adding that more time is needed to assess the market and economic impact of its Apr’18 policy rate reduction of 25bps.
The Monetary Authority noted that while overnight rates responded to the Apr’18 policy rate adjustment to decline (and then stabilize) around the midpoint of the narrower policy rate corridor, other market rates are (particularly rates on lending ) are expected to also adjust downwards in line with the decline in short term interest rates.
The CBSL added meanwhile, that despite high seasonal credit demand during Mar’18, private sector credit remains at envisaged levels. The Bank also highlighted that headline inflation continued to decelerate as food price volatility has eased on the back of better domestic supply conditions, while core inflation continues to remain subdued indicating contained demand pressures.
The CBSL noted that although a temporary uptick in inflation is expected in the short term due to the impact of upward price revisions to domestic petroleum products, LP gas and milk powder, inflation is expected to stabilize at mid-single digits by H2’18 as the transitory impact of these supply –driven pressures ease and domestic food supplies improve further.
GDP growth meanwhile is expected to recover modestly in 2018 due to stronger global economic activity and improving domestic conditions.
The CBSL noted that while continued fiscal consolidation efforts may dampen growth prospects, the macroeconomic benefits from this fiscal discipline will be vital in ensuring sustained growth over the medium term.
