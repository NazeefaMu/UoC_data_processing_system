Engineering  in danger

Ignorance and personal wants of the lawmakers and facilitators are killing the foundry industry due to the export of the valuable scrap depriving the country and the local light Engineering industry, against the laws of the country and well-being of the industry. The inaction leads to corruption, loss of employment, closure of light engineering enterprises, loss of employment and loss of revenue in Billions if the formal and informal sectors.
Foundry and Forging Industry in Light engineering
The Sri Lankan formal Foundry and forging industry in the Light engineering sector is the mother of all industries. Without the Foundry industry, there will not be manufacturing in Sri Lanka. Foundry industry produces inputs to the local industries while bringing export income by exporting high value machinery and finished goods, such as Aluminium extrusions, steel reinforcement bars and structural products, Brass fittings, water pumps, water fittings, sewing machine parts, and tea, rubber, coconut, oil, coffee mills, cleaners, shredders and other processing machinery for agriculture. Facilitation of tea, rubber, coconut machinery, and irrigation and construction equipment is one of the major activities in the sector. In addition, the foundry industry produces many items to service industry for hydropower, coal power, cement, marine, industry and automobile industry. The industry employs around 40,000 persons directly and also train and employ over 2000 engineers and technical staff every year without any cost to the government. In value addition, foundries recycle metal scrap and add 100% to 1000% value to Iron steel, brass, copper and Aluminium scrap metals to produce thousands of different castings and other products.
Today industry is deprived of the raw material they used for ages. The industry is losing competitive advantage besides the technology and investments and struggle to survive while six industries closed due to want of scrap cast iron last month. The turnover of these industries over 30 Billion rupees with the machinery they produce and is required for the well-being of the fellow citizens and industries.
The informal foundry industry is spread throughout the country and running to over 2,000 small units. These are located in Pilimatalawa producing religious items such as Bronze statues, Caskets (Koth), ornamental oil lamps, vases and other castings, required by temples and churches and wanted in the Sri Lankan culture. In Kiribathgoda construction industry castings hinges, stays, casements, brass screws, decorative valance boards items produced in large scale. The areas of Kaduwela, Gampaha, Panadura and Ja Ela also produce a large number of aluminium castings in addition to pots and pans for the rural industry along with many machine parts.
Today less than 10 individuals are illegally exporting the metal scrap used by the industry putting the entire light engineering sector in danger. The small entrepreneurship 100 to 200 in Kalutara, Gampaha, Kandy, Matara, Badulla and Kilinochchi districts employing over 20,000 people producing nails for cooking utensils are unable to obtain their scrap. Eighty medium scale industries producing parts and many types of machinery, Brass, Aluminium fittings, electric wire and accessories for domestic and export market and employ over another 20,000 persons. Both these industry categories are now in danger due to inaction, bureaucracy, and poor industrial knowledge of decision makers and politicisation of processes.
Many gazettes have been issued since 1993 to stop the export of scrap. The country’s law gazetted now very clearly ban the export of scrap and low value-added items such as bars and rods ingots by the Gazette of November 9, 2009. This, followed by a Cabinet paper, gives the secretary of the ministry of industries clear guidelines, how to issue licence part 1 of schedule 111 of this Gazette.
Licencing authorities
The authorities now give licence to export almost all scrap and over 1,000 tons exported every month otherwise used by the industry. False reasoning and personal interests are the main causes. The technical committee appointed without any industry knowledge, experience and facilities for inspection and without an official fee, give recommendations for arbitrary and false reasons.
A clear example is authorities stating cast-iron cannot be smelted in the foundry industry and issuing 10,000 tons for export is one instance. In another instance, a copper rod is defined as a tube. This is done against the University and FDSI recommendations of the industry and denying the brass and bronze scrap to the industry. Another example is industry, agree for large pieces exceeding 2 tons not used in the industry to be given licence for export but authorities allow exporting all material under the said HS code of Cast Iron used by the industry. This has led to a situation where six exporters obstruct the entire metal sector industry with their financial power and political power, more so they export valuable raw material at one-third the market price depriving the local industry. Cast iron Market price 42 export price 17.
India is the biggest market for this metal scrap, producing higher value-added automobile parts, which Sri Lankan industry is trying to enter.
The industry has made many representations to the authorities and authorities issuing licences keep pointing fingers to different institutions.
The customs department said that they have no facilities to check the materials licensed to be the same as for the invoice and documents. Recommending authorities for scrap say that they have been only asked whether sample materials submitted can be used in Sri Lanka by the foundries no qualitative or quantitative inspection of sample check is done. There is neither value addition formula nor a format to check the value addition and is done haphazardly for certain wire exports. The authenticity of official documents submitted for shipments and price of exports is not checked.
The exporters use over a year old export licence to get past the customs while the validity is only for three months. FDSI has adequate documents to prove that the ban on export is been used as an eyewash in public.
These official actions are not accountable and the country loses billions of rupees due to substitution, undervaluing and making the established light engineering sector in danger. Licencing scheme also stopped many export orders of genuine local manufacturing industry due to reasons known only to licencing authorities.
