A LITTLE BIT OF HOME AND LUXURY : JETWING VILLAS

Now you can experience the warmth and comfort in solitude at Jetwing villas; boutique properties tucked away from the usual holiday rush, where guests can bask in the beauty of the location while indulging in the comforts that the family has perfected over the years.
"As the monsoon leaves the West and South toward the tail-end of the year, what better than to plan your next getaway - be it a quick weekend break from the city stress or a weeklong retreat into relaxation - to one of Jetwing's individualised villa properties along the coast? The deliberately limited number of rooms at each of these properties offers a more private experience with dining options that are tailor-made to the guests' needs." States Jetwing hotels in a press release.
Yathra by Jetwing is the first houseboat property and sails its passengers along the serene Bentara River. Jetwing's Saffron and Blue is named for the fine sand and clear seas of its Kosgoda setting. With only four rooms - all luxurious and comfortable suites - and plenty of wide open spaces, the villa is ideal for solitude and easy-going holidays.
One of the best-loved destinations in Sri Lanka, three of Jetwing's villa properties are situated in the iconic city of Galle. The Galle Heritage Villa by Jetwing is within the walls of the Dutch Fort itself, along cobblestone streets and the fading yet elegant facades of the fort's houses, a celebration of Dutch architecture. This is a family home that has stood within the Fort for generations and has now been restored to offer guests the best blend of classical aesthetics and modern comforts.
Ten minutes up the coast, inland from the world-renowned Jetwing Lighthouse, Jetwing Kurulubedda has captured the essence of an 'escape' both in its location and design.
Twenty minutes down the coast from the Fort is Era Beach by Jetwing, a boutique villa property in Talpe that turns the dream of a luxurious escape into reality.
