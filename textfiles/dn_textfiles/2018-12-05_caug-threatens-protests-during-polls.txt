CAUG threatens protests during polls

Convenor of the Combine Association of Unemployed Graduates (CAUG) Ven. Thanne Gnanananda Thera said members of their association are keen on violating the election rules again if the government fails to address their issues.
Ven. Gnanananda Thera was speaking at a media conference yesterday in Colombo.
The Thera added that the government should take prompt action to end the unemployment of graduates.
According to the CAUG, there are around 80,000 vacancies available in the state service which can be filled with graduates.
The government should fill these vacancies with the unemployed graduates.
“If the government fails to settle our issue, we are eagerly looking forward to breaking the election laws once again as we did during the last election.
We will engage in protests violating election laws, if an election is called,” he said.
Speaking on the CAUG protest held on Monday in Colombo, the Thera said police attacked them when they were going to the Presidential Secretariat to hand over a letter to the President.
“We have sent 10 letters to the President requesting a discussion with him.
But until today we haven’t received a favourable response. However, we have come to know that new employees have been recruited to several ministries recently,” he said.
They are ready to discuss long-term and short-term remedies to end the unemployment of graduates with the President, the Thera said.
The CAUG will launch a countrywide protest campaign soon urging the government to recruit unemployed graduates to the state service , he said.
Achintha Divanjana of the CAUG said teargas, baton charges or water cannons cannot stop their struggle.
