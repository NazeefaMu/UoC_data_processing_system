Apple MacBooks and iMacs from Abans

The Mac vs PC debate has been raging ever since both types of computers hit the market in the early 1990’s.
Abans has the following reasons why switching to a Mac will give you better bang for your buck than a PC.
The only characteristic that sets PC’s apart from Apple Macs is their universal usage of Microsoft Windows. This, however, means that the quality of the hardware used in each PC can vary based on the manufacturer’s preference, which often results in lower-quality, more fragile components. In stark comparison, Apple has designed Macs to function as single cohesive units by incorporating superior software and parts. Since all segments are solely developed by Apple, Macs tend to be more durable and less prone to breakdown.
PC’s have long been reputed for their easy customizability. Yet, users usually have to install several required apps and software programmes manually, which can be a tedious process. On the other hand, Apple Macs are equipped with a set of useful built-in apps, including Mail, Safari, Pages, iTunes and more, that automatically appear on your Home Screen. Plus, the latest editions of Apple MacBooks come with Touch ID, a revolutionary feature that enables you to set system controls; answer iPhone or FaceTime calls; conduct fast logins; purchase apps from the App Store; and enact function key capabilities, without having to move the cursor across the screen.
With the introduction of Continuity in OS X Yosemite, Apple has further strengthened the ties between Macs and iOS devices, something that has carried through to OS X El Capitan. Thanks to the innovative Hand-off feature, you can start an email, note or document on your iPhone/iPad, and continue the same task on your Mac without syncing or saving anything to a cloud drive such as OneDrive or Google Drive. Also applying to web searches, reminders, map searches and calendar adjustments, this seamless integration means that all your devices work in perfect cohesion to help you complete your tasks without experiencing stress or frustration.
Coupled with weak anti-virus controls, PC’s are also susceptible to the proliferation of malware which can slow downoperating systems. Unlike PC’s, Macs are already outfitted with standard safety features that constantly monitor, encrypt, and update the device’s macOS to guard against malicious software.
Apple is the best for you, visit your nearest Abans-Apple iStore, Apple authorized dealer or Abans Elite Showroom and select from the latest lineup of Apple MacBooks and iMacs.
