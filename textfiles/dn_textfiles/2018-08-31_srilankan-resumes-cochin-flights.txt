SriLankan resumes Cochin flights

SriLankan Airlines resumed services to Cochin yesterday. Flights were suspended since August 15, due to the devastating floods in Kerala.
The Cochin International Airport closed from August 15 and reopened on August 29, with the first flights being domestic services, followed shortly by international carriers.
SriLankan’s first flight following the resumption departed Colombo at 07.47 am yesterday.
