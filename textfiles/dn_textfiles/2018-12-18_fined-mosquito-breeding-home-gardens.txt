Fined for mosquito-breeding home gardens

Twelve suspects in the Tangalle MOH division who were found guilty of maintaining dengue-mosquito breeding sites at their home gardens were fined Rs. 1500 by the Tangalle Magistrate and Additional District Judge.
The Magistrate issued warrants against two suspects who were not present before the Court on that day. Public Health Inspectors of Tangalle and Kudawella jointly conducted the raid.
