Visakhians flying high

What better way to end the Visakha Vidyalaya centenary year than to take to the skies? Visakhians have created history, not only for the school but for SriLankan Airlines by flying an all-Visakhian crew to Japan.
The national carrier – SriLankan Airlines, on December 2, added a new chapter to their history at 40,000ft to commemorate the glorious 100 years of excellence of Visakha Vidyalaya with a flight of Visakhians in the technical crew, cabin crew and an interpreter.
The pilot in command, Captain Chamika Rupasinghe and her crew headed by Senior Cabin Manager Ajantha Karunatilleke, in the SriLankan Airlines UL454 from Colombo (CMB) to Nartia (NRT) was a flight to remember.
“We planned this for the school’s centenary celebrations. This was possible because out of the two women pilots at SriLankan Airlines, I am the only Visakhian. And there is a lot of Visakhians in the crew. So we had a unique opportunity to have an all Visakhian crew,” said Captain Chamika Rupasinghe speaking to the Daily News.
Captain Rupasinghe had been serving at SriLankan Airlines for 12 years as a crew member and 6 years as a pilot. She says this experience to celebrate her school’s centenary in the sky was truly memorable.
“It was a great experience to see the entire crew from my school. The faces are familiar from school days. Some are senior to me and some junior. And sharing this experience with them was truly amazing,” she said.
Captain Rupasinghe added that another similar flight is planned for January as well.
The alma mater camaraderie in the air included the Captain, Cabin Supervisor/Japanese Interpreter Deepthi Peiris, Cabin Supervisor Rashini Rajawasam, Cabin Supervisor Ayomi Indiketiyahewage, Flight Attendants Duresha Kariyawasam, Serangi Jayaratne, Charitha Paranamanne, Umangi Singhabahu, Chithmi Ranawaka, Nishani Dassanayake and Denushka Weeraperuma.
“We are proud to be Visakhians. We are also proud to be a part of the nation's flag Carrier and finally we take pride in being Sri Lankan women,” the crew stated.
Indeed, the flight was a fitting tribute to their alma mater for producing such ‘high flying’ women to mother Lanka.
