Over 40,000 SDOs to get job permanency

Over 40,000 Samurdhi Development Officers (SDO) who had served for many years will be given permanent appointments by Housing and Social Welfare Minister Wimal Weerawansa.
The Minister was participating in a conference at the Ministry auditorium attended by ministry officials and Samurdhi Movement trade union officials recently.
The trade union officials who attended the meeting had to stage strikes and protest campaigns in the past demanding job permanency. They said that certain higher officials had given a deaf year to their appeals ignoring their just cause.
The Minister, who gave a patient hearing to the matter, said he will grant job permanency to over 14000 Samurdhi Development Officers and directed officials to grant the appointment letters in a week.
Since appointments of Samurdhi Managers is handled by the Public Service Commission (PSC), the Minister advised officials to make arrangements in consultation with the PSC to grant the appointments.
The Minister also directed officials to ensure that some justice was done to the families of emplooyees in these posts who had died without job permanency.
