Sampath Bank voted ‘Best Retail Bank’ and ‘Best Commercial Bank’ again at World Finance Banking Awards

Sampath Bank was recognized as Sri Lanka’s ‘Best Retail Bank’ and ‘Best Commercial Bank’for the 5th consecutive year at the prestigious World Finance Banking Awards awarded by UK based World Finance magazine.
Continuing to win accolades both within the island and around the world, the Bank has reigned supreme at this forum, bringing home the two awards, consistently, ever since 2014.
Being the only Sri Lankan bank to have been recognized at this year’s event, the awards are a reflection of the strong growth in Sampath Bank’s overall profitability, its healthy liquidity levels, higher earnings per share, dividends and returns to shareholders in general and the consistent growth in its market share in both asset and liability class products and services.
The World Finance magazine statesthat the 2018 edition of the awards “have sought to identify the banks that have successfully held their nerve during a period of uncertainty and are now preparing tools to last them for the foreseeable future and beyond.”
“Standingalongside some of the world’s best banking and financial service providers, we are honoured to have been recognized at the World Finance Banking Awards for the fifth consecutive year,” said Nanda Fernando, Managing Director, Sampath Bank PLC.
“The awards are a testament to our overall performance, financial ratios, the variety and clarity of our products and services, alternative financial product offerings, corporate governance, parallel market interaction and competitive strategy.”
The World Finance Banking Awards are one of the most respected accolades in the banking and financial services sector, globally.
The honours received at the World Finance Banking Awards join the multitude of recognitions that have been bestowed on Sampath Bank in 2018.
Earlier this year, the Bank was included to the MSCI Frontier Market 100 Index, becoming the only Sri Lankan company in the Index with a weightage of 0.36%.
