Colombo will be cleanest city within next five years: Champika

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka vowed to transform Colombo into the cleanest city with no flooding within the next five years.
Participating in the commencement of construction of the Sebastian Northern Canal rain water pumping station and annicut yesterday, he said the Colombo city would submerge with drainage and rain water. He said people have made the Kelaniya River their toilet instead of using it for economic progress.
The Minister said that in the past much was spoken about beautifying Colombo and the managing garbage, planting trees and flowers. “We take great pains to keep our homes clean and beautiful.
“Yet, most of us pay less attention to keep our toilets and kitchens clean. We do the same for the the Colombo city. No matter how many beautiful buildings are built, Colombo’s toilets and kitchens are still pathetic,” he said.
The Minister noted that a major issue is floods. Even developed cities in Europe face the same issue. He said the main reason for flooding is the obstruction of canals and water drainage being hampered due to haphazard building constructions and man-made problems. In addition, other environmental factors are there beyond our control. He said Colombo’s underground pipeline network is around 150 years old and so is the drainage system,
"If these were not secured, we would have to face a major catastrophe. Our pipeline network is around 960 km. Of the water that enters this network, around 40 percent is wasted due to dilapidated condition of the pipelines. The lack of maintenance and improper management have made the drainage and rain water lines identical. This has put the Beira Lake area in jeopardy.
"If we are to maintain the drainage system properly, we must launch a systematic drainage system and find a proper way to discharge the rain water. Simply growing trees and beautifying the city will not suffice,” Minister Ranawaka said.
