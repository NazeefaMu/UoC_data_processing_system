Flower and plant exhibition in Katunayake

The annual flower and plants exhibition organized by Suwahas Flower Society in Katana and Negombo is now in progress at the Davindra Mendis grounds, Katunayake and will conclude tomorrow. The organizers hosts three events per year.
With the horticulture sector growing and with increasing number of housewives being engaged in the industry, this year the event has attracted a record 65 stalls.
With the rapid growth of tourism, a new market opened and this has resulted in more housewives engaging in the sector.
The event was also supported by the Gampaha Botanical Gardens and several seminars were also conducted by their officials.
