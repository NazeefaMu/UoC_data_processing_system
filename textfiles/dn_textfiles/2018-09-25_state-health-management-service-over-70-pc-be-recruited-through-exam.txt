State Health Management Service: Over 70 pc to be recruited through exam

Employees will be recruited to the State Health Management Service through a competitive examination by December, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Seventy percent or 886 persons will be recruited through a competitive examination, he said, adding that however, about 185 officials opposed to the recruitment.
According to Minister Senaratne, even graduates can apply for employment in lower grades in the Health Ministry. They will be appointed as nurses attached to state health institutions as they are graduates.
The minister was speaking after handing over appointment letters to 385 health management officers during a ceremony in Colombo, recently.
Minister Senaratne said duties can be carried out more effectively and productively when recruiting health staffers to lower grades as they would have a sound knowledge on the health service from the beginning. Accordingly, health staffers were recruited for lower grades through an examination.
