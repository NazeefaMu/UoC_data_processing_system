Citizens' Mail

Stop killer drivers!
Once again, we have seen the carnage and loss of innocent lives due to reckless driving by an irresponsible driver on a long distance bus. The Madurankuliya accident must never happen again, and seeing the footage in the electronic media one can imagine the horror experience and shock of the unsuspecting passengers. The bus was virtually decapitated into two.
It is sad that despite the prevalent motor traffic laws, the authorities are unable to prevent such accidents happening. One can only fear that accidents of this nature will only increase due to the development of express ways and better and wider roads between major towns in the country. The recent increase in fines for traffic violations is totally inadequate and will not serve as any form of deterrent. In my opinion, the punishments must go to the extent of life-bans from driving, cancellation of driving licenses for a longer period of time and convicting offenders on man-slaughter charges with long prison sentences, as in this instance when the driver was reckless and completely at fault for trying to overtake another vehicle when approaching a culvert. Authorities must increase highway patrolling and speed checking at regular intervals on all highways and main roads and consistently apply the laws if we are to eradicate this scourge.
Recently, I was on a company outing to Jaffna for which we happened to hire two super luxury buses which were regular Jaffna/Colombo route buses. On our return journey the driver of the bus I was in, failed to stop when the traffic police patrol flagged the bus down for overtaking on a bend at high speed, on the Aunradhapura - Puttalam main road.
The Police Patrol gave chase for more than 10 km and stopped the bus, severely reprimanding the driver, who had already being copped for several previous offences and was carrying only a temporary driving license at the time.
A majority of long distance drivers are known to be such reckless maniacs, and must be stopped at all costs, if we are to prevent such tragedies and loss of innocent lives.
The IGP, Ministers of Law and Order, Highways and Transport act fast and make road safety a priority!
