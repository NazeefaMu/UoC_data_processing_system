Indian military expert praises Lankan Army

Military, first responder to national disasters - Veteran Journalist National Security Analyst, Author and Media Entrepreneur in India Nitin A. Gokhale commended the roles of the military in the region, including the Sri Lanka Army for rising to the occasion as first responders to any national disaster or natural catastrophe and taking the lead in extending assistance to the affected and victims.
He was speaking at the Session 3 (final session of the day) of the 8th Colombo Defence Seminar-2018 at the BMICH on the theme ‘Human Induced Climate Change’.
Session 3 was chaired by one of the most celebrated Chiefs of Indian Army Staff and Chairman Chiefs of Staff India, General Bikram Singh (Retd) who arrived here at the invitation of the Commander of the Army.
He said that he, as an author and a veteran journalist while living in the north east of India, collected those experiences.
South and South-East Asia are prone to massive natural disasters and inadequate training given to civilian agencies has always been of little use.
“Military is the first responder in most cases in 2017 and even a few months ago in Sri Lanka. From China to Cambodia and India to Indonesia, the military has regularly come to the rescue. They perform their military tasks across the region since the military is well-located, better-trained, and enjoy the spirits of cohesive and disciplined nature.
They organise shelters, food and medicine after rescuing people from difficult situations; from restoring roads and bridges to restarting electric and water supplies.
“Climate change is here to stay and is getting worse.
“The more industrialized we get,there are more chances of technological disruptions. Militaries perhaps need specialised cadre for such work. Templates need to be put in place for better coordination and quicker responses.”
Stressing the need to work with better coordination and planning with other agencies, armed forces always earmark a portion of resources for them and do proper planning although others do not.
