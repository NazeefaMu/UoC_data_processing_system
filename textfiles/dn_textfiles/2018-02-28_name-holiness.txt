In the name  of holiness

Maha Shivaratri also known as the ‘Great Night of Shiva’ is a spiritual festival held to honour the God Shiva where Hindu devotees are mindful of overcoming darkness and ignorance. Dr Lakshmi Ramaswamy held a performance at the Kaileshwar temple in Colombo on Maha Shivaratri called Aindhaan Potri when she visited Sri Lanka recently.
She did a performance in connection with the Natyanjali. Natyanjali is a performance done in Shiva temples during the Shivaratri time.
Aindhaan Potri is based on the story of 4 Saiva Saint Poets called as Nayanmars namely, Gnana Sambandar, Tirunavukkarasar, Sundarar and Manikkavacakar and one Sekhizar who is considered to have chronicled the inspiring stories of the Nayanmars and who penned the ‘Peria-puranam’.
“I am going to present fives dances. Each of the Saints had an incident in their lives from which onwards they got into the fold of Shiva. We have added that incident and whatever miracles they have done during their lifetime in the name of Shiva. This is the 22nd production we have done. My dance institution which is Sri Mudhraalaya is 24 years old now. Next year will be our Silver Jubilee,” said Ramaswamy.
Lakshmi Ramaswamy is a dancer, choreographer and researcher who hails from Tirunelveli.
She is the first doctorate in Bharatanatyam from Madras University. She is also a recipient of the Fulbright fellowship for Arts and Culture Management studies. Ramaswamy has trained under Chitra Visweswaran, Dr Padma Subrahmanyam and Kalanidhi Narayan.
She is also a top grade artist of the Doordharshan and teaches MA in Bharatanatyam at the Madras University.
“I have trained my students in Arangetram and now many of them have become teachers themselves. Many of them are MA holders and Dhoordharshan acknowledged graded artists. Some of them are also doing their PhD,” stated Ramaswamy.
Ramaswamy receives a tremendous amount of happiness when creating new performances.
“If a mother gives birth to a child, that happiness is similar to what I have when creating new performances. I feel humbled to stage it in front of people. One thing about the classical arts is that it gives happiness. It has a takeaway value, and after anyone watches my productions, there is something to take out of it. It pleases the mind. In my performance, we explore the lives of these saints – how much they have done for religion and society,” pointed out Ramaswamy.
To Ramaswamy, the production is deeply meaningful. She also has added Thevaram songs.
“This performance is mostly on the devotional side, as it is dedicated to Lord Shiva. It also addresses society as we are social beings. The message in this production is commitment. Commitment is the basis of our lives. We live in a world with so many troubles, but if you are committed you will get your reward. The performance is also religiously oriented. It has been a lot of hard work,” explained Ramaswamy.
Sri Mudhraalaya has performed in UK, Bangkok, USA and London but this is the first time they are premiering a performance outside of Chennai.
“I am a first generation dancer and my performances have been very well received and critically acclaimed by scholars and people. People who did not appreciate Bharatanatyam have remarked how beautiful it is after watching my performances. Expressing emotions and feelings and portraying characters and stories is my speciality. We just want to go from strength to strength creating productions of high quality. We want to touch on good values and ethics. We want to create nice memories for people when they go home. To be a performer one has to work hard. Dance is spiritual to me because it is mind, intelligence and emotion,” added Ramaswamy.
