Revive the rural economy to increase government revenue:PM

The need to revive the rural economy as a possible measure to increase government revenue in the face of mounting debt, was stressed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday as he declared opened the new premises for the Ministry of Rural Economic Affairs at 492, R. A. de Mel Mawatha.
The Prime Minister observed that over the last few decades, the rural economy had simply consisted of the unemployed moving to an urban centre or to the “Middle Eastern, Italian or Singaporean economy. “This is all affecting the economy of the village. How do we create development within the rural economy?” he asked.
Wickremesinghe requested the ministry to focus on improving and modernising two or three sectors such as dairy and poultry to be able to generate greater employment and establish industries within the village itself.
The dairy sector should be able to provide fresh milk to all school children, said the PM as he noted that the poultry industry needed to be transformed into an export oriented industry. “The biggest issue with poultry is the cost of raw materials. We have to see whether we need to increase local raw material production or import them to help bring down the cost of production of poultry,” said Wickremesinghe.
Economic development both rural and urban have become a dire necessity of the government as the Prime Minister pointed out that they had to find ways to pay off foreign debt amounting to Rs. 4,820 billion in the next 10 years. This is apart from the local debt burden of the government, he said. “We need to look at alternative incomes, jobs and try to reduce imports,” he said.
Despite such a need however, the Prime Minister observed that Sri Lanka’s situation remained unchanged over time. “We have not progressed despite the end of the war and the main reason for this is the lack of national unity. We are working on it now,” he said as he brought up the example of Tamil citizens now being allowed to sing the national anthem in Tamil.
