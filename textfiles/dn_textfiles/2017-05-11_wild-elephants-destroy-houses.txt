Wild elephants destroy houses

A number of houses were damaged when a herd of wild elephants attacked Katuwanayaya and Edisonkanda in the Nugegalayaya Grama Niladhari Division yesterday. Residents said, the wild elephant attack took place around 4 am.
No effective measures have been taken so far by the higher-ups regarding the human-elephant conflict, they added.
