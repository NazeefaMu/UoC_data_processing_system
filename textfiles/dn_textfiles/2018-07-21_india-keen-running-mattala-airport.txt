Lanka awaits experts’ report for joint venture
India keen on running Mattala airport

The Sri Lankan government is awaiting a report from experts to finalise its joint venture with India, to run the loss-making Mattala airport in the island’s Southern Province, The Hindu reported yesterday.
Once the report is out, the proposal will be taken to the Cabinet for clearance, a top official in the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation told The Hindu .
According to the proposed joint venture between the Airports Authority of India and the Airport and Aviation Services in Sri Lanka, India will own a 70 percent stake and pump in $225 million to revamp and run the airport, while the Sri Lankan side will invest the rest. As per the draft agreement, fine-tuned over three formal rounds of negotiations in Colombo, India will operate the airport on a 40-year lease.
“We need to revive this dying airport, which caused a massive loss of rupees 20 billion,” Minister of Civil Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva told Parliament recently.
Getting here was not easy for either side, particularly with opposition forces, aligned to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, staunchly opposing the deal that they claim amounts to the “sale of national assets” to foreigners.
Ever since Mr. Rajapaksa built the airport in 2013, at an initial cost of about $200 million, the facility has been incurring huge losses and has made international headlines as the “world’s emptiest airport”. In June, Dubai’s Flydubai became the last airline to pull out of Mattala, Sri Lanka’s second international airport.
“The Mattala joint venture will explore options like setting up a flying school, running a training academy, and re-routing air traffic, because the aim is to somehow make the facility commercially viable,” the top official said. However, those at the negotiating table know that it is no easy task.
With a current operational cost of LKR 250 million (roughly $1.56 million) per month, without a single flight, the airport offers little commercial logic. All the same, its proximity to Hambantota, less than 30 km away, where China holds a 70 percent stake in the massive port it helped build, appears to be reason enough from India’s strategic standpoint. - The Hindu
