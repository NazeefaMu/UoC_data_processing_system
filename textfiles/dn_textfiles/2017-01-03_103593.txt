New lottery agents  will be appointed if  protests continue: Ravi

 
Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake yesterday warned lottery agents that if they continue to stay away from sales, new agents will be appointed in their place.
The lottery agents have boycotted sales during the last two days to protest the government’s decision to increase the price of a lottery ticket by Rs.10.
Speaking to the media in Colombo, Karunanayake said lottery agents’ protests against the government’s decision was unacceptable.
The minister said the increase is to provide more winning opportunities for the public.
The minister also said the agents were being paid an adequate commission with other benefits.
He warned that the government will be compelled to appoint new agents if the lottery agents continue to stay away from sales.
