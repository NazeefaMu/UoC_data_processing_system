In football-mad Haiti, World Cup offers relief from daily grind

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Saturday: Whether they are fans of Argentina’s Lionel Messi or devotees of Brazil’s “Selecao,” Haitians struck by football fever have brought life on their Caribbean island to a standstill, as the World Cup offers a month-long respite from daily hardships.
The poverty-stricken country’s team languishes in 104th place in the FIFA rankings and did not qualify for the finals in Russia, but that hasn’t prevented fans from cheering for their Latin American neighbors to the south.
Only a few cars could be seen early Saturday in downtown Port-au-Prince’s normally congested streets. But on one sidewalk, dozens of people all hurried in the same direction: towards a small TV set inside a barber shop.
“See how empty the streets are -- everyone’s in front of the screen watching the match!” Joe Saintilus said from the shop’s doorstep.
Authorities have installed several giant screens on major public squares throughout the capital to facilitate World Cup watching.
NO ELECTRICITY, NO PROBLEM
According to the World Bank, a full two-thirds of Haiti’s nearly 11 million people have no access to electricity, but the director general of the country’s power authority promised early June to step up production to coincide with the sporting event.
The country is still recovering from Hurricane Matthew, which struck in 2016 -- six years after a massive earthquake killed more than 200,000 people. Football, however, offers a form of temporary relief, and World Cup fever is evident.
