Colombo, second most expensive city in South Asia

 
Research from the Economist Intelligence Unit indicates that Colombo is the second most expensive city in South Asia, and 108th most expensive in the world.
A total of eight South Asian cities, including New Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karachi and Bangalore, were included in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s survey.
Results showed Dhaka was the most expensive city in South Asia, followed by Colombo and Kathmandu.
The survey compares over 400 individual prices across 160 goods and services in 133 cities around the world.
The goods and services include food, drink, clothing, household supplies and personal care items, home rents, transport, utility bills, private schools, domestic help and recreational costs.
While Asia is home to some of the cheapest cities, it also hosts some of the world’s most expensive - Singapore, for instance, is the most expensive city in the world, followed by Hong Kong.
Asia now accounts for half of the 10 most expensive cities, including Tokyo, Osaka and Seoul, the Kathmandu Post reported.
