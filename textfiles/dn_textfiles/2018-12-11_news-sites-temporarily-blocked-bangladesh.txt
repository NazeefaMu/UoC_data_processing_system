News sites temporarily blocked in Bangladesh

Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has reopened 58 news portals hours after access to them were restricted by the regulator on "national security" grounds on Monday.The BTRC official told the Dhaka Tribune that they blocked the news portals after the authorities concerned asked them to do so for the sake of ‘national security’. The regulator, however, did not elaborate the reasons.The regulatory body on Sunday sent letters to international internet gateway operators and internet service providers to restrict access to the news sites.However, a number of these 58 news sites were still found operating hours after the order was issued.“We gave the order based on recommendations from the government and law enforcement agencies,” BTRC Senior Assistant Director Zakir told UNB on Monday. - Dhaka Tribune
