Tiniest inhabited island

Earth’s tiniest inhabited island is known as Just Enough Room Island for a reason - it’s barely the size of a tennis court.
Despite measuring in at a minuscule 3,300 square feet, the mini-rock has enough room for a cramped cottage, a tree and a pair of deck chairs.
Once known as Hub Island, the land - marooned off Alexandria Bay in New York state - was purchased in 1950 by the wealthy Sizelands family. But their plans for a cozy holiday home backfired when tourists flocked to ogle the cottage.
“The speck of land squeezes a house and a couple of wrought-iron benches pushed hard up against the shingles onto its banks,” wrote the Washington Post’s Andrea Sachs in 2010. “One misstep and you’re swimming.”
The outpost just about counts as part of the Thousand Islands archipelago as it’s not only above the level of the river year-round, but can sustain two trees or shrubs.
The island is one of 1,864 tiny patches of land poking out of the St. Lawrence River, which separates New York from Ontario, Canada.
The tiny island is about half the size of Bishop Rock, which the Guinness Book of World Records claimed was the world’s smallest inhabited island.
But it lost its crown in 1982 after the island’s lighthouse became automated, so there was no need for humans to man it.
