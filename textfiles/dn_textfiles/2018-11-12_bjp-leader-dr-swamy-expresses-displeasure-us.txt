BJP leader Dr. Swamy expresses displeasure at U.S.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Rajya Sabha member Dr. Subramanian Swamy yesterday expressed his displeasure at the US as they’ve condemned Sri Lanka for dissolving Parliament and ordering elections ahead of schedule.
In a tweet, he said that the US has come a long way from approving military dictators for putting a lock on Parliament to condemning early elections by a duly elected President.
Swamy hit out at the US adding that a duly elected President such as Maithripala Sirisena has the liberty under the Constitution to call for elections.
