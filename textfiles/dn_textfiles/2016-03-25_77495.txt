Govt. aims to increase fish production by 2018

 
The total fish production in 2015 was 75,000 metric tons. The government's target is to increase it to 150,000 metric tons in the next two years, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was speaking at the launch of the Miridiya Waruna programme held at the Apegama premises, Battaramulla yesterday.
The programme was held to pay tribute to inland fishermen and fisheries officers who contributed for the development of the freshwater fisheries sector in 2016.
The guests were Minister Amaraweera, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara, Science and Technology Minister Susil Premajayantha and Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage.
Minister Karunanayake said fish harvested from Sri Lanka is very popular in many countries.
He said by developing the fisheries industry, Sri Lanka can earn foreign exchange.
Minister Amaraweera said the awards ceremony will boost the freshwater fisheries sector.
"We have taken steps to improve fisheries and aqua culture development. The government plans to continue this ceremony annually," he said.
Minister Premajayantha also spoke.
