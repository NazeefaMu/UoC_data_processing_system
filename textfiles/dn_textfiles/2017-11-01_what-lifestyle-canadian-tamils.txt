What is the lifestyle of Canadian Tamils?

In North America, in Canada, there are many people from Lanka, Tamil Nadu and other countries. They speak an ancient (about 21 centuries ago) but a contemporary language called Tamil.
The Tamils from all parts of Lanka, north, east, central, Uva and west have gone to live in Canada for various reasons. This had been happening for phe last half a century. Majority of them are from the Jaffna peninsula. They are now Canadian citizens wherever they come from. A handful of them must be having dual citizenship of both Lanka and Canada.
Such people produce literature and films in their mother language which is Tamil. Although they are now reckoned as Canadian Tamils, what they produce as literature as
Pulam Peyar Ilaakiyam” (literature produced by the uprooted people) by some Lankan newspapers and magazines, just because many of them write about their experiences during the ethnic war situations in Lanka. However, even if they write about their Lankan experiences what they write cannot be called Lankan Tamil Literature. In fact they should be categorized as Canadian Tamil Literature.
Respective countries
Similarly there is Tamil Literature from citizens from countries like Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, Holland, Britain, Australia and New Zealand and South India. Although the writers may have come from Lanka what they produce belongs to the literature of the respective countries and they are no more Lankan Tamil Literature.This fact is forgotten by Lankan Tamil commentators. So, to my mind Pulam Peyar Ilakkiyam is a misnomer. Let that be.
A well-researched book by a former academic from Jaffna University and now a Canadian citizen, Prof Ilaiyathamby Balasundaram is an original and first of its kind work. This 518-page book printed in Toronto on gloss paper by Swami Vipulananthar Tamil Research Center in 2017 can be called a Magnum Opus.
It is a book in Tamil titled as Canadaavil ilankaith thamilarin vaalvum varalaarum. (Lankan Tamils’ Life and History in Canada). Under 11 topics, the writer gives comprehensive and valuable information on his chosen title. In a short review like this, it is impossible to comment on his admirable content. Most matter is new to me. Although I have been to Toronto - only on two occasions - I wouldn’t know much about Canadian Tamils. So I shall list the subjects of his book that may interest readers to buy and enjoy the book. They are listed in Tamil. I translate those into English.
1. Canadian Tamils’ entry into the country: a historical view.
2. Education for new immigrants in Canada.
3. The Status of Tamil in Canada.
4. Tamil Culture and prevailing of such culture in Canada.
5. Canadian Tamil Literature and Studies in Tamilogy.
6. The greatness in Science and Semantics of the Canadian Tamils.
7. The activities of Tamil Media in Canada.
8. The political activities of Canadian Tamils.
9. The lifestyle of senior citizens and Generation Gap.
10. Associations for the arts, literature and culture in Canada.
11. Conclusion
Tamil contributions
Apart from the main test, the book includes a bibliography of researched books and literary materials.
There are also indexes on Saiva Temples in Canada Catholic Tamil Prayer Churches, Tamil Radio Stations in Ontario, Tamil newspapers published in Canada, Tamil magazines published in Canada, books published by the Tamil Media in Canada, Tamil websites in Canada and Tamil Films produced in Canada.Prof Fr Joseph Chandrakanthan in his evaluation of the book says it is a good guide for other Tamils in other parts of the world to record their contributions in Tamil and this book is serious social document that is comprehensive.
In his Preface, Prof E Balasundaram details his painstaking effort that started in 2005 and thanks all those who assisted him in this praiseworthy undertaking.
This book deserves to be made available in all libraries and universities and research institutions.
