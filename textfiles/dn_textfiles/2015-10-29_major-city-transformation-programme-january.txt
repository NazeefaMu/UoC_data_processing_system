Major city transformation programme in January

The government will present its programme in January next year designed to transfer the entire Western Province to a major city and then the Hub of Asia, said Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
The views of professionals, voluntary and the public are being obtained at present, he said at the ceremonial opening of the Railway Quarters at the Slave Island Re-development Project. Forty houses were granted to the employees of the Railway Department.
Ranawaka said the participation of the public and their assistance to make such a programme a reality was compulsory.
"For example when they are given a housing unit, they have to accept it without reluctance to give up the previous place," he said. "The public attempt to acquire lands illegally. During the recent four holidays, people had acquired government lands on a large scale."
Minister Ranawaka said steps have to be taken if the government commits an offence against the people.
"In the similar way, if a particular community acquires government land illegally, stern action should be taken against them," the minister said.
"If some one attempt to acquire public property using thuggery, we would take stern action against them".
