‘Countrywide strike if SAITM awards MBBS degrees’

If the SAITM awards MBBS degrees to its students, it will be a violation of the Medical Ordinance and the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will launch an island wide strike, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthga said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said the government did not solve the SAITM students' problem and abolished the SAITM on December 31 as promised.Dr. Aluthge said the SLMC should not act according to the whims and fancies of politicians and it can only act according to the Medical Ordinance. “It cannot advice the SAITM because it is an illegal and fraudulent institution".
