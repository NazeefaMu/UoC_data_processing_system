Prisons to monitor goods brought in for inmates

Prison authorities are planning to ban food and other essential items from being taken into prisons by visitors.The measure is on at the Agunakolapelessa prisons.
A spokesman for the Prisons Department said the Department will soon submit a proposal to the Justice Ministry to implement it in all prisons in the country.
He said the Department will seek to impose a ban on bringing in food and other essential items for inmates by visitors.
The spokesman said visitors often deliver banned drugs such as heroin hidden inside food items and other essential items to prisoners.
He said visitors bring phones, SIM cards and other items to inmates hidden inside food and other items.
“If visitors need to deliver food or other essential to inmates, they can do so by paying the relevant cost of the items to the Department office. Then we will buy those items and give them to the prisoners,” he said. He said a number of foreign countries were adopting this method successfully.
The spokesman said this will help minimise crimes and other wrongdoings inmates commit.
