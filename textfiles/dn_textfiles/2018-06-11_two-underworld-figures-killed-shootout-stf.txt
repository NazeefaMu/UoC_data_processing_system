Two underworld gang members were killed in a shootout with the Police Special Task Force (STF) in Madawala, Katugastota in Kandy on Saturday.
According to the Police, they were close associates of two wanted underworld gang leaders’, Madush and Angoda Lokka, who are said to be residing abroad.
The two gang members are said to have carried out many criminal acts acting on the instructions of Madush and Angoda Lokka.
The suspects who were killed during the shootout have been identified as 30-year old Rumalsha Iresh Madushanka alias “Baila” and Polwattage Upali alias “Jana” according to the Police.
The Police were on the alert about the suspects after coming to know that the duo were coordinating criminal activities from a hideout in the Kandy area.
The Police Special Task Force had placed road blocks in the Madawala area after coming to know that the duo were travelling in a vehicle from Katugastota towards Madawala.
When the Police stopped a vehicle for inspection, the duo who were inside had opened fire at the Police officers and a shootout had ensued with the Police retaliating.
According to the Police, the gang members who were killed during the shootout are suspects in several ongoing court cases related to murder, ransom, drug trafficking and assault.
