President proposes stable legal order

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday urged members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) to adopt a comprehensive framework to prevent the trafficking of illicit drugs by sea.
The President, in his address to the IORA Leaders Summit yesterday said it was necessary to examine the dangers at sea such as piracy and terrorism.
The President said the trafficking of illicit drugs by sea has become an industry of sorts.
“Although various steps have been implemented to counter trafficking, there is no satisfactory end result,” the President said.
“It is universally recognized that all littoral States possess a maritime area bordering their coasts within which they exercise complete authority. However, beyond this limit are high seas which are not subject to the jurisdiction of any State. Illicit drugs are often smuggled into the country from the sea beyond the territorial waters,” President Sirisena added.
“I suggest IORA to work out a stable legal order to confront these concerns in conformity with the principles of the freedom of navigation.”
The President said it was in this context that the IORA
Concord and the Action Plan were signed by member nations, strengthening the organization’s role as an active forum for dialogue.
He said the national unity government had undertaken measures with regard to Sri Lanka’s position in the Indian Ocean region. The President informed Sri Lanka’s ambitious plans to enter the global value chain by becoming a regional hub for trade, tourism, transport and logistics.
The President stressed that it was necessary for IORA to initiate a dialogue between SAARC and ASEAN leaders.
“As our current Chair, Indonesia is also a member of the ASEAN and it may be useful to consider initiating a dialogue linking IORA member States, its dialogue partners and all interested major and middle powers.” The President welcomed Indonesia’s commitment to bring together all member nations of the IORA and its dialogue partners.
The President was greeted by his Indonesian counterpart Joko Widodo upon his arrival at the Jakarta Convention Centre to attend the IORA Leaders’ Summit.
