Corns in big demand

Corn cultivation will be facilitated to meet the local and foreign demand for the crop.
He was addressing a farmer meeting at Agunakolapelessa.
The Minister said corns are imported now overlooking the local corn production.
He said the farmers find it very difficult to sell their corns at a reasonable price.
Over 310,012 metric tonnes of corns are needed annually for the country and the same quantity is used to produce animal food. The Minister said the import of corns will be sanctioned and local farmers will be encouraged to cultivate corns.
