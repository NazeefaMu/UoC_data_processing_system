TISL launches anti-corruption tracker

Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) yesterday launched an online platform to track the progress that has been made in key anti-corruption commitments made by the government at the Anti-Corruption Summit 2016 held in London.
TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeysekere said this tracker will serve as a tool to promote accountability in the government to fulfill its anti-corruption commitments.
“Sri Lanka is unique in constitutionally enshrining our commitment to implementing the UN Convention against Corruption. As corruption also continues to feature prominently in the public discourse, we hope that the information provided through the tracker will empower the public and other stakeholders to focus their efforts in the fight against corruption,” he said.
In May 2016, 43 governments and six international organisations met in London for the Anti-Corruption Summit, resulting in a bold Global Declaration against Corruption.
The Sri Lankan government, represented by President Maithripala Sirisena, was also a participant at the Anti-Corruption Summit and made several broad-based pledges.
The three pledges that will be tracked through the online platform are the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), tracking large-scale corruption and money laundering and the protection of victims and witnesses.
These broad pledges are further broken down into 47 articles covering a wide range of commitments to combat corruption.
The tracker can be accessed at www.tracker.tisrilanka.org.
