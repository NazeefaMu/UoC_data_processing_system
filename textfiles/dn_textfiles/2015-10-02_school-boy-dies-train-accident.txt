School boy dies in train accident

A Grade III student was hit by a moving train travelling from Galle to Ambalangoda as he attempted to cross the railroad unaware of the train and succumbed to his injuries on admission to the Galle Karapitiya Teaching Hospital yesterday afternoon.
The accident took place at Galle, Richmond Hill. The boy identified as Pubudu Theekshana of Richmond College, had crossed the railway line to get to his school from the school bus which was parked on the opposite side of the road.
The driver of the school bus had accompanied the victim along with four other students and the driver seeing the moving train had stopped the boys from crossing. However, the boy who met with the accident had crossed the railway line with no heed to the driver's warning, police investigations revealed.
The student was a resident of Lelwala off Wanduramba in Galle. Galle Police are investigating.
