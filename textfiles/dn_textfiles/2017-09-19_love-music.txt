In love with music

Sending positive and powerful vibes throughout the audience is what Anno Domini is all about. Shehan Perera, Band Leader of Anno Domini who believes music is all about love and passion reveals his story to Melodies.
Shehan Perera, who is a lawyer, says the band chose the name Anno Domini because it was catchy. Perera who has always had an interest in Latin names pointed out that it actually means in the year of our Lord. The band strongly believes in being honourable and values integrity. They also believe in being professional and going that extra mile. It is this sense of responsibility that really defines them. Trustworthiness, dependability and pride and love in what they do are on the top of their list of priorities.
“We make sure the people who book us get the maximum out of it. We play exactly the way they would have wanted it. We cater to their musical tastes and also to the theme of the function. They must feel that they have got their money’s worth and should see that we have made a real effort,” said Perera.
Perera’s inspiration comes from many sources. He related a very touching story about how he wrote a song for his new born daughter which has not been recorded yet. Seeing her as a baby on the first day of her birth changed his life. That was an inspiration.
“I have written a few songs, but we have not had a time to record them. We want to record some singles this year or at the start of next year. I have written a song for the band about being in music, making music and being in love with music. Music itself has been one of my inspirations along with life events and various other things,” Perera stated.
Anno Domini is a band for all times. Their repertoire includes almost everything on request. They have made their name as a flexible and resilient band.
“Predominantly we go as a pop band, but being a band in Sri Lanka we play all types. We do a lot of weddings as well and are known in the wedding circuit. So you need to play different types of music to suit the occasion,” he said.
“We play pop, jazz and retro as well. We play music from the 70s up to 2017. We play a lot of current songs and also play Bailas and Sinhalese pop songs. In Sri Lanka especially at a wedding you need to play everything as the audience expects all,” Perera added. Anno Domini started as a group of friends and used to play as an acoustic outfit. The band is over 13 years now. Their first gig was at the World Trade Center. Starting out with four people, they had a packed audience every Friday, just playing acoustic music like Eagles, Beetles, Simon and Garfunkel. Having a great following, they thought they should cater to bigger events including weddings, corporate events and dinner dances. Perera points out that they were inspired and influenced by bands such as Beetles, Queen, the Eagle at the beginning. However now they have incorporated more songs into their repertoire such as Pit Bull.
“In our music we always try to be positive. Positivity is the main message we want to convey. Different artistes have different ideas expressed in their music but we want to use music as a tool to promote positivity. We have enough of songs that focus on the negativity in the world. We want people to be happy when they listen to us. When we do weddings we want everyone to enjoy the event, and we want them to go away feeling happy. We want to spread the message that life is good. Life is something happy,” Perera explained.
Love what you do, because if you do what you love, you will enjoy it, and if you enjoy it you will be successful. This may sound a cliché but it is exactly what Perera’s message is all about. If you enter music you have to do it because you love it and that should be your number one motive.
“My message to anyone who enters music is that first you have to love what you do. If you love making music then go for it. However it can be lucrative as well. You should be professional about it and not let people down. If you are known as a responsible person or outfit, and you know how to respect your clients, then you can go far. Be mindful of peoples’ tastes and requirements,” Perera said.
There is a perception in Sri Lanka that you do music because that is the only thing you can do. This is far from the truth. Anno Domini does music because it is their first love. Changing this perception is something Perera feels, is his duty. Music is a gift and it is a blessing to have music in your life. Not everyone can do it. Perera feels that musicians need to be respected as life would be boring without music. Music has added so much meaning to Perera’s life as he even met his wife in a church choir. Music has being in his life now for 23 years. “I am on the executive committee of the Western Musicians Association and we want to play our role in uplifting the standards of the music industry and help musicians to improve. We are thinking of an insurance scheme for musicians and a retirement plan as well. We are taking baby steps at the moment but we feel that it will be something great for the music industry,” Perera said
Anno Domini has created strong bonds of friendship and built bridges. “I have been in a choir for a long time. I have had the privilege of being trained by good voice trainers. I was part of the workshop players’ drama group directed by Jerome L. De Silva. For musicals we were trained by Mary Anne David and I had the privilege of learning under her.
I have sung for shows conducted by Ruwani Seimon and I was trained by her. As a child I also had the chance to train under Lylie Godridge. All of them have influenced me,” Perera summed up.
