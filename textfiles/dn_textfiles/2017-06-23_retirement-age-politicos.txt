A retirement age for politicos

Executive Director of PAFFREL Rohana Hettiarachchi has called for a retirement age for all Sri Lankan politicians saying that most of our politicos have stuck in their toes and refusing to budge even when they are long in the tooth. He said that there were some politicians who should be consigned to wheel chairs but are still staying put due to the greed for power. Such politicians, he opines, hinder the opportunity for youth to come to the fore to serve the country. He wants a ceiling placed on the age for political office though this should not necessarily mean that all politicians should retire at 55 or 60 as in the case of the public and private sector.
Hettiarachchi’s recommendation, no doubt, would be received with mixed sentiments. He certainly would not be a favourite with some of our members in the August Assembly, who have long passed their “expiry date”. There will also be those who will contend that long experience in the field is a sine quo non, in order to mature as a fully fledged politician who could serve the public better. Those who are of this school of thought would refer to the case of JRJ who became Head of State when he just passed the biblical life span of three score and ten years. This was after remaining nearly half a century in politics holding ministerial office under three UNP governments prior to that. Sirima Bandaranaike too played a long innings and was indeed wheel chair bound when she died in harness. Others such as Maithripala Senanayake, T.B. Illangaratne. Dr. N.M. Perera served long years as politicians, and it must be said, made noteworthy contributions towards the country. What is more, these politicians were repeatedly elected by the people despite their age, some of them even defeating youthful candidates fielded by the other side.
True, as the PAFFREL head contends, a majority of our politicians are on the threshold of senility, if not already there, and should be put to pasture. Some of their conduct in recent times definitely suggest that old age has taken a toll on their faculties. Equally, it is true that we cannot write-off all politicians in general merely because age has caught up with them. With age comes wisdom and Sri Lanka could do with political leaders who have accumulated loads of wisdom. With age also comes cunning and, regrettably, it is this trait that one sees more often in our politicians, going by past experience. We are aware of at least one political leader in the recent past who went out of his way to extend his tenure in office, indefinitely, so it was said, to pave the way for his progeny to pick the baton, possibly when he had reached a ripe old age. The PAFFREL chief perhaps may have had such individuals in mind when he made his suggestion for a retirement age for politicians.
Be that as it may, many would agree with Hettiarachchi’s claim that aging politicians were blocking the entry of youth into politics, read parliament, but not all. Youth have to be guided by experienced hands and it is only mature politicians, who have acquired the skills with long years in the field are capable of doing this. Hence, one should guard against throwing the baby with the bath water. If all politicians of “retirement age” are to make way for youth there is certainly going to be disorder and mayhem, given the scenario now being witnessed on the streets.
On the contrary, it is the new entrants who are responsible for the riotous scenes presently witnessed in parliament and not the veterans. True, this conduct may be attributed to youthful exuberance and cannot be exactly faulted. But if Hettiarachchi feels that parliament will be a better place if youth representation is increased at the expense of aging politicians he indeed is mistaken. We had youth representation in its entirety in the JVP when the party won nearly 40 seats at the 2004 General Election with most members even appointed Cabinet Ministers under CBK. It is difficult to gauge if the country gained in anyway by such a large infusion of youth into parliamentary politics. Which goes to show that bringing youth into politics is not the panacea of all ills. The country’s problems need speedy solutions which require experienced handling and it is only those politicians who have matured with age could cope with the challenge.
On the other hand, one has to admit that there is certainly deadwood in the present parliament who needed to weeded out and replaced with fresh faces. These MPs, as mentioned before, are merely marking time till the time is ripe to make way for their kith and kin to join in the gravy train. They, no doubt, are a burden on the country and a drain on its finances. More than a retirement age, it would be ideal if a MP is debarred to contest election after a specific term in parliament. This, while giving them a honourable exit, would also ensure no family tree thrives.
