KOPIA supports onion production

The Korea Program on International Agriculture (KOPIA) Sri Lanka Centre held a workshop on onion seed production at the Field Crops Research and Development Institute (FCRDI), Mahailluppallama, recently.
About 120 participants were present, including local governmental officials, technical advisors, and about 80 Sri Lankan farmers from the KOPIA model farms in Galenbindunuwewa and Bulnewa areas.
M.G.S.P. Pathirana and B.I. Hettiarachchi, onion researchers from FCRDI, as well as a Korean onion expert Dr. Lee Jeong-Gwan presented brief lectures on soil improvement, onion cultivation and seedling management, followed by a discussion.
Dr. Lee demonstrated how to make Kimchi by using onion, to promote the consumption of onions in Sri Lanka. Kimchi is a traditional side dish made from salted and fermented vegetables, commonly cabbage and Korean radishes, with a variety of seasonings. He also demonstrated ways to operate a vinyl mulching machine and a trencher for pesticide-free weed control.
The KOPIA Sri Lanka Centre has been managing the model farms on onion seed production since 2015, and is planning to hold an academic seminar and an evaluation session this October.
