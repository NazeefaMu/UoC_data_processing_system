Brigadier Priyankara recalled for consultation

Minister Counsellor (Defence) attached to the Sri Lankan High Commission in London, Brigadier Priyankara Fernando has been recalled to Sri Lanka for consultations.
Military Spokesperson, Brigadier Sumith Atapattu addressing the weekly media briefing said no inquiry was being held against the Defence Attaché, “We just want to talk to him about what happened”.
He explained that while there was diplomatic pressure, the impact the incident had on the image of the country needed to be discussed. As far as the military was concerned, this was not a ‘serious crime’, he said.
“There have been people who supported him as well as criticised him for that and we just want to find out what happened given the circumstances”, said Brigadier Atapattu.
In early February Brigadier Fernando was filmed whilst making a gesture which symbolized the ‘cutting of a throat’, in response to a group of Tamil protesters outside the High Commission.
Though the Foreign Ministry at the time immediately recalled him from service, the President later reinstated him.
