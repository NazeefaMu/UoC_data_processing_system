Gunmen fire at Dickwella PS member’s house

Three armed men wearing helmets had aimed several gunshots at the house of Dickwella Pradeshiya Sabha UNP member Priyantha Wanigaratne and escaped around 5.45 am yesterday (30).
According to reports, the three men had arrived at the house and knocked at the door yesterday morning.
When his wife opened the door, the men had claimed that they were from the Dickwella Police and wanted to check the house for hidden firearms.
His wife was suspicious about their identity and had shouted out to her husband and asked him to alert the Dickwella Police. Wanigaratne had quickly come and closed the door and the men had fled the scene after firing several gunshots at the house.
The gunshots had damaged a wall in the house.
No casualties were reported. Wanigaratne had then visited the Dickwella Police Station and lodged a complaint about the incident. Police investigations are continuing.
