Police probe Boossa private bus hold up

An extensive operation has been launched to track down the suspects involved in the bus hold up at the Boossa Junction on the Galle - Colombo Road where a private bus was forcibly stopped and taken away with the bus crew after dropping the commuters at the spot, Rathgama Police said.
He said the suspected group of thugs had abandoned the bus along Pinthaliya - Delkada road after assaulting the driver and conductor with clubs and iron bars and severely damaging his vehicle including its engine.
The driver and conductor are receiving treatment at the Arachchikande Hospital. Their condition is not critical, a hospital spokesman said.
The damaged bus had to be towed by another vehicle to the police station due to engine failure. The bus was plying from Elpitiya to Beddegama via Gurusinghagoda when the incident ocurred. A group of about 15 had been involved in the attack.
Investigations revealed that a controversy regarding the operation timetable of buses had led to the incident.
