Pakistan wins second T20I and takes winning 2-0 lead
Ashraf destroys gallant Sri Lanka with hat-trick

ABU DHABI, Friday – It seems that nothing can go wrong for Pakistan at the moment for everything they touch seems to turn to gold as the saying goes.
Yesterday at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium Sri Lanka invited to bat first again by Pakistan in the second T20 International looked on course towards a competitive total when they raced to 106-1 by the 17th over, but when the Pakistani bowlers were not taking wickets they found other ways of doing so by running out three Lankan batsmen with some outstanding work on the field – two of the dismissals were off direct hits.
As it that was not enough Faheem Ashraf, a 23-year-old right-arm medium-paced all-rounder from Punjab became the first Pakistani and sixth bowler to perform the hat-trick in T20 Internationals.
In a sensational third over the 19th of the innings Faheem renowned for his big hitting dismissed Isuru Udana (caught) for 6, Mahela Udawatte (caught) for 0 and Dasun Shanaka (lbw) for 1 to end up with figures of 3 for 16.
Sri Lanka rocked by these run outs and hat-trick lost their last eight wickets for 18 runs off 22 balls to slump to 124-9 when a total in excess of 150 was on the cards at one time.
Although Sri Lanka fought back superbly to remove the top five batters for 94 in 16 overs and reduced them to 113-8 in the final over when 12 was required, Pakistan had plenty of depth in their batting to whisk off the remaining runs.
Shadab Khan (16 not out with 1 six, and 1 four) and Hasan Ali (3 not out) saw Pakistan home by two wickets with a ball to spare to take a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
Sri Lanka on this occasion got their batting order right by promoting the big hitters Seekkuge Prasanna, Thisara Perera and Dasun Shanaka up the order, but they managed only five runs amongst them.
Sri Lanka needed to play fearless cricket if they were to get out of the present quandary of batting failures.
The top three in the order almost did that before the innings made a complete U turn.
Dilshan Munaweera and Danushka Gunathilaka put together an opening stand of 43 off 40 balls before Munaweera was run out for19 off a direct hit from mid-off attempting a quick single. He made it rather difficult for himself by running at an angle instead of straight. He should be told that the perpendicular is the shortest.
Gunathilaka joined by Sadeera Samaraweera showed positive intent and played the kind of cricket that had been lacking in the Lankan side for quite awhile. They ran their singles well and rotated the strike to raise a partnership of 63 off 64 balls before things started to fall apart.
Samarawickrama became the second run out victim when he was dismissed for 32 off 31 balls and in the same over Sri Lanka also lost Gunathilaka for a well compiled knock of 51 off 48 balls (4 fours, 1 six) – his maiden T20I fifty.
The quick dismissals of two set batsmen proved detrimental to the rest of the innings and the momentum of the Lankan batting was simply lost as Pakistan came roaring back into the game.
