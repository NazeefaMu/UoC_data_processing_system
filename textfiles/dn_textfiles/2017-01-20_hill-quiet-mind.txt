The Hill Of The Quiet Mind

Juliet Coombe follows in the footsteps of the pilgrims’ sacred circuit and is spellbound by Sithulpawwa Rajamaha Viharaya, Yala’s wild and deeply spiritual rock temple
Driving through protected wilderness in the heart of Yala National Park one hears how once a year the 50 park guides have to protect the pilgrims from being attacked as they walk barefoot through Yala game reserve to a mystical rock and cave temple complex known as Sithulpawwa, which is thought to have been built in the third century.
A place that is both spiritual and historically fascinating owing to its temple cave drawings done in red and yellow, on a thin layer of plaster, in the 3rd century, which give a wonderful snap shot of earlier times in this remote area of the island.

Known throughout the island as one of the great pilgrim sites of Sri Lanka it is all the more exciting and dangerous for the un-initiated as it lies inside Yala wildlife reserve, which requires crossing a bridge from Block One to Block Two on foot. Risking ones life among the bull elephants and frisky leopards is truly a test of faith as they will if hungry happily take a whole cow or monkey, in one jaw dropping moment, as they pounce on their prey. However, my guide laughed saying usually the elephants want to steal the pilgrims’ lunches or cameras and the greatest danger is them being crushed by one of them in the process. Talking to the park’s guides one has to admire those that will risk all for their religion; some might even say it is a religious test to navigate your way through the wildest of places and survive to make a holy pujas.

Sithulpawwa   
If westerners want to go to Sithulpawwa temple through the park please organise special permission in advance so that you can do this on foot, or you can go on the road to Katagamuwa, running alongside Block Two, where if you are lucky you will see, as we did, a leopard crossing the road outside the park boun dary along Tissamaharama-Yodhakandiya road, where even in a car you will have plenty of wildlife encounters.
Revered and exalted, Sithulpawwa Rajamaha Viharaya, built around the 3rd Century BC, is only one hour from The Safari Hotel, Tissa and is an excellent place to stay as they provide excellent guides and an extremely knowledgeable naturalist in the area, who can explain the history of the ancient Buddhist monastery, which is 18 km east of the pilgrimage town of Kataragama.
There are many ancient buildings of interest below the rock temple, which you have to climb up to, to get to the inner sanctuary, where you can enjoy spectacular views. The rock temple has small water features cut out of the rock surface, probably formally for the monks to bathe in and now home to a couple of pairs of white ducks.Sithulpawwa is derived from the word “Chiththala Pabbatha”, meaning ‘the hill of the quiet mind’, which was famous at one time for its hermit religious community.
You park up in the lower car park and walk up one side, taking your shoes with you or facing a long walk back to pick them up later in the day. At the top of this naturally beautiful spot one crosses a path from the main Stupa to get to the other side, through jungle and a rock climb to the top that takes one and a half hours. From here you have amazing views of Yala National park on the other side, which is home to 44 different mammals, of which the leopard and elephant are the most famous.
From the temple you can see views of Yala and lots of colourful bird life
On the walk the naturalist guide will point out some of Yala’s 250 birds, some of which can be seen around the large temple area. Yala boasts half of the 495 different types of birds to be found in Sri Lanka, and if you are lucky, on a cool day, you may also encounter a handful of the 47 species of reptiles that can be found in the park and occasionally, if you do not walk too loudly, you might even see one of the country’s three venomous snakes. Monks say there have been snakes from time to time on the jungle path, including the Indian Krait, the Indian Cobra and Russel’s Viper.
For history buffs this ancient monastery is full of different ruins in diverse places that go back over 2,200 years, to a time when it was a place of worship for devotees as well as a centre of Buddhist education for Buddhist monks teaching learned pilgrims. Things to look out for are the paintings of the first Kingdom, during the Anuradhapura era, and the fascinating Image Houses and Circular Relic Houses, which are spread throughout the monastery premises. It is a good idea to have an expert with you on this adventurous walk.

The serene quietness of the place, even when busy with pilgrims, is why people say it is so uplifting as one is not only close to nature and what many refer to as the original Garden of Eden, but also touched by the words of the Buddhist monks that live inside the temple grounds. Seeing Yala game reserve through its religious buildings reminds one how until recently this was open land and the only way to see the area was on foot or by ox cart, as cars and jeeps in the bigger scheme of things are very new.
Watching the sun set over this sacred spot is breath-taking and also means, on the journey back to the hotel, that you are more likely to see nocturnal wildlife as they are at their busiest at dusk.
It is a great time also to see rogue elephants returning from a wash and drink in the waterhole and if you are really lucky a leopard or two. Just remember as you drive back to The Safari Hotel to do so slowly, as elephants if frightened can charge vehicles at night.
The stunningly recently refurbished Safari Hotel Tissamaharama is a gateway property to a number of special places like Yala National park’s Sithulpawwa temple and is in its own right a major cultural and natural attraction. The hotel overlooks a floating lake of birds nesting on an island opposite and blooming lotus flowers, which are picked daily at dawn in a rubber ring to give as spiritual offerings to the surrounding temples and in particular to sell to pilgrims making their yearly pilgrimage to Kataragama.
It is a serene spot where time does not matter as much as your spiritual well being, a true oasis located 270kms South of Colombo and a lifetime away from busy city life with experiences that will stay with you for a life time.
