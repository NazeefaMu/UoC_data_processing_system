Sri Lanka’s first ever Watch Experience Centre

Blink International recently announced the launch of a dedicated multi-brand watch Experience and Service Centre. Situated at the Iceland Building in Colombo 3, the Blink experience center showcases a variety of versatile and stylish timepieces from internationally renowned brands such as Casio, Puma, Esprit, Elle, Cross, and Sevenfriday, offering visitors to the centre a first-hand feel for Blink’s selection of high quality watches designed to offer affordable luxury to fit any budget.
“Sri Lanka is developing at an increasingly rapid pace, and with this development, we see young people become more discerning in their taste, but still demanding performance and durability out of their watches. Today, Blink maintains a portfolio of some of the most sought after watch brands in Sri Lanka. We are very optimistic that we will be able to carry our momentum into 2017, and substantially expand our distribution island-wide,” Muhammed Mansoor, Director of Blink said.
Speaking at the opening, Group CEO Faris Fausz outlined how Blink International was an important strategic move for the group in order to bring affordable, original timepieces to Sri Lanka backed by the highest warranty and service standards. He said “As a group we have been touching customers’ lives and fulfilling their needs with functional products with a sense of design, Blink International will be a further testament in that quest.”
