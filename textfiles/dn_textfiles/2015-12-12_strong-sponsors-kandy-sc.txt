Kandy sports round-up
Strong sponsors for Kandy SC

 
Strong backing by sponsors helps keep Kandy Sports Club moving forwards with many victories. Kandy SC are the defending inter-club champions who will once again be sponsored by Cargill's Food City, Sri Lankan and Etisalat.
The sponsors should be proud of the club's achievements. Started in 1950, in the period between 1995 and 2012 the club did not lose a single Clifford Cup title, although in 1998 there was no tournament and in 2006 the club withdrew from the tournament. Kandy SC has won the league title for a record nine consecutive years between 2000 and 2009.
The crowds at the venues as well as live TV coverage have no doubt given the much needed exposure to the sponsors. Rugby at club level draws more spectator interest than cricket.
Etisalat's association with Kandy SC has helped them in a big way. Kandy SC captain Fazil Marija said: "We sincerely thank Etisalat for their kind sponsorship and we look forward to deliver an unforgettable performance to make our sponsors proud."
Cargills (Ceylon) PLC are once again the platinum sponsors of the champion outfit and Singer Sri Lanka, the long standing sponsor.
Ransilu Jayatilake does Kandy proud in Canada
Ransilu Jayatilake who represented the country at the Commonwealth Power Lifting Championship has pocketed six gold medals and silver in the two-day event. He is the first Sri Lankan to achieve 700 kgs mark in Power Lifting and the first to lift 300 kgs in weightlifting.
Ransilu started his power lifting career at the age of 13 and was coached by his father D.U.M. Jayatilake. Ransilu's iron sport started at Kandy SC gymnasium when his father was in charge.
Kandy Club Football inactive
With the Kandy Club football in the doldrums some of the football lovers who are starving without proper football in Kandy have come forward to play a game between a team from Kandy and Colombo on invitation.
They plan to come out with a trophy named as M.E. Marikar and William Weerasinghe trophy. M.E. Marikar, a product of St Sylvester's was a top class footballer during his days. He also played for the school, Kandy Schools, Young Stars SC, Kandy District, Saunders FC and led the Government Services XI in 1956. Later he was a great football promoter as an official and journalist.
William Weerasinghe who hails from down South studied at Dharmaraja College and later played football for the school and Young Stars SAC. He was one time treasurer and Vice President of the Kandy District Football Association.
The two teams will comprise some of the top players in the country and the trophy and the match expenses will be borne by former FFSL president Manilal Fernando.
S.N Ranaweera, best all-round sportsman Trinity Junior
Swimmer S.N. Ranaweera was chosen as the best all-round sportsman of Trinity College Junior School for the year 2015 and was presented with a trophy donated by Herbert L. Fernando in memory of one time Trinity rugger and hockey player and later rugger coach Quentin Israel.
Swimming
Kandy product Shehan de Silva who learnt his swimming at Trinity College was adjudged as the champion swimmer for the second year at the 41st national sports festival which was held at the Sugathadasa Stadium swimming pool and organized by the Ministry of Sports.
Rugby Referees to be trained
One of the finest referees to come out of Kandy Anil Jayasinghe, who has blown over here and overseas, is to give a helping hand to promote referees.
He is keen to conduct classes for referees twice a month, and teach them the finer points of refereeing.
What has happened to Ladies Cricket Club?
The question in Kandy among the cricket loving ladies is what has happened to the recently-formed Kandy Ladies Cricket Club that took part in hard ball cricket and played in the tournament organized by the Sri Lanka Women's Cricket Association. The first game they played in this tournament was against Colombo Colts Ladies team at the Moors grounds.
The team led by Swini de Alwis comprised Chamara Polgampola, Dilani Manodara, Prabha Udawatte, Mahesha Perera, Sandamali Jayasundara, Nisansala Dharmawickrema, Nirmala Bowatte, Sripali Weerakkody, Subadhra Kumari, Nalika Samaranayake, Sandamali Karunaratne, Niluka Amarasena, Sandya Kumari, and Chandima Abeywickrema.
Will this club like the men's clubs remain inactive and only start playing matches when the AGM is around the corner?
Women's Basketball
Kandy' Basketball team led by Ravini Dissanayake and comprising Nethmi Wijesinghe (vice-captain), Dulma Jayamanne, Sachini Dulangani, Nirasha Beddegama, Dilanak Silva and C,. Harini gave a superb display of basketball to beat Kandy YMCA and take top position in the Kandy District women's basketball tournament which was organized by the Kandy District Basketball Association.
This is one sport both in the men's and women's that are doing well. Veteran of the game D.S. Pingamage is the one responsible for keeping this game alive.
When will KDCA AGM take place?
When will the AGM of the Kandy District Cricket Association (KDCA) be held? This is the talk among the cricket playing clubs in Kandy. It is high time they call for the AGM and hold it before the Sri Lanka Cricket AGM. The secretary of the KDCA should take the blame for not doing a proper job. Today in Kandy at club level there are no domestic tournaments and also the game is not promoted in the correct manner. The last KDCA AGM was held in 2013. From that day onwards no AGM has been held, but the same people are holding office.
Duncan White remembered
The late Duncan White, who was born on 1 March 1918 and departed on 3 July 1998, was remembered in Kandy. He is an athlete who has left an indelible mark in Sri Lanka's sporting history. White was the first Ceylonese athlete to win a medal in an Olympic event.
He won silver in the 400-metre hurdles at the 1948 Summer Olympics in England. He was also the only South Asian to have won an Olympic medal in track and field at that time.
White though he was born in Lathpandura near Kalutara, was educated at Trinity College, Kandy where he was awarded 'Trinity Lion' for athletics.
This was subsequently withdrawn from him due to minor disciplinary reasons. He won his Olympic medal the same year Ceylon gained independence from Britain. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1949 but only many years later in 1988 was he honored by his country of birth with a postage stamp.
