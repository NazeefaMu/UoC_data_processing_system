Money laundering case against Mahindananda:
Further trial fixed for July 9

A case filed against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs.27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo, over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money, was yesterday taken up before the Colombo High Court.
The Court of Appeal had issued an order transferring this case to another court of competent jurisdiction other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
High Court judge Gihan Kulatunga fixed the matter for a calling date on July 9, since the order of the Court of Appeal had not been received by the High Court.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Aluthgamage alleging that Aluthgamage had purchased a house at Kynsey Road, Colombo, from an individual named Christopher Roshan for Rs.27 million.
The Attorney General alleged that the accused failed to disclose how he was able to raise the money for the purchase of the house, and further alleged that he had committed an offence that comes under Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The former minister stands accused of financial irregularities in a complaint lodged against him by the Convener of the Voice Against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty with Counsel Hafeel Farisz, Thusitha Ranasinghe, Tharandi Wijayapura and Dinesh Silva appeared for the accused.
