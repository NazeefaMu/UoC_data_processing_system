New paddy strains yielding good harvest in South

AT-07800 and AT-676 paddy strains introduced to farmers by the Ambalantota Paddy Research Centre were able to yield a good production, paddy cultivators said.
The AT- 07800 which is a white samba-nadu paddy strain and grains of rice of this variety are a little thin and long. The harvest can be reaped within a short period of three months since cultivation. Over 160 bushels of paddy can be harvested through this by cultivating in the dry zone.
In the case of wet zone, 120 to 130 bushels of paddy could easily be reaped. That is also highly resistant to pests, insect scourges and various other diseases, researchers added. AT- 676 is also a white nadu and samba paddy variety. The harvest can be yielded in three months since cultivation. Over 160 bushels of paddy can be harvested from this paddy strain too through the cultivation in the dry zone. In the wet zone cultivation, over 130 paddy bushels could easily be obtained from it.
