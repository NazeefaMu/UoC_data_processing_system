Resolving debt knots

Sri Lanka faces a serious problem: the country is heavily indebted; total public debt rose to Rs. 9,401,969 million (or Rs.9.4 trillion) as at September 2016. As a % of GDP, public debt stood at 76% in 2015 and the rating agency Fitch estimates this has increased to 77% of GDP by end 2016.
More frighteningly, servicing this debt, paying the interest and the capital consumed 90.6% of total government revenue in 2015. The debt service cost has remained at over 90% for most of the last 10 years and has even exceeded 100% in some years (in 2009, 2010 and 2013).
If the majority of what the Government collects as taxes and grants is spent paying interest and capital on its outstanding debts how is other expenditure funded? By further borrowing, which means that in subsequent years the interest cost will keep rising. The Government takes on new loans to repay old ones and we end up spending more each year to service debt than on health, education, indeed almost everything else combined.
Government services
Sri Lanka is in a debt trap; the majority of the Government’s income goes to repay debts and further debt is incurred to pay for government services. This is clearly unsustainable and has been so for some time.
Sri Lanka has not reported a surplus on the current account (meaning that revenues do not cover recurrent costs) from 1990, which is as far back as the published figures go. Further, the position keeps worsening; the current account deficit which was Rs.3,807m in 1990 has continued to deteriorate steadily to reach Rs. 246,779m in 2015. The position is now reaching a critical stage, as successive IMF bailouts in 2009, 2011 and 2016 testify. (See Table)
To try and close the deficit on the current account the Government has resorted to sharp increases in taxes. In the 2016 budget VAT, withholding taxes, telecoms taxes, excise duties and a multitude of taxes on businesses have increased. The citizenry, already burdened by high cost of living are reeling under the impact of the tax increases and the scope for further increases is limited, unless the Government wants to court widespread unpopularity.
It now becomes apparent that we cannot ignore the case for cutting outlays any longer. When cutting costs it is always good to start with the largest items, because even a small percentage reduction will deliver large absolute benefits. If debt service consumes 90% of Government revenue then trying to reduce this should be a priority.
As any banker will advise, the simplest way to prune the debt is to dispose of underutilised assets and use the proceeds to settle debt. If a sufficiently large quantum of assets were disposed, in combination with the recent increases in tax it will be possible to bring the current account into surplus with the surplus being used to reduce debt still further. We thus turn a vicious circle of ever increasing debt service costs into a virtuous circle of steadily reducing debt.
Dispose of state assets
This is the basic rationale for Sri Lanka to dispose of state assets: we have been living beyond our means on borrowed money. If we are not to collapse under the weight of our debts then we need to arrest the situation immediately and pay off as much debt as possible. Disposing of assets will allow the Government to raise funds to reduce debt.
While the need for disposing assets is now clear, selecting which ones to dispose of has sparked a furious debate. The Government has proceeded very timidly, identifying a few non-strategic assets for disposal: the Hyatt Hotel, Litro Gas; the Colombo Hilton, Grand Orient Hotel and Waters Edge and Lanka Hospitals.
This is an uncontentious list of assets. These serve no wider public interest, all were relatively recent acquisitions, many being expropriated from private hands under dubious circumstances under the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilized Assets Act of 2011.
Surprisingly, there is objection to even this. The objectors make no real case for not disposing these assets but resort to ideological arguments that these represent public assets of great significance that should never be touched. How a collection of hotels, a distributor of cooking gas and a fee-levying hospital run on private lines could be considered vital to public welfare is a mystery.
What the Government should be concerned with is the process of disposal: open bids must be called and the whole process must be transparent and free of political interference.
Stock Exchange
The Government should follow the successful model used in the past, offering 60% of the shares on open bidding and subsequently selling a further 30% of the shares to the public and listing the company on the Stock Exchange. The employees are gifted 10% of the shares free of charge.
The businesses selected for sale are distinct legal entities in their own right and are not insolvent or overburdened with debt. As many were already listed, they are compliant with SEC rules and publish financials on time, an indication that internal systems and processes are in a workable state. The accounts of most SOE’s are usually about three years in arrears and serve as a damning indictment of state management.
In other words these are relatively ‘easy’ privatisations. Their disposal should be fast-tracked. In parallel a wider review of SOE’s to determine the benefit they bring to the wider public and the merits of disposal must be undertaken.
