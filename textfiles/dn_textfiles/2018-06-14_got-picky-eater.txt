Got  a picky  eater?

We really do want to make sure our children get off to a great start in the morning and we want to make sure that their little bodies are fueled to do the best at school, so it can be stressful when they will not eat before school.
Don’t panic. This is a completely normal. Here are some strategies you can implement to lighten your load.
1) Eat together
 
One of the simplest things you can do to encourage great eating habits in your child’s early years is to sit down together for family meals. Sitting down together isn’t just about nutrition; it’s about connecting and teaching children about becoming members of society and acting in a civilized way.
 
2) Get rid of any distractions!
 
When the family starts to eat, definitely turn down the television and put the hand-held technology (mobile phones and games) away (that means you too, mom and dad). Children get very easily distracted. Practice “Mindful Eating” by eliminating distractions, your child will be able to put more focus towards what’s on their plate.
 
3) Maintain consistent rules
 
It’s very important that parents of fussy eaters maintain clear and consistent food rules in the house at all times. If your child refuses a particular food, don’t be fooled.
They’re hoping you’ll offer up something sweet as an alternative.
If you do fall for this, your child will quickly learn that refusing vegetables results in something else being offered. So consistency is the key. Whatever you do, don’t force them to eat, bribe them, or insist they finish everything on their plate.
 
4) Presentation is everything
 
Children are very observant. Before they even start eating, their eyes are observing what has just been put in front of them. If it looks gross, they’re going to think it tastes gross.
So keep it colourful, neat and interesting. It literally takes an extra minute to re-arrange their food into a smiley face, or make the Triforce out of veggie sticks. Just a little variation can sometimes make a world of difference. Also, try preparing foods a different way.
 
5) Make them your kitchen sidekick
 
Getting your child to help with meal preparation, no matter how little, will lead to them being more likely to eat the food as they now have an ‘ownership’ of the meal and feel proud about helping out.
At the store or market, ask your child to help you select fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods.
When you get back home, encourage your child to help you put the food away, arrange the fruit, or rinse the vegetables.
