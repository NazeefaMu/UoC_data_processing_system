Tallest Christmas Tree ‘cut down’

The process of constructing the world’s tallest and largest Christmas tree, which was intended to set a Guinness world record, has been halted by Ports Minister Arjuna Ranatunga on the instructions of Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith,  Coordinating Secretary of the Ports Minister and Christmas Tree construction committee chairman Mangala P Gunasekara said.
He said that Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith was informed duly through his coordinating secretary prior to commencement of the construction of this giant work. Besides, the constructing committee has taken measures to make the Pope aware through a letter in this regard.
The estimated cost of the project was Rs 12 million and the total amount had been planned to be raised through donations of well-wishers. Of the amount Rs 6 million had already been received as raw materials and all the major construction including the structure has already been completed, he said.
“The intention of constructing this world’s tallest and largest Christmas tree was to bring the message of the peace to the world.”
“In addition it was to showcase and strengthen religious harmony among the ethnic and religious groups. Besides, it had been planned to set a Guinness world record as the world’s tallest and the largest Christmas tree.
“Moreover, it was decided to boost tourism through this project as this would attract tourists. It has been reported that most of the hotel rooms in Colombo have already been booked in advance due to this project” he said.
When Gunasekara was questioned whether the project did not receive early approval of the Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, he said that they took measures to inform Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith through his secretary before the commencement of the project on August 18 at the Galle Face Green.
The project commenced amidst the blessings of all religions.
When asked whether the project utilised the resources of the Ports Ministry, Gunasekara added that not a single cent of the Ports Ministry was used for the project. All the expenses were to be covered through the donations of the well-wishers.
“The project was being initiated by a team of prime-mover drivers of the port with the assistance of other harbour employees.”
“They worked voluntarily. Apart from ports employees a significant number of volunteers from countrywide joined the project.”
“Not a single bolt or nut of the Port was used in the project” he said. S.D.M. Nanayakkara the chief architect of the project said that this was a dream of his.
