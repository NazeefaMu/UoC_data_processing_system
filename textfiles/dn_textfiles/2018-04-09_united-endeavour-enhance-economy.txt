United endeavour to enhance economy

The change of regime in 2015 January raised people’s aspirations for a positive social and political transformation. Many people felt that the country could move away from the conflictual past to a more peaceful future. They also expected that their myriad of problems could now be managed by a regime committed to the well known principles of good governance. But, after three years since the formation of the new government, people’s hopes have been largely dashed and the country is embroiled in an unprecedented political crisis and nobody knows how we are going to get out of it.
As I pointed out in several articles in these columns immediately after the formation of the new regime in 2015, some of the key constituents of the new regime represented extremely contradictory political views that it was virtually impossible for them to pursue a collective programme of reform. This was evident throughout the three year period and this became quite clear whenever the government leaders were forced to take a firm stand on important public policy issues. Yet, they could not do so because the regime was caught between two very different ideological positions that I have described as “corrosive neoliberalism” and “violent ethno-nationalism” in the political domain.
As is well known, neoliberalism was embraced by many countries since the late 1970’s and some of them have since then made many economic gains by way of FDI, technology transfer and rapid economic growth. China is the most notable example in the world but there are many others in East Asia and elsewhere. Though deficient in terms of democratic governance and civil liberties, the technocratic nature of the regimes enabled these countries to manage their economic development process in an efficient manner by making necessary public investments in such areas as education, research, institution building and essential infrastructure development without wasting borrowed money on economically and socially useless projects. But, Sri Lanka by and large mismanaged the development process and allowed industries we had built over many decades to collapse.
Agro-based industries
We put all our eggs in one basket, i.e. the garments industry and, with increasing wages due to inflation and devaluation of the rupee, many people started migrating to other countries. Many low end garment enterprises migrated to countries with cheaper labour. Successive governments were happy to promote the exodus to earn much needed foreign exchange, without realising the negative effect of labour migration on the domestic economy, in particular rural agriculture.
The neglect of agriculture resulted in loss of employment and livelihoods in rural areas, increasing food prices and declining crop diversification. Instead of scientifically managing the sector, populist governments took short term, popular measures to appease the rural voter, making the latter dependent on subsidies such as highly subsidised inputs and income support. Yet, many youth had no interest in agriculture due to its precarious nature as a source of income.
The main reason was that agricultural sector has remained stagnant due to lack of crop diversification, neglect of agricultural research leading to almost total collapse of agricultural research institutions, devaluation of agricultural extension and the lack of development of agro-based industries to create more lucrative employment opportunities in rural areas. Moreover, liberal import policies led to the collapse of many rural industries, forcing many people to leave rural areas.
Persistently low public investments in education did not help improve its quality, making many of the products of public educational institutions unfit for highly skilled and productive employment in a competitive labour market. This situation encouraged the private education sector ranging from private tuition classes through international schools to private higher educational establishments in urban centres. Products of private educational institutions and those who returned from overseas education filled most of the vacancies in the private sector.
Meanwhile, the products of public educational institutions in general were left out of more lucrative employment in the corporate sector. The situation became serious with the rapid expansion of the public university system over the last three decades without commensurate increase in budgetary allocations for general and higher education.
While the quality of education either stagnated or declined, successive governments continued to absorb university graduates into state institutions to fill non-existent jobs. Almost random deployment of new recruits in diverse state institutions without any training or preparation not only did not contribute to their performance and productivity but also created a demoralised and frustrated youthful workforce.
Public finances
The stagnant or even declining state revenue due to diverse reasons coupled with gross mismanagement of public finances deprived many important sectors of adequate resources. The most notable among them have been public transport, health and higher education and research. Neglect of health and public transport has resulted in the stagnation of public transport and health services, forcing many people to find private solutions, making the situation even worse. As regards the neglect of research, consequences have been even more damaging to the economy.
As is well known, both developed as well as developing countries today compete with each other on the strength of their technological capabilities. Countries that invest heavily in R and D usually have an edge over the others because the former can either improve the quality of their export products or introduce new products into the global market. Many East Asian countries have done extremely well in this regard.
Global university rankings put many East Asian universities ahead of the universities in other parts of the non-western world. The same pattern is evident in the registration of patents across the world. Most recent university rankings show that none of the South Asian universities appear in the first hundred universities in Asia, let alone Sri Lankan ones. None of our universities is included even in the first 2000 universities in the world.
As indicated above, it is research and development that enable countries to improve production processes or introduce new products into the market. So, it is critically important to invest in R and D. Since there are no large industrial firms in Sri Lanka with their own infrastructure for research, public financing of research is indispensable. Yet, governments have not given high priority for research, and the consequences are clear.
One practical way to address the issue would have been to actively pursue joint ventures with overseas firms with high technological capacity. This would have helped the country not only diversify the product mix but also convert raw materials currently exported into finished industrial products. This would have also helped develop our own technological capacity through technology transfer and the development of skills among local employees.
What is outlined above shows the developments challenges we have faced over the years and how we would have overcome them by adopting strategies that have worked in other countries. But, what had been missing in the case of Sri Lanka has been the absence of an enlightened political elite.
Our political leaders have been either extremely inward looking, confined to their close social circles in Colombo, reproducing themselves through exchange of favours and sharing the social surplus produced by hapless masses through corrupt practices or extremely archaic and parochial, making use of backward segments of society to gain and retain power and privilege for them and their retinue while preventing the country from making any progress on any front. What is common to both the elites are corruption and abuse of power.
Rapid economic growth
As a result, neoliberalism that has enabled many countries in the region and elsewhere to promote rapid economic growth has been turned into an extremely corrosive force by one faction of the political elite that thrives on gross inequalities and injustices in society, the other faction has used ethno-nationalism to lead the country on a downward spiral of inter-community discord, corruption, economic stagnation and increasing misery for the vast majority of ordinary people. As a result, today, the country is torn between two powerful but equally negative political forces.
The challenge before the right thinking citizens is to find an alternative path to development, public welfare and national unity, that helps the country to move away from both corrosive neoliberalism and violent ethno-religious nationalism. The future well-being of the ordinary masses will depend on whether the progressive political forces succeed in taking the country on the alternative path mentioned above.
