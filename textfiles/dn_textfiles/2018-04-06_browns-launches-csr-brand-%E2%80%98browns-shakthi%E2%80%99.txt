Browns launches CSR Brand ‘Browns Shakthi’

Brown & Company PLC launched ‘Browns Shakthi’, an integrated CSR brand for the Browns Group. The maiden project under the ‘Browns Shakthi’ initiative was to refurbish Thodamaduwa Vidyalaya in Galenbindunuwewa.
The company prioritized serving education sector at the initial phase and searched for the most deserving schools in remote areas. Thodamaduwa Vidyalaya boasts for a number of zonal accomplishments in volleyball, aesthetics and academics with minimal resources.
‘Browns Shakthi’ could be strength to the current and future students of Thodamaduwa Vidyalayaby fulfilling the immediate needs of the school. The students of the selected school largely descended from the hardworking farming community and labour groups who work for a daily wage.
When the ‘Browns Shakthi’ team initiated the renovation project in Thodamaduwa Vidyalaya in December 2017, the school library was a dilapidated room with a limited number of books and chairs, whereas children mostly read under the tamarind trees. They practiced for volleyball matches in the harsh grounds or paddy fields.
Within four months, the dilapidated room was refurbished into a spacious building with book cupboards, a recommended list of books, chairs and tables while the thorny area in the school premises was cleared, levelled and renovated into a capacious playground.
Separate areas in the ground were marked as a volleyball court and running tracks. ‘BrownsShakthi’ donated football, cricket, netball and athletic equipment to the school as a support to develop the sporting skills of current and future students in the area. While contributing to elevate the living standards of underprivileged communities, Browns has pledged to repay the environment and promote sustainable development by initiating an island-wide tree planting campaign as a part of the ‘Browns Shakthi’ CSR initiative.
Being in existence for 143 years, Brown & Company PLC is one of Sri Lanka’s leading conglomerates in operation today with 50 plus subsidiaries and associates focused on trading and strategic investments.
