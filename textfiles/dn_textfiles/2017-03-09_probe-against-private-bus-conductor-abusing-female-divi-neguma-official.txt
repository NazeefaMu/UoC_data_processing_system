Probe against private bus conductor: For abusing female Divi Neguma official

The Central Province Road Transport Authority has launched an investigation against a conductor of a private bus operating on the Nattaranpotha, Kandy road for allegedly abusing a Woman Deputy Director of the Divi Neguma department who travelled in his bus yesterday, International Womens Day.
This follows a complaint made by Lakshmi Ratnayake, Deputy Director of the Divi Neguma Department in Kandy. She said in her complaint that she boarded this particular bus at Nattaranpotha yesterday morning (March 8) to travel to the Maligawa halt and asked for a ticket. The conductor offered her a ticket for Rs 20 when the actual fare was only Rs 16.
When she pointed out this mistake and asked for the balance Rs 4 due he asked for a rupee coin to offer her a Rs 5 coin.
When she said she had no rupee coin and gave him a two rupee coin the conductor gave her a five rupee coin reprimanding her in abusive language.
Mrs Ratnayake said she felt ashamed at the indignity meted out by the conductor.
