Point of view
Sri Lankan equity market performance continued to remain mixed this week as investors awaited the outcome of the Supreme Court’s judgment on the President’s sudden dissolution of Parliament on November 9th.
The main-share ASPI lost ~43 points at the start of the week ahead of the court ruling, but gained ~36 points during the rest of the week as the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Gazette issued by the President dissolving Parliament was unconstitutional and that the Parliament cannot be dissolved until 4.5 out of its 5-year term is completed.
The week’s mixed performance resulted in the ASPI closing the week ~ 0.1% W-o-W ( or 7 points) lower, but staunchly above the key psychological mark of 6000-points (at 6062.55 points).
Activity levels on the market meanwhile remained in line with that of last week, with average daily turnover at Rs.0.6Bn(relative to 0.6Bn last week), but 22% lower than the YTD average of Rs.0.8Bn.
Local institutions and HNIs accounted for ~38% of total market activity this week (cf. ~42% so far this year), with buying interests focused mainly on Odel (~38% of total crossings), Commercial Bank (~29% of total crossings) and HNB (~11% of total crossings).
Foreign investors meanwhile, continued to sell-off Sri Lankan equities with net selling for the week amounting to Rs.963Mn (cf. Rs.929Mn last week). Although foreign individual investors have recorded a net purchase of Rs.5.4Bn between Jan-Nov’18, foreign institutional investors have off-loaded Sri Lankan equities to the tune of Rs.24.0Bn to bring the total net foreign outflow from domestic equities to Rs.18.5Bn (by Nov’18).
Foreign investors sold a further Rs.1.9Bn in the first two week’s of December, dragging the Colombo bourse’s YTD net foreign selling position to ~Rs.20.4Bn relative to net foreign purchases of 17.7Bn last year.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain influenced by domestic political developments especially the President’s decision on the new cabinet and prime minister.
Robust domestic demand to aid developing Asia
The ADB this week noted that its outlook for global growth has firmed (since its last update in Sep’18 amid the escalating US-China trade conflict) due to the 90-day truce between the two countries as they engage in bilateral negotiations.
The Group added that although this downside risk remains (given the significant policy differences to be reconciled between China and USA), developing Asia continues to “weather the external headwinds” due to robust domestic demand (6.0% in 2018 and 5.8% in 2019)1.

South Asia meanwhile still remains the fastest-growing sub-region in developing Asia, with growth on track to meet its estimate of 7% in 2018 and reach 7.1% in 2019 especially as India maintains its growth momentum on rebounding exports and higher industrial and agricultural output.
ADB noted however that i) tighter credit as the nonbank finance sector experiences stress, ii) limited fiscal space for public capital expenditure, and, iii) escalating trade tensions1 remain downside risks in India although some of these risks could be offset by the recent decline in oil prices and greater export competitiveness as the Indian rupee has weakened 10% since early 2018.
The Group also noted that although GDP growth in Sri Lanka grew by 3.7% in Q2’18 (amid revived private consumption), continued tightening of government current spending, stagnant fixed investment and the recent political uncertainty are likely to dampen Sri Lanka’s short-term growth prospects.
The growth projections for major industrial economies (US, Euro Area and Japan) meanwhile were retained as despite contraction in Japan in Q3, favorable outcomes in the US and the euro area confirm that the major industrial economies are on track to meet growth projections of 2.3% in 2018 and 2.1% in 2019.
