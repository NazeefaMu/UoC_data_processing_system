Kandy SC keep stranglehold on league title

Kandy Sports Club recorded their tenth win in style on Saturday thumping CR & FC 50-15 at the NIttawela grounds to get closer to retaining the Dialog league title for yet another year. Kandy has won all their games convincingly to maintain their stranglehold in the league.
They had a good plan and great preparation, and they played the best rugby.
Kandy went on a romp on hill country’s fine weather from the kick off to beat CR.
The first quarter CR & FC went hard, and matched their opponents play, but from there onwards the match wasn’t that great for the CR & FC that saw too many handling errors, and some shocking kicking resulting in their loss. Kandy’s win set them up for next weekend’s clash with CH & FC.
Kandy started the game at full throttle, attacking from deep and putting pressure on the CR. Every CR mistake they capitalized on, not with anything fancy but simple fundamental skills to put the ball over the line.
Kandy completely dominated the proceedings as they collected their points from 5 goals and 3 tries and CR responded with 1 goal, 1 try and 1 penalty. Having taken a commanding 21-3 lead Kandy had more or less sealed the win by halftime.
Kandy have some quality players and some big ball carriers pretty handy and skillful backs and in the forwards some solid tacklers. They did plenty with the ball. The best fly-half in the country today Fazil Marija continued his excellent play, proving the catalyst for his side’s impressive win.
He controlled distribution and the midfield in equal measure, and then the centers skipper Gayan Weeraratne, Danushka Ranjan, wingers Richard Dharmapala, Danush Dayan and fullback Nigel Ratwatte played with a lot of passion and a lot of heart.
