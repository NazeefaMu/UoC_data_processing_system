SLVBA to host volleyball tournament for tourists

For the first time, Sri Lanka Veterans Volleyball Association (SLVBA) has decided to have a separate volleyball tournament for tourists during their veterans' tournament scheduled to be held in November, in Negombo.
President of the SLVBA, Mervyn Fernandopulle said that several top volleyball players have made requests to organize an event of this nature. “Even hotels have requested us to explore the possibility of hosting an event of this nature.”
He said that November is the peak season for tourists and they would be able to get many foreign teams to compete for which they will have a spate format.
“If we have many teams we will also host a women’s event.”
Fernandopulle, who is also the Chairman of three star class, Palace Hotel Negombo and Airwing Tours and Travels, said that they will also inform the outstation hotels about this event to woo teams from them as well.
