Finest  Shakespearean  insults

English literature's greatest son, William Shakepeare, is credited with play of words that has taught, inspired and delighted people across generations.
While one does admire the beauty of the Shakespearean language, let us not forget the bard's wit in throwing the most amusing and hard-hitting of insults. Here are a few you may be inspired to use in everyday life.
Henry IV Part 1
Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button, not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch—
Macbeth
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got’st thou that goose look?
Henry IV
Away, you scullion! You rampallion! You fustilarian! I'll tickle your catastrophe.
Measure for Measure
Thou art a flesh-monger, a fool and a coward.
All’s Well That Ends Well
A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality.
Macbeth
Go, prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-liver’d boy.
Henry IV Part 1
Thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch!
As You Like It
Your brain is as dry as the remainder biscuit after voyage.
Hamlet
If thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.
Richard III
Thou art unfit for any place but hell.
Henry IV Part 1
Thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch!. indianexpress.com
