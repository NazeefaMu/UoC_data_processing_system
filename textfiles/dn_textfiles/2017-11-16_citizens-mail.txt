Citizens' Mail

My War Heroes
The president rightly said that no war hero should appear before a war tribunal. I applaud him for such a strong statement.
Why should they?
War heroes protect people and put their own lives on the line for good of the country.
War heroes abide by the law and protect civilians.
War heroes do not torture or shoot children.
War heroes do not stand by and let their troop kill and rape at will.
War heroes have nothing to hide.
War heroes do not lie.
War heroes speak the truth, even if that means putting their own lives at risk.
I salute these war heroes; they finally put an end to this long and bloody war.
War criminals on the other hand, are the ones who should appear before the war tribunal.
War criminals killed innocent children and bombed hospitals.
War criminals lined up surrendered people and shot them, because they can.
War criminals made people disappear.
War criminals profited illegally from war and stole from this country.
War criminals try to mingle with war heroes, and hope they would be mistaken for one too. But they won’t. Because the country is going from strength to strength; strengthening our rule of law, strengthening our governance structures and strengthening our standing on the world stage. But we would never be fully free of our past until we’ve faced up to our demons and confronted them. And we will.
