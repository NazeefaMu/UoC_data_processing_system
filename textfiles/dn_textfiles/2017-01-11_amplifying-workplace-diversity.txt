Amplifying workplace diversity

International Parity at Work Day will be observed on January 11 every year, starting January 2017. It champions the value of workplace diversity – inclusive of all genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, physical abilities and ages; and it raises awareness of persistent workplace inequality.
People across the world are creating events to celebrate International Parity at Work Day – and many Sri Lankans are getting involved: whether it is just a chat over tea and cake to explore how you will support someone who is different from you to advance – or a full blown celebration of the difference that people who are different from each other contribute at work.
The largest celebration so far scheduled in Sri Lanka will be held near the Viharamahadevi Park and includes speakers who will share many personal stories, including: how leaders have created excellent performance from cross cultural/multifaith teams; how young ambitious people have got themselves noticed so that they could progress at the rate of their talent rather than have to ‘wait their turn’; and how men struggle to succeed in female dominated professions – demonstrating that the gender challenge is not limited only to women.
Organisations and individuals interested in holding an event can publicise and share photographs/videos of their celebration on social media by using the hashtag #ParityDay whereby their celebration be reposted and acknowledged on the International Parity at Work Day official pages.
The inaugural Day will also be celebrated in London at the iconic Cheesegrater building, and with businesses and communities around the world holding individual events to show their support for workplace parity.
This year’s International Parity at Work Day also sees the launch of The Parity Pioneers Movement, initiated by a group of global professionals who seek to unleash world-class performance by amplifying the value of workplace diversity through leadership and cultural development.
In an increasingly volatile, uncertain complex and ambiguous world, organizational diversity increases long-term business resilience – and yet workplace disparity remains a critical global challenge. The Equality and Human Rights Commission found that progress on gender equality is “grinding to halt”1; Strikingly, too, sectors that are successful at promoting women to senior positions are not doing the same for minorities - and vice versa. The World Economic Forum currently estimates that economic parity between the sexes will take 170 years to achieve after a continuous and dramatic slowdown in progress.
Ishreen Bradley - founder of the Parity Pioneers Movement, commenting on the importance of parity at work, says “now more than ever – in this tough operating environment, it is essential to support individuals and organisations to overcome engrained cultural and institutional barriers to parity,” said The Parity Pioneers Movement in a press release.
The Parity Pioneers Movement aims to accelerate the realisation of brilliance and performance through inclusion and difference - catalysing world-leading performance by maximising the value of difference.
