CEB unions strike today?

The Ceylon Electricity Board trade unions are to commence an island-wide strike from today, claiming that they were assaulted at the CEB headquarters by the Police.
The Special Task Force and the Police rescued several high-ranking Ceylon Electricity Board officials, including its Chairman, who were detained by the CEB Trade Union members at the CEB head office, yesterday.
“Following the rescue operation, there was a clash between the Police and the trade union activists,” sources said. The Trade Union (TU) action follows the clash between the TU members and the Police, where the former claims that they were assaulted by the Police.
According to sources, the CEB high-ranking officials were detained by the trade union members alleging that the CEB has neglected to pay the salary increment to employees.
Meanwhile, Power and Energy Ministry spokesman Sulakshana Jayawardena said the ministry would take steps to provide an uninterrupted power supply.
