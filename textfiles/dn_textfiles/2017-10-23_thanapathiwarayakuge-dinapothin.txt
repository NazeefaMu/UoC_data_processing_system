Thanapathiwarayakuge Dinapothin

Senior Diplomat Ranjith Gunaratna recently came out with his book Thanapathiwarayakuge Dinapothin (Ambassador’s Diary), which compiles several stories based on his experiences as a long-serving diplomat. The book written in Sinhala compiles stories about people from all walks of life; whom Gunaratna had acquainted during his 25 years of service as a diplomat. Gunaratna has held key positions in a number of Sri Lankan foreign missions during his career. He currently serves as the Consul General at the Sri Lankan Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany.
Excerpts follow:
Q: This is a rare publication, in the sense that not many Sri Lankan diplomats have penned their experiences while working at foreign missions. Was there any specific purpose or aim behind your effort?
A: In general, diplomats write various reports, analyses and memos during their career. Yet, their personal experiences abroad do not reflect in these official documents. In comparison to the diplomats of other countries, Sri Lankan diplomats rarely discuss about their experiences. My new book, 'Ambassador’s Diary,' is aimed at filling this vacuum. It is based on my experiences in the 25 years of career as a diplomat. The stories are about people from all walks of life; whom I have had acquaintances. The stories reflect my journey across the western societies dominated by liberal thinking, Asian societies that espouse Asian values and Middle East societies that are based on Islamic way of thinking. Amidst this cultural confusion, I found ingredients for the stories.
Q: You may have met many foreign leaders during your long career as a diplomat. Who are the ones who impressed you most?
A: Countless men and women influenced my career. Among them, I highly admire Lee Kwan Yew, whose vision, dedication and commitments paved the way for the emergence of the modern Singapore. One can have certain criticisms about his style of governing. Yet, if you compare Singapore in 1950s to present, you would certainly feel admiring Lee. Other than him, I always have a high regard for Japanese leaders. We can learn a lot from Japan. Unfortunately, most of our politicians are groping in the dark as they lack a clear vision. This is one reason for me to write this book as it would help them to understand the world beyond their political domain.
Q: You seem to be highly impressed by Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore. What prompted you to translate into Sinhala the book on Yew and Singapore’s rise under his rule?
A: I was able to impress him on my idea of translating the book when I met him at a conference. The book depicts Lee's strategies and approaches to each challenge he faced in the nation building process. Although there are different views about some strategies adopted by Lee Kwan Yew, we can still agree with many of his actions. Politically, Lee tried to foster a Southeast Asian identity instead of a Chinese identity in Singapore. Lee Kwan Yew's 'The Singapore Story' helps us to understand Singapore's political culture in general and many government policies in particular. Overall, as a multi-ethnic country, Sri Lanka could learn a lot on nation building in Singapore. This is one of the main reasons for me to translate this remarkable book.
Q: In Your book you highlight the challenges faced by Sri Lankan migrant workers. What steps you recommend to ensure enhanced security, welfare and living standards for them while working abroad.
A: According to my experience, they encounter social issues and work place related issues. However, they have no control over the work place related issues such as sexual, physical and verbal abuses, denial of basic facilities, non-payment or under payment of salaries, long working hours, inability to return to Sri Lanka on completion of contract, restrictions on freedom of movement and communication with the relatives, denial of compensation for work place related accident and physical aggression. In addition, they are also victims of human smuggling, forced labour, forced prostitution, racial discrimination, inequality, arbitrary treatments by the authorities and crimes. In this context, Sri Lanka needs to work with the respective labour receiving countries to address these issues collectively.
Q: Do you think the government should ban sending Sri Lankan women to work as domestic workers abroad?
A: India has imposed a ban. However, banning of Sri Lankan women seeking employment as domestic workers is not a solution to the problems. They leave due to lack of opportunities in Sri Lanka. We can talk about a ban when they have other alternatives in Sri Lanka. For that Sri Lankan system is not yet ready. Sri Lanka seeks to address these issues within the existing system and with the cooperation of the labour-receiving countries while gradually opening new vistas of opportunities for them in the country.
Q: In your book you highlight several instances of unethical and unnecessary interference or influence by politicians or those affiliated to them in the work at foreign missions?
A: In Sri Lanka, today, political interference is a cultural phenomenon. Political interference occurs in two situations. The first situation prevails when the system does not function properly and people are suffering as a result. For this, bureaucrats are responsible. The second scenario occurs when politicians attempt to manipulate the system for their gains. However, undue political interference always creates unpleasant environment. Such interferences affect smooth functioning of Sri Lankan missions too. We are always looking forward to working without any undue political interference. Yet, Sri Lankan is not yet ready to move forward without political maneuvering.
Q: what are your views on non-career diplomats being appointed for high posts at Sri Lankan foreign missions?
A: Most countries appoint non-career diplomats. This is the policy of the Sri Lankan governments too. We have seen great Sri Lankan non-career envoys in the past. Some of them have performed better than career diplomats. However, I personally think there is no problem appointing a few “suitable” political appointees. The question is about their suitability.
Q: Can you describe your experiences related to the activities of the Pro-LTTE lobby in foreign countries?
A: LTTE has always been lobbying in the foreign countries against Sri Lanka. Our missions have been able to respond to their propaganda very effectively occasionally with some drawbacks.
I have always worked with the Sri Lankan diaspora to respond to the LTTE. Support of the Sri Lankan diaspora was vital in this exercise. I believe that Sri Lankan diplomats need to work very closely with the Sri Lankan diaspora to garner their support to protect and promote Sri Lankan interests abroad.
Q: The positives and negatives you see in Sri Lanka’s Foreign Service and suggestions for improvement?
A: Diplomacy is a highly sophisticated subject. If we are not updated with the current knowledge on this subject, we cannot perform effectively.
Most of our diplomats do not pay much attention to professionality.
We need to be equipped ourselves with necessary tools, knowledge and skilled required to perform in the digitally tuned world. Question is, do we have these in our hands?
Q: Are you planning for any new publications in the future?
A: At present, I am working on an English short story book to be published internationally. I am also conducting a research on Sri Lankan diaspora.
This study mainly explores the nexus between Sri Lankan diaspora and economic development in Sri Lanka and the diaspora’s relations with the state, political entities, and a border spectrum of the Sri Lankan society through economic, political, social, cultural and virtual activities.
It is also aimed at understanding its impact on Sri Lanka as an agent of change and the future of State-diaspora relations in the context of globalization. My plan is to produce an ably researched publication on Sri Lankan diaspora in English and Sinhala languages.
