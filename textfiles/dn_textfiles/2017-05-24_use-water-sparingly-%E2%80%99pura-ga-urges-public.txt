Use water sparingly, A’pura GA urges public

The Anuradhapura Government Agent had urged the public to use drinking water only for drinking and cooking purposes in view of the prevailing drought.
Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka told the Daily News that the water levels of the Nuwara Wewa, Tissa Wewa and Thuruwila tank which supply drinking water to around 300,000 people have been decreasing drastically.
He pointed out that around 40,000 cubic metres of water are filtered and distributed to the public per day from the tank trio. He appealed to the people to start using the abandoned deep wells and existing tube wells for routine domestic washing purposes including watering the gardens etc.
Wanninayaka said around Rs. one million is spent daily for water purification by the Water Supply and Drainage Board (WSDB).
The Government Agent and the WSDB have requested the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to issue a few water turns from Mahaweli to Tissa Wewa, Nuwara Wewa and Thuruwila tank in view of the national Poson religious celebrations which would attract around one million devotees to Anuradhapura.
