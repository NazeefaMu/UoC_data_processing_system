Coaching clinics in Lawn Ball

The sport of Lawn Ball which was introduced to Sri Lanka recently is immensely popular in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Malaysia and Singapore.
Lawn Ball is a sport played by people from all age groups and a lawn ball venue will be set up at Nattandiya in January 2018. Lawn Ball teams from Singapore and Germany will tour Sri Lanka in January and February 2018 to play against Sri Lanka teams
The Lawn Ball Association of Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Ministry of Sports will conduct a coaching clinic for Sri Lankans who are keen in learning to play Lawn Ball.
A university student from Aachen Germany Nastassja Berwing is giving her maximum support to the Lawn Ball Association to make this project a success.
