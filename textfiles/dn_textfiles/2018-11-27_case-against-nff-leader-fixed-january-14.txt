Case against NFF leader fixed for January 14

A corruption case filed against National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa was yesterday fixed for January 14 by the Colombo High Court.
The defence was allowed to access with computer evidence pertaining to several documents listed in the indictments.
The Bribery Commission Director General had filed indictments against Wimal Weerawansa for the alleged unlawful acquisition of money and assets, estimated at Rs.75 million within a period of six years while serving as a Minister, during the former regime.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets between January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2014.
The indictments were filed under 39 incidents based on monitory and property transactions estimated at Rs.75 million.
The Director General alleged that the former Minister had unlawfully made 26 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased lands and vehicles in contravention of section 23(a) of the Bribery Act. The Bribery Commission’s Director General further alleged that former Minister Weerawansa had owned these properties-deemed under the provision of the Act to be property acquired through bribery.
