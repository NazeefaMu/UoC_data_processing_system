Tickets sold out for cricketers gala reception in Australia

Tickets for the charity Gala dinner hosted by Sri Lanka Cricket to facilitate the Sri Lankan cricket team in Australia have been sold out according to the organizers.
The proceeds from the ticket sales are for the ‘Cricket Aid’ initiative, which is Sri Lanka Cricket’s only charitable arm.
The team and well-wishers will be hosted to a grand reception on Saturday February 18 from 6:30pm onwards at Cathies Lane Wantirna, South Victoria.
At the reception well-wishers will also be afforded the opportunity of taking photographs with their favourite cricketers.
The national team will be leaving for Australia on February 13 to play a series of three T20 Internationals.
