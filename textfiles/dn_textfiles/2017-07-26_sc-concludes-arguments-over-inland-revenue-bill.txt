SC concludes arguments over Inland Revenue Bill

The Supreme Court yesterday concluded arguments put forward in support and against the bill titled “Inland Revenue Bill” and all parties in the petitions were directed to file their written submissions forthwith.
Later on, the Supreme Court’s determination over the proposed bill is to be communicated to the Speaker. The Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Anil Goonaratne and Justice Nalin Perera.
Ten petitioners including MP Bandula Gunawardane and Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Secretary Amal Randeniya are seeking a declaration that bill shall become law only through a two-third majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
However, the Attorney General had informed Supreme Court that several amendments are to be brought to proposed Inland Revenue Bill at the committee stage of the Parliament.
President’s Counsel Nigel Hatch with Romesh De Silva PC, Sanjeewa Jayawardane PC, Manohara De Silva PC and Senior Counsel Canishka Witharana appeared for the petitioners.
Additional Solicitor General Farzana Jameel with Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obesekera and Senior State Counsel Suren Gnanaraj appeared for the Attorney General.
