Graduates to fill public sector vacancies

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed all ministries to inform him about the number of vacancies that exist so that they could be filled by graduates, said Education Minister and Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, who is also the newly appointed General Secretary of the UNP.
The Prime Minister intends to fill all such vacancies within the next three months. Vacancies for graduates in all government departments, ministries, semi-government firms and statuary boards will be filled with qualified graduates who are now unemployed. All existing vacancies for graduates in all administrative districts in the island, including the North and the East, will be filled within the next three months, the minister said.
