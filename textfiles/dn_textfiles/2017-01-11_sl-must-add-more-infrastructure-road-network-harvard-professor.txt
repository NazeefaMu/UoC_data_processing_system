SL must add more infrastructure to road network - Harvard Professor

Sri Lanka should try to add more infrastructure to its road network and other areas, Harvard University economist, Prof. Ricardo Hausmann said.
Speaking to corporate leaders and several ministers at the BMICH on Monday he said the classic example is some of the high end tourist hotels in Kuchchaveli.
“They are of high quality but unfortunately it takes seven hours to get there.”
“This is not a practical for a tourist”
