Stay inside; there’s nothing outside..!

As more rapes, lynchings and murders take place and India, becomes more unsafe, one wonders whether there is a larger conspiracy as this humorous thought entered my head. Though sometimes it isn’t always humour is it?
“Terrible! Terrible!” shouted a senior official of the government, “We can’t implement any projects without people complaining! The bullet trainis in a controversy because commuters want to first make the existing railways safe!We can’t build metros in the cities, because people say buildings are shaking!”
“And sir,” said his junior, “In Mumbai, they don’t want the metro to run under a Fire temple because it will upset the magnetic waves! Another line has activists fighting against trees being cut!””
“Trees, people, temples! All are conspiring against us and at this rate we will not have anything ready by 2019!”
“Is that an auspicious year sir?” asked his junior.
“That’s election year dammit, and if we can’t show bullet trains, roads and metros, we are doomed!”
“Maybe we should think different sir!” said his junior.
“How different?” sighed the senior government official, “People want to travel, we have nothing to offer them! Not even river transport!”
“Let them stay at home sir!” said his junior.
“Stay at home?” asked his senior, “You want the whole country to stay at home?”
“Yes sir, if they stay at home they will not want new means of going from place to place!”
“But why should they stay at home dammit?”
“Because it’s unsafe outside!” exclaimed his junior with a smile, “It is so unsafe, people will be afraid to come out!”
“So what you are saying,” saidhis senior slowly, “Is to create such tension outside that people won’t venture out and won’t realize we’ve not made any progress?”
His junior nodded brightly, “We encourage murders, rapes, stone throwing and all sorts of violence outside. We make it unsafe for women, have gangs strip them for love jihaad, kill journalists, and sir soon doors will be locked and boarded with everybody safe and immobile inside!”
The senior officialnodded smugly, “You know something, that’s exactly the situation in the country now, there’s anger, rage, communal tension and fear! Give me the phone please!”
The junior officer handed the phone to his senior obediently, then heard him telling all departments to stop work. “And to win the elections,” continued the junior, “We could have hourlytalks by the PM to keep people glued to new promises, which anyway they will never venture out to see if implemented or not!”
His senior shook his head in wonder, patted his junior on the shoulder and decided to transfer the young fellow to a remote area, before the junior had aspirations of taking over his job..! [email protected]
