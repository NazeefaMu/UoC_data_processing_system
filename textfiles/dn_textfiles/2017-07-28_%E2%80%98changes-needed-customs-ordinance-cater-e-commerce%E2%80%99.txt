‘Changes needed in Customs Ordinance to cater to e-commerce’

Sri Lanka Shippers’ Council Past Chairman, Sean Van Dort urged the need to bring in necessary changes to the Customs Ordinance on e-commerce to better reap emerging benefits from the shipping and logistics industry.
Lashing out at successive governments over the last 30 years for their inability to take swift measures to address issues relating to the shipping and logistics industry, Van Dort said, “From a logistics industry point of view, we haven’t even touched e-commerce, which is a US$ 3 trillion industry.”
He made these views while speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 held in Colombo, this week.
“Nobody has looked at our concerns; there is no think tank in the government to identify the emerging trends, innovations in the industry or to appoint a target-oriented team to see how we can benefit from e-commerce.”
“The present consumer wants e-commerce; he wants his products faster. How can local businessmen provide a service to a manufacturer or an industry with three-star rules requiring five-star services?” he queried.
Commenting on Sri Lanka’s excellent geographical location, Van Dort claimed that the country is not geared to tap true potential since it has not even touched the potential of its excellent geographical potential to achieve its set economic targets.
