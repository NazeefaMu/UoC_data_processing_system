Law enforcement authorities called to act

Violence, hate speech against religious and ethnic groups:
The Cabinet of Ministers directed the law enforcement authorities and the Attorney General to take action against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech against religious and ethnic groups.
The Cabinet of Ministers issuing a statement yesterday said the National Unity Government, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena reaffirm commitment, in accordance with the mandates received at the Presidential election in January and Parliamentary election of August 2015, to ensure that the country never again returns to a conflict-ridden situation.
The statement adds: "The government resolves to guide the nation towards reconciliation, sustainable peace, and economic progress. Communal, ethnic and religious hatred and violence and impunity have no place in the society that we strive to build.
"We are concerned by the recent incidents of violence targeting places of religious worship, shops and business enterprises and houses. We denounce in the strongest terms, these acts of violence and hatred, including incidents of hate speech by certain individuals and groups aimed at inciting violence against the different ethnic and religious communities in the country.
"We are saddened by the destruction of property and loss of livelihoods as a result of recent incidents and the pain of mind and fear caused to individuals.
"We affirm that hate filled expressions and actions by individuals and groups with vested interests, resulting in demeaning, denigrating and inciting violence against fellow citizens of various ethnic, religious backgrounds have no place in Sri Lankan society.
"While reaffirming the government’s commitment to reconciliation, peace building, peaceful co-existence and the rule of law, we direct the law enforcement authorities to take steps in accordance with the law of the land, against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech targeting any religious and ethnic group in the country. The strictest action must be taken without delay, in accordance with the law, against persons or groups who act to incite violence and engage in acts of violence. The law must be applied to all regardless of social status, ethnic or religious background or political affiliations of perpetrators of such acts.
"We direct the law enforcement authorities and the Attorney General to expedite action against those responsible for atrocities committed, as impunity holds the possibility of the country receding into conflict.
"We express our deep appreciation to civil society and religious leaders who have stepped up to counter the attempts of a few to spread hate in the country, and who have called for calm and peaceful co-existence.
"We take this opportunity to urge the participation and leadership of Sri Lankans in efforts aimed at reconciliation and fostering peaceful co-existence in the country, without which, the stability and economic growth and progress that the nation deserves will continue to elude us.
"Gautama Buddha’s teachings emphasise the importance of co-existence, tolerance, respect and compassion. This nation is blessed by the teachings of the four great religious traditions in the world – Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam – which provide us the guidance for peaceful co-existence, upholding human values and honest and hard work required to rebuild the nation as one of the most progressive in the region.
"We urge citizens, young and old, to contribute their best to the country as patriotic citizens to build a nation that is stable, peaceful and progressive; a society where the dignity of each individual is upheld; where diversity is respected; and where every individual has the opportunity to enjoy the freedoms that are the rights of equal citizenship.
"We must stand united to strive to eliminate the affliction of hatred towards each other, and resolve that we will never allow ourselves to once again be dragged into conflict as in the past."
