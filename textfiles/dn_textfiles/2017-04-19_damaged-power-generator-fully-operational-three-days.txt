Damaged power generator fully operational in three days

The undergoing repairs of the generator will be finished within the next three days, Power and Energy Ministry Spokesman said.
The power generator in the third stage of the Norochcholai Coal Power Station, which was closed for maintenance for the last nine months, will be added to the national grid from today, he said. He said it will add 300MW to the national grid.
The boiler of the power generator in the first stage of the Norochcholai Coal Power had an air leak and it is now being repaired following its breakdown on Monday. The leak has cost a 300MW loss to the national grid.
The breakdown happened on Monday, but technical team could not reach the boiler for the maintenance due to its high temperature.
Since the power generation under the second stage can also provide a 300MW to the national grid, the CEB will be able to provide power uninterruptedly round the clock, the spokesman said.
