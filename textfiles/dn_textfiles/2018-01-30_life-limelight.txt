Life in the limelight

Symphony Orchestra – Life & Life Composer and Conductor Maestro, Vajira Indika Karunasena did not speak a word on stage. Not a word. Not for him is the limelight. He is completely immersed in his music. Music is his life, it is his calling. It gives his life such powerful meaning. For him, music is his way of understanding the universe. Music is his way of communicating the wordless knowledge within his soul. Music is his language.
He is a man with many achievements. Yet not a word of it! He wanted music to be the center of attention. Not him.
How do I know this? You can tell a lot about a man by just listening to the music he makes. And the most wondrous thing is every single person in that audience interpreted the evening differently. That is how thought provoking the evening was. What I understood may not have been what the person next to me understood. That is the mystery and the pleasure of music. It morphs into many things in our minds.
Of course apart from what it meant to all of us, one has to credit the musicians on stage with him. It was a well- greased machine. And in the midst of it all was Karunasena on stage, frantically waving his hands, a wiry, short individual looking intently at his fellow musicians. No doubt they knew their business.
The music was pulsating and had a hypnotic influence on us. Images flickered through my mind as the music spoke to my heart, as if I was on the couch next to a practitioner of hypnosis. It was as if an invisible hand delved into my mind and perused my thoughts.

All in all it was an enjoyable evening. No surprises as such. Not a concert which was very different from other concerts or exceptional. It was a nice concert and a pleasant evening. It was in the end a celebration of music by a talented maestro. With a flick of his wrists he made such beautiful music.
Symphony Orchestra – Life & Life was held on January 20 at the Lionel Wendt.
