Countrywide programme to control dengue

A countrywide dengue control programme will take place from March 29 to April 4 under the direction of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. This mosquito control programme will focus on destroying all dengue mosquito breeding grounds located everywhere in order to control the increasing number of dengue cases, Health Ministry sources said.
According to sources, around 3,000 teams will take part in the National Mosquito Control week. Presidential Task Force members and health officers from the Health Ministry will be included in the teams. Entomology studies have revealed that schools, construction sites, religious institutions etc harbour most of the dengue mosquito breeding sites.
According to the Epidemiology Unit sources, 40 dengue deaths and 24,562 dengue patients had been reported during this year from all parts of the country. Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Baticaloa, Trincomalee, Jaffna, Kalmunai, Ratnapura and Kegalle districts have been declared as high risk districts.
Prompt medical treatment should be sought from a state hospital or from a qualified doctor if anyone has fever more than two days. No drugs other than Paracetamol should be used to control fever, the source added.
