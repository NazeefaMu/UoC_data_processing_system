Ceylon Waste Management wins Green World Environment Award

Ceylon Waste Management (Pvt) Ltd. (CWM), the pioneer in e-waste management in Sri Lanka has won a Green World Environment Award in the international campaign to find the world’s greenest countries, companies and communities.
CWM was honoured with a Global Gold Award for its work in e-waste, in the Wastes Management category, and also awarded the Green World Ambassador 2018, by The Green Organisation, UK.
Competing against more than 500 other nominations in the Green World Awards for Environmental Best Practice, CWM was presented the trophy and certificate at a presentation in Ankara, Turkey on September 17, 2018, hosted by the Republic of Turkey, Ministry of Environment and Urbanisation.
CWM’s winning paper will be published in The Green Book, the leading international work of reference on environmental best practice, so that others around the world can follow their example and learn from their achievement.
The awards are organised by The Green Organisation, an international, independent, non-political, non-profit environment group dedicated to recognising, rewarding and promoting environmental best practice around the world.
They are supported by the Environment Agency, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, the Chartered Institution for Wastes Management and other independent bodies.
“This award marks yet another victory in our quest to be the leading provider of e-waste handling solutions in the region. Being globally recognised is not only an honour for us as a company but also brings Sri Lanka into focus as being able to provide internationally accepted and accredited solutions”, said Sudesh Nandasiri, Chairman of Ceylon Waste Management (Pvt) Ltd.
The award follows CWM receiving the Green Apple Award 2017, awarded at the Palace of Westminster, London, UK by the Green Organisation last year.
CWM’s standing was further enhanced with the Gold Award - Winner for Best Financial Performance & Business Operation of 2017 in Medium Category Enterprises, and the Gold Award = Winner for Manufacturing Sector (Non-traditional) at the National Business Excellence Award 2017, Sri Lanka.
Previous awards won by CWM include the International Diamond Prize for Excellence in Quality 2015, from the European Society for Quality Research, headquartered in Switzerland, which is held to recognise companies with superior development efforts and overall excellence, which are most committed to economic progress, both for them and their communities as a whole, and The Platinum Technology Award for Quality & Best Trade Name at the Green Era Awards 2014, held by the Otherways Management Association Club (OMAC), Paris, France, which is an award designed to recognise true global sustainable examples of companies that have shown green practices in their performances.
Established in 2010, Ceylon Waste Management (Pvt) Ltd. is the only Board of Investment (BOI) approved e-waste recycling entity in Sri Lanka. In keeping with continuous innovation and investment into R&D, the company launched its second e-waste processing factory at Kelaniya in July this year, while an R&D center for Industrial Waste materials was opened at Kochchikade in Wennappuwa.
