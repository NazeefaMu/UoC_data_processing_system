Govt. ready to take up any challenge against UNP

If the UNP was ready to try their luck at an election, then the current government was ready too and both parties could agree and come to a decision, said the Public Administration, Home Affairs and Justice Minister Susil Premajayantha.
“Otherwise when Parliament is convened on the 14th, we will show the majority and are confident of it. At yesterday’s group meeting, the President and Prime Minister stressed that as a government with the cooperation of Parliament, we would forge ahead. The President would not go back on his decision for sure,” he said.
He pointed out that if the President and the Prime Minister could not sit at one table and take policy decisions together, then the country would go into chaos. But today, the President has appointed a Prime Minister that he could work with and together, the government would bring the country back to the path of prosperity. “We have the support of the majority of the people which had been displayed clearly,” he said with confidence.
On the issue of the 19th Amendment, he said that it was not endorsed by a referendum, but only a 2/3rd majority in Parliament. “Now the UNP is going crying to the International Community seeking their support. But while they do so, we have taken oaths and immediately commenced our work.”
When asked when the new government intends to hold Provincial Council elections, he assured that within a period of 2-3 months Provincial Council elections would be held and prove what true democracy was. “We are currently making all the arrangements for that. The previous government failed to hold PC elections due to their inability. But we have the ability and we are not afraid,” he said, adding that if they are unable to do it under the new system, the PC elections would be held under the old system. No matter what, he assured that the elections would be held within the next 2-3 months.
“During the past, the country was plunged into a crisis on several instances. I must say clearly, that even after the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the Executive Presidency still holds the power to allocate the ministries to ministers. The previous regime have been trying to indicate to the International Community that Parliamentary activities are being carried out according to the Westminster structure. But, it is their own president, J. R. Jayewardena who changed that in 1978. Through the 19th Amendment, all that happened was a minor reduction of those powers. Many legal experts have expressed their views in this regard.”
Premajayantha noted that the President was still the head of State, Government and the Cabinet. “The President still has one year and two months left in his term until January 2020. Hence, if the President was unable to work with Ranil Wickremesinghe for the remainder of his term and there was no policy compatibility, then what was his option? In fact, he had made several requests to other leaders in the UNP, but they had turned a deaf ear,” he said, adding that he had no other option, but to go to the next best option.
“When the Cabinet is dissolved, then the President holds all relevant subjects under him and distributes these subjects by appointing Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers in accordance with provisions of the Constitution.
