Hemas provides drinking water  to schoolchildren in NCP

Clogard, the flagship product of Hemas Manufacturing, initiated on a novel campaign to provide underprivileged children with a heavy metal water filter fulfilling a vital need for healthy living. This CSR initiative was instigated by Clogard Fresh Blast Gel.
Hemas Manufacturing is the first Sri Lankan company to produce a gel toothpaste; Clogard Fresh Blast Gel manufactured with a combination of natural ingredients and opta zinc technology to fight germs providing long lasting fresh breath. Young people especially, seek the confidence that fresh breath provides, enabling them to interact closely and speak with people of all ages.
The Clogard Fresh Blast Gel team visited a small school in North Central Province (NCP) and witnessed the debilitating situation caused by dental fluorosis due to contaminated drinking water.
Prior to the installation of the water filer, residents faced severe hardships in accessing drinking water and having to pay for clean drinking water. However, to cook and clean they continued to use contaminated water resulting in irreparable dental issues.
“Clogard Fresh Blast Gel wanted to reach out to these children to do what we can do to mitigate the damage done, especially to encourage school children to brush with a fluoridated toothpaste to help strengthen their tooth enamel, preventing tooth decay,” said Shanadi Liyanage, Assistant Brand Manager, Oral Care Hemas Manufacturing.
Clogard Fresh Blast Gels’ campaign invited the public to get involved to wish these children by embracing values of ‘saying it fresh’ by submitting wishes to a booth located at Majestic City.
The inauguration ceremony was held recently at the school attended by several provincial officials, school officials, students, parents and well-wishers.
Clogard Fresh Blast Gel also conducted a free dental clinic via its mobile dental truck. The children received advice including the importance of brushing and inculcating dental hygiene.
