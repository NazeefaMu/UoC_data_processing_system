Operation to nab litterbugs

A special operation will be conducted to take into custody residents in Ingiriya, Moragahahena, Pokunuwita and Gonapala who dump garbage haphazardly on the roads at night, Horana Pradeseeya Sabha Chairman Asoka Ranatunge said. It is expected to seek the co-operation of PHIs for this operation through the relevant MOH offices. Unauthorised littering of garbage on the roadsides has become an environmental issue in the area, he said.
