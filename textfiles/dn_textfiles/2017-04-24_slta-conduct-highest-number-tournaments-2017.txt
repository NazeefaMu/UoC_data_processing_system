SLTA to conduct highest number of tournaments for 2017

The Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) boasts that they will conduct the highest number of annual tournaments during their 100-year history in 2017, including over 20 tournaments in the under-10 category.
The SLTA will host a tournament once in three weeks throughout the year, creating competition opportunities to the age category that has shown an unprecedented high volume in recruiting to the sport. This was revealed to the media during a discussion at the SLTA where the national governing body announced its annual tournament calendar and clarified questions raised by the media.
The SLTA vice president Sohan Patrick said that over 15,000 U-10 kids are playing tennis island-wide and participation at national level under-10 tournaments exceeds 1200.
“The popular junior programme, ‘Mini Tennis’ has been re-branded as ‘Cool Tennis’ and proved to be a resounding success,” said Patrick.
“Grass root level tennis at outstations has shown great progress. Tournaments will be conducted in Jaffna (Dec. 8-10), Negombo (July 7-9), Batticaloa (April 28-30), Kurunegala (Aug. 15-18) and Kandy (Aug. 25-27) and about 15 new courts have been set up in the outstations during the past two years,” he said.
“The enthusiasm in parents, kids and outstation schools are very encouraging. But unfortunately we experienced a big drop out in the age categories U-14 and U-16, so a lesser number of players continue in the U-18 and beyond.”
Speaking further, Patrick stated, “There are lots of international tournaments for U-12, U-14, U16 and U-18 age categories. Around 35 Lankan juniors annually participate in these tournaments. International exposure is very important and at present 6 to 7 Lankan juniors are doing well overseas. We have Adithya Karunaratne who reached U-18 world 250 rank recently, training in Spain. We hope she will qualify to play in Wimbledon. Avindra Perera is also one our future hope.”
SLTA will host 12 international tournaments including three men’s Future series (June19-July 9), three women’s Future series (Oct. 2-22), two ATF U-14 (Oct. 30- Nov.12) and most importantly the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group III (July 17-22) in Colombo this year. Ending a continuous five-year stint in the Davis Cup Group II, last year Sri Lanka was relegated to Group III, but SLTA has high hopes this year that our players will prosper on home advantage to bounce back to Group II. Nine teams namely Jordan, Malaysia, Pacific Oceania, Qatar, UAE, Syria, Turkmenistan, Lebanon and host Sri Lanka will battle in two groups where the top two teams of each group will play off to determine the two teams to enter Group II. The Lankan team for the Davis Cup will be selected before end of May.
The 7 hard courts at the SLTA will be renovated after the completion of the 2017 tournament calendar at a cost of nearly 35million, so the top international events can be hosted.
