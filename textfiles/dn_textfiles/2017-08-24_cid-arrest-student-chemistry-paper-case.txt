cid arrest student in chemistry paper case

Police spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said a student was arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) for allegedly distributing the controversial Advanced Level Chemistry exam paper via an electronic device.
Gunasekara said that the student is from a school in the Colombo area. The spokesman also said that the student has circulated the exam paper only after receiving it at the examination.
Gampaha Police on Monday arrested a computer operator who had computerised a Chemistry paper, similar to the Advanced Level Chemistry second paper. The suspect had computerised the paper on the instruction of a tuition master.
