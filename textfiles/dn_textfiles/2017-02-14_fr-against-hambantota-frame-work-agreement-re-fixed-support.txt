FR against Hambantota frame work agreement re-fixed for support

The Fundamental Rights petition filed by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara seeking an order to quash the Framework Agreement entered into by the government with two Chinese companies, was yesterday re-fixed for support on February 13 by the Supreme Court. When the petition came up before the three-judge-bench comprising Justice Priyasad Dep, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Anil Goonaratne, counsel appeared on behalf of the petitioner sought a further date to support the petition.
The petitioner cited members of the Cabinet of Ministers, members of the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (referred to as the CANC and also sometimes referred to as the Committee of Secretaries), the Director General of the External Resources Department of the National Polices and Economic Affairs Ministry, the Ports Authority, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited and China Communications Constructions Company as respondents.
The Petitioner states that the petition relates inter alia to the infringement and imminent infringement and continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution, by the arbitrary, capricious, mala fide and illegal and unlawful decision of the respondents to enter into an agreement with the People’s Republic of China for the promotion of investment in Sri Lanka by Chinese investors and lease and convey and enter into an agreement or in any other manner dispose about 15,000 acres of land and/or 50 Square kilometers.
The petitioner further sought a Declaration that the Framework Agreement dated December 8, 2016 as null and void, and declare that the agreement has no force of law until it is approved by Parliament, as required by Article 157 of the Constitution.
