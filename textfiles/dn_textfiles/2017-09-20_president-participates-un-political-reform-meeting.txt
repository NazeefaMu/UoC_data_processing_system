President participates in UN political reform meeting

President Maithripala Sirisena and several world leaders participated in the United Nations Political Reform High Level Event at the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) chamber at the UN General Assembly building on Monday.
This event was held under the patronage of US President Donald Trump and it was followed by a participants' photograph.This ECOSOC Session focused specifically on how the Council can further support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
US President Donald Trump gave his first speech to the United Nations on Monday morning, during a panel on reforming the organization.“In recent years, the United Nations has not reached its full potential because of bureaucracy and mismanagement, President Trump said.
“We encourage the secretary general to fully use his authority to cut through the bureaucracy, reform outdated systems, and make firm decisions to advance the UN’s core mission.”
“The United Nations was founded on truly noble goals,” he said. “The United Nations has helped advance these goals in so many ways: feeding the hungry, providing disaster relief, and empowering women and girls in many societies all across the world.”
As the high-level week of the United Nations General Assembly gets underway, Secretary-General António Guterres stressed the role of the UN to help reshape “unproductive and unrewarding” finance and redirect investment to creating a better world for all.
“The choices we make on finance will be critical,” Guterres told this special event held at the UN Headquarters in New York on financing for global development goals.
Guterres noted that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – adopted by UN Member States in September 2015 – are a blueprint for building an inclusive, sustainable fair globalization.
“We can choose to bemoan the lack of financing for the 2030 Agenda in a world awash with so much unproductive and unrewarding finance. Or we can grasp the opportunity to reshape finance, according to our urgent, collective needs,” he said.
“The choice is clear. Let us invest in the 2030 Agenda and finance a better world for all.”
However, today’s global financial system, which manages some $300 trillion in financial assets, is simply not fit for purpose, the UN chief said, recalling that the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, adopted in 2015 at an international conference in the Ethiopian capital on financing for development, highlights the importance of being innovative in leveraging resources and financing for development.
