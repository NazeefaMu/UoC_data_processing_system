Tailor delegation to Taiwan

A Sri Lankan delegation headed by Chaandana Wijesekera of the old-established Bristol Tailors, will be attending the 37th convention of the World Federation of Master Tailors (WFMT) in Taipei, Taiwan.
The convention is conducted for leading craftsmen in tailoring from around the world to share their experiences and expertise. Through this network, Sri Lanka has drawn the expertise of internationally renowned master tailors to train local tailors.
The delegation left on July 30 for the convention that ends in the first week of August.
