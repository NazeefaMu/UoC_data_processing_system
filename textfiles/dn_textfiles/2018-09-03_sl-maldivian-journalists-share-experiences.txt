SL, Maldivian journalists share experiences

In the coming weeks the role of civil society and the role of the media in the Maldives will be more important than ever, regardless of the outcome of the election, said Phillipe Dickinson, Second Secretary at the British High Commission in Sri Lanka, addressing journalists from Sri Lanka and Maldives at a workshop in Colombo last Thursday.
The two-day workshop implemented by Internews and supported by the British High Commission in Sri Lanka was held to build a network between Maldivian and Sri Lankan journalists.
“We are meeting here today on the International Day of the Disappeared. During the past 11 years more than 900 journalists have been killed for doing their job,” Dickinson said. “Sadly, the impunity rates for these crimes are shockingly high and 90 percent have gone unsolved.”
“Such incidents erode press freedom and deprive entire societies of important information.
In an era of fake news, social media trolls and foreign attempts to manipulate elections, the free and responsible press faces new challenges. Solidarity is really important to face these challenges by supporting each other and sharing your practical experiences,” he said.
Journalists from the Maldives enlightened their local colleagues of the challenges they are facing, while their local counterparts including prominent journalists like former Sunday Observer Editor Lakshman Goonasekera, Sitha Ranjani of the Free Media Movement and Amantha Perera, together with civil society activists including Jehan Perera and PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi enlightened them of their experiences in the past few decades.
