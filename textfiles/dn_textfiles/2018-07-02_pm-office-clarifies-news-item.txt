PM Office clarifies news item

The Prime Minister’s office issuing a statement made clarifications with regard to a news item appeared in print media regarding Prime Minister’s speech made at the Dr. Saman Kelegama Memorial Conference held on June 29 in Colombo.
The Prime Minister stated At this conference that he negotiated with Prime Minister Li and President Xi of China and came up with a proposal beneficial for both parties. Sri Lanka also informed the China that Hambantota cannot be used for military purposes. The Sri Lanka Navy is moving its Southern Command to Hambantota. There is no need to be frightened as security of the port will be under the control of the Sri Lanka Navy. Once an American has asked him, “What would you do if the Chinese troops land in Hambantota?” The Prime Minister has responded saying that there is a full army division stationed at Hambantota. The Prime Minister never mentioned that we will not be resisting any invasion. Further, no Navy in the region has the capacity to land an army division in Sri Lanka.
As far as the Hambantota Port is concerned, it will only be a commercial port which will trigger off much needed economic development of backward districts of Hambantota and Moneragala very soon, the statement said..
