‘A/L results not filled by SAITM graduand’

The SAITM graduand who requested registration from the Sri Lanka Medical Council left the space allocated in the application for A/Level results blank, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Speaking at a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the student requested the SLMC registration after the Supreme Court judgement and then the SLMC informed her to forward an accurately filled application.
“So far this student has failed to submit the accurately filled complete application for SLMC registration. She has not filled the box for A/Level results. What we can gather is that she wants to avoid filling this box in the application,” Dr. Aluthge said.
Applicants need to fill an application accurately and completely to obtain the registration of the SLMC which registers all MBBS doctors.
Any person needs to pass the Advanced Level Examination in the Science stream to study for the MBBS degree.
No MBBS doctor can practice without SLMC registration, he said.
