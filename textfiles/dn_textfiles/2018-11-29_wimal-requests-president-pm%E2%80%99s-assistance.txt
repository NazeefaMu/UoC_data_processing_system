Relief for Samurdhi families:
Wimal requests President, PM’s assistance

Housing and Social Welfare Minister Wimal Weerawansa yesterday said that he requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to provide immediate solutions to the problems faced by Samurdhi officials and 1.5 million Samurdhi beneficiary families.
The Minister said that he made this request from the President and the Prime Minister when he took over the Housing and Social Welfare portfolio.
“We have succeeded in providing an immediate solution to a problem faced by the Samurdhi Development Department employees. An officer for every Grama Niladhari Division was appointed when this Movement began in 1995,” he said.
The Minister added that the Department employees faced many issues during the previous regime and their issues should be immediately addressed.
“There are 1,073 Samurdhi Banks around the country. Around 28.8 percent of people are living below the poverty line when the Samurdhi Movement started. By 2017, only 6.5 per cent were living below the poverty line and the Samurdhi Movement helped alleviate poverty among our population,” Minister Weerawansa said
He added that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa established the Samurdhi Development Department by bringing five institutions to its fold.They are the Sri Lanka Samurdhi Authority, Up Country Development Authority, Up Country Village Rehabilitation Authority, Sri Lanka Southern Development authority and the Samurdhi Commissioner’s Department.
He said that 119 out of 27,000 Samurdhi officials have retired from the Department during the last regime but none of them received pension benefits.
“One hundred and seventy eight officials have died in the Department and none of them receive pension benefits and the government should ensure that their families receive pension benefits as other officials in the government service,” he added.
“A group of Samurdhi officials have already filed a case before court seeking ETF, EPF and pension benefits for them.
“We cannot wait any longer. If court determines that Department employees deserve more benefits, we will provide them these benefits with retrospective effect,” Minister Weerawansa said.
The Minister said that the objective of forming the Samurdhi Movement is to alleviate poverty in the country.
He said that he will continue the programmes implemented by the department with the addition of new methodologies.
