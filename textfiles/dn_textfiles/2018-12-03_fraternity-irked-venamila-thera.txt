Fraternity irked by Ven.Amila thera

The Maha Sangha has expressed disappointment over the behaviour of Ven.Dambara Amila Thera. They said his expression of views and recent utterances were unbecoming of a monk.
The Maha Sangha while expressing their displeasure over the monk's behaviour said a code of conduct for those in religious garb existed and his behaviour was unbecoming to a Bhikku.
The Maha Sangha while disagreeing with what the thera has done and is doing, stressed the need to deal firmly with the monk for misusing public money.
What he does, as a Member of the Sangha fraternity has brought disrepute to the Buddha Sasana, the Maha Sanga added.
