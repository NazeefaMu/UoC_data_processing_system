Repercussions of Geneva Summit

Already the United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva has adopted a resolution on Sri Lanka relating to the human rights situation during the fratricidal civil war that ranged over 30 years. Though the final resolution was not available at the time of writing this article, a wide debate has opened in the country over the draft resolution that was to be adopted with amendments. This is natural. Though the debate has ended in Geneva it is likely to have its repercussions here and abroad for a long time.
Already opinion is divided over the domestic mechanism that would investigate the human rights violations that were supposed to have taken place during the last phase of the war. Some see it as a trap to strangle the country. For some others it is an excuse to whitewash the whole issue. Still others consider it a necessity step to solve the problems confronting the country at present.
Though this matter relates to the last phase of the war it is necessary to go back in history to a period considerably earlier. War is nothing but the continuation of politics by other means. The war erupted since that politics could not be continued under normal peaceful conditions. Here the turning point was the Black July of 1983 when a mass pogrom against the Sri Lankan Tamil population took place with the connivance of the Government then in power.
Internationalization of National Question
Internationalization of the National Question in Sri Lanka was a direct consequence of Black July, following which there was a large exodus of Tamils to foreign lands, principally to India and Western countries. It created a huge Tamil Diaspora most of whom subsequently obtained citizenship of the West. As a result these countries began to be involved in domestic affairs of Sri Lanka, principally in inter-communal relations and the human rights situation here. It is plain that we ourselves are to blame for this internationalization of a problem which remained absolutely a domestic one beforehand.
No country could be isolated in today's globalized world. Also the world is more alert with regard to human rights violations anywhere in the world. Just as we are concerned about the human rights of Palestinians or Black Americans or Aboriginal communities elsewhere the world is concerned about the rights of the Sri Lankan population, especially of the Tamil population.
During the latter part of the Eelam War Sri Lanka became isolated in the world due to two factors. One was the rabid chauvinist policy vigorously pursued by the Government in the name of patriotism and the antagonistic policies it pursued against countries which had a considerable Tamil Diaspora of Sri Lankan origin. Incidentally this is the type of patriotism that Bertrand Russel spoke of when he said that patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.
Positive changes
The demand for an international inquiry to investigate alleged human rights violations during the concluding phase of the war was a political reaction to the immature and unenlightened domestic and foreign policies of the former Government. It should also be remembered that it also did not emerge overnight. They first demanded a credible domestic inquiry. In deed it was promised. But the promise was never kept. Though at last the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission was established its report was not implemented. In the meantime the former President agreed with the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to allow an international inquiry. One this is evident. We have promised an international inquiry. We have lost our credibility among the world community of nations since we reneged on that promise.
Another important factor is the change in the international community's attitude towards Sri Lanka following the Presidential election and the positive changes taken by the new government to create a climate more conducive for national reconciliation. They have also noted the remarkable change for the better in the human rights situation and steps taken towards good governance albeit against stiff opposition from reactionary forces. The result has been the ending of Sri Lanka's isolation in the world.
The retreat of the international community from an international inquiry to a hybrid and then domestic inquiry is a result of the political developments in Sri Lanka since January. This has somewhat reduced the threats to our sovereignty. It is only somewhat and not total for total elimination of the threat depends on our own conduct.
For example, our sovereignty would be certainly in danger if we reject outright the demand for a domestic inquiry. We have to admit that there human rights violations may have occurred during the war. When they are violated even in ordinary non-political confrontations how can we offhand deny that there were never any such violations?
On the other hand, a refusal to investigate betrays a guilty consciousness on our part. Our politicians and officials have so far behaved in that way. Whatever inquiry that is held should be fair and independent. It should not be a trick to get out of an embarrassing situation. Such a course of action would have the same result as rejection of an inquiry.
Defects in judicial system
Though the request for an inquiry has come from the international community the inquiry is actually an imperative domestic need for it is a sine qua non for national reconciliation and sustainable peace. Its need is therefore more ours. Elated at the decision of the Human Rights Council to opt for a domestic inquiry some spokesmen of the Government has begun boasting that everything is OK as if there is nothing more to worry about. Everything will be OK only if inquiries are conducted properly and fairly, If not the international community may change its attitude again. We have to remember that lost credibility cannot be regained by words alone.
Since the defects in our judicial system are acknowledged it is essential that some form of international intervention may be needed for the domestic inquiry. The task will be to select the form of intervention that would not compromise State sovereignty. There may be persons in any social organism that violate ordinary norms of conduct. We find such persons among teachers, lawyers, doctors, politicians, priests etc. Then how could one say that Black Sheep are not found among members of the Security Forces? If there are such persons investigating and punishing the guilty would certainly enhance the prestige of the Security Forces. The Tamil National Alliance in a statement on the draft resolution of the Human Rights Council has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the Government. This is a welcome positive development. In its opinion the domestic inquiry is a constructive first step in a long journey towards national reconciliation.
However there are several obstacles to be cleared to effectively proceed towards national reconciliation. The first is the need to overcome the resistance of the chauvinist forces who are trying to use the HRC Resolution to regain power. Their strength should not be under-estimated. They thrive on the ignorance of the public and use pseudo-patriotic slogans to foster racial hatred. Also one should be mindful of opportunist forces within the ranks of the Government itself who may again desert it and join the opposition at critical times. A repetition of the serial drama enacted by the opposition during the January-August period may occur.
The best guarantee against such a possibility is to take the people into confidence and ensure transparency and openness in all government undertakings. The necessity of organising the masses in favour of a political solution to the National Question is an urgent necessity if Sri Lanka is to make good use of the new space available for national reconciliation and a just peace.
