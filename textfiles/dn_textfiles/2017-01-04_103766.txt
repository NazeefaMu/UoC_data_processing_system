JO launches National Assets Protection Movement

Parliamentarian and Joint Opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardene said they have launched a movement called the National Assets Protection Movement to oppose the unconstitutional, illegal and unpatriotic actions of the present government.
Addressing the inaugural meeting of the movement at the Narahenpita Abhayaramaya attended by JO members, trade unionists and artistes, Gunawardena said their endeavour was to save the country’s national assets and prevent the alienation of the 34 national assets planned by the government under various guises.
He said among the national assets which may be vested in foreign interests were the Magampura Port, Mattala Airport, Ranminitenne Tele Village, Colombo Port Eastern Terminal, Trincomalee Tank Farm, Trincomalee Port, Palali Airport, Sri Lanka Railways, SLTB, SriLankan Airlines, NSBM, Lanka Hospitals Ltd, Hilton Hotel, People’s Bank, Bank of Ceylon, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, CEB, EPF, ETF and Lotus Tower.
Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma said they hoped to meet the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates, the Mahanayake Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Nikaya and the Mahanayake Thera of the Amarapura Nikaya and the Archbishop of Colombo and to complain to them about the injustice planned by the government. He said they would also hold a massive satyagraha at Hambantota with the participation of the Maha Sangha, clergy of the other religions and the people from Hambantota, Moneragala, Ratnapura and Matara districts to prevent the government from signing the Hambantota Port and adjoining leasing agreement.
