Congressional Caucus on Sri Lanka renewed for 115th Congress

The Congressional Caucus on Sri Lanka under the leadership of its Co-Chairs Representative Robert Aderholt (R-AL) and Representative Dina Titus (D-NV) recently renewed its registration as a Congressional Member Organization of the 115th U.S. Congress.
The Caucus comprises House Representatives from both the Republican and Democratic parties. Former House Representative Chris Van Hollen was the democratic Co-Chair of the Caucus until his election to the Senate at the beginning of this year.
The Sri Lanka Caucus has been active for over a decade and is one of over 50 country caucuses in the U.S. Congress.
The Caucus serves as an informal group of congressional members dedicated to issues related to Sri Lanka and educating other members on the subject.
The Caucus is a manifestation of the close bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and the United States. It also reflects the interest of congressional members, supported in particular by the Sri Lankan-American community and other well wishers, in promoting Sri Lanka–United States relations, especially people to people contacts both within the United States and between Sri Lanka and the United States.
