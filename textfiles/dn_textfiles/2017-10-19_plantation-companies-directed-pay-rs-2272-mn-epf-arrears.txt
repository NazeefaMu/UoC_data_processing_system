Plantation companies directed to pay Rs. 2,272 mn EPF arrears

Three leading estate owned plantation companies have not paid EPF for their employees and the arrears amounts to Rs. 1,702 million at the moment.
The additional due tax, interests, fines is around Rs. 550 million and the total due amount is around Rs. 2,272 million, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said. According to Minister Seneviratne, the three state owned plantation companies manage ten estates in the country with a large number of employees working in them.
The Labour Department has filed 1605 complaints against those companies for not paying EPF. Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry spokesman said that Minister Seneviratne ordered the managements of those companies and the ministry officials who handle the estates to pay the due EPF and arrears immediately and if those companies do not have required funds to pay EPF, they should obtain funds from the Treasury.
The scholarships granted for the students of estate sector workers who passed year Five Scholarship Examination get delayed due to the issues of EPF and ETF accounts.
The state owned plantation companies should take the responsibility for this injustice done to school children, the spokesman added.
