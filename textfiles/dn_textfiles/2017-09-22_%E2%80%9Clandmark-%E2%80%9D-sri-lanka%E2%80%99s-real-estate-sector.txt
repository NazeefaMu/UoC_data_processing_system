“Landmark ” in Sri Lanka’s Real Estate Sector

Landmark Developers Holding (Pvt) Ltd was launched recently in Colombo. Western Province, Chief Minister, Isura Devapriya, McQuire Rens and Jones Group Chairman, Dr. Nalin Jayasuriya and Ceylon German Technical Training Institute, Chairman Pandu Bandaranayake participated at the launch.
Landmark Developers Managing Director, Eksith Hanpangama said Sri Lankan real estate has come a long way to become one of the fastest growing markets in the region. “With the facelift to urban infrastructure, Colombo in particular is becoming an attractive city for both local and foreign investors. Subsequently, to match this demand, the growing population with its increasing income levels are constantly seeking upgrades and for a better quality of life,” he said.
Landmark’s vision is to become the leader in Sri Lankan sustainable real estate solutions with a global presence. Landmark Developer’s vast portfolio currently includes development of apartments and commercial buildings, facility management and maintenance, legal and financial consultations, blocking and selling of land plots for residential and commercial purposes, construction of property on existing land, compact or “Nano Homes”, interior designing, feasibility reports and facilitating overseas real estate investments in countries including Australia, the USA, the United Kingdom, the UAE and Maldives.
One of Landmark Developers pioneering projects, Park Residencies was also unveiled at the gala event. Park Residencies is home to twelve luxury boutique apartments in Pagoda Road. These luxury living spaces will include a yoga studio, fully-equipped gym, pool and a café that will cater to the residents living in the property. Differentiating itself from others in the industry promoting secluded living, Landmark Developers strives to create a sense of community and family among its residents.
The developers strongly believe in climate change and its adverse effects. The property developer hopes to contribute positively to the environment by adopting green building practices and developing sustainable properties across the country. Within their sustainable and green strategy in mind, they hope to initiate two Nano Home projects in Nugegoda and Thalawathugoda. These luxury homes will be sold at an affordable cost and consist of facilities such as three bedrooms, back yards, solar power, plunge pool and more in a 1,400 plus square feet of space.
