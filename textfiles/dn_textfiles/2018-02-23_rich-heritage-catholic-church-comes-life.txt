Rich  heritage of Catholic Church  comes to life

The air was thick with tropical heat in the cathedral in Kotahena Sunday evening as worshippers prepared for the mass. Schoolchildren in choir robes lined up on bleachers. Across from them, violinists in all black tuned their instruments.
It was no ordinary Sunday. St. Lucia’s, the seat of the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Colombo, was filled to capacity. The domed ceiling was lit up a fantastic blue.
The organizers, in fact, had to set up plastic folding chairs and projectors in front of the church’s Roman columns outside to accommodate the overflow crowd.
This special mass, which the church had been organizing for the past month, was meant to stand out. “We want to popularize some of the heritage of our singing in the church,” said Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith at a press conference in January.
Rather than a normal mass, Sunday’s gathering was meant to showcase some of the Catholic Church’s most beautiful music, performed by a huge group of singers and musicians
At 6 p.m., the mass began. The combined choruses – more than 200 people in total – sang in Latin, from Franz Schubert’s “Mass in G Major.”
For the next two hours, both professional and school singers filled the cathedral, the largest and oldest on the island, with music.
In one alcove, conductor Gregory Rose, visiting Sri Lanka from the U.K., directed men and women from Camerato, the Choir of St. Peter’s College, Choral Spectrum, Coro CantAmici, Contempo, La Scala Negambo, the Past Pupils choir of Good Shepherd Convent, the Soul Sounds Academy Choir, Speranza, St. Mary’s Choral Society, St. Theresa’s Choral Society, the Old Joes Choir, the Peradeniya Singers, the Philharmonic Choir, and Vox One. Rose also led the musicians of the Chamber Music Society of Colombo.
In the opposite alcove, Choral Director Francis D’Almeida led the combined choir of Archdiocesan schools and parishes. They were the choirs of: St. Joseph’s College, St. Benedict’s College, Good Shepherd Convent, St. Lawrence Convent, St. John the Baptist Church Kandana, St. John Dal Bastone Church, Pelawatte, St. Joseph’s Church, Grandpass, and the Archdiocesan Choir.
This Sunday was the third Latin Choral Mass the Archdiocese has organized over the past three years. The church “wants to bring the rich heritage of this music to our people,” said Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, who presided over the mass.
“We wanted to show that Sri Lankans are capable of singing those songs with such elegance,” he added.
The mass followed a traditional structure, including a sermon, readings from the Bible, and a communion.
But aside from some readings and announcements in English, the music was completely performed in Latin. The Mass in G Major of the Austrian composer Franz Schubert – who died at the young age of 31 after writing hundreds of pieces – came to life in the Colombo cathedral.
The Latin Mass ceremoniously welcomed the season of Lent, the season where Catholics through prayer and penance remember the death of Jesus Christ.
Cardinal Ranjith said this Lent season is the year of the Good Shepherd, and the communion section of the mass recognized this theme, as the choirs and worshippers alike sang “ego sum pastor bonus:” “I am the Good Shepherd.” According to the communion, it is the Good Shepherd who dies for his flock.
Cardinal Ranjith said he hoped the traditional music, performed on a grand scale, would inspire young people to engage with the heritage of the church.
He said the Latin Mass, once the staple of the Catholic Church, was starting to gain popularity around the world. But one thing is for sure. In Colombo, it was a success.
