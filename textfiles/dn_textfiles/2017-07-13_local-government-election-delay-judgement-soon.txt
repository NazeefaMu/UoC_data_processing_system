Local Government election delay: Judgement soon

 
The judgments of the cases that were filed before the Supreme Court on the delay of the local government elections would most probably be delivered within this month, said Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Prabath Gammanpila. 
He said that three cases had been filed against the delay of the elections and the hearing of them have already completed.
"Since a justice in the bench that heard the cases is scheduled to retire next month I hope the judgements would be delivered within this month," MP Gammanpila said. 
He made these observations today addressing a press conference held at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya political Office at Pitakotte.
“However, that the elections have been delayed long and nobody takes the responsibility of the delay the Election Commission and the subject minister both are passing the ball to each other,  However the matter is in the hands of the leader of the House as it is his responsibility to take up the amendment bill into debate in Parliament," MP Gammanpila said.
He aslo said that if the government failed to hold the election in October the joint opposition would come on roads in protests and would not leave until the election is declared. He added the advantage of the delay of the election is with the joint opposition.
