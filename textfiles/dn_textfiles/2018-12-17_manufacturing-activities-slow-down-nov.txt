Manufacturing activities  slow down in Nov.

According to SL Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), manufacturing activities has slowed down in November.
The slowdown observed in manufacturing activities in November was mainly driven by the slowdown in new orders and production, especially in manufacturing of textiles, wearing apparels, leather and related activities.
However, new orders and production in the manufacturing of food and beverages activities has improved with the Christmas season demand.
Employment remains unchanged during the period due to the difficulties in recruiting additional employees, especially in manufacturing of furniture activities.
Meanwhile, overall stock of purchases indicated a slowdown, mainly due to the subdued production of manufacturing of textiles, wearing apparels, leather and related products.
Suppliers’ delivery time lengthened at a slower rate which is mainly driven by the reduction of lead time on demand, for supplies related to manufacturing of food and beverages activities to speed up their production.
All the sub-indices of PMI Manufacturing recorded values above the neutral 50 threshold signalling an overall expansion in November yet at a slower pace compared to October 2018.
