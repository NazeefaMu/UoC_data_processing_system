Tax misappropriations in Chilaw

Chilaw Urban Council Secretary A.A. Jayasiri said that there had been financial misappropriations during tax collections at the Chilaw vegetable fair.
He said the average tax collected in three weeks was Rs.24,430, but the amount that had been collected during the past three weeks was only Rs.18,000.
An investigation into the matter had been conducted recently, Jayasiri said, adding that measures would be taken to bring the culprits to book.
Taxes had previously been collected through a tender procedure, but since they had received several complaints against it, a commission procedure had been introduced.
