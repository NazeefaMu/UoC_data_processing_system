US, Sri Lanka launch youth employment programme

The Sri Lankan and the United States governments on Thursday launched a new initiative to support youth job training, a Rs. 1.8 billion project funded by the USAID.
US Ambassador Atul Keshap, speaking at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, said the new initiative, called YouLead!, would support youth employability, vocational skills development, and entrepreneurship.According to Ambassador Keshap, 70 percent of unemployed people in Sri Lanka are youths between the ages of 15 and 29.
“YouLead! aligns global best-practice tools and training with in-demand jobs,” he said.
Keshap said there would be a special focus on burgeoning private markets such as tourism, construction, and maritime services.The programme will be supervised over four years by volunteers for Economic Growth Alliance, a coalition of NGOs, and the International Executive Service Corps.
