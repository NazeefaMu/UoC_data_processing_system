BIA enhances its surveillance to detect H1N1 influenza passengers

The Quarantine Unit at the Bandaranaike International Airport in Katunayake, has enhanced its surveillance to detect passengers with H1N1 influenza following reports of an increase in the number of persons affected by the disease in the Maldives. Meanwhile the Sri Lankan Airlines too have activated communicable disease safety procedures in their flights coming in and out from Male.
According to the Maldives Health Ministry statistics, 105 people have tested positive for the H1N1 virus, or Swine flu, since January, while two had died. Some schools and the State university have been closed until the disease is brought under control.
