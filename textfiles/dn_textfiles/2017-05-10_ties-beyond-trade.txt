Ties beyond trade

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently concluded a working visit to India, which is followed by the arrival of Prime Minister Modi as the guest of honour for the opening of the UN Vesak celebrations in Sri Lanka. That Prime Minister Modi has agreed to grace the UN Vesak celebrations in Sri Lanka, despite the lack of a significant Buddhist constituency in his own country, is a tribute by him to Sri Lanka’s own unique Buddhist heritage, with its origins in India.

India has in more recent years, increased its focus on the fact, that it is not only the cradle of one of the world’s major faiths, Hinduism, but also the birthplace of another of the world’s major religions, Buddhism, which in its purer Theravada form, is now mainly practiced in Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka.
However, the real story of Indo-Sri Lanka relations under the Sirisena / Wickremesinghe Administration lay in the MOU that was signed in Delhi during Prime Minister Wickremesinghe’s visit there in late April.
The MOU achieved some aspects, though not the full extent of what the original Economic and Trade Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) was intending to do, laying the groundwork and creating the basis for Indian investment in Sri Lanka. Many of the aspects which certain professional groups objected to, including the easier entry of Indian professionals in to our labour market were left out of the MOU, though the agreement leaves open the possibility to expand the scope of the MOU at a later date.
Joint Opposition’s Xenophobia vs Racism
The Joint Opposition backing defeated President Rajapaksa, has since its electoral defeat been seeking a political slogan and platform on which to make a political comeback. A comeback, which Rajapaksa now seems to believe is only two moons away. Notwithstanding that claim, the JO’s political messaging is important if its justified claims to being the alternative to the rainbow coalition is accepted. The die-hard loyalists of the defeated Rajapaksa regime, never really abandoned the barely disguised and thinly veiled racism which was its stock in trade at both the elections of 2015, in which it lost, much to their own surprise.
A racism which ensured, as some counting agents personally reported, that in some minority polling stations, especially in Muslim areas, every single vote went to President Sirisena and none to Rajapaksa, a unique first in Sri Lanka’s electoral history. The JO’s strident majoritarian ethno-nationalism having a resonance and appeal solely with a section of the majority community and none other. Unable to come up with any other rationale for its existence, the Rajapaksa’s and the JO are intent on flogging the war victory for electoral gain, a strategy which failed them in 2015 and likely fail them again in the future.
Defeated President Rajapaksa, being a shrewd politician has recognized that he does need some minority support if his political project is to ever move from a very well-funded opposition project (no prizes for guessing their source of funds) to one which enjoys electoral victory in the future.
Accordingly, he is personally trying to reach out to minorities, but sending Gotabhaya to Durga Town, Aluthgama may be more like rubbing salt in the wound, while parading former LTTE leader and criminally accused Karuna on the front stages of the Joint Opposition platform, is hardly an appeal to the Tamil people.
The alternative for targeting the perceived “enemy within” and engaging in the fear and hate mongering which is its stock in trade, especially the minor allies of the JO, who though the tail, seemingly wag the JO dog, has been xenophobia or attempts at whipping up anti-Indian sentiment. Much to their chagrin, this also does not seem to have got much traction in the South, while it hardly has any currency at all in the North and East.
It’s the economy and reforms
The Yahapalanaya Administration received its mandate for reforms, democratic, economic and reconciliation reforms. At the end of its term and indeed at any Provincial or Local elections which intervene and we do have Provincial elections due towards the end of this calendar year, this government would be judged on whether it delivered on those promises to the people. While the easy wins of the first one hundred day programme was perhaps largely achieved and the enviable 19th Amendment and the RTI Act, passed much more needs to be done to fulfil the expectations of the electorate. A key aspect of that is economic reforms.
The defeated Rajapaksa Administration left the incoming Good Governance Administration with a mountain of debt, both foreign and domestic, spent on dubious projects together with massive corruption. Leaving the incoming administration with very little wiggle room for fiscal stimulation or trying to spend its way out of a slowing down economy. We also continue to be burdened by huge military spending. A rather surprising feature of our peace, being that we have higher military spending in our post war period than we did fighting the war.
With not much room left for government capital expenditure, the only other source of funds is foreign investment and as Western economies slow down and go through political transformations of their own, from Brexit to the bring jobs back to America campaign of the Trump Administration, Sri Lanka should in its own rationale interest seek to exploit and benefit from the expanding economies in its own region and India is an economic powerhouse next door, from which we must benefit and profit. Sri Lanka attracts abysmal levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) and one method of increasing confidence of private investors in our economy, is to have greater and profitable investments by foreign governments.
The Indian MOU largely lays out cooperation by India, actually investment by them, mostly in Sri Lanka’s energy (power) sector, a crucial requirement for every other industry including households to function. The transitioning of our national power generation from the traditional thermal and hydro, to other alternative and renewable forms of energy, including solar and natural gas is a welcome development. Increased Indian investment into Sri Lanka’s roads, highways and the power sector is perhaps just the prescription our economy needs to move up a notch or two.
