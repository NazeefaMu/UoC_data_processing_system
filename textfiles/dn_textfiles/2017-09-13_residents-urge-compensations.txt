Residents urge for compensations

A number of residents of the Kurunegala Division have complained that they have not been paid due compensations for the lands that were acquired by the Government for the proposed expressway to be built via Kurunegala.
The construction of the expressway is now in process disregarding the objections of the residents of Malpitiya, Boyagane, Henamulla, Amunaatta and Gettuwana areas.
Herbot Gunathilake of the Pubudu Farmers’ Organisation, Nailiya, told that their lands were acquired by the Government by force and government authorities didn’t express clearly as to how compensations will be paid to the residents who lose their land and properties in this regard.
"The Government has not paid even a cent as compensation on this issue so far. We are utterly helpless and we have nowhere to go," D. A. K. Ranasinghe, a resident of Nailiya village, told the Daily News.
However, Kurunegala UNP Parliamentarian and Deputy Minister of Transport Ashok Abeysinghe said, all steps would be taken soon to pay the land owners with due compensations, but that process would take a considerable length of time.
