Country taken forward under new programme: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe paid courtesy calls on Malwatu Mahanayake Most Ven. Tibbatuwawe Sri Siddartha Sumangala Thera and Asgiri Chapter Mahanayake Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanaratana Thera, yesterday, after paying homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic at the Dalada Maligawa, Kandy.
The Premier apprised the Theras on the government’s development plans and stated that after the return of President Maithripala Sirisena from London, the country will be taken forward under a new programme.
He said that the government had paid special attention on promoting peace and reconciliation so that the recent incidents in Kandy will not be repeated in the region.
Addressing the media after his meeting with the Theras, the Premier said that this year the people will see the dividends of many development projects launched by the government.
He added that several projects are at their final stages and plans are afoot to launch other projects soon.
The Premier said that although the country faced many natural disasters such as floods, droughts and the collapse of the garbage dump, the government took steps to reduce the burden on the people so that they were able to celebrate the New Year to their satisfaction.
