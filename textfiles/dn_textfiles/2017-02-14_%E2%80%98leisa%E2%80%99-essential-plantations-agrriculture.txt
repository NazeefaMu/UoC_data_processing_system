‘LEISA’, essential for plantations agrriculture

‘Low External Input Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA) is receiving increased attention, both as a sustainable alternative to Green Revolution-like strategies making intensive use of external inputs, and as a strategy of sustainable agriculture in resource-poor environments where no or very few external inputs are used’
Reading views expressed by some eminent personnel in the tea industry, it is apparent that the allegation is that the country's tea industry is likely to be worsened with the ban of the Herbicide Glyphosate. But the relevance of this notion has to be viewed alongside with what is going on in the global sphere instead of looking at it from a very narrow focus.
While acknowledging that there are other issues that may qualify to be on the top of the list and the objective here is to pointout the obvious and start a discussion so that the policy makers in Regional Plantation Companies would hopefully listen.
It is still a debate whether glyphosate should be allowed or totally banned from tea plantations. It is important to realise the difficulties in practicing fully organic practices. Hence, a long term succession approach is needed.
I am no way proposing or promoting to ban chemical weeding but trying to pointing out that the over use of chemicals the harvest will effect in the long run and the prices may drop.I do not think that this is new information.
The accusation of high cost of production and low productivity was there even before the ban as well but then what have they done to tackle it. Very little from the strategic point of view. That clearly shows the impotency and lack of management will to turn around. They knew every once in two years the wage increase is coming but they were not prepared to face the issue. All we collectively agree with or without statistics is that we have an industry threatening issue that has no solutions internally at the moment.
I am not a scientist and also do not wish to be controversial and my personal experience and view is that continuous use of a single Herbicide frequently might carry a risk of a build up of resistant species which may be harmful.
Risk is part and parcel of any agriculture and it has always been there and will never go away. It is therefore very important that planters to have the capacity to understand, face and overcome this aspect. An article published in January, 2017 in Scientific Reports 7, Article number: 39328 under the title of: “ Multiomics reveal non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats following chronic exposure to an ultra-low dose of Roundup herbicide'.If any individual or any association can prove that the research findings are wrong rather making silly statements showing their petty minded narrow thinking thus throwing thousands of human lives in added danger.
Most genuine planters who are patriotic but voiceless join with me in saluting the PM and Minister Navin Dissanayake for unmasking these top guns who are still tolerated by their masters for reasons best known to them. But their days are numbered as an eminent team of less than 20 genuine planters headed by Jeevaka Atapattu are heavily involved in unearthing the bitter truth of destruction of Regional Plantation Companies.
Whilst acknowledging genuine interventions of the team behind him as well, let me be very open that what is needed at this eleventh hour is not more commissions in the pretext of psychological torture. Both PA, CPS and all other leading trade unions must put their best foot forward and link up with the team headed by Atapattu and come out with the plan of damage control leading to another golden era of SMART plantations.
There is no time for procrastination.The Minister with the blessings of both the President and PM must develop the second line of defence. NIPM, IPM, ICA and PIM must be summoned to come out with a strategic plan for the entire industry with identified smart goals for each year. As long as there are intelligent inputs many investors will look at the plantations industry as a golden opportunity.
The industry must understand the value of HRM inputs even at this late stage before it becomes too late and reach a state of irreversible damage. All must understand that the clock is ticking.
Coming back to the story of Glyphosate it was used in the past in extremely small proportions to eradicate the infestation of tea fields with couch and Illuk which are generally in ravings, roadsides and boundaries.
If I am not mistaken glyphosate was introduced in early 1980s under world bank project to use glyphosate to reconditioned fields with grass prior to re-planting specially to control couch in badly infested fields uprooted for re-planting.
According to Tea Research Institute instructions (in 1980s) it is important that high yielding fields have to be kept free of couch and glyphosate to be sprayed in fields, provided the sprayed patches are left without being plucked for a period of at least three months after spraying.
The T.R.I., time to time recommended using various other Herbicides as well taking into consideration the Herbicideto be used depending on the weed species present at the time of the application and taking into account the retail price.
T.R.I, has imposed a two round spray limit annually to minimise the risk.
Weeding is an unproductive exercise. There are advantages as well as disadvantages on spraying because some time the side branches and the plucking table may get damaged and there by the yields will go down and the other hand it keeps the cost down. Therefore it has to be undertaken very carefully. Those days we had a very effective system of manual and chemical weeding programme. Once you sprayed a herbicide (not glyphosate) after one or two months later we do a kyporuku (removing weeds by hand )in order to remove the weeds resistance such as Amalay and Alavangupillu and bring them to the roadside and heap it.
The weeding programme and its cost has to be decided by the management in the estate taking into consideration various aspects such as the VP and seedling percentages or its hecterage on Division wise and some times you may have to give little extra money to some opened fields where there are more vacant patches (pottals) which not rehabilitated (planted with grass) if not the field staff cross charged the weeding workers to some other items specially on plucking and covered this cost from well covered VP fields.
This has to be within the budget given by managing agent and accordingly we handle the weeding cost and never allowed the fields to get overrun with weeds except for the fields that were due for uprooting for re-planting.
It might not be possible to develop a chemical weeding programme for the whole plantation in the short run. Therefore, the chemical weeding programme needs to be developed at estate level. This might look like an overwhelming task but this could be turned into a productive investment.
There has to be a control on using too much chemicals in the plantations. The monitoring has to be done by a reliable authority and I propose a Government authority with all the powers to take decisions on estates over the use chemicals to be appointed.
Over the years chemical weeding has become an integral part of plantations but now it is increasing.
High cost and low productivity
If you go back to history, normally over the period after pruning there will be a certain percentage of nearly 10% of die back may be due to shot-hole-borer, mite and what we did was removing those bushes and planted the rehabilitation grass in those patches and re-supplied with VP plants later and you called it Infilling and I do not know whether it has been carried out and if it would have done there should have been a crop increase over the years.
However, the million dollar question is whether Sri Lanka or the Industry has benefitted from privatising the countrys biggest asset. The RPCs have access to better management and how far have they been successful in value addition except for a few RPCs which have to be commended for their initiative in the right direction.
It should be noted with concern that by statute 3 percent of the total tea lands should be re-planted with VP each year and anyone is well advised to check whether it has happened and if so present success percentage.
Ex Planters, who were in service prior to the nationalisation in 1975, will remember how they had to forward the annual return to the PA each year indicating the acreages re-planted. It is appropriate if the Plantation Restructuring Unit attached to the financial ministry, those officials to explain whether the 22 management contracts drafted by them whether the minimum requirement or compulsion to re-plant tea/rubber is in the management contracts signed by the RPCs or they drafted the management contracts to look after the interest of the citizens or for the benefit of the RPCs.
The civic-minded public is very much concerned about the present state of some of the privatised plantations. We must focus on soil rehabilitation and safe drinking water as well as Sri Lanka”s ailing plantation industry in general and the tea sector in particular needs urgent intervention in order to make the industry a US$ 10 billion industry by 2020.
