Battle against kidney disease
CAPD solution shortage to be resolved soon

The Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) will be available for all kidney patients in Sri Lanka soon after submitting a Cabinet paper, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said the CAPD solution will be provided first to kidney patients in the North Central Province under an investment project. The Cabinet approval is to be obtained to implement the project.
In the past, only one company imported the CAPD solution. Therefore, Sri Lanka experienced a shortage as a result. Now, two more companies have registered to import the solution, the minister said.
Countries, including Sri Lanka, will have to ban Glyphosate soon, following a court decision in the US.
“There is a danger for Sri Lankan tea in the world market because the use of Glyphosate in tea plantations is cancerous,” he said.
The government’s decision to lift the Glyphosate ban is wrong, he added.
