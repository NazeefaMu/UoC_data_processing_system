Lankan paddlers struggle at group stage

Sri Lankan junior paddlers who are participating at the 22nd Asian Junior & Cadet Table Tennis Championship in Thailand failed to impress in yesterday’s Cadet girls’ and boys’ singles and Junior mixed doubles group matches, losing all seven encounters of the day.
There were six cadet singles (three boys and three girls) along with the Junior mixed doubles match against Singapore. Only Helitha Hendawitharana won a singles set against his Hong Kong opponent Tsang Tsz after losing the first two sets but conceded victory to Tsz in the following set.
The other two Sri Lankan lads, Thenuka Ubayasena and Harshana Karandawela were defeated in straight set wins by Harimoto (JPN) and Kang Jinho (KOR) respectively.
The Lankan lasses followed the same footsteps and Imasha Sobana won a solitary set over Koh Kai of Singapore which did not change the fate of the match. Imasha lost the fourth set resulting a 3/1 win for Kai. The other two Lankan girls suffered clean sweeps from their Chinese Taipei and Singapore rivals.
Harsha and Chamathsara brought some hope to downhearted Lankans by winning the initial set against their Singaporean counterparts in the Junior mixed doubles match, but soon let fade all hopes losing the following three sets.
A 17-member local contingent including 14 paddlers and three officials are representing Sri Lanka at the championship where the events will be conducted in Cadet and Junior categories. The championship commenced on September 16 and will conclude on September 21
