The ICC announced the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 will be broadcast to more than 200 territories across five continents with an anticipated reach of more than two billion people, thanks to expanded syndication and licensing deals by ICC’s global media rights partner, Star Sports.
In 146 countries fans will be able to watch the coverage via traditional broadcast whilst the digital broadcast coverage is available in more than 200 countries.
The event, which will be staged at the Cardiff Wales Stadium, Edgbaston and The Oval from 1-18 June, will for the first time be broadcast live into China, South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia via Fox Network Group.
Also, in a major coup for U.K based fans, cricket returns to the BBC after 6 years, with a daily one-hour highlights show being transmitted throughout the tournament by the British public service broadcaster. And for the first time ever, fans in Continental Europe and Japan can watch the event live via ICC’s Facebook page.
Viewers in India will get a choice of following the coverage via Star Sports in English, Hindi and Tamil.
