Working-class heroine

It was an irresistible idea: to invite America’s former First Lady Michelle Obama to discuss her new book with the Nigerian superstar novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Staging the event in a venue with a capacity of 2,700, however, was akin to squeezing the Glastonbury Festival into someone’s back garden. When tickets went on sale for Becoming: An evening with Michelle Obama in the Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall, it sparked a rush like no other. “Why not just do it at the Royal Albert Hall?” grumbled one Facebook commenter after discovering she was 8,000th out of 55,000 in the online ticket queue. The physical queue began at 2.30am, and the Southbank Centre’s annual membership rocketed.
With such intense demand for tickets, many wondered just what type of audience would make it to the event. It turned out to be an equitable cross-section. 300 tickets were reserved for charities and schoolchildren. Among the high-profile attenders were the Labour politician Diane Abbott, the actress Michaela Coel, the former Olympic champion heptathlete Denise Lewis, the supermodel Adwoa Aboah, and the broadcaster June Sarpong. The preponderance of black female celebrities was reflected in the crowd as a whole, in which women outnumbered men significantly. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, the presenter Jon Snow and the author Alan Hollinghurst made for relatively rare male sightings. So when the lights finally dimmed and Michelle Obama entered the stage, the cheers reached soprano levels. “All right, everyone, deep breath”, said Adichie.
Straight talker
The excitement was fully justified. Funny, insightful and analytical, Michelle Obama impressed hugely as she spoke about her life and her memoir Becoming.
Obama talked emotionally about her late father, a highly intelligent blue-collar worker from South Side, Chicago who saw a “flame” in Michelle and sought to keep it alive: “to have that flame lit in a girl means you have to value her voice and let her speak”. Her dad was a straight talker whose dinner table conversation went so far as the “responsible” joys of sex. Obama recalled a time he cashed his entire monthly pay-check so that he could physically demonstrate to his children the costs of running a household.
“We make the mistake that working-class people aren’t gifted”, Obama lamented. “Talent is spread equally among humanity . . . I knew that I had a brain that was superior. I knew that I had a creative mind. And I knew when people weren’t investing in me”. Much of the audience seemed to identify with her comment about how teachers make assumptions about their students because of their skin colour.
One of Obama’s funnier anecdotes described the time when the Queen personally collected the Obamas in her car and Michelle became overwhelmed by the protocol instructions. “Oh, it’s all rubbish,” Her Majesty told her, “just get in.”
Title of spouse
Obama’s White House years occupy only a third of her memoir because it is “only a bit of what defines me as a person”. “You lose yourself in the title of spouse”, she added. Nonetheless, she credited her husband for helping her think more broadly about her life. “He doesn’t play games, fellas”, Obama said, wagging her finger as the crowd cheered. “A very attractive quality.” She reminisced about first dating Barack, who asked her, “Can I kiss you?” “That’s a lesson in consent!” Adichie interjected, and the audience roared with laughter.
Obama was most compelling when discussing the psychology of poverty. Drawing on her working-class roots in Chicago, she described the fear that can hold back poor people: fear of being stopped by the police, or going outside your neighbourhood. “I can find friends my age still living in the same house, doing the same thing . . . and I know it’s because of fear”. Bright young girls must also contend with their own family’s fear of their success, “of rising beyond what their family knows for you. You find yourself in this hard gap. You don’t belong at home with your family . . . and it’s often the parents who will hold a kid back. Not because they don’t want their success or because they don’t love them, but they’re afraid of the unknown”.
In another life Michelle Obama might have been a psychologist. I hadn’t fully appreciated what an effective bridge she creates between the working class and social elite, with her ability to illustrate a practical pathway to success. She’s a genuine working-class heroine.
Self-doubt
When Adichie asked Obama what message she would give to young black women navigating the world today, she advised them to ignore the self-doubt that comes from being constantly told “don’t reach too high, don’t talk too loud”. We walk around with those demons in our heads. “You have to slay the dragon in your own mind.” This is something Obama knows that only too well. Maliciously inaccurate media depictions of her as an Angry Black Woman who emasculates her husband still rankle. That chapter of her memoir, she said, was the hardest one to write.
“People will literally take our voice”, she said of black women in the US. “They will take the things from us that they like – our style, our swag. It becomes co-opted, but then we’re demonized. We are angry; we’re too loud. How dare I have a voice and use it . . . . People can literally take our words and co-opt them as their own”. The audience giggled at what could well have been a dig at Melania Trump, who was accused of plagiarizing one of Obama’s speeches during her husband’s election campaign.
Without mentioning the current US President explicitly, Adichie asked Obama about her thoughts on the Trump era. “Change is not a straight line”, she replied. We must make sacrifices now in the knowledge that we may not live to see the results.
The audience groaned when Adichie wrapped things up. “Ten more minutes!” someone cried out. But to no avail – Obama exited the stage to the tune of Stevie Wonder’s “Signed, Sealed, Delivered”, leaving us floored at how quickly ninety minutes had passed.
