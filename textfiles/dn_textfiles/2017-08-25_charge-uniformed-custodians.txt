Charge of the uniformed custodians

The Police Service has been from ancient times a much-respected service in our country. But over the recent past, it appears to have sadly lost its standing in our society. We need to address this problem in our own interest. The Police Service must be upgraded and made a special service like the old Civil Service. The best suitable for the profession must be attracted to join at all levels. We have today the highest level of literacy in the developing world so the ‘catchment area’ is available so let us restructure the Department, increase salaries and ‘perks’ and attract the best possible to the Service. If we are to ensure the security of the country we must do the needful.
There has been an unprecedented rise in brutal crime in recent days in our country which necessitates the need to address the problem on an urgent basis. We have had many Police Commissions at various times but there is today a need for the government to re-appoint a multi-disciplinary team to study the problem afresh. It appears to us that there has been a breakdown in relations between the community and the Police. This is an absolutely vital area that we should examine.
We can draw from the experience of many countries which have adopted Community Policing practices. I believe that a unit of the Defence Ministry which was headed by Dr Sanjay Colonne did an in-depth study of this issue but with the change of government in January of this year that unit was disbanded. Our Police Department, however, did continue its training programs with the assistance of the Scottish Police and has been developing Community Policing, for example, the Police organised the following programmes:
To my mind whilst this is a good beginning it is wholly inadequate. In Japan, for instance, they assigned two or three policemen to a particular area so that they become familiar with the residents and the residents with them, as a way of reducing crime.
Community Policing, or community-oriented policing, is a strategy of policing that focuses on police building ties and working closely with members of the communities.
In published texts Community Policing is described as “a philosophy that promotes organisational strategies, which support the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime”.
Community-oriented policing
There is no universally accepted definition of Community Policing. However, it can commonly be described as a policy that requires Police to inherit a proactive approach to address public safety concerns. This type of policing has been utilised in various cities for about the last 150 years. The first form of community-oriented policing is credited to the London Metro Police Department around 1830, as regular patrol areas were assigned to officers, now commonly known as “beats”.
Community-oriented policing was the cornerstone of the Clinton Administration and gained its funding from the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (Ahlin, Gibbs). According to a survey conducted by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) of more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies that had been using community policing for at least one year, 62 percent stated they had less crimes committed against civilians, 80 percent stated that they had reduced the fear of crime, and 99 percent stated that they had received increased cooperation from civilians. The overall assessment of community oriented policing is positive, as officers and community members both attest to its effectiveness in reducing crime and raising the sense of security in a community.
“Community policing is a philosophy of full service personalized policing, where the same officer patrols and works in the same area on a permanent basis, from a decentralized place, working in a proactive partnership with citizens to identify and solve problems.” According to Bertus Ferreira an authority on the subject.
Community policing is a professional management organisation that is structure for the support in the community to create proactive problem solving to address the immediate conditions that give rise to the public safety issues such as crime, social disorder and fear of crime. Community policing has partnerships between law enforcement agency and other organisations like government agencies, community members, non-profit service providers, private businesses and the media.
Government agencies includes probation and parole, public works departments, neighbouring law enforcement agencies, health and human services, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members can include partnerships with neighbourhood association that has meetings, town hall meetings and storefronts decentralized in the community. Non-profit organisations include advocacy of groups like service clubs, support groups, issue groups and community development corporations.
These groups work with individuals that have the same interest in the community. Private businesses have a bigger impact on the community from the health perspective. Private businesses often identify problems that provide the resources which can include security technology for the community. The media represents a powerful organ to communicate with the community.
Public safety
The community policing uses the media to assist with publicizing concerns and solutions that will impact the community. The media can have an impact on the fear of crime, crime problems and perceptions of the police in the community. Community policing recognizes that police can’t solve every public safety problem alone so interactive partnerships are involved. The policing uses the public for developing problem solving solutions.
The contemporary community policing movement emphasizes changing the role of law enforcement from a static, reactive, incident-driven bureaucracy to a more dynamic, open, quality-oriented partnership with the community. Community policing philosophy emphasizes that police officers work closely with local citizens and community agencies in designing and implementing a variety of crime prevention strategies and problem-solving measures.
To accomplish these initiatives, it is crucial that officers feel closely integrated with the majority of citizens and agencies in the community they serve. Typically, this means that officers perceive themselves as sharing important community values, beliefs, and goals. It also implies that officers are confident of community support and involvement in their decisions and action.
Many common elements in community-oriented policing include:
* Relying on community-based crime prevention by utilizing civilian education, neighbourhood watch, and a variety of other techniques, as opposed to relying solely on police patrols.
* Re-structuralizing of patrol from an emergency response based system to emphasizing proactive techniques such as foot patrol.
* Increased officer accountability to civilians they are supposed to serve.
* Decentralising the police authority, allowing more discretion amongst lower-ranking officers, and more initiative expected from them”.
I do hope that the government would appoint a special Commission to look into the state of the Police Service today. In the meantime I presume that a Police Commission would be established under the 20th Amendment in the very near future and persons such as the Dr. Sanjay Colonne who was so completely involved with this subject when he was serving with the Defence Ministry and retired respected IGPs and retired DIGs would be appointed to this Commission and would work to restore the image of the Service.
