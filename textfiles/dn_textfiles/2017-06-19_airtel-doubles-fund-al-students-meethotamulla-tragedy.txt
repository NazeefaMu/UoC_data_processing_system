Airtel doubles fund for A/L students at Meethotamulla tragedy

As the Sinhala and Tamil New Year dawned, the residents at Meethotamulla, Kolonnawa encountered an unforeseen tragedy with the collapsing of the infamous garbage mound.
During this period, the country stepped forward to provide immediate relief for the victims, while Airtel also raised a fund contributed by its employees. With the Advanced Level exam approaching, Airtel doubled its fund as a means of supporting and empowering the students affected in Meethotamulla in the most meaningful manner.
Commenting on the humanitarian initiative, Chief Executive Officer of Bharti Airtel Lanka Jinesh Hegde said, “During a national disaster like this, we at Airtel believe that we are responsible to make a difference. With a perfect understanding about the needs of the affected children, all our employees made a collective effort to not only contribute financial assistance but also to get to the ground level and understand the most crucial need for this community to rebuild their futures. We wanted to reduce their burden of the youth during this difficult time and do something meaningful by empowering them, as they are the future of the country.”
