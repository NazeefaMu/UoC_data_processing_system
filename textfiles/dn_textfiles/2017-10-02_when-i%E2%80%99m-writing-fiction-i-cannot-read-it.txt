When I’m writing fiction, I cannot read it

As a child, books were your refuge. The entirety of book-world was your tribe. The March family taught you morals; Anne of Green Gables, especially if you were like me, an unruly kid with reddish braids, gave you hope. Maybe Brian Robeson in Hatchet made you believe you could survive anything. The Lord of the Flies let you know that you wouldn’t.
As you grew older, you discovered new books and new ways to learn from them, but that profound connection you feel with them never left you.
What, though, if the joy did?
For life-long bookworms, as many novelists are, becoming a published author is a dream come true. Or perhaps more accurately, a long-awaited arrival. You enter the heart of the tribe.
Being a novelist is hard work. You are at your desk for often long, often irregular hours. Or for short hours that you wish could be longer. Frequently you struggle through one or the other without knowing whether a paycheck awaits you at the end. When your novel is published, you have to switch to a whole new skill set to assist with marketing and publicity. You may also have to face a new set of trolls.
At the same time, making up stories for a living is crazy wonderful. Having a legitimate excuse to obsess over language is utter relief. My books, although not autobiographical, still carry a piece of my heart; in becoming a published novelist, I feel as though I’ve in a way become the very thing I spent my life loving.
But what if becoming a published novelist was to rob the pleasure that inspired it? What if it was to hamper the act or, worse still, joy of reading?
My second novel, Shining Sea, came out in paperback last month. In the year between the hardcover release and the paperback, I was involved in promoting the novel, wrote a number of short and long-form nonfiction articles and op-eds, wrote some politically oriented speeches, and began researching and making notes for a new novel. I also read like a coyote loose among sheep. I devoured new releases, explored and fell in love with a whole new (for me) genre, and consumed huge chunks out of my to-be-read pile. I re-read every book I own by Willa Cather, which is pretty much every book by Willa Cather. I consumed any book of fiction or creative nonfiction related to Uganda that I could get my hands on. I strode into bookstores and strolled back out with books recommended by the bookseller. I always am startled when, at the end of the year, I tally my book-buying costs. This year I may need to down a glass of wine first. In October, after a final loop through California, all of my scheduled book touring for Shining Sea will be done. As much as I enjoy visiting bookstores and meeting readers, I look forward to settling down to the nitty-gritty of my new novel, closing my office door to the world, and turning the notes and random pages and research I’ve amassed over the past year into a carefully crafted whole.
Does this mean my greedy fiction-reading streak will have to end?
When Ronlyn Domingue, author of The Mercy of Thin Air and The Keeper of Tales trilogy, is working on a new book, she will “read ARCs if asked for blurbs and do critiques.” But she “will rarely read for pleasure.”* Kelly Simmons, author of One More Day and the forthcoming Fourth of July, says, “[W]hen I’m writing I can’t tolerate what others might call a guilty pleasure. I’m worried it might seep in!”
I also shy away from reading other people’s fiction when I’m in the thick of writing a new novel. I have to read daily, especially before I go to sleep at night. The idea of not doing so is impossible; I might as well go on a fast—something you would never catch me doing. But while I’m developing the voice of a book, I don’t want to hear someone else’s fiction cadences.
For a period of time in the course of working on a new fiction manuscript, novels—apart from ARCs that have been sent to me for blurbs and fiction by friends to critique—disappear from my bedside table to be replaced by nonfiction titles, newspapers, and magazines. While writing Shining Sea, the table was also occupied variously with books by or about a WWII Japanese prison camp survivor, a Pacific Ocean surfer, John McPhee’s The Crofter and The Laird: Life on an Hebridean Island, Homer’s The Odyssey, and other books whose cadences I did want to catch (or at least those of a character in them). Books, in other words, I might appreciate as a reader but was reading as a writer. The irony! Doing the job I love, although intimately connected to the pastime I love, clearly also interferes with it.
Some novelists do read other people’s fiction while they write. “I always read, even when I am in the thick of my own work,” Marcy Dermansky, author most recently of The Red Car says, “because I need to be reading. It would be too bleak not to be reading; it takes a long time to write a novel.”
“Yes!” Elizabeth Silver, author of the novel The Execution of Noa P. Singleton (as well as a recent memoir), replies when I ask whether she continues to read fiction. “Constantly!” Pamela Erens, author most recently of Eleven Hours, says. Like Domingue, other novelists don’t. “Generally not,” Ramsey Hootman, author of Surviving Cyril, says, “Although I’ve learned in the past five or ten years that this doesn’t apply to nonfiction.” Allie Larkin, author of Stay and Why Can’t I Be You, concurs: “I have a hard time reading novels at some stage of writing my own. I stick to non-fiction then.”
Still other authors do continue to read fiction, but not in their own genres. “Yes, sometimes I can’t help myself,” Emily Holleman, author of The Fall of Egypt series says. “But I avoid reading things that are at all similar in genre/tone. No historical fiction when writing historical fiction.” Jasmine Guillory, author of forthcoming The Wedding Date, says, more specifically, “I read every day and have since I first learned to read. I tend not to read books that are in the same genre/style of mine while I’m first drafting, though.” - Lit Hub
