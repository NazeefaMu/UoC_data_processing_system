CAVILL    out as  Superman

In a shocking development, Henry Cavill reportedly is no longer part of the DC extended universe as Superman.
According to a report, the actor, who first appeared as superhero in 2013’s ‘Man of Steel’, and later reprised his role in ‘Superman V Batman’ and last year’s ‘Justice League’, is parting ways with Warner Bros.
According to insiders, the development comes after talks of Cavill’s cameo in ‘Shazam!’ did not come to fruition due to scheduling conflicts. “There’s a recognition that some parts of the previous movies didn’t work,” said the studio insider.
Another source said that Warners is trying to hit a “reset” button with the DC universe.
Talks are on to find new face for the beloved superhero.
“Superman is like James Bond, and after a certain run you have to look at new actors,” said a studio source.
It is being said the studio has shifted its focus to a ‘Supergirl’ movie, which will be an origin story featuring a teen superheroine, which effectively removes an actor of Cavill’s age from the storyline as Superman, aka Kal-El, would be an infant, according to DC lore. Another voice adds that the studio is unlikely to make a solo ‘Superman’ film for at least several years. Hollywood Reporter
