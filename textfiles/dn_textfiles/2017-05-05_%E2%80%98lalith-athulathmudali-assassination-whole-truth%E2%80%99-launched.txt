‘Lalith Athulathmudali Assassination: The Whole Truth’ launched

Professor Ravindra Fernando’s latest investigative book, Lalith Athulathmudali Assassination: The Whole Truth, was launched yesterday at the Organisation of Professional Associations.
The book covers all angles of the assassination, which took place on April 23, 1993, and refutes the Presidential Commission’s claim that former President Ranasinghe Premadasa was responsible for Athulathmudali’s killing.
Fernando analysed documents at the National Archives, forensic evidence, and the official Scotland Yard report to write the book.
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, the chief guest at the launch, praised Fernando for his methods and critical eye.
“Present and future generations have a right to know the facts of this case and the connected matters so that they might identify the perpetrators and causes behind the crime. We should take steps and precautionary measures to prevent the repetition of such tragedies,” he said.
Dayanthe Athulathmudali, Lalith’s brother, delivering a speech lambasted the government for failing to reach a proper verdict in the case.
