Man arrested for destroying Swift nests

Police yesterday arrested a person who damaged the nests of swifts in the Singimale Tunnel on the Hatton Railway road. Police have found that the racketeers, who broke the nests and eggs to sell them to five-star hotels, throw the birdlings on to the railway line. Police said legal action would be taken against the suspect. Picture by Asela Kuruluwansa
