President attends funeral of slain policeman

 
President Maithripala Sirisena attended the funeral of the policeman attached to the Anti-Narcotics Unit who was shot dead during a sting recently.
The officer - J.A.D.C Abewickrama - was also posthumously promoted from police constable to sergeant by the President who pinned the badge on the slain policeman.
On May 9 a group of men on motorbikes opened fire at a team of policemen conducting a raid in Piliyandala.
A police officer was killed in the incident and another sustained serious injuries.
