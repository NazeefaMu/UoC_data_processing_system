A plea to renovate Rajarata tanks

At a divisional meeting of the farmers held in Pethiyagama in Thambuththegama, the importance of renovating the remaining tanks in the Rajarata area to introduce the ancient irrigation culture to the younger generation of the country was highlighted.
Retired principal and a farmer of the Pethiyagama village, R.B. Abeyratne said that although their generation was knew what a tank was, the younger generation would not know what it is in the future.
Therefore, it is very important to renovate them.
According to him, almost all the tanks in the Mahaweli H Zone were destroyed and later used as paddy fields. However, a few officials who were aware of the importance and the usefulness of the tanks took steps to protect a few.
The Pethiyagama tank is one of them.
R.M.S. Thilakaratne, a farmer from the Pethiyagama, pointing out the importance of the Pethiyagama tank said that there was no Mahaweli project during their childhood.
Therefore, it is the Pethiyagama tank which provided them with water for their needs. “We used water from this tank for both Yala and Maha cultivation seasons,” he said.
Another farmer of the Pethiyagama village, retired principal Ratnayake said that the Pethiyagoda tank is now filled with mud as it is not cleaned properly.
Therefore, he requested the government to launch a programme to dig this tank and renovate it for the future use.
