Jaffna students  repair flood  hit Mapalagama school

 Politicians who do not consider politics as a business should be elected to office by the people of this country, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said.
Civil society too should have a stake in the country’s forward march without washing its hands off by leaving everything in the hands of politicians, the former President said addressing a meeting at the Mapalagama Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Galle district.
The Mapalagama Vidyalaya damaged in the recent floods was repaired and refurbished by a visiting group of students from Vembadi Maha Vidyalaya and Mallika Maha Vidyalaya in Jaffna. The meeting was held to mark the handing over ceremony of the refurbished buildings and other equipment to the students and staff of Mapalagama MMV. Kumaratunga said Sinhalese as the majority community had its own rights but they should also respect and provide for the rights of other communities as well.
Describing war as a meaningless thing which did not benefit anyone Kumaratunga said eventhough people in the south faced many difficulties and vicissitudes on account of war those who suffered most from it were the Tamils. History showed that Sinhalese and Tamils had stood with each other in unity even during foreign invasions.
“During the recent past we had created divisions as to South, North and East. Most governments since Independence in 1948 had given preference to the South in development work without giving an equal share to the North and East.
“Minorities had been unfairly treated even in the case of university admissions. If such things did not happen we would never have faced a 30 year war,”Kumaratunga said. She said a group of about 70 students from the North had set up camp in the South and helped to renovate and rehabilitate schools devastated by floods.
Northern Province Education Director Udayakumar also spoke. Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal de Silva, former Minister Piyasena Gamage and Provincial Minister U.D.G. Ariyatilleke were present.
