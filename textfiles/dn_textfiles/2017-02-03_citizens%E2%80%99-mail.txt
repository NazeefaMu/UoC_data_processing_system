Citizens’ Mail

Act impartially on two MSD security officers
I was shocked and amazed to hear how the guardians of the law, the police have acted so despicably, sexually harassing a female Russian tourist on the Mount Lavinia beach recently. The Russian tourist has complained to the police, patrolling on the beach, the two police officers who belong to MSD squeezed her buttocks. What a shame for the police of Sri Lanka!
The Police and the Armed Forces should be exemplary, good mannered and should, protect the public from nefarious acts being meted out to them. Instead these two police officers have acted in a noxious way belittling our country. Further, they have proudly confessed to the Sub Inspector and the Constable who inquired them that they too have been from the Police and argued against the questioning.
Their confession reveals us as they were police officers what they had done was legitimate and they were above the law. The two errant police officers were severely drunk and attacked the Sub Inspector and the Constable and tried to escape from the scene. Fortunately they were nabbed by the Police with the help of the navy.
While thanking the Police and the Navy for arresting them I very earnestly and sincerely urge the IGP to take stern action to these shameless MSD security officers impartially, without showing mercy, considering they belong to Ministerial Security Division.
