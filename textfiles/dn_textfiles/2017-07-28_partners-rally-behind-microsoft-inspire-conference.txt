Partners rally behind Microsoft at Inspire conference

IT professionals from around the world gathered in Washington D.C. recently for Microsoft’s 16th annual partner conference, Inspire. The five-day event, which was held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Centre, provided Microsoft’s partner community with opportunities to help businesses and government agencies succeed in their push towards digital transformation.
In his keynote speech, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke of a new data creation and consumption model - called “the intelligent cloud” - driving Microsoft's product development directions and creating huge opportunities for the vendor's legions of solution provider partners.
He then announced Microsoft’s vision to build artificial intelligence into all apps and services using the integrated platform, Microsoft 365.
Awards were also presented in 34 categories and winners were chosen from a pool of more than 2,800 partner nominees representing 115 countries worldwide.
Sanje Private Limited, the agile document management services pioneer trusted by thousands of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies to combine paper and digital files into a single hub, was recognised as “Sri Lanka Partner of the Year”.
The Microsoft Partner Network gives businesses the resources and tools they need to capitalise on demand; deliver tailor-made IT strategies across public, private, and hybrid cloud; deploy across platforms supporting different technologies, languages and operating systems.
Microsoft operates with over 150 partners in the local market, all of whom are Microsoft licensing specialists highly experienced in Microsoft licensing schemes and products. They also conduct Microsoft product demonstrations and carry out technical, sales and product trainings.
"To reiterate what Satya said, ‘Microsoft has always been a partner-led company, and we’ll always be a partner-led company.’ We thank our partners for their passion, commitment and drive to make us better," said Brian Kealey, Managing Director of Microsoft Sri Lanka and Maldives. “In this day and age, we work in a fast-paced and extremely competitive industry where it is crucial for business information to stay accessible, flexible and secure. Partners like Sanje have not only provided us with an agile platform, but also with the necessary expertise to help us succeed in the emerging market of Sri Lanka.”
Microsoft partners enable businesses and government agencies to shift the status quo, develop digital infrastructure and embrace a digital future. By adopting technology at the heart of each business, Sri Lankan partners are able to accelerate the cycle of innovation, create competitive differentiation and maximise the end-user experience.
