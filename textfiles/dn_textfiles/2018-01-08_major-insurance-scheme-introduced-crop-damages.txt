A new insurance scheme for crop damages was introduced from 2017/2018 Maha cultivation Season proposed by Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake on the instruction of the President, Anuradhapura Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board Deputy Director N.P. Munasinghe told the Daily News.
The scheme approved by the Cabinet was empowered by the circular No. 07/2017 of the Agriculture Secretary. Compensation up to Rs. 40,000 per acre for crop damages caused by wild elephants is granted under the insurance scheme. Munasinghe said that from 2017/2018 Maha season, compensation for paddy, maize, potatoes, big onions, Soya bean, chillies (six varsities) will be granted up to Rs. 40,000 per acre. Farmers has to pay only a Rs.675 premium twice per year for the Yala and Maha seasons for them to be eligible for the scheme.
A steering committee headed by the government agent along with agencies in agriculture sector manage the scheme. Divisional level committees chaired by divisional secretaries maintain the regional payments.Agriculture Research and Production Assistants issue insurance receipts and carry out crop damage inspections and report the process to the committee through district agrarian services deputy commissioners. Munasinghe asked farmers in the Anuradhapura district to inform crop damages caused by wild elephants to the nearest Agriculture Research and Production Assistant or directly to the Anuradhapura Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board for them to have compensation.
They can inform crop damages on 0252222741/0255679094 as well to get relief.
Representatives of farmer organisations said the new scheme has no provisions to cover damages to coconut and several other cultivations that wild elephants destruct more often.
Therefore, they urged the authorities to include them as well in the new scheme.
Munasinghe said the Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board, Anuradhapura has paid Rs. 452.5 million as compensation to 34,607 farmers for drought damages for the 2016/2017 Maha season.
The farmers, however, had not paid any instalment for the crop insurance scheme. Each farmer was paid Rs. 10,000.
The amount will be increased to Rs. 40,000 in future, he said.
