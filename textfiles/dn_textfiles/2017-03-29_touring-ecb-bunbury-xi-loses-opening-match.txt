Touring ECB Bunbury XI loses opening match

The ECB Bunbury XI started their short tour of Sri Lanka with a six-wicket defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka Under 16 development squad at the Colts grounds.
Having elected to bat first the tourists found themselves under pressure through some excellent new ball bowling from Niduka Malshith and Ashan Dilhara (man of the match).
From 19 for 5 it took good application from the tourists to reach 134 with Hamidullah Quadri (Derbyshire) and Sean Sullivan (Essex) showing the way.
The tourists needed to be at their best with the ball to apply any pressure, and if a straightforward chance had been accepted at 55 for 3 it could have created some nervousness in the home dressing room.
This was not to be, and mature batting from Shamaaz and Umayanga guided the hosts to a comfortable and well deserved six-wicket victory.
The tourists, given this was their first outdoor experience for several months, will now know what is required to play against a well prepared opposition in challenging conditions.
This tour has been arranged to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Bunbury Festival, which since its foundation in 1986 by David English CBE, has brought together the best Under-15 cricketers in England and Wales.
The tourist are due to play three more 50-over matches at Colts, Surrey Village and Galle.
Scores:
ECB Bunbury 134 in 45.1 overs (Hami Quadri 37, Sean Sullivan 35, Malshith 2/15, Dilhara 2/24, Tharindu 2/19)
Sri Lanka U16 Development 136-4 in 31.2 overs (Perera 21, Mishara 24, Shamaaz 22 n.o., Umayanga 31 n.o.)
