Emirates to fly one-off A380 to Colombo

Emirates’ iconic A380 aircraft will make a one-off landing at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), Katunayake, on Monday, August 14, as the global airline joins local authorities in the celebration of the airport’s resurfaced runway.
The special flight, operating as EK654 from Dubai, will be the first A380 aircraft to disembark passengers in Sri Lanka after completing a commercial service. The one-off A380 aircraft will arrive at 16:10 hours and be on ground for more than six hours before it returns to Dubai as flight EK655 departing at 22:10 hours, enabling airport executives, VIPs, trade partners and media to enjoy a guided static tour of the double-decker aircraft.
“Colombo has welcomed us from the day Emirates commenced daily flights from Dubai in 1986, just a year after the airline launched its operations. We are honoured to work alongside the city, airport and the Sri Lankan Civil Aviation authorities, to bring our flagship A380 to this vibrant destination.” Senior Vice President, West Asia and Indian Ocean, Ahmed Khoory.
As the first and only airline in the world to operate a fleet of all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft for its passenger flights, Emirates’ operating fleet remains modern and efficient while offering customers a high level of comfort. Since 2008, Emirates has flown over 80 million passengers on its A380 fleet.
