Iflix spreads holiday cheer in Lankan offices

Christmas came early last year in Sri Lanka, thanks to iflix, the world’s leading Internet TV service for emerging markets, offering subscribers unlimited access to thousands of TV shows, movies and more.
Over 20 offices around Sri Lanka participated in the iflix Christmas Office promotion to win an iflix office takeover, with a visit from the iflix team bearing gifts, including one-year complimentary vouchers and iflix merchandise.
Participants also stood the chance to win the grand prize of ten Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones to access iflix’s vast library of thousands of first-run exclusive shows, award-winning TV series, blockbuster movies and more.
The promotion was launched on iflix Sri Lanka’s social media pages and popular hit radio channel, KISS FM 96.9. To join, participants had to create ten iflix accounts within the same office and register their office name together with their contact details on iflix Sri Lanka’s Facebook page. The draw was held lonJanuary 19, with the Corporate Business Development Team from Hayleys Advantis taking home the grand prize.
Firaz Markar, iflix Sri Lanka General Manager commented, “Christmas is a season for thanksgiving and sharing, and we at iflix were incredibly thrilled to spread the Christmas cheer around Sri Lanka. Our members are at the heart of everything we do, and what better way to give back than to surprise some of the most hardworking Sri Lankans. Looking forward to seeing more smiles next Christmas.” Shanaka Keith Dabare, Senior Executive – Corporate Communications for Hayleys Advantis said, “We had fun meeting the iflix team during their visit, and were even more excited to hear that we won the grand prize! Thanks so much iflix for sharing the Christmas spirit with us.” For new subscribers, iflix offers a complimentary one month trial with full access to its world-class service, features and content.
