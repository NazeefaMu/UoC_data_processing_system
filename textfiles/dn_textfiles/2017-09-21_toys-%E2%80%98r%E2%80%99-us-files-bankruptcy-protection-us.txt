Toys ‘R’ Us files for bankruptcy protection in US

Toys ‘R’ Us has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada as it attempts to restructure its debts.
The firm was once a dominant player in the US toy market, but has struggled against larger rivals such as Amazon.
The move casts a shadow over the future of the company’s nearly 1,600 stores and 64,000 employees.However, a US bankruptcy judge approved a loan of more than $2bn to help stabilise the toy chain.
The aim is to give Toys ‘R’ Us money and time to prepare for the upcoming Christmas shopping season.The firm’s European operations are not part of the bankruptcy proceedings and Toys R Us says it does not expect any immediate impact on its UK stores.
Toys R Us’s operations in Australia, about 255 licensed stores and a joint venture partnership in Asia are also not included in the bankruptcy move.The bankruptcy filing is more evidence that traditional retailers are struggling in the US, as online retailers continue to capture market share.
Toys ‘R’ Us said the majority of its stores around the world remained profitable, and would continue to operate as normal through the holiday period, which is when they do most of their business.
But the company is also looking to online sales to secure its future, with recently launched web stores for its products.
GlobalData Retail estimates that in 2016 about 13.7% of all toy sales were made online, up from 6.5% five years ago.
“The past decade has seen a dramatic change in the domestic toy market with new channels, increased competition, and new technology all having a deleterious impact on the sector and traditional toy stores. Unfortunately, Toys ‘R’ Us has not responded effectively to these challenges,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. (BBC)
