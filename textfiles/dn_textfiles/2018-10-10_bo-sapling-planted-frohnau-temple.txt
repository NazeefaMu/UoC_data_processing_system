Bo sapling planted at Frohnau temple

A sapling of the Sacred Sri Maha Bodhi was recently planted at the Frohnau temple in Germany. The sapling was presented to Sri Lankan Ambassador to Germany Karunasena Hettiarachchi by a delegation that comprised of senior Buddhist monks, including North Central Province Atamasthanadhipathi Ven. Dr. Pallegama Siriniwasa Nayaka Thera.
Senior government officials, German Dharmaduta Society trustees Senaka Weeraratne and Ananda Wimaladharma, as well as a Sri Lankan and German Buddhists participated in the ceremony. The sapling was brought to the temple in a procession that was organised by the devotees.
After an alms-giving ceremony was held, special religious observances were conducted to bless the Presidents, Prime Ministers and the people of Sri Lanka and Germany.
Ambassador Hettiarachchi thanked all parties who assisted the Embassy to bring the sacred sapling, especially President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Ambassador also thanked Geological Survey and Mines Bureau Chairman and Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease Project Director Asela Iddawela, as well as representatives of the German Dharmaduta Society for their assistance.
As Sri Lanka and Germany celebrate 65 years of diplomatic relations, the planting of the sapling of the Sri Maha Bodhi at the Frohnau Buddhist temple further strengthened bilateral, religious and cultural ties between the two countries and also created an opportunity for all Buddhists in Germany to pay their reverence to the sacred sapling.
