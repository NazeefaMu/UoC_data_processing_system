ASSET meeting on Nov. 28

The Advancing Specializing Skills for Economic Transformation (ASSET) Project of World University Service of Canada (WUSC) will hold its annual meeting of the Advisory Committee Plus (PAC+) on November 28 in Colombo.
ASSET has developed over 300 private sector partnerships resulting in over 4,000 employment opportunities for youth.
This year's event will comprise direct project partners and include other stakeholders involved in youth skills for employment projects in North, North West, South and East Sri Lanka.
In total, over 100 agencies and partners including members of the private sector, INGOs and donors are expected to attend the event. The five-year ASSET Project funded by the Government of Canada, which commenced in 2014, focuses on strengthening partnerships and collaboration between the private sector, government and training institutions. Using this model of planning for human resources, the project has placed over 4,000 young men and women in employment.
Working in collaboration with the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training, the project provided vocational training and building of technical and soft skills required, especially in the fields of tourism and hospitality; Information and Communication Technology; Construction; and Automotive Maintenance, where there is a significant labour shortage.
Through its focus on youth, including bridging women, youth affected by conflict and persons with disabilities, into the workplace, the project also supported the National Skills Sector Development Programme - which aims to create a more inclusive skills development system for the country by 2020 - through improving links between private sector, government and training providers.
At the PAC+ event, the WUSC plans to share the lessons learnt, achievements and policy recommendations with national level agencies and also share the results from their discussions at the regional labs held in the south, east and north of the country.
