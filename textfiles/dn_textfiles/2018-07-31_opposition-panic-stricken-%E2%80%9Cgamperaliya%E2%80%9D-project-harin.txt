Opposition panic-stricken by “Gamperaliya” project - Harin

The Opposition is panic-stricken by the “Gamperaliya” village development project, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said yesterday. He pointed out that Rs.200 million is allocated for each Divisional Secretariat which will create a significant change in rural development of the country.Minister Fernando also said no financial corruption would occur when utilising these allocations.
“Gamperaliya” is not like the previous regime’s Gama Neguma. There were figures like Mr. 5% and Mr. 10% those days. That is how they took commissions out of these projects. Gamperaliya won’t be like that. The maximum benefit of “Gamperaliya” will be with the people. Therefore,it is no wonder if the Opposition is antagonised and scared by this project,” Minister Fernando pointed out.
He was speaking at a press briefing at the UNP Headquarters,Sirikotha yesterday morning.
