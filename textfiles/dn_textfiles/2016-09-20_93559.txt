Jonathan Brownlee denied in dramatic end

Sunday: Jonny Brownlee's bid to win the World Triathlon Series ended in dramatic fashion at the final race.
He was leading with 700m left on the run but started to struggle, weaving around the road as his legs seized up.
Older brother Alistair caught up and helped him finish second in Mexico, with Jonny then collapsing and being taken away for medical attention while a protest was lodged.
Spain's Mario Mola took the overall title after finishing fifth on Sunday. Officials unanimously ruled against disqualifying Jonny Brownlee because, under International Triathlon Union rules, athletes can receive help from another competitor.
But the result was still enough to provisionally give Mola the overall title by four points from Jonny Brownlee, who is understood to be on a drip.
World Triathlon tweeted to say Brownlee was sent to hospital “for safety precautions”.
South Africa's Henri Schoeman swept past Jonny Brownlee to win Sunday's race in hot and humid conditions, with Alistair Brownlee coming third - a second behind his brother having partly carried him for the final few hundred metres and helping him across the line.
