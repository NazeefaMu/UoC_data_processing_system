While laying out some of his delicious food preparations that definitely titillated taste buds he spilled out details about Nouri, Singapore - the restaurant which celebrates people in all differences and similarities.
The food was a combination and its succulent flavours were certainly a difference from what one normally experience. The food though small in size was really big on taste. The five dishes that were served were all different from one to another.
The Kombu Cured Indian Threadfin Diamond Trevally Alectis Indica Spiced Coconut Cream Caviar was the first dish served and had a pleasing taste. Made of fish the course was soft and welcoming to the palate. It had at truly distinctive taste, one that lingers in your memory. The Coconut cream made it so appealing.
It has influence from Malaysia, Brazil, Indonesia and the Philippines. All the people who belong to these cultures will enjoy this dish recalling their cultures.
The Sri Lankan King Prawns Fennel Emulsion Charred Tomato and Saffron Broth was one the next in line. It was a combination of delicious huge prawns with Tomato. If you are a sea food lover, then this dish will not disappoint you. The spicy dish and was really great to consume.
Saffron has been an important spice throughout the years and Chef Brehm wanted a dish that united the cultures of North India, Morocco, Greece, Iran, and Spain - all in the one dish. The dish was infused with the flavour of saffron.
The Picanha Steak Black Pepper Sauce in Bitter Gourd Salad is absolutely irresistible. The well cooked meat will make your dining experience an unforgettable one. If you are a meat lover it is a must to try out this steak which is so worth.
The Bean Fritter Salted Prawn Turmeric and Coconut Sauce looked very much like a Sri Lankan Wade with dhal curry. The sauce added to the experience, since it was very much like a curry from Thailand or India.
Last but not least the desserts - Caramelized Oranges, Orange blossoms and Almond Emulsion Bergamot Pate De Fruit with Ceylon Tea and Ice Cream.
What an absolutely lovely way to end your meal! Sweet and melting in the mouth it was so inviting and succulent.
Every dish was different from the other and diverse. It really is marvelous to think how Chef Ivan Brehm has done all of this. The man is a true genius in the kitchen. His restaurant in Singapore, Nouri when translated means - To Nourish and Brehm says the restaurant not only nourishes just the body and mind, but the liminal bond between the chef and the consumer.
“I come from Brazil and my dishes are meant to evoke a sense of familiarity in the dining, regardless from where the diner is from. The Intention of the course today was to bring some memories out of you. I have been a chef for all my adult life and it has been 17 years. I am blessed to get up every morning and do what I love doing which is cooking. Though it is a profession that requires a lot, you get a lot back in return,” said Brehm.
Brehm remarked that Nouri has won many awards and that they are constantly trying to do better than the day before.
“Food is a unifier of cultures. Every time I sample a dish from a different culture, it reminds me of a dish from my own culture. I always try to bring into my dishes, food from different cultures. They are a combination from across the world. The food at Nouri is very diverse and inclusive. Because Nouri is in Asia we always try to use the Asian influence. We have a lot of dishes based on familiar tastes presented in unfamiliar combinations,” explained Brehm.
Brehm, who has an impressive resume, having worked at famous restaurants, commented that you need to cook with an open mind and that the goal of Nouri is to create one food that reminds people of different cultures.
“We want to remind people that before they are Singaporean, Japanese or Brazilian, they are people that belong to a bigger family. Our food is about reminding them of that. A lot of skill, research and hard work go into what we do. Most of all we love what we do,” stated Brehm.
