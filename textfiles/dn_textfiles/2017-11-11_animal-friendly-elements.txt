Animal-friendly elements

Animal Rights Activist, Attorney Lalani Perera says the Budget 2018 include animal-friendly elements, which are laudable, Legal Counsel Lalani Perera said.
“The Budget 2018 is not just people-friendly, but it also has animal-friendly elements. The proposal to move away from the caged zoo concept to an open cage concept at the Dehiwala Zoo might initiate more animal welfare plans, especially space-wise.
We have been trying for more space for all caged animals for years. Globally, the trend is to close down zoos. We in Sri Lanka request to open animal sanctuaries instead of opening zoos,” he said. “We really hope this will not be merely a proposal. The fund allocations for the proposals should be correctly used,” Perera said.
