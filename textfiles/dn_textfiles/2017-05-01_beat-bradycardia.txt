Beat Bradycardia!

This week Consultant Clinical and Interventional Cardiologist Dr.Mohan Jayatilake (MD, MRCP) speaks about Bradycardia (slow heart rate than normal), one of the common heart problems among people, especially the elderly. 
Q - What is Bradycardia ?
A - When the heart beats very slowly it is called Bradycardia. A Heart rate of 60 to 100 a minute while at rest is considered normal in most people. If your heart beats less than 60 per minute it is considered slower than normal.

* In young people and athletes who are fit and healthy, the heart rate less than 60 beats per minute is a normal variation.
* In other people Bradycardia is a sign of problem with the electrical system of the heart.
* Heart rate may fall below 60 during sleep at times in most of the normal people.
Q - What are the symptoms of Bradycardia ?
1. Fatigue or feeling tired.
2. Dizziness or light headedness.
3. Confusion with reduced mental capacity.
4. Fainting or near-fainting spells
5. Shortness of breath
6. Excessive tiredness during normal activity.
7. In extreme cases cardiac arrest may occur
Q - Who are most affected? How and when ?
A - Heart has natural electrical conduction pathways formed by nerve fibers. When the nerve conduction travels through this pathway heart beats occur. The electrical pathway has to go through Sino Atrial (SA) node and Atrio Ventricular (AV) node within heart muscles. These are called heart’s natural pacemakers.
Q - How is Bradycardia diagnosed?
A – Review your symptoms, medical and family history with complete examination by your doctor. Some people can check their own pulse over the wrist and count it per minute for the heart rate.
a. ECG test – primary test for evaluating Bradycardia. ECG determines the kind of Bradycardia
b. Holtermonitor - a portable ECG device worn on a belt or shoulder strap. It can record the heart’s activity over 24 hour period. Intermittent Bradycardia can be detected after evaluation of the report.
c. Event Recorder - Portable ECG device monitors heart activity over a few weeks to few months. This permits the doctor to determine the patient’s heart rhythm at the time of the symptoms.
d. Tilt table test - This test helps to understand how Bradycardia contributes to your fainting spells. The patient lies down flat on a special table and then the table is tilted as if you were standing up. If change of position causes fainting spells, that will help to establish a link between heart rate and fainting episode. Then some form of Bradycardia due to faintishness can be ruled out.
e. Exercise test - Heart rate increase in response to physical activity during treadmill test in patient with normal variation of Bradycardia.
f. Lab tests - To find out contributing factors such as infection, hypothyroidism or an electrolyte imbalance.
g. Sometimes sleep apnea too can cause Bradycardia. You may undergo test to monitor your sleep.

Q - What treatment options are available for Bradycardia ?
A – The availability of treatment depends on what causes it.
1. If damage to the electrical system causes severe Bradycardia, a device called “pacemaker” is inserted. It is placed under the skin with a wire going in to the heart. This artificial pacemaker gives electrical impulses to the heart to contract. People older than 60 are more likely to have this type of Bradycardia that requires a pace maker.
2. Treat hypothyroidism with thyroxin tablets.
3. Treat and electrolyte imbalance with electrolytes sodium or potassium. (Na or K)
4. If a drug is causing Bradycardia your doctor may either adjust the dose or prescribe a different medicine.
The goal of treatment is to raise the heart rate so your body gets the blood it needs. If severe Bradycardia is not treated, it can lead to fainting as well as fits or even death.
Q - How can we prevent it or at least the complications ?
A – Identify this problem with Bradycardia with symptoms and perform ECG and Holter Monitor test.
1. Elderly people even though they are not having symptoms, regular checkups should be done.
2. Any other person with frequent falls causing injuries to the body and seizures (Fits) as well as cardiac arrest should be prevented by identifying and treating Bradycardia.
Emergency medical treatment to increase heart rate followed by permanent pace maker implantation is necessary.
Some permanent pacemakers which are called I.C.D ( Implantable Cardiovertable Defibrillator ) can deliver a shock to a person who gets irregular rapid heart rates or cardiac arrest due to Bradycardia.

Q - What lifestyle changes are recommended to keep one’s heart healthy?
A - Bradycardia is often the result of another heart condition. Follow the below steps to lead a heart- healthy lifestyle .
1. Heart healthy diet – lot of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and non fat dairy products.
2. Regular exercises
3. Loosing weight
4. Stop smoking
5. Managing high blood pressure, diabetics or high cholesterol
