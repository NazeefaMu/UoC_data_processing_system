A key witness in the controversial RADA case yesterday told the Colombo High Court that they were asked to move out of the Mavil Aru area by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa since they were negotiating with Emil Kanthan, the LTTEer.
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said he and a group including Ven.Athuraliye Rathana Thera, Akmeemana Dayaratne Thera who reached the Mavil Aru area to open the Mavil Aru anicut sluice gate from the clutches of LTTE were told to move out of the area by the then President and Defence Secretary.

He told Court that Minister Champika Ranawaka had been informed by former President that they were negotiating the Mavil Aru issue with a LTTE leader called Emil Kanthan.
