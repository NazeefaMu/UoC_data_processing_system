Plans to uplift local dairy industry

Since fresh cows milk helps man's healthy life by providing essential proteins and salts to the body, the Rural Economy Ministry has drawn up a strategic plan to uplift the local dairy industry. The plan drawn up under 13 units also includes the uplifting of small scale and commercial scale dairy farmers.
Popularising the drinking of fresh cows milk and provision of solutions to dairy farmers affected by vagaries of weather and climatic changes is underway, the Ministry said in a press release. The plan also envisaged seven development targets including poverty alleviation provision of a nutritious meal to all, encouraging healthy life, gender equality, sustainable consumption and making a contribution towards the country's economic development, the Ministry said in a press release. The Ministry hoped to move forward in this task by creating close corporation between the entrepreneur and the government.
It is also envisaged to discourage the use of plastics in wrapping milk related products and promote the distribution of a cup of milk among school children.
