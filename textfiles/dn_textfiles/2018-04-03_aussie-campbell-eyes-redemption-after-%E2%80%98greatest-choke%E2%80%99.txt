Aussie  Campbell eyes redemption after  ‘greatest choke’

GOLD COAST: A defiant Cate Campbell has promised a return to her best form at the Commonwealth Games as the Aussie swimmer looks to exorcise the demons of her Olympic flop two years ago.
The 25-year-old is blazing the comeback trail after taking a year out from the sport, prompted by what Campbell described as the “greatest choke in Olympic history” in Rio -- her sixth-place finish in the 100 metres freestyle final.
Campbell, who is limbering up for the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast this week, rediscovered her mojo at the national trials, where she dominated the 100m freestyle and broke Australian records in the 50m free and 50m butterfly.
“I definitely missed being part of the team,” she told reporters. “To be back in the green and gold, it really makes my heart beat a little bit faster.”
Campbell was the red-hot favourite to win the Olympic 100m title in 2016 and led at the turn before fading badly, allowing Canada's Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel to come through and tie for gold. - AFP
