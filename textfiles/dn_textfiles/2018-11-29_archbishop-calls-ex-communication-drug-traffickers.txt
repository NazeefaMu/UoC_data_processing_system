Archbishop calls for ex-communication of drug traffickers

Even death as a punishment could be justified for drug traffickers as their crimes are such that they in fact amount to killing of innocent youth who become addicts, said Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm, Cardinal Ranjith.
The Cardinal was speaking at a mammoth prayer rally at St Mary’s Church, Tudella, on Sunday, to seek divine intervention against the drug menace.
The faithful from 10 parishes belonging to the Tudella diocese arrived in procession to the Tudella Church, for the prayer rally.
Cardinal Ranjith referred to the Holy Scripture and said Jesus Christ has said, “But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin, it would be better for you to have a large millstone tied around your neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea,” (Mathew 18.6).
He said that if people amass wealth by indulging in activities like drug trafficking that kill children and youth, punishment that justifies their crime should be meted out to them.
He called upon the 10 parish priests who led processions from their churches to identify the drug traffickers, big and small, whether politically backed or with other influence, and if they belonged to the congregation of the church, to ex-communicate them.
Cardinal Ranjith instructed the parish priests, that the identified drug traffickers should not be given ‘Holy Communion’, as they have to be classed as criminals.
These drugs are smuggled into the country and systematically distributed among the youth. ‘Black money’ so earned would not last long and those who indulge in such activities have to account for them to God, he said.
If someone earns through others’ pain and suffering, they would have to pay it back very dearly as those crimes would cause God’s wrath, the Archbishop said.
Cardinal Ranjith said that the areas of Ja-Ela, Gampaha and Negombo are notorious for drug trafficking. So, if any Christian is involved in the notorious business, they are not Christians or Catholics. He urged those who are concerned about others’ lives to team up with the priests to apprehend such criminals who distribute drugs and bring them under the law.
