‘Lanka Kumaru’ on Beijing TV

A cartoon film titled 'Lanka Kumaru' (Lankan Prince) is to be produced by the 'Beijing KAKU Media' affiliated to the Beijing Television Company to mark the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka.
A ceremony to introduce the film was held under the patronage of Sri Lanka Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and distinguished guests at the Pudong hall of the Kerry Hotel in Beijing recently. The film with 30 episodes is based on a true story of a Sri Lankan Prince who visited China in ancient times. The Beijing KAKU Media has finished writing the script and other research work. They expect to complete the production work within the next six months, the Prime Minister's Office in a press release issued yesterday said. Beijing TV boasts nearly 900 million viewers worldwide.
Sri Lanka could gain wide international publicity through the film, Sri Lankan special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama attending the ceremony said. Beijing KAKU Media Deputy General Manager Song Yi said they want to promote more television exchange programme between Sri Lanka and China.
Town Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake, Sri Lanka Ambassador in China Dr. Karunasena Kodituwakku and other representatives from both countries were present.
