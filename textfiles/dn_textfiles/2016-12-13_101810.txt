Dengue eradication programme in Ampara

 
The Nintavur Medical Office of Health carried out a fogging programme to eradicate dengue mosquito breeding places in and around the Nintavur Divisional Secretariat as the number of dengue patients identified and admitted to the hospital for treatment in Ampara is on the increase.
Thsleema Baseer, Medical Officer of Health Nintavur said 120 patients were identified in Nintavur. Public Health Inspectors, police officers and the general public have been instructed to clean places where dengue could possibly breed, she said.
The MOH has filed 85 cases in court against the house-owners who have ignored the warning and instructions given by the PHIs and Police.
