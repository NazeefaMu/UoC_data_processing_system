MICH condemns terror attack in Iran

President of the Moors’ Islamic Cultural Home (MICH) and former Colombo Mayor Omar Kamil in a statement condemned the recent terrorist attack on a military parade in Iran.
Kamil, a former Sri Lankan envoy to Tehran, called upon the international community to come together and exert pressure to stop such ruthless and barbaric acts.
Excepts from the statement follows:
"The Moors’ Islamic Cultural Home joins the entire world community in its condemnation on the recent brazen terrorist attack carried out at a military parade in Ahvaz, Iran and conveys its heartfelt sympathies on the Iranians including civilian attendees who lost their lives due to this blatant attack.
"While condemning this dastardly act of the separatists, the MICH joins hands with all Muslims and other Sri Lankans in calling upon the world community not to support any separatist movements or terrorist organizations in such attacks where over 25 people were killed and more than 60 injured including the innocent men, women and children who were watching the military parade."
