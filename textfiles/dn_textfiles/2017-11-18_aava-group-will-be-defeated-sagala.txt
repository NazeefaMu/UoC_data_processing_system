Aava group will be defeated - Sagala

Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka yesterday assured that the government would not allow the so-called Aava group, or any other criminal gang, to raise its head in the North.
The Minister in a statement yesterday stressed the Police had unleashed its full strength to curb the activities of the criminal gang and bring its members to book.
“It was reported that the gang had launched eight attacks in the Northern Province recently. The Police have already arrested six individuals in connection with these incidents and further investigations are underway to arrest other members of the group,” the Minister said in a statement.
To expedite investigations, Police have cancelled the leave of all officers in the Jaffna Police area, the Minister added.
“We don’t want to restrict our operations against criminal gangs to the Northern Province. Similar operations are already underway in other parts of the country as well, and the Police have made significant progress in this regard. Crucial details of some ‘masterminds’ operating the underworld from overseas have already been uncovered,” the Minister also said expressing confidence that the Police will soon be able to apprehend them.
Meanwhile, our Jaffna Group Correspondent reports that the main suspect Sathyavel Nathan Nishanthan, alias “Nisha Victor,” identified as the leader of the Aava group who escaped Police custody at the Mallakam Magistrate Court yesterday, was rearrested by the Police within a few hours.
Nisha Victor who was arrested in connection with a number of cases in Jaffna, including sword attacks against Police in the Koppai area in Jaffna was granted bail by the Jaffna Magistrate Court on Wednesday (15).
It was reported that as no one came forward to bail Victor out, he escaped from Police custody when he was brought to the Mallakam Magistrate’s Court. However, Police re-arrested him at a relative’s house.
