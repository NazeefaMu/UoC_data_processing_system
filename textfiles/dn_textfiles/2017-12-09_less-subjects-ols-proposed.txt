Less subjects for O/Ls proposed

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the ministry was exploring the possibility to reduce compulsory subjects of the O/L Exam.
The Minister was addressing a media briefing held in Kuliyapitiya, Kurunegala on December 8. O/L students now study nine subjects, and they will be facing only six compulsory subjects at the exam in the future.
Students will have to face practical tests for other subjects under well-designed evaluation procedures, the Minister said.
The new change would be implemented for a better education system, he said.
