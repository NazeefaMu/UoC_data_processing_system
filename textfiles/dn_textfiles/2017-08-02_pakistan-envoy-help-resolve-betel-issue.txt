Pakistan envoy to help resolve betel issue

Pakistan has pledged support to resolve the growing crisis faced by about 5,000 Sri Lankan betel growing families due to a new tax imposed by Pakistan.
On June 21, the Government of Pakistan imposed a Pakistani Rs 200 (SL Rs. 291) per kg of new regulatory tax on betel leaf imports from Sri Lanka. This was on top of the existing Pakistani Rs 343 (SL Rs. 500) per kilo of Pakistani customs duty imposed on Lankan betel leaf as of June 21.
“We will give favourable consideration to the betel tax faced by Sri Lankan exporters,” assured acting High Commissioner of Pakistan Dr. Sarfraz Ahmad Khan Sipra when he met Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, Industry and Commerce Ministry Secretary Chinthaka Lokuhetti, DG Commerce of Sri Lanka Sonali Wijeratne and representatives of betel leaf exporters of Sri Lanka, recently.
Minister Bathiudeen added: “Pakistan has imposed a new regulatory tax on Sri Lankan betel imports. This has affected more than 5,000 farmers and their families in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura and Puttalam Districts. Pakistan is the only country where Sri Lanka’s betel leaves are exported. Sri Lankan betel is also the main betel leaf type imported from Pakistan. Lankan growers have informed us that there is a big yield in betel harvest this year but due to the new tax by Pakistan, they are unable to recover even their export duty costs. This issue can impact our bilateral trade volumes as well.”
According to the Department of Commerce, in 2016, bilateral trade between Sri Lanka and Pakistan stood at $368 million, showing a marginal decline from 2015’s $ 370 million.
Acting High Commissioner Dr Sipra said: “If there is any problem, we will resolve it. I shall take this issue up with my government.
We need to have a concerted and conjoined effort to develop our future trade. The regulatory import tax imposed by Pakistan on betel leaves is not only for Sri Lankan betel leaves but for betel leaf imports from all countries as well-across the board."
