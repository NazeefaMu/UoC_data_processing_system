Fire at Meethotamulla garbage dump

A fire broke out at the garbage dump in Meethotamulla last night causing panic among residents of the area. The fire brigade which was immediately deployed to the area managed to bring the fire under control, said the police media unit.
Area residents were temporarily asked to evacuate the area to avoid breathing in fumes rising from the fire.
The garbage dump has been a site of protest for the past few years with area residents protesting over it while authorities have taken few measures to contain the growth of the landfill site that accommodates all the garbage from Colombo.
In 2015, an oil pipeline leak led to a fire erupting and damaging four houses in the Meethotamulla-Orugodawatte area.
