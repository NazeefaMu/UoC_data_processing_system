SLC resolves Pallekele Test hotel mix-up

The hotel mix-up between Sri Lanka Cricket and Earls Regency Hotel has virtually been resolved with SLC awaiting the final confirmation from the hotel by 9 am today for the release of the rooms to accommodate the Sri Lanka and England cricket teams for the second cricket Test to be played at Pallekele from November 14-18.
SLC CEO Ashley de Silva said yesterday that Aitken Spence had agreed to release the 78 rooms required by SLC.
“We looked for an alternate hotel and we were not happy with it but now Aitken Spence is going to release the rooms to us,” said De Silva.
“We spoke to the tour operators and negotiated with them. Aitken Spence must be moving the people already booked into some other hotel and making their own arrangements. We are in the process of finalising it. We are waiting for the final written confirmation from Aitken Spence today,” he said.
SLC were caught up in a situation where the rooms they had booked for the Test match were given out to UK-based tour groups and they had two choices - to find an alternate hotel or to move the Test match from Pallekele to a different location which would have been Colombo.
Thankfully the issue seems to have been resolved without the Test match not having to be moved.
