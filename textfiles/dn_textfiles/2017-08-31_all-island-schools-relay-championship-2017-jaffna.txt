All Island Schools Relay Championship - 2017 in Jaffna

All Island Schools Relay Championship was a very interesting and proud event among many tournaments organized by the Education Ministry to improve the school sports in Sri Lankan children. From its start in 1984, this championship has brought many children to both local and international platforms and after so many years it came to an end in 2004.
However, as advised and guided by the present Education Minister, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the championship started again last year from Kandy. The second edition of this comeback is all set to take place in Duraiyappa Ground, Jaffna, on September 08, 09 and 10 with Milo from Nestlé Lanka PLC coming in as the main sponsor.
The minister decided to hold this championship in Jaffna in the Northern Province, especially with the prime objective of generating teamwork, brotherhood, corporation and reconciliation among the children.
There will be 38 boys’ and girls’ relay events, divided in the categories of Under 12, Under 14, Under 16, Under 18, and Under 20 in this year's championship. 2900 boys from 164 schools and 2100 girls from 138 schools are expected to take part in envents with a total of 5100 students from all over the country.
The opening ceremony will take place on September 8 with V.S. Radha Krishnan, the Education State Minister being the chief guest and Dr. K. Serveshvaran, Provincial Education Minister, Northern Province, as the guest of honour. The closing ceremony will be attended by C.V.
Vigneshvaran, the Chief Minister of the North Central Province, as the chief guest and Sunil
