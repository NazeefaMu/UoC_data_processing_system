‘SLPP has networks to spread false information’

Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said it has come to the notice of the government that members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) had set up special media networks to spread misinformation to the public.
“We have come to know that they have hired 40 people to write stories that would provoke ethnic clashes and another 40 to spread false information on what the government is doing,” said the Minister, addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing, yesterday.
“We know where they operate from,” he added.
The minister was responding when a journalist asked him about various misconstrued stories which have been appearing with regard to what happens within the Cabinet every week.
