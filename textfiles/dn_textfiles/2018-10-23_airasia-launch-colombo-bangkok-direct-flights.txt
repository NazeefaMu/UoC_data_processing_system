AIRASIA to LAUNCH COLOMBO-BANGKOK DIRECT FLIGHTS

AirAsia will launch four-time weekly direct flights between Colombo and Bangkok from December 14, with a special promotional fare, an airline press release said.
Operated by Thai AirAsia (flight code FD), this direct route to Bangkok in Thailand will be the airline group’s second connection from Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport which includes direct route to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (flight code AK).
Santisuk Klongchaiya, Chief Executive Officer of Thai AirAsia said, “Sri Lanka has always been a promising destination for AirAsia as we have connected the country to a wider network via Kuala Lumpur for nearly a decade. To This time we are relaunching the flight from Colombo to Bangkok to provide the people of Sri Lanka with even greater connectivity that comes with attractive low fares to create more demand. We are strongly confident that our return to the market will stimulate travel appetite and demonstrate our commitment to generating more traffic to Sri Lanka to fuel tourism and economic growth for the country. Sri Lanka is such a hidden gem in South Asia with undiscovered potential. We therefore have high expectation for a healthy market reception for this new route.”
Thai AirAsia operates the widest network in domestic Thailand and offers several international connections to other prominent cities in Asia. Travellers from Sri Lanka who wish to explore beyond Bangkok can enjoy a convenient Fly-Thru service with just a single-time baggage check-in from Colombo and make a brief transit in Bangkok to continue seamlessly to other destinations in Thailand and beyond. Sri Lankan travellers can take advantage of the convenient flight schedule that gives them more time to spend abroad by arriving in Bangkok in the early morning and depart in the evening.
