Caution against rat fever spreading now

The public should take precautions to protect themselves from Rat Fever (Leptospirosis) with the onset of rain when the the virus tends to spread. Around 1,400 Leptospirosis cases had been reported this year up to now, Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) Director and Epidemiologist Dr. Paba Palihawadana said.
Dr. Palihawadana said all information about Leptospirosis and about the drug Doxycycline used to prevent it can be obtained by dialling the 0710107107 hot line.The service is free and available 24 hours with specialised doctors replying all inquiries.
Dr. Palihawadana said those vulnerable to the disease include farmers, persons who clean drains, persons who work in mines, marshy lands, canals and persons who swim or play in contaminated water.They should contact the nearest PHI or MOH office and obtain the Doxycycline dose issued free.They need to take two tablets before their work and need to also consume plenty of water while working.The tablets can give around 90% protection for one week’s period.Two tablets should be taken until work ends.
The main symptoms of rat fever are abrupt onset of high fever, mild flu, chills, conjunctival suffusion, muscle tenderness (notable in calf and lumber areas), intense headache, jaundice area and decrease in passing urine. It is vital to seek medical treatment as early as possible from a Government hospital.
Rat fever can be cured if medical treatment is given on time. It is however difficult to save the life of a patient who seeks medical treatment at the latter stage where renal, heart failure and other symptoms appear, Dr. Palihawadana said.
