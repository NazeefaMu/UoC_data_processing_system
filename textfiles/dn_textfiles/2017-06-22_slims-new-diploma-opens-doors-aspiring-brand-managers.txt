SLIM's new diploma opens doors to aspiring brand managers

Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) announced the latest intake for the Diploma in Strategic Brand Management (DSBM) at the Kingsbury Hotel, recently.
The intake is now open for persons who aspire to excel in brand management.
Students who enrol for DSBM can complete the 12-month programme at SLIM Business School, Colombo.
DSBM is the first strategic branding qualification in Sri Lanka catering to those who aspire to become fully-fledged brand managers, bestowing individuals with essential skills in strategic brand management.
These individuals will muster skills to develop, nurture and manage brands effectively to add value to their companies and company brands.
The 12-month-long part-time programme which covers all aspects of branding, offers students an integrated learning experience via a practical launch of a brand.
The DSBM course covers vital areas such as the role of a brand manager, brand marketing, brand planning, strategic implications in branding and managing brands overtime.
Vice President of SLIM, Pradeep Edward who is the Director/CEO of GAP Holdings said that DSBM endows necessary skills in marketers to build valuable brands by utilising internationally proven, innovative branding strategies and practices.
"One specialty of SLIM– DSBM is that students get an opportunity to experience practical aspects of learning. They receive hands-on experience in practically launching a new brand. Fresh and innovative brands launched by DSBM students have created many opportunities for them in the corporate sector in the past," he said. SLIM employs the cream of marketing personnel in the country who hold senior positions in the corporate sector as resource persons to conduct DSBM lectures that are benchmarked with global standards.
In addition, several classes will be conducted by visiting lecturers to provide wider industry experience.
Pradeep Edward also shed light on a wide spectrum of activities SLIM students are exposed to, beyond marketing studies.
“The SLIM Students Council offers SLIM student members networking opportunities with peers/lecturers and to take part in national-level events conducted by SLIM such as SLIM-NASCO Brand Excellence, Effie, People’s Awards, Marketers’ Nite, and SLIM Toastmasters,” he said.
The guest speaker of the SLIM-DSBM inauguration, Rainco Group Chief Operating Officer Aroos Ahamed spoke on the power of branding and its effects and implications on consumers.
“Branding is a magical tool that facilitates marketers, creating an edge over competitors for their products and services.
Brand managers are a rare breed of individuals who work constantly on making ‘brand loyal’ customers and grooming them to become ambassadors of the company’s brands,” said Ahamed.
He drew examples from several top brands in the world and explained in detail how they earned the reputation of ‘top-of the-mind’ brands.
SLIM CEO and Executive Director Sanath Senanayake is of the opinion that it enhances practical value and real world application of DSBM by identifying the needs of the industry, ‘in order to ensure that we produce diplomats who could cater to the demands of modern marketing and branding’.
He noted that the SLIM- DSBM course content, syllabus and text books are benchmarked with varying global marketing atmospheres as well as to cater to current local industry requirements. Credible and value adding courses/training programmes and affordable prices of SLIM have made the marketing fraternity and the corporate sector in Sri Lanka to perceive SLIM as an invaluable mentoring entity for over a period of four decades.
