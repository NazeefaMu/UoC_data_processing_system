Matara – Kataragama Railway Extension: CMC will not compromise on quality: Project GM Tang Ming

The China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation, better known as CMC is a Chinese government entity and will not compromise on quality, safety or stake its reputation for any reason, said CMC’s Project General Manager for the Matara – Kataragama Railway Extension Project (Phase I) Tang Ming.
He was responding to allegations made by former team leader appointed by the project consultants Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) at a press conference which was aired over electronic media a few days ago.
“We are deeply concerned about the allegations,” he added.
The Transport Ministry awarded the designing and construction of phase one of the Matara – Kataragama Railway Extension to China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation while appointing the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau as consultants. Phase one which is the 27km stretch from Matara to Beliatta will cost the Sri Lanka government USD 278 million and is financed by China’s Exim Bank.
“CMC with a staff of over 2000 stationed worldwide is experienced in the construction and upgrading of railway lines and has successfully completed the construction of the 158km Ankara - Istanbul high-speed railway project in Turkey which commenced in 2006 at a cost of USD 1.27 billion, before engaging in the construction of phase one of the Matara - Kataragama Railway Extension Project in 2010,” Tang Ming said.
“CMC has also been awarded the locomotive and carriage and construction plants, and component assembly project in Myanmar in 2013 at a cost of USD 102 million and in 2015 was awarded the high-speed upgrading of the 926 km Teheran – Mashhad railway project costing USD 1.69 billion. All the above projects are on a design and build basis and are financed by China Exim Bank. In addition, the company has supplied many Diesel locomotives and passenger carriages to Pakistan, Iran, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Turkmenistan, Brazil, Cuba and even Sri Lanka,” said CMC’s Project Manager in Sri Lanka Wu Fan Yu.
“We have cast over 300 concrete girders for the Southern Railway Extension Project of which only less than 1 percent failed certification.
“These girders have been discarded and the rest have been launched under the supervision of the CECB and Ministry of Transport. It is the CECB that has been appointed by the Ministry of Transport to approve and monitor the design and construction of Phase one of the Matara – Kataragama Railway Extension and engineers from CECB are expected to approve contract material submissions, contract methods and monitor every step of the construction process. It is only once they certify that we can proceed with the construction or move on to the next step,” explained Tang. “It is true that the project is behind schedule. There are many reasons for the delay including adverse weather conditions including delays caused by CECB,” he added.
