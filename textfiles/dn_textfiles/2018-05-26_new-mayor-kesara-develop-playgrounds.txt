KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP
New Mayor Kesara to develop playgrounds

That’s good that the new Mayor of Kandy Kesara Senanayake is on the correct track looking to upgrade all playgrounds which are badly in need of up uplifting. A look back into playgrounds reveals that it was introduced in 1938. The first was the Rakade grounds and also known as the Welpitiya playgrounds now it is called P.T. Rajan playgrounds. Then came the Victoria Drive playground and the third was Deyanawella playground now known as Edmund Silva Playground. At present there are over 20 playgrounds, which help the area sportsmen at grass root level. Today there are some top coaches in these play grounds department but sad to say in the last three years few community centers where they promote indoor had to be closed due to members’ rivalry. All playgrounds are pocket size. No matches can be played; every playground in recent times has come out with side net wickets. For coaches to conduct their classes for football, rugger and hockey there is no proper grounds. Only ground they had for matches was the Bogambara stadium that too was taken over by the sports ministry by force and the loss of this ground is badly felt. When it was under the Municipality the ground charge was only a few hundred rupees. Today it is sky-high and poor schools and clubs are finding it difficult to pocket out this money.Hillwood
