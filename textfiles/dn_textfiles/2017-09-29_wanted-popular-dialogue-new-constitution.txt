Wanted: Popular dialogue on new Constitution

The Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly is now made public. However, in the wake of anxieties aroused on account of constant postponement of Local Government and Provincial Council elections no serious debate or dialogue has taken place. In its place we see only the continuation of former rhetorical outbursts of communal minded forces against it. Even the media does not seem to give it sufficient prominence.
Public agitation against the existing Constitution started immediately after its promulgation. Countless number of protest campaigns was held by civil organisations and almost all parties except the United National Party, which introduced it. Finally, even the UNP decided to change it.
Two issues dominated the protests. One was the need for a solution to the national question. Other was the need to end the authoritarian Executive Presidency. So no Constitutional reform would be meaningful if these two issues could not be satisfactorily resolved by it.
The proposed but yet not finalized reforms gives the public another chance at reviving the dialogue on these two subjects. Though the Interim Report dwells upon more issues of equal significance it is our attempt hereto analyze the behavior of principal political parties on the above two issues. As the United National Party has not made any reservations on the Report we conclude that it is in agreement with it.
National question
The other party in the Government – the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has expressed its reservations. More importantly it has in the beginning of its submission the following sentence: “The first paragraph of page one of the draft interim report of the Steering Committee shall be amended as follows. ‘Agreed principles/ formulae’ shall be substituted by ‘negotiated principles/formulae’. This means that it has not given any definitive approval. It may change its stand in the course of the debate, especially with regard to devolution of power and the abolition of the Executive Presidency. This is by a party which ruled the country for 14 years under the existing Constitution. One could also recall that each time it came to power in the interim period it pledged to remove the Executive Presidency and arrive at a negotiated solution to the national question.
It has particularly opposed to any change of Articles 1-9 of the existing Constitution. These refer to the nature of the state, place of Buddhism and the executive presidency. Incidentally the Joint Opposition also objects to any change in the same articles. While the JO totally rejects the Interim Report, the SLFP provisionary does not agree with it, allowing it room to join the JO, if conditions suit them. One may be excused for presuming that the fifth column of the JO in the SLFP wants to remain the Government and enjoy the privileges of office as long as possible before joining the JO at a decisive point of time. It is clear that there is no policy difference between them. They are like twin brothers.
The SLFP’s stand is not only intransigent but also confrontational as seen by its following comment with reference to Article 9 which deals with the place of Buddhism and other articles on the nature of State etc.: “The Sri Lanka Freedom party is not in agreement to any other alternative proposal in the draft drafted by the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly.” This means it is not ready to negotiate and other parties should agree to their diktat. This is despite all formulations keeping the essence of the present formulations intact. It is regarding matters that are in essence not changed by the Interim Report.
Executive Presidency
The SLFP in a volte-face now wants to retain the Executive Presidency as it is. Yet its President who has repeatedly promised to abolish it keeps silent with no comment. People are entitled to know whether he too shares the new view. Should he keep his pledge to the entire people or obey the party? It is a matter of conscience.
In contrast, the attitude of the Tamil National Alliance is more flexible. It helps national reconciliation. While it has presented its proposals, it nevertheless says that “In the interest of reaching an acceptable consensus, the TNA will be willing to consider agreement with the main principles articulated in the Interim Report, if the same are agreeable to the two main parties”. According to the Liam Fox Agreement they are also obliged to do so. The TNA position is most welcome.
The JO’s strategy is to defeat the new Constitution when a vote is taken in it in Parliament. It is also to use its twin brother the SLFP to torpedo it before that. In any case the final act of the JO campaign is likely to be the vote in Parliament in which it hopes to prevent the Government receiving a two-thirds majority. As the struggle for a new Constitution hots up there are other minor parties and groups that will join the ethno-religious extremists against it.
It is up to the other parties, especially the Left and civil society to campaign for the safe passage of the draft Constitution in Parliament. The intellectuals, trade unions and mass organizations have a special responsibility to consider it their duty to do s. The present slide to past practices and reneging on election pledges could also be halted or reversed only by such a renewed enhancement of mass action.
It would be a catastrophe if this chance for national reconciliation and unity is defeated again as it happened throughout the last 65 years. It would be the greatest betrayal of the future generations. If it happens history will not absolve us.
