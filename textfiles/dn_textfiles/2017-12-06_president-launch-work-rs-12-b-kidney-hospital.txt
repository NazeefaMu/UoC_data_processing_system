President to launch work on Rs. 12 b kidney hospital

President Maithripala Sirisena will lay the foundation stone today for the proposed kidney hospital to be built at a cost of Rs. 12 billion, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe and other invitees will take part in the ceremony to be held in Polonnaruwa today. The hospital, which will be the largest kidney hospital in South East Asia, is to be constructed in a 16-acre land.
The hospital will consist of 200 beds and another 100 dialysis beds. The construction work of the hospital will commence before the end of this year. The project is funded by the Chinese government, he said. At present, around 6,500 kidney patients from the Polonnaruwa district and another 13,000 kidney patients from the Anuradhapura district undergo dialysis or require facilities for dialysis. They will be benefitted by constructing the hospital, he added.
