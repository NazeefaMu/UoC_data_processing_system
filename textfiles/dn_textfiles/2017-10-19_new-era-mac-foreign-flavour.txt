New era for MAC with foreign flavour

The apex athletic event in the mercantile calendar, the annual Mercantile Athletic Championship (MAC) organized by Mercantile Athletic Federation (MAF) for the 34th occasion will be held on October 20 to 22 at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Sports Complex, Diyagama.
Around 2,000 athletes from 53 mercantile firms already confirmed their participation. An Indian team will also take part this opening a new chapter in Sri Lankan mercantile sports. There will be events in 14 different age group categories from 25 to 60 years for men and women. Altogether 330 events will be conducted including 173 men's and 154 women's titles.
Annual Mercantile Athletic Championship is the most prominant sports event among mercantile firms in the country. New 10 mercantile institutions will make their debut this year. MAF president Sydney Rathnayake said that the foreign participation in this event will in return create possible financial and career opportunities for talented yet struggling athletes in the country. "MAF will continue its 'Kreeda Saviya' programme this year too. We have decided to donate sports goods to one of arduous schools in Puttalam district," he further said.
Employees of companies affiliated to MAF are eligible to participate in this meet and a contestant must have completed minimum six month service in the respective company.
There will be 45 challenge trophies on offer for the winners of certain events. Last year's event saw 35 new meet records being established while Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) Team became the overall champions with MAS and Airport and Aviation Services coming in second and third places respectively.
Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) has come forward as the main sponsor and Zaara Tours will be the travel partner while Lake House will be the print media partner. HNB, Janashakthi Insurance, NDB and Colombo Dockyard also joined in as sponsors this year.
