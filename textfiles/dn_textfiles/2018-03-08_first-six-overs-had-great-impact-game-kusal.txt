First six overs had a great  impact on the game - Kusal

Man of the match Kusal Perera said that the first six overs decided the fate of the first match in the Nidahas trophy T20 tri-series between Sri Lanka and India played at the R Premadasa Stadium on Tuesday.
Sri Lanka won that game quite handsomely by five wickets thanks to Perera’s early onslaught on the Indian bowlers that saw his team run up their best ever power play T20I total of 75/2 in the first six overs. In comparison India managed only 40 in their power play overs.
“When you get that kind of start it is easier for the innings to progress smoothly. But you don’t get that kind of start every game. The first six overs had a great impact on the game,” said Perera who went onto score a blazing 66 off 37 balls that saw Sri Lanka overhaul India’s total of 174-5 with nine balls to spare. The win brought to an end Sri Lanka’s seven-match T20I losing streak against India.
“We had to attack in the first six overs as the target was 175. We needed some momentum,” said Perera who was playing his first international match since January 21 after straining his side during the one-day tri-series match against Zimbabwe in Bangladesh.
“After the injury when I returned there were doubts. More than wanting to play a great knock, I wanted to play a good game. Very happy with that. I’ve had several injuries in the last several months. But I had played a few domestic games and I had done well. So I had confidence going into the first match of the competition. The way the wicket was behaving it was easy to bat. The ball was coming onto the bat that was why I was playing my normal game.”
Perera whose strokeplay is sometimes reminiscent of the great Sanath Jayasuriya denied that he was trying to copy anyone. “I was not trying to copy anyone but playing my normal game. When you have confidence and experience you know how to play your game. Some people use the top hand and some the bottom hand. I am using the bottom hand and everyone is different.”
Perera said that his assault on fast bowler Shardul Thakur off whom he took 27 runs in an over was not pre-meditated. “He bowled short and full and I was going to attack him after two balls. That is the T-20 game and you have to attack.”
Perera said the win was a good confident booster for the tournament and they hoped to maintain it right till the end.
“It is good for our confidence to start off with a win. That is the main thing. We are trying to improve everyday. We are not over confident. We are seeking to improve every single day,” said Perera.
“The Indian side is very good and they have done a good job in the last few months. We were trying to control what we can control. The coaching staff is communicating well. The players have been given confidence. The way everyone is moving about during games and training is good.”
In his career Perera has batted in different positions from opener to middle order batsman. “Whatever the position I get, I need to play a role. Whether I am opener or middle order batsman, it is decided by the selectors and the management. My role was to go out there and do the job for the team.”
TODAY: Bangladesh the third team in the competition make their first appearance when they meet India at the R Premadasa Stadium at 7 pm.
