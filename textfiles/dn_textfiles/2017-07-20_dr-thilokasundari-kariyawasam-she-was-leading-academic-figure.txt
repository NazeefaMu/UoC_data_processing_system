Dr. Thilokasundari Kariyawasam: She was a leading academic figure

During my school days and university life, Dr. Thilokasundari Kariyawasam was a leading academic figure due to her contribution towards school education by writing books on education. During my teaching career, she was a model to be followed in our career path. I, as a novice teacher at that time, till now, remember her attractive posture mixed with a holistic personality and a speech made by her at a workshop conducted for teachers at Trincomalee in 1976.
After that, as a project officer of the Research Unit of National Institute of Education (NIE), I had the opportunity to perform my duties as a researcher under Dr. Thilokasundari, the second Director General of the NIE. Once, at a research-steering committee meeting, she expressed the importance of qualitative research to fill the gaps that may arise due to the limitations of quantitative research, using a simple example without taking much time from the committee members.
This type of flexible research was not with many director generals that dominate their roles at NIE through their so-called 'names,' 'arrogance,' 'political power' or 'professorships.'
If we analyse the 32-year-old history of the NIE, the Director General who used the power of the NIE with its maximum capability was Dr. Kariyawasam.
Her power of decision-making was independent and time-saving, as expected from the Act of the NIE enacted in 1985 to 'advise the minister regarding the plans, programmes and activities for the development of education in Sri Lanka.' The strong academic background with the wide range of experiences in schools, education offices, and as a whole on school education, she was able to implement the activities of the NIE with an independent strong mind that helped to strengthen the role and functions of the NIE.
Although the successive director generals from the university system misused the policy framework of the NIE due to their lack of knowledge on school education and blindly followed the university system and politicians they were following, the activities introduced during the period of Dr. Kariyawasam were still at the base of NIE securing the day to day functions and roles of the NIE.
Her contribution towards the expansion of teacher education opportunities by way of developing different teacher education courses around the island is praiseworthy.
Recently, at a lecture on Research Methodology for newly-appointed SLEAS officers, I suggested to conduct 'case studies' and 'life history research' on a number of contributors to the school education system in Sri Lanka.
I emphasised names of three Director Generals of the NIE too and one name was Dr. Kariyawasam. I sincerely hope this task will be performed so that the contribution of Dr. Kariyawasam will be recorded scientifically for the reference of future generations.
