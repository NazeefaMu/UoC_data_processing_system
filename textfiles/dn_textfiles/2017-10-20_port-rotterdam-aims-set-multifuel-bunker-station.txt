Port of Rotterdam aims to set up multifuel bunker station

The Port of Rotterdam has set sights on a new multifuel bunker station for the refueling of LNG and other cleaner fuels.
The port authority has signed a letter of intent with PitPoint.LNG, a joint venture formed by PitPoint clean fuels and Primagaz Nederland BV, to investigate the realization of such a project.
Krabbegors/Duivelseiland at Dordrecht Inland Seaport has been designated as the location for this bunker station.
“The realization of a multifuel bunker station reflects the Port of Rotterdam's commitment to play a pioneering role, as the administrator of the biggest port in Europe, in energy transition within Europe. In this way, we will encourage the use of LNG as an alternative to fuel oil in shipping,” Ronald Paul, COO for the Port of Rotterdam, said.
Dordrecht Inland Seaport is the most inland seaport in the Netherlands. It forms the meeting point of the shipping lanes for the cities of Amsterdam - Rotterdam - Antwerp, and the main shipping route into Germany: the ideal location for a bunker station of this type, Pitpoint.LNG said.
Over the coming period, the duo intends to focus their efforts to further explore the feasibility of the multifuel bunker station. As informed, this will include holding discussions with potential customers, partners and suppliers to see how the supply and demand for cleaner fuels can be effectively matched.
“Whether it's hydrogen, electric, biodiesel or LNG/CNG, a central aspect of the investigation is the requirement that all fuels supplied by the multifuel bunker station should produce fewer harmful emissions than traditional fuels. This includes fuel for ships, trucks and/or commercial vehicles with the aim of working together to achieve cleaner air and a better living environment,” the company said.
