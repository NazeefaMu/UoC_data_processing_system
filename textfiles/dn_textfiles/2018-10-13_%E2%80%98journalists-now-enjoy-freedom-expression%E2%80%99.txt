‘Journalists now enjoy freedom of expression’

Journalists now enjoy freedom of expression. Earlier thugs came in white vans abducted and made them disappear, Chief Incumbent of the Vajiragiri Viharaya in Tangalle Ven. Mirisse Dhammawansa Thera said.
The Thera was addressing the 25th Annual General Meeting of the Hambantota Journalists' Association at the temple recently.
The Thera said the journalists today can criticise the government without fear. Many journalists in Hambantota have no special privileges or a high income, yet they do a laudable service for the country, the Thera said.
"The narcotic kingpins in the death row enjoy luxuries and they have modern equipment to direct underworld activities," the Thera said.
Ven. Dhammawansa Thera donated monetary gift to the Association and its treasurer Raja Waidyasekera received the gift. K.K. Dayasena was appointed the Chairman and William Wanniarachchi was appointed the secretary of the association.
