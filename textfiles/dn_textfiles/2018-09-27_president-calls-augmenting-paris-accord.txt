President calls for augmenting Paris Accord

President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday called for further strengthening the 2015 Paris Climate Accord.
Addressing the UN General Assembly in New York, President Sirisena said the whole world is facing challenges posed by severe changes in climate. “I would like to propose that the community of nations must focus on implementing the Paris Accord that the world reached in 2015, by further improving the unity that we reached by signing that accord. We must remember that the Paris Accord is critically important to the future of the entire biosphere and humanity,” the President said.
He emphasised the imperative need to adhere to the Paris Protocol on Climate Change for the sake of the future of human beings as well as flora and fauna. Referring to Sri Lanka, he said the vision of the government is to ensure sustained economic development through the increase of domestic agriculture and industry under environment-friendly policies and programmes.
The President said that the exodus of refugees is a major issue in international politics and urged the United Nations to play a bigger role because of the paramount importance of the issue. Sri Lanka is following a non-aligned policy. In fact, Sri Lanka hosted the Non-Aligned Summit in 1976 and it was the most successful summit. Sri Lanka has a policy of friendship with all and the country does not have any enemy nation in the world, he said.
President Sirisena said that Sri Lanka’s Executive President had been vested with more powers than any other leader in the world, and he had curtailed those excessive powers of the Executive Presidency and transferred those powers to the Parliament. He also stressed the need to eradicate poverty. At present, the whole world is engaged in an attempt to free itself from poverty and the United Nations must play a bigger role in the endeavour, he said.
He called on world leaders to take collective action to eradicate the problem of narcotic drugs and illegal pharmaceuticals. He said he wanted to draw the attention of the General Assembly of the United Nations to the problem of drugs that poses a serious threat to society and asked the world body to play a bigger role in eliminating this problem.
The President said that in international politics, the issue of Palestine is very important and reiterated Sri Lanka’s support to the people of Palestine.
