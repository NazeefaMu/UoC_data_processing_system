Countrywide waste management plan in the offing:PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday assured that the government will bring a viable solution to the garbage issue soon.
The Prime Minister said that a proper plan covering the entire country is to be devised for waste management. Premier Wickremesinghe made these observations when he called on the Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter Most Ven.Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera in Kandy yesterday.
“The government is ready to discuss with the relevant parties and the people, if implementation of waste management plans is detrimental to the environment,”the Prime Minster said. The Premier was of the view that conducting protests over waste disposal is fruitless. “We can stop dumping garbage, if there are issues,”the Prime Minister said.
“This issue is not limited to Colombo and Kollonnawa. “This is a problem has engulfed the entire country,”the Premier added. The Prime Minister added that certain private institutions have not started waste management projects even though they have obtained permits for such ventures.
Premier Wickremesinghe said the government will annul the licences provided to these institutions, if they fail to commence such projects within two weeks.
“Such projects have not been commenced in many districts including Kandy, Galle, Matara.
The Prime Minister added that a Japanese team has inspected the garbage dumping site at Meethtamulla and their report is expected next week. “In addition, a World Bank team, a local team and Swedish team have inspected the area. The government will obtain their observations,” the Premier said. The Prime Minister also called on the Mahanayake of the Asigirya Chapter Most Ven.Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera.
