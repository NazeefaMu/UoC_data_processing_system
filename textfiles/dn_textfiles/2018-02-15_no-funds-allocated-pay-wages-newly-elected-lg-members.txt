No funds allocated to pay wages of newly elected LG members

“A sum of 182.8 million rupees is required monthly to pay salaries to the newly elected 8,325 councilors and about 200 bonus councilors who are to be selected for the service of local bodies countrywide. According to the existing system, a Chairman of a PS has to be paid a monthly salary of Rs. 25,000. A UC Chairman too has to be paid monthly a sum of Rs. 25,000 to 30,000”, a leading Cabinet Minister in the Kurunegala District told Daily News yesterday (14).
He said that a Deputy Chairman is paid Rs. 20,000. In addition, a councilor is to get Rs. 15,000 as a monthly salary. As telephone and travelling allowances, they are to be paid more than Rs. 3,000 every month. However, the money for this purpose has not been allocated by the Central Government so far, according to the reliable sources of the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry.
When this matter was referred to Kurunegala District Senior Divisional Secretary W.E.Jayathilake, he too confirmed that the facts herein are true.
