Nineteen countries pledge support

Nineteen countries have pledged support Sri Lanka at this catastrophic situation, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said.
Already US$ 2 million has been promised as grants to Sri Lanka, he said. He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Head Office in Colombo.
However foreign countries suggested that if an emergency situation was declared they could provide us more funds but the President decided not to declare so as some groups will create a different image using the same situation.
He said that the government has decided to ask for generators, water motors and gully browsers and boats which could be useful in the future. He said that the existing boats seemed useless as they were unable to use in the powerful currents of the flood waters.
