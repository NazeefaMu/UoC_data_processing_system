‘Govt committed to protect farmers’

The government is committed to protect the farming community and provide the reasonable price for the produce of the farmers, Kurunegala district Parliament Member co-chairman of the District Development Committee Meeting J. C. Almawathuwala said yesterday.
He said the price of rice increased in the local market due to the drought in many parts of the country. In 1985, the country was 90 percent self-sufficient in rice.
He said several thousand of neglected and abandoned paddy lands went in to rice cultivation during the previous years.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said all politicians should be aware of development work proposals.
He said financial allocations for development work will be sanctioned according to the recommendations of members.
Almawathuwala said the responsibility of financial allocations for development projects will be entrusted with the Divisional Secretaries. Development activities will be implemented under the five year plan.
North Western PC Member Chithralal Perera said that Western Provincial Council has decided to transport garbage in train to a locations in Puttalama. This is harmful to the environment of the Puttalam District.
