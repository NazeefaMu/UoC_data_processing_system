Navy edge out Havies 28-26

A spectacular last minute penalty by full back Thilina Weerasinghe enabled Navy Sports Club to earn a hard fought 28 points (3 tries, 2 conversions, 3 penalties) to 26 (4 tries, 3 conversions) win over a fighting Havelock Sports Club outfit in their Clifford Cup ‘A’ Division inter-club knock-out rugby semi final match played at Race Course grounds yesterday.
The scores were deadlocked 12-all at half time.
After being contained in the first half the Navy ‘eight’ came up with a sterling display in the second half to outplay their counterparts in the loose.
Prop forward Charith Silva was a source of inspiration to his team-mates with his fiery loose play and capped a fine performance by scoring two tries in the match.
For the winning Navy SC team the three tries were scored by prop forward Charith Silva (two) and wing three quarter Chathura Gomez (one). The two conversions and the three penalties were fired across by their reliable full back Thilina Weerasinghe.
For Havies their four tries were scored by hooker Shameer Fajudeen (two), flanker Gihan Madusanka (one) and number eight Lasindu Ishan Karunathilake (one). Former Sri Lanka full back Reeza Mubarak put over the three conversions.
