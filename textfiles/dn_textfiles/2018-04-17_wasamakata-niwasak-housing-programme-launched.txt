Wasamakata Niwasak  housing programme launched

The Wasamakata Niwasak National Housing Programme representing all Grama Niladhari Divisions in the country, was launched under the patronage of Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa at the Tissamaharama Divisional Secretary Division, on April 13. It coincided with the Soorya Udawai – Niwasaka Udawai programme that was held on the same day to cover 14,000 Grama Niladhari Divisions, National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) Chairman Lakvijaya Sagara Palansuriya said.
As an initial step, the minister’s objective was to build a new house for underprivileged families in every Grama Niladhari Division, he said.
He said the programme was aimed at identifying and resolving housing issues. The beneficiaries under the said programme, would be selected though rural housing committees set up at village levels.
