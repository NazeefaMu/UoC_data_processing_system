Dullas resigning from posts, a common occurrence - Weerakkody

Commenting on the decision taken by Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma to resign from the SLFP Matara District leadership post, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said that this was not the first occasion he had done so as even in 2001 did so when the SLFP was in trouble.
He made this observation responding a question raised by a journalist at a media conference held yesterday at the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry.
The minister said that he had not yet resigned from the post and there was a possibility of changing his decision within the next few days.
“This is not the first time he acted like this. When the party was in a crisis situation in 2001, he left the party and flew to America after appearing for a UNP advertisement which claimed that Sri Lanka was not a good place to live in. It is some what suspicious as to whether he had once again received an invitation from USA,” the minister said.
Minister Weerakkody said that measures were taken to hold the 65th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in Kurunegala on the 4th of next month on a grand scale. “The members of the SLFP have already taken measures to make all grass root level SLFP supporters aware about the convention and there was a good response from them and they were ready to join us to strengthen the SLFP,” he said.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist with regard to the appointment of the former Hambantota Mayor, a person with a bad history as an electoral organizer, Minister Weerakkody said that he had been given a four year period prior to the next general election to do politics in a democratic manner.
