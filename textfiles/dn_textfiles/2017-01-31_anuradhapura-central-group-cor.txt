Certain individuals are trying to achieve their personal political ambitions by deceiving the people and putting them in trouble, Agriculture Minister and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Silva said.
"A political leader should try to serve the people instead of trying to serve himself. Some are trying to regain their lost political and personal privileges by placing people's future at stake,” he said.
“There is no harm if people tried to regain their lost privileges provided they did not place innocent people in trouble," he said.
Dissanayake was addressing a Jana Hamuwa after opening a rehabilitated road leading to a farming village in Dutuwewa, Galenbindunuwewa.
Dissanayake said certain former SLFP local government members were under the impression that the SLFP would suffer if they received nominations from another party to contest elections.
"If they think so, they are sadly mistaken. A large number of people were flocking round the SLFP in the village areas. There were many people among them who were willing to contest elections to render a dedicated and selfless service to their areas without restricting to personal agendas," the minister said. He said although no announcement had been made about an election so far, the SLFP was fully geared to face an election any time and win it.
Dissanayake said it was strange to see individuals who had robbed the country to the tune of millions of rupees trying to pose as heroes by displaying their manacled hands to the public when they are hauled before courts.
"One such person had even gone to the extent of displaying his posters countrywide with a verse depicting him as a patriot. Today the environment in the country had turned for the better and everyone was considered equal before the law," the minister said.
