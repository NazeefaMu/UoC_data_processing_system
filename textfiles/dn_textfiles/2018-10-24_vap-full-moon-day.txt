Vap Full  Moon Day

Sacred Vinaya Pitaka in Mahavagga Pali
Reveals the observing of Vas in times early
Believed to be the highest act leading to liberation
With the dawn of Katina and its culmination
Every Buddhist monk blessed with higher ordination
Are entitled to observe Vas for their emancipation
During 3 months commencing from Esala month
They engage in this religious fiesta with utmost faith
At the end monks receive Katina Cheevara from the laity
Who wishes this to be in their life a reality?
Out of Atamaha Kusal this is in deed
Said to be the highest merit bestowing deed
While at the same time this is said to suppress
The ill effects of bad kamma of those in distress
This is the most noble wholesome act of Katina robe
Creating a religious awakening in the entire globe
Bringing about a total disciplined way of life
Compelling them to utilise the day sans strife
Bhikkus are also blessed with higher levels of Dhamma
Through strict meditation and study sublime Dhamma
They in turn showed the laity with Dhamma
As the “gift of Dhamma excels all other gifts of Sam Buddha Samma
The busy vassana brings devotees all together
With great enthusiasm they never fail to gather
They provide the Sangha with the four essentials
In gratitude for their service in Dhamma and its rituals
VapPoya is of great significance for yet another reason
As the day that Buddha in Thavathimsa heaven
Preached Abidhamma to his mother MathreeDivya Raja
On his way to spend seventh vassana with a special puja
The other sacred event is regarding BosatMaitree
Where history reveals that he started his religious spree
With a retinue of 500 on this Vap full moon day
For the most glorious historical event, paving the way
Then TheriniSanghamitta arrived in Dhammadweepa
Turning a new chapter in the history of Buddha Sasana
It was on Vappoya day, King sent envoys to Pataliputta
Under the leadership of Minister MahaAritta
Lanka was blessed with two most sacred things in Buddhist culture
Which led to a complete transformation in historic future
One was that Therini inaugurated Bhikkuni order
The other, she brought the most sacred Sri Mahabodi along with her
This stunningly serene Bodhi with charm and grandeur
Is a landmark visited by millions every year?
