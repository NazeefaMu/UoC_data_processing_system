World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day on May 8

On World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day, which falls on May 8, the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) will be joining a global celebration of the work and bravery of Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers, and the diverse humanitarian services they offer in communities everywhere.
“Our volunteers live in the communities they support, from the smallest and most remote villages to the largest cities,” said Jagath Abeysinghe, President of the SLRCS.
“Our services are tailored for local needs and are delivered in local languages. Today is when the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement come together to thank our volunteers who give their time and expertise here in Sri Lanka and all over the world”.
The Sri Lanka Red Cross Society reaches nearly 300, 000 people every year with a range of services tailored to local needs. From disaster management, post flood and recovery assistance, community based health activities, dengue prevention, first aid and restoring family links to the promotion of Humanitarian Values and Principles, it helps people to prepare for, cope with, and recover from crises.
Every year around the world, the Movement supports many millions of people affected by conflict, natural disasters and other emergencies, through its network of around 14 million volunteers and 450,000 staff.
Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers are as diverse as the life-saving services they provide through 190 National Societies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). This local action is supported by the global reach of IFRC, ICRC, as well as partnerships with sister National Societies across the world.
“Around the world, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement reaches out to the most vulnerable in all types of contexts - from responding to needs in disaster and conflict situations, to providing assistance in urban centres and remote areas, and advocating on behalf of those in need in policy circles and to governments,” said Claire Meytraud, head of the ICRC in Sri Lanka. “But our approach is universal, guided at every turn by our Fundamental Principles: Humanity, Impartiality, Neutrality, Independence, Voluntary Service, Unity and Universality”
Gerhard Tauscher, the IFRC representative in Sri Lanka said: “whatever you are living through - a natural disaster, a health crisis, the effects of conflict or violence - we are here to support you.”
World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day is celebrated every May 8 - the birth date of the Movements founder Henry Dunant. It recognizes the bravery and dedication of volunteers and staff members around the world. 2018 is the 190th anniversary of Dunant’s birth, mirroring the 190 National Societies providing humanitarian support in communities large and small every day.
