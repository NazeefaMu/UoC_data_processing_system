Thera critiques land acquiring process for Central Expressway

The process of acquiring land for the Kurunegala - Dambulla stretch of the proposed Central Expressway had caused great inconvenience to the respective land owners in Dambulla, said Athuparayaya Bodhirukkarama Viharadhipati Ven Aluthgama Upananda Thera, President Patron of the Union of landowners surrendering properties for the Expressway.
He said two problems had arisen regarding the payment of compensation to the acquired land which they discovered after discussions with officers of the Dambulla Divisional Secretariat and higher officials.
One is that compensation payments relevant to the Dambulla Viharaya's Rajakariya land was being paid to the Buddhist Affairs Commissioners Department rather than tenant residents in the lands.
Only a part of the compensation is paid from the proceeds of selling trees and other vegetation on lands taken over are paid to the Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya. Similarly, there had been no response as to the procedure adopted regarding the take over of state lands where people were residing.
Since the majority of people resident in lands to be taken over were living under deep mental distress, authorities should either resolve this problem in a fair and just manner and inform them in writing about the procedure adopted in this connection.
Ven. Upananda Thera said his organisation is not opposed to development projects of this nature or engaged in politics to topple governments but solely interested in ensuring justice and fair play to innocent people losing land for this project.
He said another problem was that decisions taken by the government in this matter does not filter down properly to the affected people.
