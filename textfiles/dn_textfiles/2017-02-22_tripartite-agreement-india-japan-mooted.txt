Tripartite agreement with India, Japan mooted

Satoru Nagao, a Research Fellow at the Tokyo Foundation and Lecturer of Security Studies at the Law Faculty of Japan’s Gakushuin University, urged Sri Lanka to forge stronger ties with India and regional powers like Japan to balance its relationship with the increasingly aggressive China.
Nagao spoke last Wednesday at the Institute of National Security Studies, and warned that increased cooperation between India, Sri Lanka, and Japan will be key to limiting China’s influence in the Indian Ocean.
“A new system has gradually emerged where several multinational security cooperation arrangements have recently been formed. Under this new system, Japan-Sri Lanka-India co-operation has an important role,” he said.
Much of Nagao’s lecture focused on China’s increasing threat to East and Southeast Asia, as evidenced by its increased aggressiveness regarding the development of several islands in the South China Sea. Waning American influence in the eastern Pacific Ocean has emboldened China, which has historically exploited gaps in alliances and power vacuums to expand its influence.

“When France withdrew from Vietnam in the 1950s, China occupied half of the Paracel Islands. and the other half in 1974 immediately after the Vietnam War and the US withdrew from the region. After the Soviet Union withdrew from Vietnam, China attacked the Spratly Islands controlled by Vietnam in 1988.”
Nagao emphasised that the bilateral alliances between the United States and individual Pacific countries, such as U.S.-Japan, U.S.-Phillippines, and U.S.-Australia ties, would have to give way to multilateral ties wherein the Pacific countries work to cooperate together without depending on the United States.
He warned that East Asian countries are feeling increasingly threatened by China’s brazenness and its apparent disregard for international law, as evidenced by its ignoring a 2016 decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration that rejected its territorial claims in the South China Sea.
These concerns have heightened due to China’s acquisition of at least 42 submarines between 2000 and 2015.
“Japan and countries around the South China Sea are likely to suffer from China’s assertiveness in the near future. Therefore, a need exists for us to maintain a military balance with China despite their large military budget,” he said.
Nagao further emphasised that China has increasingly set its sights on becoming a major player in the Indian Ocean, as it has undertaken large-scale port development projects in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka as part of it’s “String of Pearls” strategy.
Despite that these projects appear to be economic development initiatives, Nagao argued that they are in fact barely concealed tactics to increase its military abilities in the Indian Ocean, as the new ports could be used as naval supply bases.
Furthermore, China is selling weapons to countries that surround India, further shifting the balance of power in the region. Pakistan has recently purchased eight Chinese-made submarines, while Bangladesh bought two.
“These submarines will, to a great degree, regulate India’s naval activities because the Indian Navy must have sufficient ships to maintain regular oversight over the locations and purposes of other countries’ submarines,” Nagao said.
China’s increasing military might, shrewd tactics, and aggression threaten to change the balance of power in the Indian Ocean in China’s favour. If the “String of Pearls” does in fact come to fruition, India will find itself encircled.
Therefore, in order to fend off the Chinese in the Indian Ocean, a desire both Japan and India share, increased trilateral cooperation will be key.
“It will be useful if such dialogue (between Japan and Sri Lanka) will promote a more practical Japan-Sri Lanka-India strategic trilateral dialogue. Through such dialogue, both Japan and India can share info, better identify Sri Lankan needs, and choose courses of cooperation or support,” he said.
“Furthermore, the possibility exists that the network of these trilateral security initiatives would culminate and contribute to India initiatives including the Indian Ocean Rim Association and Indian Ocean Naval Symposium as a collective security system in the near future,”he said.
Along with trilateral dialogues, it will be important to augment communications between Sri Lanka, Japan, and India to counter the Chinese threat. Due to Sri Lanka’s wariness of India, Nagao noted that Japan can act as the perfect mediator between the two countries.
“If Japan and India mutually collaborate, then the two countries can support Sri Lanka more effectively. For example, if Japan and India collaborate to establish a maritime communications network system in Sri Lanka that would serve the entire Indian Ocean, it would be easy for the three countries to be aware of what occurs in the Indian Ocean.
“A high probability exists that India will be the most influential sea power to fill the power vacuum in the Indian Ocean region in the near future, and the strategic location of Sri Lanka has affected the security of the entire Indo-pacific,” he said.
India’s Role
While China’s influence rises and that of the United States falls in the Indian Ocean, Japan and India will have to bear more responsibility to secure the region and deter China from violating international maritime and territorial laws.
Part of this claim lies in the fact that India boasts a massive coastline and has set a goal of augmenting its naval fleet to include 200 ships within the next decade. On top of this, the Indian Navy accounts for 15.8 percent of the Indian Defense budget, which is up from 12.7 percent in 1990.
“A high probability exists that India will be the most influential sea power to fill the power vacuum in the Indian ocean region in the near future,” Nagao said.
Moreover, there is evidence that India will be a cooperative maritime actor, as it accepted a 2014 UN decision on a disagreement between India and Bangladesh regarding the two countries’ coastal boundaries.
Nagao contended that the United States and Japan would welcome India’s taking the responsibility of protecting the Indian Ocean waters from further Chinese incursion.
“It seems that Japan and the US would wish India to exhibit a more positive role in the Indian Ocean. India’s rise helps lower the heavy burdens of Japan and the US in the Indian Ocean and helps them to concentrate naval and air military resources toward areas around Japan and the South China Sea,” Nagao said.
Chinese-Sri Lankan relations: Economic aspects

Nagao’s talk focused on concerns related to Sri Lanka and India’s role in preserving Japan’s national security, so it would follow that he slightly downplayed the significance of China’s economic assistance to the island.
“To support its own development, Sri Lanka wants to accept China’s economic support. However, when China is building a port in Sri Lanka and their submarines visit Sri Lanka, these moves create new difficulties with India.”
Though Sri Lanka has little incentive to give up China’s backing, Nagao claimed that closer ties to Japan and India would more than make up for any economic troubles caused by shunning the Chinese.
“If China supports the development of Sri Lanka, then there is little motivation for Sri Lanka to refuse economic support from China. However, from india’s perspective, Chinese activities in Sri Lanka represent an encirclement strategy limiting India’s influence in the Indian Ocean.”
“These collaborative projects are preferable to accepting China’s support, which would create strategic difficulties. Therefore, under Japan-Sri Lanka-India cooperation, a win-win situation can be created,” he said.
This might be a winning situation for Japan, but it is unclear where Sri Lanka would turn for a similar level of economic support.
The Japanese scholar did say, however, that Japan could help fill the gap left by the Chinese. He also mentioned that the projects will be better executed and of a higher quality. Asked if Japan would, like the Chinese, sell military equipment, he said that Japan would not supply any country with sub-standard military products and claimed that the submarines sold to Pakistan and Bangladesh were in bad condition.
Nagao’s talk was a well-meaning wake up call for Sri Lanka, as the country might think that there are few geo-political and security downsides to accepting Chinese economic assistance. But Nagao noted that, throughout its recent history, China has leveraged its economic aid to coerce smaller, poorer countries into following its strategic vision, thereby increasing its imprint on the world stage.
