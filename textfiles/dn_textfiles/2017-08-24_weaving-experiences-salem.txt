Weaving  experiences  in Salem

Last month (July 2017) on the second leg of my tour in Tamil Nadu, I took the Kovai Express train at 3.15 PM from Coiambuttur, the second-biggest city in Tamil Nadu, now known as Kovai in short. One of the fastest trains in India, it was heading to the State Capital, Chennai. On the previous day standing in a big queue I succeeded in getting a seating accommodation in the train. However it was overcrowded with people standing, mothers and children chatting and playing. In my segment of the compartment, there were seats for nine people to sit. Except me a Lankan, all the other seats were occupied by one family, while some others of the family were standing all the way because they had not reserved their tickets. They all spoke in either Telugu or Urdu which I did not understand. The Express train was to reach Chennai, but I had to get down an important station called Salem.
I remembered an enclave called Salem in Cincinnati, the second-biggest city (after Cleveland) in the State of Ohio in the U.S. But by 5.15 or so I reached the Weavers City Salem with great relief.
Awe-struck
A postgraduate, M.Phil English literature student and one of my youngest friends, Jothi Srinivasan and her father came in their car to pick me to spend almost 24 hours at their residence, one hour travel away from the station. I was awe-struck. Astonished of their kind hospitality, especially when they had not known me face to face as I was a stranger from another country. Their simplicity and naïve manners and their own family bonds made me adapt myself to suit their environment shedding my urban lifestyle and was overwhelmed when the whole family (father mother, expecting elder married sister, younger sister, younger brother, grandpa, grandma, uncles, aunties, paternal grandma all came to see me to welcome me among their midst and showed happiness in meeting me. I was a little embarrassed by their love and genuineness.
Jothi has noted through my conversation with her through the correspondence that I like idly with chicken liver curry and her mother had prepared a delicious dinner for me with Jothi helping her. Although they are doing very well in their family business of weaving sarees for wholesale distribution and well-to-do, they remain very simple and down to earth without any pretence and ostentatiousness. It is this factor that made me love them for what they are. I was moved when they asked me to sleep in one of their rooms on a cosy bed while they all slept in the hall on the floor on mats as they do in outstations in Lanka.
They were all very particular in entertaining with their kindness and fondness and providing me with breakfast and lunch on the following day. I didn’t have much time to have a longer chat with humble Jothi regarding her thesis. She will be completing her research on a woman Indian Feminist writer.
Expensive saree
As their custom, they said they give presents to their guests and presented to me and my wife a lovely expensive saree and Veatti and clothing for a shirt. I am deeply obliged to them and remember them always.
Bidding goodbye with sadness I travelled with them in their car driven by Srinivasan Sir himself to the Salem Junction Railway station. Jothi’s mother, a distinguished looking lady and Jothi accompanied to the station. The Kovai Express arrived on time and I sat in my reserved seat with another set of passengers from various communities in India. The train reached Chennai Central Railway station by 10.30 in the night. Just as the train was a very long one the platform too was about 150 to 200 metres long. I couldn’t possibly carry my travelling bag and the handbag and go to the exit climbing up and then down. I sought a porter’s assistance an old man like me to get me a prepaid cab to my hotel. He was kind enough to do that as it was raining heavily in Chennai that night. I paid him voluntarily 50 Indian rupees.
I reached my hotel in Anna Saalai passing the L I C building, got into my room and slept well.
Big malls
Two more days were left for me to leave Chennai.
Getting up early, I went to the City Centre Mall in Mylapore, a district in the metropolis, to do some shopping. There are three other big malls in the megacity. I only bought a collard Sherwani shirt for 1000 Indian rupees (To know the price in Lanka you have to multiply it by Rs.2.45) and had some bites in the KFC kiosk.
The teenagers seen were all alike as in Sri Lanka in their dress, behavioural patterns etcetera. On the last day, I went to see the owner and director of Madura Travels- a successful travel agency well known in Southern India. He is V K T Balan who had lived in Lanka from his birth until 1981 when he went to India to settle down there. While in Lanka as a teenager he wrote and produced many Thamil plays and won many awards. I gave him a copy of one of my books written in Thamil, which he enjoyed reading. After exchanging past memories with him for more than 3 hours, he returned to his place of residence after dropping me at my hotel.
SriLankan Airlines flight was scheduled at 10.00 am. And I went to the airport three hours earlier.
Reached BIA by about 11.30 and the story ends here.
