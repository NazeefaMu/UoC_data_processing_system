Kerosene price
Special mechanism to be set up to prevent use by buses

As fishermen protest against the recent increase in kerosene prices, Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said the earlier increase had resulted in a 50 percent reduction in kerosene sales in the country.
“Most of this it is as a result of buses and other motor vehicles no longer purchasing kerosene to run their vehicles,” said the Minister, addressing the Cabinet media briefing yesterday.
President Maithripala Sirisena had previously issued strict instructions to curb the menace of bus drivers mixing kerosene with petrol in their vehicles.
Thus along with kerosene being increased from Rs. 57 per litre to Rs. 101, the Petroleum Resources Ministry also undertook raids at petrol stations to apprehend those who illegally sold kerosene to be mixed with petrol.
With fishermen protests, the prices were dropped to Rs. 70 per litre as of Tuesday (12) night, but they have asked that prices be brought down further to Rs. 57 per litre.
“If we keep decreasing the price, it will only encourage motor vehicle owners to resort to their previous practices. So the President also asked that a special mechanism be designed to deal with the menace of using kerosene for illegal purposes,” said the Minister.
