ASCG initiates innovative gravity sewer system for Colombo

With Sri Lanka experiencing a significant growth in infrastructure development coupled with increasing tourist arrivals, the local office of Anhui Shui’an Construction Group Co Ltd (ASCG) recently held a project completion event for its innovative gravity sewer system at the Shangri-La Hotel Colombo.
ASCG, a leading China-based enterprise focusing on general contracting of construction works and integrating commercial investment, real estate development, hospitality, tourism, scientific incubation, factory building leasing and international businesses, will lay new sewer lines to cater to the new developments with no dig (micro tunneling) technology for newly-built and upcoming hotels based in the city’s Slave Island area.
Micro tunneling is a modern tech that is new to Sri Lanka when it comes to constructing sewers and ASCG has taken up the Colombo Municipal Council sewer project as its entry point to sustainable development in the country. This sewer technology will immensely benefit the large scale hotel developments in the area.
With the enormous support by the Deputy Municipal Commissioner, Eng. Lalith Wickramaratne, Directors of Engineering Division, Eng. Nihal Wickramaratne and Eng. Salim including others, ASCG through challenging difficulties and unforeseen congestions was able to successfully complete a micro tunneling project on time to Shangri La Hotel Colombo which was opened immediately after its construction.
The pipe jacking by micro tunneling involved pipes of different sizes and materials. The pipes used were Vitrified Clay jacking pipes up to diameter 600mm and Reinforced Concrete jacking pipes up to diameter of 1200mm.
Eng. Nihal Wickramasinghe, speaking at the event, said “It was a difficult task considering the site conditions, especially without sufficient details of underground structures inside the army camp along Baladaksha Mawatha.
During the micro tunneling process the machine even struck a concrete pile foundation which we thought was a draft foundation. It was really a highly challenging task and I take this moment to thank ASCG for all their efforts to complete this.”
ASCG’s motive in Sri Lanka is to share and merge modern technology in China with locally available ones to implement projects in the best cost effective and sustainable way.
With a registered capital of RMB 560 million and a competitive edge in the global construction marketplace, ASCG today has around 16 immediate subordinate departments including IT, survey and design, investment management, overseas business development amongst others.
ASCG has been granted by Chinese government the super grade qualification for general contracting of water, hydro power and building works and grade-I for general contracting of municipal works. The group has been certified as class-I for safety standardization and rated by China Construction Industry Association as an AAA-Credit enterprise.
With its corporate philosophy ‘honesty, fine works, initiative, innovation and social contribution’, ASCG consistently pursues its development strategy of ‘reform to advanced development, innovate operation and to drive lean management’, strengthening its construction initiatives throughout China and heading to the world.
ASCG will continue to forge ahead with determinations, continuous innovations, excellent equipment, state-of-the-art technologies, scientific management and utmost sincerity to cooperate with all sectors of society to share win-win developments and target for fruitful achievements.
