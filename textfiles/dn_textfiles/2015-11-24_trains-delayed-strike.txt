Trains delayed by strike

 
Office trains from Colombo Fort line have been delayed due to a strike action by railway drivers this morning(24).
The strike action was taken by the railway staff due to an alleged assault on a railway driver that took place at the Ragama Railway station last evening.  
Commuters who use the trains as a mode of transport in the morning were seen inconvenienced at several railway stations due to the strike.
