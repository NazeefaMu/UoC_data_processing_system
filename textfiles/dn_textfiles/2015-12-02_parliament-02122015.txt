[Parliament]-02.12.2015

Motion to formulate new constitution - PM
The government is planning to move a motion to formulate a new constitution, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He said the government will move a motion to convert Parliament to a Constitutional Council in formulation of the new constitution as pledged during the election.
He made these observations joining the second reading debate of the budget proposals.
The Prime Minister said the government has to bring new laws to create a new political culture.
He said the government takes measures to set up Parliamentary Supervisory Committees to act as a government. He said 16 more supervisory committees are to be set up in addition to the PAC and the COPE. MPs will chair each of the committees. All ministries will come under them, he said. "The National Audit Act, Right to Information Act will be presented to Parliament soon", the Prime Minister said.
"The amendments to increase women's representation to 25 percent at the Local Government Institutions have been formulated," he said. A strong institution will be set up in connection with anti-corruption activities. A Development Co-ordinating Board will be set up to coordinate development activities in the country while steps would be taken to set up Gramarajya centres, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Budget provides concessions for the needy - Rajitha
The budget 2016 is a golden budget which provided concessions for the needy, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne told in Parliament yesterday.
He was joining the second reading debate on the budget proposals for the eighth allotted day.
"Though Sri Lanka achieved the average growth rate of about 6.5 percent during the past few years, many districts, including Mannar, Mullaitivu, Killinochchi, Batticaloa, Badulla, Monaragala and Ratnapura have the higher poverty level than the national average. The daily income of most of these families is lower than two dollars," the minister said.
When the new government was formed, country's income was low and the debt burden was high. Sri Lanka has the lowest tax income in the Asian region. The previous government had shown the people false data, he said.
The government has spent Rs.130 billion to increase the salaries of public servants. Relief was provided for the needy by reducing the prices of 11 essential food items, the minister said.
The government has provided relief for farmers by providing fertilizer subsidy.
Minister Senaratne proposed Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to grant Rs. one million to doctors on behalf of the vehicle permit received earlier. Minister Karunanayake accepted the proposal.
MR signals budget's success - Sagala
The best assessment of the budget has been given by former President and Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa who has not spoken during the budget debate, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake told Parliament yesterday.
"The former President has not signed the no-confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. We expect that the
former President would express his comments on the budget soon," he said.
The minister was participating in the debate of the second reading of budget 2016.
"The world attention is on Sri Lanka as a result of the January eight revolution. Many countries which opposed Sri Lanka earlier are
helping the country. Our aim is to strengthen the economy through international trade. We will get the GSP+ facility shortly which will open the EU market for our products. Both main parties have reached the consensus on developing country and strengthening the economy. Many youth left the country those days as there were no jobs for their qualifications. Today, we have created an environment conducive to make strong, intelligent and skilled youth," the minister said.
Those who had left the country seeking employment opportunities are returning to Sri Lanka. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe does not take popular decisions. He always stood his principals. He thinks about the future and takes strong decisions, Minister Ratnayake said.
Meanwhile, UPFA MP Mahindananda Alutgamage said that he is against the budget as it affects the poor.
"The budget has not provided relief for the people. We can not go to our villages if we vote for the budget. The budget does not contain President Maithripala Sirisena's ideas and policies. It is based on the Prime Minister's ideas. This is a deal based budget," he said.
"Although, the President raises his views on protecting the environment, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake imposed the taxes on electric cars. A brother-in-law of one of the ministers has obtained a majority of shares of a major vehicle importing company. That is why tax on electric cars was raised to give an advantage to the importer. I request the Prime Minister to probe the matter of providing 50 gold import permits to cronies of the government," Alutgamage said.
Meanwhile, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said the budget has been presented to lay the foundation for a strong economy. The government will address the grievances of the public servants. A housing programme will be started for them, he said.
Rural Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said both government and the opposition members are pointing out shortcomings of the budget. That shows that democracy is prevailing in the country, he said.
Mahindananda lauds Prime Minister
Opposition Parliamentarian Mahindananda Alutgamage lauded Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's leadership quality of being a good listener in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation when government backbenchers were shouting during his speech joining the second reading debate on the budget yesterday. He said backbenchers should learn from the leader to listen first.
However, Alutgamage said those who had worked tirelessly spending their monies and time to save the UNP when the party was in the opposition could not yield the results when they formed the government. Daya Gamage was the one who paid electricity and water bills of Sirikotha when the UNP was in the opposition. His lands too had been taken away from him, Alutgamage said.
"He has not been given a ministry which helps him to get his lands back," he said.
Minister Daya Gamage said he was Primary Industries Minister and had nothing to do with lands.
"I paid the electricity bills of Sirikotha. I am the one who settled the bills," the Prime Minister said.
'PMB lost Rs. 1,735 million last year'
The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) lost Rs. 1,735 million last year without receiving rice from paddy given to private rice mill owners for processing, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P.Harrison told in parliament yesterday.
The minister said investigations have been started by the Criminal Investigation Department to find out reasons for not receiving rice from paddy provided for 30 private rice mill owners. He said measures have been taken by the government to protect small and medium scale rice mill owners.
Loan facilities provided to the rice mill owners by the previous regime had been misused. Investigations have been started to look into this. He said the present government has also provided loans to them. They use these loans for other purposes," he said.
He said measures will be taken to provide Rs. 10 billion to the Treasury by strengthening rice mill owners avoiding unnecessary expenses.
Budget includes holistic approach to development - Swaminathan
The budget 2016 has covered the business community, development community, the public, low and middle income groups, women and children, vulnerable, senior citizens, public officers and all concerned stakeholders, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M.Swaminathan said in parliament yesterday.
"It is not easy to cover all parties who have conflict of interest. I consider this budget as a 'development oriented people friendly' budget which covers the aspirations of all Sri Lankans. This budget will be a milestone to create an upper middle income economy with inclusive growth and development. Rome was not built in a day," the minister said.
A delicate balance is maintained between economic reforms and price reduction of essential goods to provide relief to the masses," he said participating in the second reading stage debate on budget proposals.
The minister said unexpected costs from contracts signed by the previous government had restricted the space available to the government to manage resources efficiently.
The government has introduced a budgeting system which helps to rationalise public expenditure based on relevance and justification. Under the previous regime, 60 to 70 percent of the budget was at discretion of a few family members. Public assets were misused and given to friends and relatives, he said.
"We inherited a crisis ridden economy. It is not easy to revive the economy which had been mismanaged for the last 10 years. The 2016 budget is both development oriented and relief centred. This implies that the main thrust of the budget is two-fold. It includes cost of living reduction and pushing the development agenda," he said.
"According to the Fitch rating, the budget proposals reiterates ambitious set of economic reforms aimed at raising foreign investment, boosting private sector participation in the economy, promoting public-private partnerships, reducing dependency in foreign borrowings, improving ease-of-doing business and ensuring governance standards to achieve inclusive growth, employment generation, shared prosperity and protecting the poor and the vulnerable," the minister said.
Public investment has focused on infrastructure development, health, education and human capital development. The budget not only helps to revive the crisis driven economy but also includes proposals to achieve people friendly inclusive development, Minister Swaminathan said.
Budget based on erroneous hypothesis - Dinesh
The budget is based on an erroneous hypothesis, MP Dinesh Gunawardane told in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation joining the debate on the budget proposals for the eighth allotted day.
Gunawardane said notes worth Rs.300 million have been minted by the government. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the Rs. 300 million was used to pay loans taken during the Rajapaksa regime.
Gunawardana said the government expects an overnight industrialization. There should be proper plans to achieve industrialization, he said.
Gunawardana said the government has a plan to reduce 11,000 workers from the SLTB.
