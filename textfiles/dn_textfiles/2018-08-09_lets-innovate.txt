Let's innovate!

The ideas that will shape the future aren’t just coming from high-tech labs and research centers. Creative young minds are dreaming up innovations for a better tomorrow as part of the International Young Scientists Innovation Exhibition. The event which was held for the 10th time ran from July 9 to 13 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It is organized by Malaysia Young Scientist Organisation (MYSO) with the vision of creating an atmosphere of research mindedness in elementary and secondary school levels.
Around 30 countries took part in the event in which Nalanda College, Colombo, clinched four medals: a silver and three bronze. Maneesha Pramuditha Rajapaksa lead the team which comprised Senith Nimnaka Rajapaksha, Ayodya Panchal de Silva, Tharindu Deepaloka Munasinghe, and Dinera Susiriwardhena competed in the Environmental Science, Life Science and Physics and Engineering categories.

All these students are from the school’s Research Forum which is mentored by Upeksha Abeysekera. Nalanda College Principal Thilak Waththuhewa too supported the project.
Maneesha, Senith and Ayodya had developed a device to separate chemicals from drinking water and purifying it. This system is capable of separating Trichloromethane or Chlorofoam by using solar power. It is also easy on the purse and can be placed on a household water tank. It can even be utilized to purify a small quantity of water. Users are able to drink pure water which is not contaminated with germs by using this system.
“These chemicals are known to cause cancer. Though we cannot find the answer to how exactly cancers occur, the least we can do is protect ourselves from one of its causes by drinking purified water,” Maneesha said adding that they had won a silver medal in the Environmental Science category at the event.
The team had taken three months to do the project. Speaking about the most challenging moment of the project Ayodya said that finding a sample testing machine has been difficult. They had to sacrifice a lot of time to find the equipment needed for the project.
Tharindu too competed in the Environmental Science category at the International Young Scientists Innovation Exhibition. He has focused on a contemporary issue involving the preservation of the environment today. He has developed a ‘barrel’ to address the polythene menace in the country.
“If you try to destroy polythene by burning it outdoors, it contributes to air pollution. The barrel is designed to keep the fumes in so that you can burn more than one kilogram of household polythene without releasing the smoke in to the air,” explained the youth.
Tharindu had sought aid from Sri Lanka Science Society to develop his concept. He noted that there is no reduction of polythene use despite it being a much talked about topic in the past few months.
“The fume which comes out of burning polythene is filtered by active carbon in my product. Thus the output is clean air,” he said adding that he hopes to develop the device further and build a product which is the answer to the polythene issue of the country.
Senith has taken a totally different route to Tharindu in his project. He has focused on saving lives when a vehicle tumbles into a pond or river.
“There was no way a party in trouble can send a SOS. My device enables the victims to contact life saving authorities. This new safety system enables passengers to open the doors and shutters of the vehicle automatically, thereby sending the message alerting the relevant parties,” Senith said.

He has presented his project in the Physics and Engineering category and had clinched a bronze medal for his work. Dineru together with Akila Dulsara and Januka Dharmarathne of year 10 have built a machine through which one can get maximum benefits by scraping coconuts. They have been motivated to develop this device because of the high price of coconuts today. Their research had unearthed that if a coconut is blended at a low speed for a longer time, one can obtain better coconut milk which is full of protein and low in fat.
“We focused on the topic in two angles: how one can extract the best quality coconut milk by blending with hands and by using a blender. We did research on aspects like the water temperature, speed, and the levels of fat and protein,” Dineru elaborated some of the key points in his project which competed in the Life Science category at of the International Young Scientists Innovation Exhibition.
The boys marked their success at a time when the Sri Lankan Embassy in Malaysia marked its 60th anniversary.
Speaking to Daily News TnC the teacher in charge of the Nalanda Research Forum Upeksha Abeysekara noted that the forum had been incepted in 2011 with the aim of enhancing the creativity and research skills of the students. Each year boys from year nine onwards join the team to enhance their knowledge and skills. They have come up with quite a number of unique projects, some which have won international accolades. Once a student comes up with a noteworthy production, they interact with a resource person to develop their project.
The outputs which top national competitions then enter international events.
