Arrested for obstruction of duties

Police officers of the Tangalle Police Headquarters took into custody a person with a sword, who had attempted to hack Road Development Authority(RDA) officials who went to remove an unauthorised construction at Unakuruwa in Tangalle. The suspect was identified as a resident of Unakuruwa. This illegal construction inconvenienced residents of the area as it had caused vehicular traffic, RDA officials said.
Tangalle RDA Executive Engineer M. D. G. Jeewani said that the suspect had obstructed the RDA officials and the Police from carrying out their duties.
