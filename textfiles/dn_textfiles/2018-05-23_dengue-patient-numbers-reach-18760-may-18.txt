Dengue patient numbers reach 18,760 by May 18

A total of 18,760 dengue cases and 20 confirmed dengue deaths had been reported up to May 18 from all parts of the country, the Epidemiology Unit said.
According to the epidemiologists, the highest number of dengue cases, 2,891, had been reported from the Colombo district, while the second highest number, 2,618, had been reported from the Baticaloa district. The third highest number of dengue cases, 1,590, had been reported from the Gampaha district.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported a total of 7,89 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district had recorded a total of 2,102 dengue cases. The total number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province was 5,601, epidemiologists said.
Meanwhile, medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever, prior to applying home remedies. All fever patients require rest and should not attend work or school.
Patients should take Paracetamol only. All the other medications, especially Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen, cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), which could be fatal, they added.
People should keep their premises free of dengue mosquito breeding grounds during this rainy season, in order to prevent the spread of dengue. Even water retained in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed in, they said.
