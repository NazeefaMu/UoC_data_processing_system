MSMEs: A concept in poverty alleviation

Lack of formal employment has raised the number of people, mainly the poor, relying on informal activities such as self-employment and micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs).
The International Labour Organization has also rationalised the need for the development of MSMEs for poverty alleviation and economic and social empowerment of the poor. Therefore, promoting MSMEs is a strategy used in developing economies in poverty alleviation and economic and social empowerment programmes as it represents a promising source of productive employment, especially for the lowest income groups. Further, micro, small and medium enterprises represent a major source of employment and income in many countries of the Third World and detailed surveys in a number of countries suggest that as many as a quarter of all people of working age are engaged in MSME activities.
Similarly, MSMEs are important in bringing economic transition effectively using the skill and the talent of people without the necessity for high-level training, a large amount of capital or sophisticated technology and these MSMEs are recognised as a real engine of economic growth and technological progress. This makes MSMEs a major area of concern for government and non-governmental organisations with an objective of unemployment reduction, income generation, equitable income distribution, import substitution, innovation and poverty alleviation.
Apart from contributing to the national income, MSMEs are instruments of inclusive growth, touching the lives of the most vulnerable and the most marginalised groups. For many families, it is the only source of livelihood. For others, it supplements family income. Thus, instead of taking a welfare approach, this sector seeks to empower people to break the cycle of poverty and deprivation. It focuses on people’s skills and energy.
In India, The MSME sector is the largest source of employment after agriculture and this sector enables many of men, women and children living in slums, upcoming towns, remote villages and isolated hamlets to use indigenous knowledge, cultural wisdom and entrepreneurial skills for the sustenance of their lives and livelihoods.
Confirming that, the International Labour Organization also views the MSME sector as an essential catalyst for job creation, unemployment reduction and social progress, since it takes the lion share of the fast-growing labour force across the world, comprising 48 percent in North Africa, 51 percent in Latin America, 65 percent in Asia, and 72 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa.
There is no universal definition for MSMEs. However, there is some agreement on the general characteristics of these enterprises practised in developing countries. According to the International Labour Organization, MSMEs are small scale, use low level of technology, have low access to credit and lack managerial capacity. Further, a low level of productivity and income, a tendency to operate in the informal sector, fewer linkages with the modern economy and non-compliance with government registration procedures are other features.
These enterprises can be considered a heterogeneous group. Generally, micro enterprises are artisan-based, use local skills and resources, and sell their products locally. These enterprises involve lower levels of investment in machinery and provide largely part-time employment. Small and medium enterprises use power-driven machines and possess some technological sophistication.
On the other hand, the majority of micro and small enterprises consist of one person working alone. Self-employment is thus a central element in this sector. With most enterprises operating as single-person undertakings, it is not surprising that the largest employment category is working proprietors, a group that comprises more than half the MSME workforce in most countries. When unpaid family members are added, the numbers reach three-fourths of the workers in most places. Further, it is a common perception that micro and small enterprises are primarily vendors and small traders. There is truth in this perception, since in several countries the majority of enterprises are engaged in commerce. It is important to recognise, however, that, in all countries, small manufacturing activities are also an important component of the MSME sector.
Employment in MSMEs expands as a result of new enterprises springing up and also through expansion of existing enterprises. Some projects aim to promote new business by addressing the constraints that make it difficult for people to establish new enterprises. Other projects provide assistance aimed at countering the forces that cause existing enterprises to fail, while still others seek to help existing businesses improve their performance and expand.
The dimensions and determinants of MSMEs growth are vast and complex. Factors influencing an enterprise’s performance can be grouped into several categories, namely, demographic (gender, marital status, etc.), human capital (whether the entrepreneur has had training, the level of education, etc.), family ties (whether the enterprise is a family business or traditional, whether family members work in the business, etc.) and enterprise-related factors (amount of first loan, size of labour force, method of investment, receipt of a grant, type of enterprise, source of micro-finance, etc.).
MSMEs that began operation with higher initial investment are more likely to grow than their counterparts that started operation with relatively smaller initial investment. Therefore, as the initial investment size of MSMEs increases, the probability of moving forward from being survival MSMEs increases. Management-related factors such as maintenance of accounts, managing separate funds for business and household expenses, and registration of business also influence the success or failure of an enterprise. Further, the success of entrepreneurial businesses is limited by the availability and quality of five fundamental ingredients: (i) innovation, (ii) entrepreneurship, (iii) leadership, (iv) infrastructure, and (v) risk financing. On the other hand, most closures of these enterprises occur in the early years of a firm’s existence. MSMEs are particularly vulnerable during the initial years, when entrepreneurs are learning how to operate a new business. Further, differences in the amount of capital invested, access to capital, ability, risk aversion and spending the business grants on household investments have an impact on the growth and success of enterprises.
In addition, the location and the sector in which the MSMEs operate are instrumental in the growth of these enterprises. Moreover, MSMEs located in commercial districts were more likely to survive than those that operated in non-commercial areas. Proximity to growing markets would thus seem to be an important determinant of the prospects for an enterprise to survive.
It was also found that MSMEs suffer from a number of constraints and weaknesses. A predominant number of enterprises are in the unorganised sector. The sector is heterogeneous and the majority of units suffer from low technology base, resulting in low productivity and poor quality of products. As the units are small in size, they also have poor access to equity and credit. In most cases, capital comes from savings and loans from friends and relatives rather than through banking systems. This problem is particularly acute for the lower end of micro industries. This sector continues to face a shortage of skilled manpower due to lack of affordability and poor managerial capabilities. Another major weakness is the absence of marketing channels and brand-building capacity. Consequently, workers engaged in the MSME sector have very little bargaining power and are exploited by middlemen, unit owners and big business houses. They are unable to take up aggressive marketing like big players and they cannot find customers despite good quality and competent prices. In addition, the dispersed, unorganised nature of the industry also raises issues of quality, bulk production and inability of meeting big orders.
Further, MSMEs identify financing, especially medium to long-term finance, as their topmost obstacle to growth and investment. MSME constraints in access to finance are described as follows: (i) MSMEs are regarded by creditors and investors as high-risk borrowers due to insufficient assets and low capitalisation, vulnerability to market fluctuations and high mortality rates; (ii) information asymmetry arising from MSMEs’ lack of accounting records, inadequate financial statements or business plans makes it difficult for creditors and investors to assess the creditworthiness of potential MSME proposals; and (iii) high administrative and transaction costs of lending or investing small amounts do not make MSME financing a profitable business. In addition, there are fewer customers and sales due to the smaller population in an area, so that every customer is needed. The result is that businesses without the personal touch can fail faster than a similar other business would. The market potential for such firms is limited.
However, it is important to recognise that only a portion of MSME closures can be described as traditional ‘business failures’, where the firm was not financially or economically viable. Somewhat less than half of the MSME closures were in this category; lack of demand and shortage of working capital were the two most frequently mentioned underlying causes of these closures due to bad business conditions. However, those who closed their business for demand reasons were more likely to start a new enterprise than those who closed because of a lack of working capital. For the others, approximately one quarter of the MSMEs closed for personal reasons such as illness or retirement, while the remainder closed because the entrepreneur was able to move onto better options.
Therefore, it is clear that the micro and small enterprise sector contributes significantly to the socioeconomic development of vulnerable communities and enables them achieve socioeconomic equity. As such, MSME development emerges as a key instrument in poverty reduction efforts. However, MSME development strategies should be country and context specific. Each country may have its own challenges, opportunities and priorities for change. In addition, resources available for implementation may also vary by country and context.
Therefore, results achieved may also be different. Further, MSME development requires a cross-cutting strategy and the development strategy has to be inclusive and may have a more holistic approach, involving measures for creating an enabling environment, public–private dialogue and business development services facilitation (including capital, training, consultancy and advisory services, marketing assistance, technology development and transfer and business linkage promotion).
