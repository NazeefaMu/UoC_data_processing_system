Applause for belles lettre

That rush of joy seeps in slowly across the middle bench of the audience. That is where the shortlisted nominees occupied waiting for the ‘final judgement’. As the book covers appear on the large screen, the authors must have felt a pulsing throbbing feeling. Finally, when one book is left in the screen with its name announced as the winner, the recipient must have felt a rapid gentle tremor-like sensation. You are trapped in a starry stratosphere from the moment of rising from the seat through walking across the aisle towards the stage to receive the much-coveted trophy. The whole world reaches a new height right before you.
An award is a token of inspiration for any scribe. The judgement always stirs hair-splitting debates, but the winner’s satisfaction is beyond words. It reaches a point of culmination when the award comes down from the state.
Yet, as Higher Education & Cultural Affairs Dr Wijayadasa Rajapakshe emphasised at the State Literary Festival held recently, the winner does not take it all. The winning entry cannot underestimate the rest of the books.
“Our responsibility is to felicitate these writers and at the same time, the occasion of State Literary Awards Ceremony would be a motivation for them.
The literature has been a luxurious flow of water that nurtured the human civilisation. The ability this subject possesses to transform the human life into a more meaningful one is unquestionable,” Dr Rajapakshe noted.
The cultural activities of a nation, the minister observed, is a measure of its nobility. Most of the literary works in the world having penetrated into the lives of the human being were able to give guidance to the society. It is obvious that excellent literary works were penned in Polonnaruwa, Dambadeniya and Kotte eras, Dr Rajapakshe added.
He also noted that the literary culture was subject to degeneration within the period of nearly four centuries of the foreign rule though there was a subsequent renaissance in literature after gaining independence.
According to the State Literary Advisory Board Chairperson Professor Samantha Herath, the ceremony does not mark a result-sheet of a competition.
“We have no intention of pushing writers for competitions whatsoever. At the end of the process of the evaluation for the selection of best literary work of the year, we foresee a quite a different angle which is very wide, noble, and touching the foremost depths of humanity,” Professor Herath noted.
He also expressed his belief in a community of writers which are a minority in a large society. This group deserves to be highly respected and honoured. They have engaged in their creative and academic endeavours with the noble intention of sharing their talents and writing skills with the community at large.
Professor Herath defined writing as a human service, without much expectation, extending to a wider social space. Conceptually the writer has the mandate to address the whole society, as he wants, with immense freedom. The real socio-political, cultural stakeholders are writers in any society. They are the erudite, veteran and critical stakeholders. They provide vision critically for the march towards the development of the society. They clear the dark terrain and pave the way and light up for a new thinking process.
A notable feature of the event was Devika Wadigamangawa’s striking speech performed at no invitation. As the recipient of the Best Literary Work for Children in Translation, Wadigamangawa had no competition among the shortlisted works. Both shortlisted works were hers. Yet she was a bit reluctant to approach the trophy. She was struggling with something to express until the compere Wasantha Rohana offered her the microphone. She revealed her identity as the wife of Free Media Movement Firebrand Sanath Balasuriya and how she capitalised her victimised period to translate the award-winning entry.
Perhaps the least noticed yet most interesting fact is how father and daughter were recognised at the festival. Tissa Abeysekara posthumously received the Best Cinema Script AQward for Weli Kathara while his daughter Charulatha Abeysekara received the Best Novel award for Stories.
