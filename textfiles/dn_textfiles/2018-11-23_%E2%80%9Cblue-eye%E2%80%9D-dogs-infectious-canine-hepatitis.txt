Vaccination schedule in Sri Lanka
In Sri Lanka dogs should get the 1st shot of vaccine at the 8th week of age as the presence of maternal antibodies in the puppies body decrease at the age of 8 weeks. Thereafter a booster vaccine is recommended at 3 months of age. The shelf life of the vaccine is one year. An annual vaccination is suggested to continue the immunity of your dog.
Caring for infected dog
You have to understand the disease may end up with death. Dogs affected with hepatitis are very weak and recovery is just a matter of time, rest, plenty of liquids and lots of love and care. Regular health checks with your veterinarian are advised, just to make sure there are no secondary infections. Your dog may not have a lot of energy for a while, so allow him time to rest and respect that it will take time until your dog is back to full health. Keeping your dog’s bedding clean and sterile is advisable, especially if there are other pets in the vicinity, to avoid them being infected. If you do have other dogs or a cat, make sure you get them vaccinated immediately. The virus survives outside the host for weeks or months, but a 1%–3% solution of sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) is an effective disinfectant.
