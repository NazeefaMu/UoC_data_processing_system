Ageing at work

Although most people would not realise it, the structure of Sri Lankan society is changing – more of us are living longer. Life expectancy has been growing steadily for over half a century. In 1960, a Sri Lankan man could expect on average to live to the age of 62. Today, he can expect to live to 72. In 1960, a Sri Lankan woman also could have lived to an average 62 and today she can expect to live up to 78.
Today there are over 2.1 million people aged 65 years or over of which 57.5 % are women. Our current birth rate is 15.5 births/1,000 population while our death rate is 6.2 deaths/1,000 population. These simple statistics reflect the true nature of our demographic scenario.
Sri Lanka is slowly reaching a crisis point. Statistics predict that in 25 years from now, one quarter of our total population would be elderly persons.
Its time policymakers in Sri Lanka sit down and take stock of the increasing elders’ situation and decide about the course of action to be taken. It needs to be done without any further delay.
Definition of “elder”
Before we progress further, let us ask ourselves a simple question. What does “elder” mean? Who exactly is a senior Sri Lankan? When does someone become an older worker? Any research will reveal an almost bewildering variety of definitions. The United Nations uses 60 as the threshold for old age. OECD and various other local and international agencies uses 65 as the threshold for old age across the general population. Many western countries including Australia also use 65 as threshold. Some countries classify workers and job seekers as old at 55. Sri Lanka is one of them.
Of course, wherever the threshold is set for statistical or policy purposes, every individual is different. Each one’s so called “old age” is dependent on his (or her) attitude, level of activity, mental and physical health, life experiences, sex, cultural background, family situation, and so on. Age is also a matter of other people‘s perceptions: younger workers (aged under 45) routinely consider colleagues old at 50, whereas most workers aged 45 or over consider colleagues old only at 65.
Threat to productivity
In any country, the rapid ageing of the population and the associated decline in workforce participation are predicted to see the slowing down in gross domestic product (GDP) over the coming decades. In addition, the aged dependency ratio will keep on rising.
Understandably, in such a situation, the Government and the private sector will collectively draw up a policy plan aiming to increase the older workforce participation rate in order to enhance national productivity and reduce the burden on the taxpayer.
For example, when Australia faced the issue of rapidly ageing population, a report bluntly stated that the Government’s overarching objective should be to keep people in work, and paying taxes, longer - rather than being in receipt of old age pensions - and to support people into self-funded retirement.
In Sri Lankan context, we all know that our workforce is already ageing. Nevertheless, consistent research findings indicate a paradox in the workplace: that employers, both in public and private sector, recognise the significance of population ageing but either do not expect their work or business to have to do anything in response, or do not take more than temporary - non-strategic action.
The increasing number of older workers seeking to keep working or re-join the workforce represent an opportunity for the government and the corporate sector if they are ready to rise to the challenge: to appreciate the importance of older workers, to manage the changes, and to ensure that their workplaces are positioned to make the most of older workers’ contributions.
For monetary or non-monetary reasons, active work is an important element of one’s well-being, whether the person is aged or not. Recognizing this fact could be an essential part of the solution for ageing problem.
Paid work contributes not only to material well-being but also to psychological well-being through social interactions and opportunities for personal and professional growth. And unpaid work, like volunteering, care work, and artistic work, can provide these same psychological benefits. Given these positive effects, encouraging and rewarding paid and unpaid work among the elderly could be a crucial part of the solution to the aging-related fiscal and social challenge
Phased-in retirement is a workable strategy now adopted in many countries in the western world and would suit Sri Lanka, too. To make it workable, Government and private sector policymakers should consider: (i) a gradual retirement scheme allowing older individuals to lower their working hours yet remain in the workforce until a later age and (ii) furnishing options for and rewarding volunteering, care, and artistic activities among older society members.
Economic and business case
There is an economic benefit for longer working lives. Contrary to popular belief, the evidence shows that keeping more aged people in workplace actually improves the quality of work in the establishment because aged workers are experienced, they care for their workplace and, above all, they can guide the younger team members with their knowledge and experience.
There is also a clear business benefit as the retiring workforce is already starting to cause skill shortages in certain sectors which will only worsen in future years if the most experienced workers retire or leave the country.
However, social norms that dictate the ‘expected’ age of retirement can be slow to change, but eventually it has to happen keeping up with the developing trend in other countries.
Self-employment
Whilst self-employment is not for everyone, it can provide the flexibility that many older workers want or need. It offers another avenue to utilise the skills they have acquired over a lifetime of employment, gives them financial independence, flexibility in working hours and the opportunity to rise to a new professional challenge. The Government could encourage the aged people to become entrepreneurs by giving them financial and non-financial support.
Key opportunities
This writer can see three key opportunities for the state sector and private sector companies if they retain the older employees.
Increasing productivity: Successful organisations appreciate the business case for engaging retaining and retraining older workers in order to ensure current and future productivity.
Moving beyond stereotypes: Organisations which strive to engage and retain older workers understand the impact of age discrimination as a barrier to older worker participation.
Investing in flexibility: Successful organisations build flexibility into the workplace and facilitate flexible careers suitable for older workers.
If the Government and private sector are keen to seize the opportunity, changes are urgently required to overcome the barriers to later life working.
The concept of retirement and ageing in the workforce must move with the times as people’s lives and the population demographics change.
To take full advantage of the opportunity, employers (both state and private) need to consider the training and professional development needs and interests of older workers.
This will include tailoring the type of training offered to ensure it is appropriate for older workers, as well as identifying roles in which older workers can assist with in-house training and knowledge transfer.
In cases where individuals are unable to take advantage of phased-in retirement - due to health issues, family obligations, or skills mismatch - Government could promote and reward volunteering, care work, and artistic work among the elderly. Such unpaid activities improve the quality of the social fabric, help the well-being of those engaging in them, contribute to the economy, and reduce healthcare and welfare costs.
Providing opportunities for the elderly to remain in the workforce longer as well as engage in volunteering, care, and artistic activities can provide both social and economic benefits and relieve some of the fiscal pressures related to aging societies.
However, at the same time, policies should be arranged in a way that recognizes the dignity and autonomy of older individuals as opposed to providing them with meaningless or degrading tasks merely to keep them occupied.
In addition to furnishing meaningful and rewarding opportunities, activities should be adapted to the physical and mental aptness of older individuals.
