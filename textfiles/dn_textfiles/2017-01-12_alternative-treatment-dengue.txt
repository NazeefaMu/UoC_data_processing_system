An alternative treatment for dengue

Recently my son, having infected dengue and being in a critical condition, was admitted to Asiri Central Hospital. I was in dilemma over his situation. At the Hospital, as there is no prescribed medicine for this illness in Western Medicine, he was given saline drips with total bed rest, measuring intake and output of liquids, blood tests, administering antibiotics and other tests were the treatment.
My friends and well-wishers always pressurized me to meet a well known Ayurveda Physician at Aluthwala, Baddegama, and bring a bottle of medicine as it is proved to be an efficacious treatment for dengue. Although I was unable to make a decision at first, later I decided to meet the physician, considering the severity of the patient. I left early morning on the third day and reached Aluthwala in three hours. After bringing the bottle of medicine we started giving him by 50 ml doses hourly. This was not disclosed to anyone in the hospital.
On the following day, the blood count started to improve. Yet little by little as the patient had various bodily issues that are attributable to slow recovery. On the sixth day of admission blood count increased up to 55,000 and later he was discharged.
I never underestimate the service at the hospital. But I am sure the indigenous medicine had effectively improved his position. All who recommended me this treatment had their personal experience. Hence I can recommend this treatment for all dengue patients. Save valuable lives from dengue. May all authorities and others pay their attention to this medicine.
