Revision bail application by Anura Senanayaka fixed for Feb.8

 
Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke today fixed for support on February 8, the bail revision application filed by Western Province former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake, arrested and remanded over his alleged role in the cover up of evidence in former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen’s murder.
However, the Attorney General had raised objections to releasing the suspect on bail at this juncture saying the police were yet to conclude investigations into the incident.
Through the revision application, former DIG had sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrate’s refusal to enlarge him on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
The petitioner said that the Colombo Additional Magistrate had refused to release him on bail on number of occasion since he had been charged for conspiring to commit a murder.
The petitioner said there is no evidence to prove that he was involved in conspiring to commit a murder, and thereby moved Court that he be released on bail.
The prosecution maintained that there is a suspicion that the suspect had beem involved along with the main suspects to commit this murder, since circumstantial evidence suggests the suspects had conducted their investigations in a manner to record Thajudeen’s death as a fatal road accident.
