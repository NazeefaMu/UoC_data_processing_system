Shakib doubtful for  Nidahas Trophy – not medically cleared

Bangladesh received a jolt with skipper Shakib Al Hasan not receiving a go-ahead on his finger injury from his doctors in Bangkok and continues to remain doubtful for the upcoming tri-nation Nidahas Trophy.
The Bangladesh all-rounder, who consulted an orthopedician in Bangkok to take stock of his injury, has already been included in the squad for the tournament to be held in Sri Lanka. BCB took the bold step of naming Shakib in the side with a hope that he will recover during some point of the tournament. However, as per his doctor, he might need up to two weeks of physiotherapy before taking the field.
"We are yet to take any decision regarding him whether he will be treated in Bangkok or Australia or will return and do the rehabilitation here," BCB chief physician Debashish Chowdhury said on Wednesday. 
"But his chance of participation is very slim. Still he can be part of the touring side in Sri Lanka if we opt to take him for mentoring the side with the hope that he can be available whenever he gets fit but that does not look to be possible during the tournament considering his condition," he further added.
According to BCB insiders, even if the all-rounder undergoes 10 days of physiotherapy, he will still require a few more days under observation before being ready to take the field, in all likelihood for the last game of the tournament if everything goes precisely as per plan.
"We are not clear about his status," chief selector Minhajul Abedin said. "But it is very unlikely that he will be available soon." BCB, earlier on Monday, had announced a 16-member squad keeping Shakib's injury in mind. At that time, it was expected that he will miss the first two games.
