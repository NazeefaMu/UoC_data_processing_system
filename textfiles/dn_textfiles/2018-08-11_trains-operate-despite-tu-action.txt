Trains operate despite TU action

The Sri Lanka Railways managed to operate nine trains from Colombo Fort and Maradana last evening too, despite trade union action launched by several unions.
According to Railways Additional General Manager Wijaya Samarasinghe, several trains bound for Mirigama, Kandy, Matara, Puttalam, Avissawella, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa left Colombo Fort from yesterday morning.
He said that several office trains were also in operation last evening despite Locommotive Train Drivers Association’s warning that they would stop the few trains presently in operation. Thousands of commuters were stranded due to sudden wild cat strike launched by several trade unions and traffic on the road opposite the Fort Railway Station came to a standstill for several hours, as angry commuters staged a protest blocking the road on Wednesday. Protesting commuters demanded the government to take stern action against the trade union officials who are trying to win their petty demands at the hands of innocent commuters.
