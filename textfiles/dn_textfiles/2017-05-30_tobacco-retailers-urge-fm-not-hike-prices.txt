Tobacco retailers urge FM not to hike prices

The Sri Lanka Tobacco Retailers’ Association met newly appointed Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, at the Ministry of Finance last week, to highlight several issues facing traders and tobacco sales.
They said that the association’s membership of over 100,000 has been severely affected following the government’s price hike on tobacco products in October last year, resulting in severe losses for the trade.
This has impacted livelihoods as this also affects sales of other products, which are purchased by tobacco consumers, they said, adding that many consumers are seen switching to illicit products.
They requested that the Minister maintain prices of legal tobacco products at reasonable levels, not implement the proposed ban on stick sales and not introduce regulations that will affect their business and livelihoods in a drastic manner.
They added that tobacco traders have conducted business in an ethical manner respecting the laws and regulations with respect to the tobacco trade, and requested the Finance Minister to consider their position for future policymaking.
