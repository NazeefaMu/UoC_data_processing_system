Pakistan’s top general accuses India of targeting CPEC

Pakistan’s top military officer yesterday accused India of targeting the $50 billion China- Pakistan Economic Corridor project through “subversive activities”.
The CPEC is a planned network of roads, railways and energy projects linking southern Pakistan, and the Gwadar Port, to China’s restive Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region.
As it passes through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), India has raised objection to the project.
Zubair, the only four-star general besides army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, said Pakistan was aware of “enemy designs” and was taking effective counter measures for national security.
