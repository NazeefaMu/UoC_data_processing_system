Pollution threatens Chithramala Ella

Chithramala Ella also known as Hakurudola Ella or Wavul Ella situated near Marukanda close to Nedurana along Eheliyagoda - Idangoda Road is threatened by pollution.
Illicit gem mining along the upper stream and paddy fields of both sides of the stream pollutes water becoming a serious environmental problem.
This immaculate white cascading waterfall not only provides drinking water for a large number of people but also supplies water for hundreds of acres of paddy fields. It generates 350 kilo watts of electricity which feeds into the main power lines.
Chitramala Ella derives its name from a clever artist who drew frescoes on the walls of a vihara and drowned while bathing. As the scenery is breath-taking, this area can be developed as a tourist attraction, nature lovers said.
