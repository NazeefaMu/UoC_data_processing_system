Kandy –  Australia’s  hoodoo venue

 
The Sri Lanka cricket team cleverly handled by captain Angelo Mathews created history last Saturday at the picturesque Pallekelle International Stadium by recording their second Test win after 17 years against the Australians, who are rated as the No. 1 Test team in the world.
Australia last lost to Sri Lanka also in Kandy by six wickets at Asgiriya Stadium in September 11, 1999.
Undoubtedly one of the happiest people was former master blaster and now chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya. The smile he sported at the conclusion of the Test said it all. In 1999 he was the captain when Sri Lanka first beat Australia. This win came under his selection committee chairmanship.
At Pallekele Australians chasing 268 for victory were all out for 161, their innings finishing with a record 154 consecutive deliveries without a run. Australia had a first-innings lead of 86. But Kusal Mendis’ first Test century 176 runs and Rangana Herath’s 5-54 put paid to their chances of winning.
Australia captain Steve Smith made a gritty 55 before tail-enders Steve O’Keefe and Peter Nevill resisted for 178 balls, scoring only four runs. O’Keefe and Nevill’s ninth-wicket stand came at just 0.13 runs an over, before debutant Dhananjaya de Silva had Nevill caught behind. The previous record for a partnership lasting 100 balls or more was 0.64 by South Africa’s Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers against India last December.
It was a remarkable win for Sri Lanka after having being shot out for 117 in the first innings and then reeling at six for two in the second innings before Mendis made his superb knock which earned him the man-of-the-match award which was presented by chief minister of Central Province Sarath Ekanayake. All players should be commended for turning this game and winning it which at one time looked unlikely. Herath bowled his side to victory by taking nine wickets in the match.
This triumph for Sri Lanka came in 27 matches across the 33-year-history between the teams. Sri Lanka has won two and lost ten games.
The biggest draw back at the venue was the absence of local fans even when the Lankans were winning. There were so few locals with Australian tourists out numbering them. Sri Lanka went into this Test match with an inexperienced side including two debutants.
Along with Herath, Lakshan Sandakan, bowled well with match figures of 7-107 on debut.
It is obvious that right hander Mendis and ‘chinaman’ bowler Sandakan are the future of Sri Lanka cricket. Mendis should not be tagged great just yet and not compared with former Sri Lanka great batsmen. He has greatness written all over him as his knocks in cold England and now in the First Test showed. He has the right technique and temperament coupled with the right strokes to make waves in the all-important Test cricket. If properly handled he should turn out to being another master class like former captain Mahela Jayewardene.
In Sandakan Sri Lanka has unearthed an uncut gem. Never before has Sri Lanka cricket produced a ‘chinaman’ bowler in the class of Sandkan. We have had great lefties like Daya Sahabandu and Ajit de Silva, but never the likes of Lakshan Sandakan. He had the Aussie batsmen like cats on a hot tin roof jumping around unable to read his mystery deliveries as to which way it was going.
He reminded one of a bowler of similar style the Aussies had not so long ago in David Sincock. If handled properly he could turn put into being a match winner for Sri Lanka in the future.
