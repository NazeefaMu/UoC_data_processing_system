Ulagalla celebrates seven years in the hospitality industry

The festivities kicked off with the traditional boiling of milk, followed by blessings from religious leaders representing all four religions. Later on, in a special gesture to commemorate the event, Ulagalla unveiled the sanitary facility to be presented to the Punchikulama School in Punchikulama. The occasion marks the hotel’s entry into their seventh year on a high note, in-keeping with Uga Escapes’ consistent commitment to social development projects.
A special Bodhi Pooja ceremony was then conducted at Jayasiri Maha Bhodiya, in the presence of the General Manager and other members of staff.
The following day, a special dinner was organised for staff members, with a visit from the company CEO, Ramli Gaffoor who thanked the Ulagalla team for their contributions towards the company’s achievements. The staff were also given an opportunity to showcase their talents outside of their general scope, with special performances set up for the evening.
