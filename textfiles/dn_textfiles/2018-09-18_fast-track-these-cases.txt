Fast-track these cases

President Maithripala Sirisena has voiced his concern at the slow progress in instituting legal proceedings against members of the Security Forces implicated in various acts of criminality during the former regime. Speaking to Heads of print and electronic media and editors at the Presidential Secretariat on Friday, the President said the police and the CID should ensure that the legal process be taken to its conclusion, regardless of the outcome, instead of letting the matters lie in abeyance after the initial arrest is made. He made particular reference to the case involving commodore D.P.K. Dassanayake. The Naval officer who was implicated in the disappearance of eleven Tamil youth was first arrested and then released, with no follow-up legal action and none the wiser as to what has become of the case.
Like the President said, the issue would give rise to political implications adding grist to the mill of the Joint Opposition's constant refrain of a witch-hunt being carried out against war heroes by the Yahapalanaya Government. If these cases are decided, one way or the other, no one would be able to point the accusing finger at the government of witch-hunts, since it will be the courts which will be the final arbiter, if those taken in are guilty or not. Besides, leaving these cases in abeyance would also amount to denial of justice on behalf of the victims and a negation of the rule of law, if indeed those arrested in fact are implicated. Commodore Dassanayake was taken into custody and held in remand for a lengthy period and even brought before courts from time to time. The Joint Opposition made a big song and dance, with some pro-Rajapaksa Buddhist monks too voicing their protest at the treatment meted out to a war hero who was personally credited with destroying LTTE vessels at high sea.
Suddenly he was released on bail and to-date no one knows what became of the case. In fact it is an injustice on the ex-naval officer, as well, to keep the matter hanging over him like the Sword of Damocles. All such cases, particularly those where members of the security forces are implicated, should be disposed of until they are decided one way or the other and the air cleared.
Not just the ex-Security Forces personnel. Even the celebrated cases against members of the Rajapaksa family and their close associates that were opened with much fanfare by this Government have retreated into the forgotten things of limbo. What became of the famous sil redi case involving the former Secretary to the ex-President where it is alleged public funds to the tune of Rs. 650 million was used for election bribes, it is pertinent to inquire. There is also no inkling as to the progress of the cases where the progeny and siblings of the former President were allegedly involved. There was the matter of Yoshitha Rajapaksa spending Rs. 40 million to set up a private TV station and the acquisition of valuable property in Dehiwela which then became famous as the Daisy Aatchi case. The second son of the former President was shown on Television taking a ride in the prison bus, an indication that the court thought it fit to send him to remand prison due to the seriousness of the offense. However, YR is now not only a free bird but the other day was seen actively involved at the venue of the Janabalaya protest, perhaps putting the whole prison episode behind him as a bad experience.
The case where Basil Rajapaksa is alleged to have illegally acquired real estate in Malwana and built on it a luxury premises for a hotel project too appears to have lost steam and so it is with the Hi-Corp case where it is alleged that Namal Rajapaksa siphoned off Rs.30 million.
There are also the murders of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramatunga and Ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen which, for all intents and purposes, have reached a dead end. Even the special courts set up to speed up the hearings appear to have hit a snag with suspects being granted bail. True, court procedures have to be strictly followed except that these only add to the frustration of those yearning for justice.
The Yahapalanaya Government had been in office for over three years and during this time hardly any culprit involved in cases of murder or corruption under the Rajapaksa regime had been brought to justice, to the disappointment of the overwhelming majority who voted for a regime change. This frustration was given expression to at the recent LG election. The Government can continue to ignore the public feelings on this score only at a great cost to it. No doubt, the Janabalayas and other shows staged by the Joint Opposition have huge funds pumped into them which can only come from the massive war chest amassed during the 10 year Rajapaksa rule. So far the Government had failed to discover the sources of these funds and also the avenues by which they were earned while it talks of getting more and more people to pay taxes from their hidden wealth.
