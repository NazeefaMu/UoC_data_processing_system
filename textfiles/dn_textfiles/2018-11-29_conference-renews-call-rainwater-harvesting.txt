Conference renews call for rainwater harvesting

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday stressed the importance of providing sustainable water and sanitation services for growing cities to limit adverse health and development impacts.
“Water and sanitation are two main challenges of sustaining human urban settlements and without reliable access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, cities cannot be sustainable,” he said.
Minister Gunawardena said policymakers and national planners should take these issues into serious consideration and new sources of water and energy including rainwater harvesting, solar power and wind power should be incorporated in their future development plans.
The Minister was speaking at the inauguration of the International Conference on Water Security through Rainwater Harvesting organised by the Lanka Rainwater Harvesting Forum in collaboration with the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry, International Water Management Institute (IWMI) with the support of USAID, and other sponsors.
The Minister charged that the Port City development project has completely ignored rainwater collection. “Therefore, we will have to put some pressure on decision-makers,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Dr. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah said Sri Lanka gets an annual average rainfall of 2,000mm, ranging from 900mm to 6,000mm in different regions. However, on average only about 60 percent of this water is being used and the balance drains into the sea as run-off.
The Minister said rainwater harvesting saves water which otherwise ends up in the sea. It is also a cost-saving measure, as water in urban areas has to be paid for. It will also reduce flooding.
He further said that rainwater harvesting promotes self-sufficiency and fosters an appreciation for water as a resource. It also promotes water conservation and groundwater recharging. Rainwater harvesting also conserves energy as the energy input needed to operate a centralised water system is bypassed.
“At present, we are pumping water from a long distance away in Ambatale. This is costly and much water is lost from leakages. Both energy and water can be saved if at least portion of the water needs in a household is collected through rainwater harvesting at one’s own premises,” the Minister said.
Local erosion and flooding in urban areas during heavy rains is lessened as a portion of local rainfall is diverted into collection tanks, he said.
IWMI Head of Sri Lanka Development Initiative Herath Manthrithilaka, City Planning and Water Supply Ministry Secretary D.G.M.V. Hapuarachchi and other local and foreign participants also spoke on the occasion.
