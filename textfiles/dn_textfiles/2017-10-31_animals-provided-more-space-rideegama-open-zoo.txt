Animals provided more space at Rideegama open zoo

The Open Zoo at Rideegama, Hambantota has been a much visited place among the general public. The animals are provided with a land area of 500 acres to roam freely in. The pictures above shows a lion, resting in its 35 acre ‘lion zone’ as visitors in buses come to watch the spectacle.
The lions could be observed at close range. A bus takes visitors close to them. There are ten lions, 5 adults and 5 lion cubs.
