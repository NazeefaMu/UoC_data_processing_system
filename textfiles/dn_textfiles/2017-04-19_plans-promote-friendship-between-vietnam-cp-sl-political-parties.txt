Plans to promote friendship between Vietnam CP, SL political parties

Steps should be taken to implement plans towards promoting friendship between the Vietnam Communist Party and political parties in Sri Lanka, while strengthening bilateral relations between the two countries, Vietnam Community Party General Secretary Nguven Phú Trong said.
He was speaking at a discussion held with Sri Lanka Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Vietnam Communist Party Headquarters in Hanoi recently.
Nguven Phú Trong said he always valued the support people of Sri Lanka extended towards Vietnam’s freedom struggle.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe invited a delegation of the Vietnam Communist Party to visit Sri Lanka and said a foundation could be laid for a sustainable relationship between the Vietnam Communist Party and political parties in Sri Lanka during that visit.
The Vietnam Communist Party General Secretary appreciated deeply the efforts taken by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to steer Sri Lanka into a salutary path towards rapid development.
The discussions also emphasised that Sri Lanka and Vietnam were making dedicated efforts towards peace, national unity and economic development.
Views were also exchanged about the importance of strengthening relations in the economic, trade, cultural, eduction, youth, defence, parliamentary affairs and other fields.
