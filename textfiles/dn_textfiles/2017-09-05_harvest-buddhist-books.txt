Harvest of Buddhist books

Renowned scholar Chamika Munasinghe recently published a host of Buddhist books: Sathiya, Bhavana saha Nivan Maga (by Tilaka Kudahetti) and Prayogika Budu Dahama (by Venerable Dodampahala Sri Rahula Thera) primary among them. The other books include Karmaya Pala Dena Heti (by Venerable Pathegama Gnanissara Thera), Karmaya Saha Dharmaya (by Venerable Dodampahala Sri Rahula Thera), Prayogika Budu Dahama (by Asanka Atigala) and Devatha Namaskaraya (by Dr Indika Gamhewa).
In these books, the publisher presents essays, study guides and practical advice on the practice of Buddhist Dhamma, commonly known as Vinaya in Buddhist parlance, by both the lay Buddhists, new initiates and experienced bhikkhus. Buddhism is essentially a religion of the mind. Mindfulness and meditation are the most talked about subject in the practice of Buddhism on the eightfold path for the final deliverance from the bondage of birth and death. Most of the articles in this section are written by venerable Buddhist monks out of love and compassion for the humanity. Even if we do not practice this religion, some of the essays in this section can be immensely beneficial for achieving inner peace and equanimity of the mind by practicing mindfulness.
The quality of our lives is conditioned by the quality of our actions. Buddhism teaches us to have a firm conviction in human potential. It says that we are creatures that possess the wonderful ability to take responsibility for what we think, do, and say, and to make our lives expressions of wisdom and compassion, rather than selfishness, fear, and greed.
