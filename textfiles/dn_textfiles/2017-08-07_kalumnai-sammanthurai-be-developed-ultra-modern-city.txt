Kalmunai and Sammanthurai will be an extensive modern city with state-of-the-art infrastructure facilities once the master plan for the project is realized, City Planning and Water Supply Minister and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Rauff Hakeem said.

Minister Hakeem said he believed that the major city under development would turn out to be a ultra-modern commercial hub with huge foreign and local investments and population about 500,000 by 2050. Initiatives will be taken to link the commercial hubs of Hambantota and Trincomalee, he said.
Prof. P.K.S.Mahanama, University of Moratuwa explained at the meeting the main features of the proposed city development project.
The project, on completion, will resemble major modern cities in Dubai and Bahrain, he explained. An official said generating power from solid waste and creating a solid-waste-free-environment would be explored.
