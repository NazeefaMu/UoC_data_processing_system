Grade One admission appeals should be first sent to schools

The Education Ministry said parents’ appeals regarding Grade One admissions should be first sent to the relevant school if their applications for Grade One have not been considered by the school.
Secondly, the appeal can be forwarded either to the relevant Provincial Education Ministry or to the Education Ministry if the appeal is turned down by the school. Accordingly, appeals relating to national schools should be forwarded to the Education Ministry while appeals relating to provincial schools should be forwarded to the relevant Provincial Education Ministry.
Lists of selected students are displayed in schools at present and parents can check for names at the relevant school.
It has been scheduled to enroll Grade One students on January 15.
The Education Ministry will establish a special unit to look into the issues relating to Grade One appeals.
