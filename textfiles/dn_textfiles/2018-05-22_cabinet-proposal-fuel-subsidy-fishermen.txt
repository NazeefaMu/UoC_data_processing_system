Cabinet proposal on fuel subsidy for fishermen

A proposal to supply fuel to members of the fisheries industry at the previous price under a subsidy scheme will be submitted to Cabinet at its meeting today, in the form of a Cabinet memorandum by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa.
The memorandum is submitted in respect of fishermen using both kerosene and diesel for their boats.
There are a total of 4532 multi day boats and 897 one day boats using diesel and 24,850 one day boats with small nets using Kerosene. Under the previous Cabinet memorandum submitted by the Fisheries Minister, Rs.4 billion was allocated to provide the kerosene subsidy for one day boats.
Following the displeasure shown by fishermen towards this subsidy the Fisheries Minister along with State and Deputy Ministers and the Director General of the Fisheries Department commenced discussions with the representatives of fisheries unions.
At these discussions the fisheries representatives demanded that fuel be supplied at the previous price. They also objected to the proposal to credit the subsidy to the bank accounts of fishermen.
Fisheries Department Director General Prasanna Ginige said his department has taken steps to provide a fair and just solution to this problem and the result is the Cabinet memorandum submitted by the Minister.
