Elderly man dies in elephant attack

An elderly man who was attacked by an elephant on Tuesday morning, died on the spot at Pakkiyawatta in Pottuvil. The victim was identified as 53-year-old M. Saleem.
Meanwhile, a 37-year-old woman who is a resident of Pottuvil, was seriously injured when an elephant attacked her on the same day. She was then rushed to hospital.
An elephant had entered the Pakkiyawatta, Hithaya Pura, and Muhuthu Maha Temple areas in the Pottuvil DS division and damaged properties.
Residents of the Pottuvil DS division spend their nights in fear.
The villagers, who undergo great difficulties due to the wild elephants that often invade their villages, had complained to the relevant authorities and requested them to provide them a proper solution, but their efforts have so far been proven futile.
