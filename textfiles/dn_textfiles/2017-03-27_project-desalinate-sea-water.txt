Project to desalinate sea water

A project will be initiated to desalinate sea water for drinking, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi said. He was addressing a press briefing in the Tissamaharama area recently.
A desalination plant will be set up at Bataatha in Hungama. The Minister said a three-acre land will be allocated for the purpose.
