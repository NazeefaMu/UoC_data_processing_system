From soccerite to a dream ruggerite!

He was a exemplary Cop in its most distinguished sense.And famous as Rugby National Coach, National Selector, Captain of the Police and Manager. He was a Footballer too. He played in 7 --yes, seven Clifford Cup Finals. Arguably a record.
 
‘BENNA’ the Josephian and the Serviceman was Best in Class and bore all these trappings lightly on his shoulders.
BENEDICT’S achievements in the field played with an oval ball called rugby is amazing, unbelievable and which is not likely to be equaled or surpassed, not only be any Josephian, but a ruggerite from any other school as well. We will detail his record as we move on.
Records he can boast of

While any other ordinary mortal will want to flaunt his plumes, or walk like a cock of the yard with nothing to show, BENEDICT has records that he can boast of and go tell it on the mountains. But todate he remains a simple, unassuming and likeable character we all ought to know.
BENEDICT’S first love was football as a young kid at school. Had he continued in the kicking game he had the inborn talent to succeed and reach the top. But he was forced into the running with the ball, passing and kicking game by a former Josephian rugby captain Neville Perera who persuaded him into the game of rugby.
It was Perera noticing his unlimited ability to be an even better ruggerite than a footballer who finally convinced him to take to rugby. Incidentally once on tour of England covering the Champions Trophy cricket tournament for the ANCL, I had the good fortune of meeting Perera.
Mentioning Benedict
It was at the residence of Dr.Gunasingham a former Air Force and Sri Lanka hockey goalkeeper in Kent in the company of their fair ladies and during a bit of elbow bending talking sport especially rugby and his mentioning BENEDICT and how he spotted Benedict’s prowess in rugby.
The moment BENEDICT handled the oval ball, he realized the unlimited, enjoyable moments ahead and the thrills and spills the game beckoned and beyond the touch lines were the bottom lines for him. Believe it or not he is arguably the only ruggerite to play in seven Clifford Cup finals. Amazing isn’t it!
His rugby expedition began in 1963 when playing for the school’s first side in football that he also took to rugby. He won school colours in both sports and in quitting school in 1964 he joined the Havelocks rugby scrum which team was captained by that outstanding left hand batsman and also captain of Trinity College Nimal Maralande. He excelled as a 2nd rower and in the next year playing under yet another Trinitian who hooked out the oval ball with success Frankie David.
Law abiding citizen
BENEDICT then wanting to be a law abiding citizen and see that others also did so to maintain the lofty traditions of law and order, joined the Police in 1967 in an era where top sportsmen in cricket and rugby players joined the khakied gentry and winning trophies at cricket and rugby became the rule rather than the exception. The names of the outstanding cricketers and ruggerites in the Police in that era are too numerous to mention.
‘BENNA’ as he was fondly called joined the Police when an Old Peterite S.Sivendren was making waves as hooker and captain of the Police team that was then playing in the ‘B’ Division. BENEDICT played a pivotal role and helped the team win the ‘B’ Division Title which earned them promotion to the top league and rub shoulders with the elite club teams.
In 1967 the Police playing in the big league, served notice of what to expect from future Police teams when playing in the Clifford Cup final they lost to Havelocks 3-11. Then ‘BENNA’ played in the 1970 Police team led by another inside three quarter who was like a gazelle in M.A.Majeed who also played for the country and shared the Clifford Cup with Havelocks led by Jeff Ratnam 6-all.
Unfortunate to lose
Then in 1971 after the JVP insurrection when many service teams were forced to skip the tournament, Police led by prop forward ’Tanker’ Hamid which included a few Air Force players of the calibre of ‘Viper’ Guneratne, ‘Lofty’ Perera and ‘king’ Charles Wijewardene played the ’knock out’ Cup final but were unfortunate to lose to CR and FC by 21 points to 7.
But BENEDICT’S most memorable moment which he still vividly remembers and treasures was the 1972 Clifford Cup final against the CH & FC led by that ‘bulldozer’ Y.C.Chang. Under the brilliant coaching of a former Trinity great Kavan Rambukwella, the PolIce were not fancied.
But a fantastic conversion by fly half and Sri Lankan soccerite Nimal Abeysinghe from 45 yards out brought the Policemen into the picture. Then when every heart was beating more than normal, ‘BENNA’ called on another soccerite Nizam Hajireen to convert a penalty in fading light.
When Hajireen obliged
And Hajireen obliged to give Police victory and send their supporters into raptures and the Police had rewritten history by being the first service team to drink off the Clifford Cup.
Incidentally featuring TUAN NIZAM HAJIREEN in these columns a few weeks back I failed to mention that immediately after kicking Police to the Clifford Cup, he got on his ‘iron horse’ and rode breaking speed limits to the Sugathadasa Stadium to help Police win the Football Association Cup. A truly amazing feat unequaled or surpassed to date in energy, grit and determination. Sportsmen and fans still talk about Hajireen’s heroics.
When BENEDCT quit the Police it was home coming to Havelocks again and played in the team led by Thajone Savangham that won the Clifford Cup. In 1977 ‘BENNA’ played in his seventh cup final when Havelocks coached by another Trinity stalwart Ken de Joodt won the cup.
Steered Havies to victory
Then leading the Havies in 1978 he steered them to win the triple – the ‘Sevens’ Clifford Cup and the ‘Knockout’. Lack of space does not allow me to detail all his achievements but suffice to say that he represented Sri Lanka from 1970 to ’77, playing against Singapore, England, Asiads in Hong Kong and Colombo. He also toured Hong Kong, Bombay, Dubai, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Chinese Taipei, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Italy.
‘BENNA’ was also coach and referee. Coaching the Police he helped them to a triple winning the Clifford Cup in 1980 under Nimal Lewke, in ’94 under Upali Vidanage and ’85 under Upali Sahabandu.
Then on the invitation of Kishin ‘my way ’Butani he took to coaching the CH & FC in 1994 and helped them savor their best years in the game winning the Clifford Cup and the President’s trophy.
Charismatic Kishin Butani
The charismatic Butani with Hassan Singhawansa as his secretary had it in them to make the club champions with their inspiration and determination. But once he twosome quit the club, the standards dropped alarmingly.
Another former ruggerite, rugby fanatic and financier Rizly Illiyas has taken over and has promised to bring back those glory days to CH, particularly promising and determined to bring Kandy SC down from their perch and to their knees. It will be interesting watching.
BENEDICT’S other achievements are: National coach from 1989 to ’92. National Rugby Selector in 1995 and ’96. Manager of Sri Lanka teams that toured abroad. Vice President SLRFU In 1992. President SLRFU. BENEDICT is married to Jasmin Rajee and has to lovely daughters in Dhisini and Chrisini. His Christian teaching made him a honorable citizen with impeccable honesty and integrity.
