SriLankan Airlines assists in disaster relief efforts

The staff members of SriLankan Airlines and SriLankan Catering joined the relief efforts carried out during the recent floods that affected several areas of the country.
The donations of staff members were handed over to Disaster Management Centre of Sri Lanka (DMCSL) and Sri Lanka Air Force to be coordinated and distributed among the needy through the government institutions.
The relief goods donated by staff members comprised dry rations, linen, medicine, toiletries and clothing items. Apart from that SriLankan Airlines also assisted Disaster Management Center to airlift relief goods on urgent basis from its overseas stations to Colombo.
In the past, the Airline has readily provided assistance to the fellow citizens affected bynatural disasters, through the collection and distribution of relief donations.
