Path cherished for centuries

“Maggan’atthangiko settho– saccanam caturo padaVirago settho dhammanam – dipadanam ca cakkhuma -273.
Eso’va maggo nattha’anno– dassanassa visuddhiyaEtamhi tumhe patipajjatha– marass’etam pamohanam” – 274.
“The best of paths is the Eight-fold Path. The best of truths are the four Sayings. Non-attachment is the best of states. The best of bipeds is the Seeing One”. - 273.
“This is the only Way. There is none other for the purity of vision. Tread this path. This is the bewilderment of Mara”.-274
-Quoted from ‘The Dhammapada – by Venerable Narada Thera - Magga Vagga- verses 273 & 274.
‘Noble’ means good, great, perfect or highest in value. The Noble Eight-fold Path is the path that leads to the end of ‘Dukkha’. It is also known as the Middle Way (Majjhima Patipada). ‘Dukkha’ is the unsatisfactory nature in life.
Things that are impermanent by nature apparently look like things that are permanent. So the worldly being (Puthujjana) holds on or clings to these fleeting objects. Thus the individual tries to satisfy himself/ herself, but fails to no avail. This is Dukkha, the unsatisfactory nature in life. When practiced earnestly, the Noble Eight-fold Path leads to emancipation, helping one to put an end to ‘Dukkha’ or ‘pain’.
The two extremes are self-indulgence and self-mortification. One needs to avoid these two extremes and tread along the Middle Way if one is to be happy in life. Giving too much of pleasure to the body is self-indulgence whereas torturing or giving immense pain to the body is known as self-mortification.
Self-mortification
Before becoming the Buddha, when He was Prince Siddhartha, leading a life of pleasure in the Royal palace, the path He chose was self-indulgence. The moment the Prince renounced worldly life and opted to live as a hermit in the forest, the path He selected was self-mortification.
The hermits at the time harboured a firm belief that torturing the body would serve as a solution in emancipating themselves. As such Prince Siddhartha too inclined towards the practice of torturing the body. For instance, practices like eating less food, sometimes only a fruit that falls down beside Him, meditating in the hot sun etc.
The eight factors of the Noble Eight-fold Path are namely Right view, Right thought, Right speech, Right action, Right livelihood, Right effort, Right mindfulness and Right concentration (unification of the mind).
Right view- In one way it is: understanding of the Four Noble Truths: the unsatisfactory nature in life (Dukkha), the cause of Dukkha, the cessation of Dukkha, the Path that leads to the end of Dukkha.
In another way, it is: understanding the reality in life. Apparently, worldly things are permanent; but the reality is: Every phenomenon (except Nibbana) is subject to change, impermanent. That is the uncertainty in life.
Right thought- Thoughts of renunciation (Nekkhamma Sankappa)-
This could also imply ‘letting go’ here and now. That is to use material (worldly) things with understanding, considering the need, rather than the greed.
Thoughts of non-anger (Avyapada Sankappa)-
Not to be angry with anyone and harbor thoughts of destroying any life but to radiate boundless thoughts on Loving-Kindness to all sentient beings (Metta).
Thoughts of non-harming (Avihimsa Sankappa)-
Not to harm any living creature but to be kind to all living beings.
Right speech- It is the correct use of words. One refrains from wrong ways of speech: Lying, backbiting (telling tales), gossip or idle talk and abusive language/ speaking harsh words. When one refrains from such talk, then naturally pure words would spring from one’s mouth. Such words would be pleasing and soothing to the ear.
Right action- It is to perform meritorious, good deeds. ‘Kusala’ means ‘skillful’. Kusalakamma or Skillful actions are as follows: to refrain from taking the life of another (including oneself), to refrain from taking what is not given and to refrain from sexual misconduct. The precept ‘to refrain from taking any intoxicants’ is not included here, as suppose this precept is violated, it would cause the violation of any of the above mentioned three precepts.
Moreover, the meritorious deeds one could perform are Generosity (Dana), Virtue/ Discipline/observance of the precepts (Sila) and meditation/mental culture (Bhavana). These are known as the three kinds of meritorious deeds (Thrivida punya kriya).
The ten kinds of meritorious deeds (Dasa punya kriya) include the above three kinds of meritorious deeds and the other meritorious deeds are attending the daily chores such as keeping the home, the school and the temple clean and tidy (Veyyavacca), honouring or having due respect to the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, teachers and elders (Apacayana), transference of merit (Pattidana), rejoicing in others’ merits (Pattanumodana), expounding the Dhamma/ having Dhamma discussions/ publishing books on Dhamma (Desana), listening to the Dhamma (Suti) and straightening of one’s views (making an effort to realize the impermanent nature of all worldly phenomena, understanding the Four Noble Truths) (Ditthijjukamma).
Right livelihood- It is to refrain from the five illegal trades: selling of animals, selling of flesh, selling of poison, selling of weapons and selling of liquor.
When one refrains from these five illegal trades, then one could make one’s living through rightful means.
Right effort- It is the four ways of putting forth effort (Satara sammappadana virya) in one’s practice:
To keep refraining from the evil not yet arisen.To refrain from the evil already arisen.To perform the good not yet performed.
To perform the good already performed again and again and bring such good deeds into fruition.
Right mindfulness- It is to be mindful in what you do.
Kayanupassana – being mindful in one’s bodily movements: when breathing in and out, walking, standing, sitting and lying down, reflecting over the loathsomeness of the body, reflecting over the four great elements of the body namely solidity, fluidity, heat and air, reflecting over the nine stages of the corpse when discarded after death (Nava sivathikaya) etc.
Vedananupassana – being mindful on sensations arising in the body. The three kinds of sensations arising in the body are namely painful sensation, pleasurable sensation and neutral (neither pleasant nor painful sensation.
Cittanupassana– It is to be mindful and aware of thoughts arising in the mind: the lustful mind, the lust-free mind, the mind filled with hatred, the mind free of hate, the ignorant mind, the mind free of ignorance (the knowing mind), the scattered mind, the collected mind etc. Dhammanupassana – being mindful amidst the occurrence of the five hindrances, the five aggregates, the six sense doors namely the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind and the arising of the seven factors of enlightenment (Sapta Bojjhanga) etc.
Right concentration – the unification of the mind gained through focusing one’s mind on a particular object (something moral, free of lust, hate and delusion). As an example: In Anapanasati meditation, the object is the breath whereas in Meditation on Loving-Kindness, the object is ‘metta’ (Loving – Kindness)
Noble Eight-fold Path
In the Noble eight-fold Path, the factors Right speech, Right action and Right livelihood are categorized as Sila. The factors Right effort, Right mindfulness and Right concentration are categorized as Samadhi and the factors Right view and Right thought are categorized as Panna(Wisdom).
Reflecting on the Noble Eight-fold Path in the right way is being attentive in this present moment. Being mindful and aware in this present moment with clear comprehension thus is known as ‘Yoniso Manasikaraya’.
“Abhikkhante patikkhante sampajanakari hoti,Alokite vilokite sampajanakari hoti,Samminjite pasarite sampajanakari hoti,Sanghati pattacivara dharanesampajanakari hoti,Asite pite kayite sayite sampajanakari hoti,Uccara passava kammesampajanakari hoti,Gate tite nisinne sutte jagarite bhasite tunhibhavesampajanakari hoti”,
“One is aware, for instance, in visiting a religious institute and attending the religious activities there and afterwards in leaving and returning from the religious institute; this could also suggest being aware at the start of a certain task, the time of attending the task and at the end of the task, or else when engaged in walking meditation, one makes oneself fully alert and conscious of what one is doing;
when looking ahead and looking around…,when bending and extending one’s limbs…,
when carrying one’s outer cloak, one’s upper robe and one’s almsbowl (for a monk)…/ when wearing clothes and using cup and plate…,
when eating, drinking, chewing and savoring…,when urinating and defecating…,
when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking and remaining silent one makes oneself fully alert.”
After all, just as a physician diagnoses a patient and prescribes medicine accordingly so does the Blessed One gives us two prescriptions: One is Sila, Samadhi and Panna (Wisdom) and the other is Dana, Sila and Bhavana. These are to be followed in our daily lives.
Further the Blessed One proclaimed: “Imassakalebarassalokan capannapemi, loka samudayan ca pannapemi, loka nirodhan ca pannapemi, loka nirodhagamini patipadan ca pannapemi”.
“In this fathom-long body I perceive the arising of Dukkha, the cause of Dukkha, the cessation of Dukkha and the path that which leads to the cessation of Dukkha.”
One may fail in one’s endeavor to follow the Noble-eight fold path and be good. However, no matter how many times one fails one should do the right thing in his / her following approach as the Dhammapada verse goes:
“Yo ca pubbe pamajjitva – paccha so nappamajjatiSo’mam lokam pabhaseti – abbha muttova candima”.
“Whoever was heedless before and afterwards is not; such a one illumines this world like the moon freed from clouds.”
