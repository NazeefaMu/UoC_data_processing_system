Sri Lanka develops low-carb rice - Neeroga

Ambalantota Rice Research Centre has introduced a new variety of low-carb rice - Neeroga - in order to prevent diabetes.
During an inspection tour of the Rice Research Centre in Ambalantota, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera underlined the importance of promoting this rice variety as a commercial crop to meet the increasing demand for low-carb rice in the local as well as the international market.
As a country where the staple food is rice, most Sri Lankans eat rice for all three main meals. Rice is rich in carbohydrates and consuming more rice will store excess sugar in the blood which leads to diabetes.
“Considering this, the scientists of the Rice Research Centre in Ambalantota conducted research to produce a low-carb rice variety. As a result of that research, scientists developed this new rice variety,” said the minister.
According to the Minister, the Agriculture Department has already taken measures to conduct a large number of research projects with the intention of introducing healthy food crops.
