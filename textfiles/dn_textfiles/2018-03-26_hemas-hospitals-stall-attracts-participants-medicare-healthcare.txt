Hemas Hospitals stall attracts participants at Medicare Healthcare exhibition

One of Sri Lanka’s leading multi-specialty private hospital chain, Hemas Hospitals, was present at the Medicare 2018, Sri Lanka’s premier national healthcare exhibition, held in Colombo and Jaffna.
Attracting more than 2000 participants at both venues, the Hemas Hospitals stall at the exhibition offered free consultations for participants and provided free tests for the public to check random blood sugar, BMI (Body Mass Index), body fat analysis and blood pressure.
A team from Hemas Hospitals was available throughout the day to assist participants in providing vital information on different healthcare topics, way forward for a healthy life, details about different medical tests and many more.
The stall also had exciting raffle draws for participants where they took some exciting gifts home from Hemas.
The Medicare National Healthcare Exhibition 2018 focused on introducing and promoting the latest advances in medical science and technology. Organized by the Ministry of Health for the 9th consecutive year, it showcased the latest in modern healthcare, disease prevention, effective treatment methods, newest technology and latest services available in Sri Lankan hospitals and laboratories as well as the global medical sector.
Medicare Exhibition in Colombo was held from March 2 to 4 at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Centre while the Northern Peninsula edition was held at the Weerasigham Hall from March 9 to 11.
“Sri Lanka is progressing towards becoming an important healthcare hub in South Asia for both international patients and suppliers.
