‘Dengue defeated, patients dwindling’

National Hospital dengue ward closed from Aug 7:
Defeating dengue within a short period is a victory achieved by the Sri Lankan health sector. The dengue ward at the National Hospital is closed from August 7, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the dengue epidemic was reported from Kinniya for the first time. Now the number of dengue patients is going down. The wards used for dengue patients in the Negombo hospital are now being used for other patients.
Minister Senaratne was addressing the gathering during the dengue eradication programme held at Battaramulla, recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that doctors, nurses and health staffers worked tirelessly to treat dengue patients. This had significantly contributed to decreasing the number of dengue patients. During the past, the police, armed forces and field officers made a large contribution towards dengue mosquito control activities.
"There is no point in controlling dengue temporarily. Dengue can increase again if the climate changes. Therefore, all should carry out the cleaning process without interruption to make sure that dengue mosquito breeding places do not exist," the minister said.
Health Ministry officials and others were present.
