Two drug peddlers arrested in Imaduwa

Imaduwa Police found a new ruse adopted by drug peddlers when they arrested two suspected drug peddlers of a five member gang at Panchaliya on the Imaduwa - Ahangama road, following a tip-off on April 30.
The ruse adopted by them is to obtain payment through eazy cash system and stick the packet of heroin onto an identified pillar or post in a given area with the aid of chewing gum for the buyer to pick it up.
Police said the two suspects aged 25 and 26 years were residents of the Weligama area.
Investigations are continuing.
