One hundred and twenty housemaids return

One hundred and twenty Sri Lankans who went to the Middle East seeking employment returned to the island after being subjected to various hardships abroad.
They returned to the country with the intervention of the Ministry of Foreign Employment yesterday morning.
Before being sent back home, the women had reportedly been detained at the Sri Lankan Embassy after being subjected to hardships during their stay as house maids in the Middle East.
