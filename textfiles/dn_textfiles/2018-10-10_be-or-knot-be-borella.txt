To be or Knot to be in Borella

The Colombo performance of ‘To be or Knot to be’, a comedy performed by the Sri Theatre Company, will be staged at the Borella Punchi Theatre on November 3 from 7.30 8.50 pm. The Sri Theatre team is back on stage with an all-new play for theatre lovers in Colombo. It has been a while since their last production took off in Colombo.
This year they have packaged a rib-tickling comedy about a young girl forced into marriage with a boy she barely knows. Rukaiya is ambitious and smart however she fears that marriage might dampen her spirits.
But what to do?
The couple must get to know each other or they are to head for a divorce in no time. They must weigh love over the trust, destiny over free will, the new world over the old. The play revolves around a Muslim family. The Sri Theatre team claims that this is the first time in Sri Lankan theatre that non-Muslims have the opportunity to enjoy the inconsistencies and jolly traditions observed by Muslims. The writer who likes to call himself an Existentialist Muslim believes that it is the God-given right to man that he questions his environment. If God wanted blind followers he would simply have engineered automatic solar-powered robots, but then he didn’t, according to a line from the play.
The first step to any form of reconciliation is to be able to laugh at ourselves believes Aslam Marikkar the writer of To be or Knot to be.
The play stars Ruwanthi as Zeena, Anaz as Feroze, Chanaka as Nazeer and Mithm as Rukaiya.
Sri theatre company believes that this play will change the way people think about another's religion and realize that in Sri Lanka all religions adhere to a uniquely Lankan set of taboos and traditions.
