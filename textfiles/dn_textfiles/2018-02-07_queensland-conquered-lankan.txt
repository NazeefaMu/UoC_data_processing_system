Queensland conquered by a Lankan

The recorded evidence of Ceylonese migrants to Australia dates back to 1816; they are, Major William O’Dean and Eve— a Malay and his Sinhalese wife. Most of the early immigrants from Ceylon generally got mixed with Aboriginal population. Apart from this, other early incidences date back to the 1870s. Queensland authorities sought out the prospects of importing labour for work on sugar cane plantations. The first batch of Lankans to work in the State was famously branded as Cingalese, a common name for Ceylonese irrespective of racial/ethnic identities.
A population of Ceylonese origin was believed to live on Thursday Island, since the beginning of 20th century. In 1882, a group of 480 left the island for Queensland—who landed in Mackay and Bundaberg in East coast. There were Ceylonese jewellers and pearl divers who left Galle port for Torres Strait. The collapse of the coffee industry followed by a depression and the moving out of villagers of their homelands by colonial planters motivated the Ceylonese to look for greener pastures down under.
Fortune seekers
S M Kamaldeen, writing for Sunday Times of October 15, 1978, in an article entitled,
‘Stranded without food …Sinhalese workers named the town Badagini!’—he queries, ‘Badagini’ of West Australia or ‘Baddaginnie’ In Victoria? He further says,
“…It is relevant to note here that during a study tour in Australia recently, the writer was pleasantly surprised to learn of a town called ‘Badagini’ in West Australia. It is said that this was the place where a group of Sinhala workers had been stranded without food, to mark which event J. G. Wilmot, a surveyor under whom they served, gave the name Badagini.” The columnist further inquires. “Could it be that some of the Ceylonese who landed at Mackay or Bundaberg found their way to distant West Australia perhaps to join the vast hordes of fortune seekers during the gold rush?”
About 37 years ago, perhaps Kamaldeen with a restricted range of information network unlike today, wouldn’t have made correct presumptions. The writer’s work on the claim on ‘Badagini’ concludes that there wasn’t a town by that name in Western Australia, but that the reference was to Baddaginnie in Victoria, which is a small township -190 km North-East of Melbourne and 10 km West of Benalla, on the Melbourne-Sydney rail track.
A place-name book compiled by Blake speaks of a Surveyor by the name, J. G. Wilmot who arrived with a team from Ceylon named the place Baddaginnie, for his men starving without provisions screamed ‘We are hungry’. Like in Kamaldeen’s, Blake’s observations are controversial too.
It is hard to believe the workers travelled over 3000 km from Mackay and Bundaberg in QLD to Victoria in the 1880s; secondly, there exists a creek [stream] called Baddaginnie flowing parallel to the rail line and through the township; therefore, one could logically infer the place got the name from it after the surveying of the place in 1857.
The name Baddaginnie sounds Aboriginal; names like Lake Bungunnia, a town in Western Australia, Badgingarra, a river called Bongala; forest Bungongo. However, it would be pertinent to quote Dr Wickrema Weerasooriya, distinguished Senior Public Servant and former High Commissioner to Australia, he says, “…the paper carried a news item that, ‘Mr. Wilmot, a surveyor from Ceylon, is naming places in Victoria, such as Dimbulla and Gampola’”.
This he says in his exhaustive research ‘Links between Australia and Sri Lanka’-1988, where he traces the origins of two Sinhala town names. Quoting Ceylon Weekly Observer-1885, he further says, ‘The writer came across a detailed description of Dimbulla, it is a town situated 334 km north-west of Melbourne, and that previously, it was known as ‘Nine Creeks’.
The name ‘Dimboola’ has generally been accepted to have come from the Sinhalese word “dimbula” meaning ‘Land of Figs’ [Divul] also Gampola, the name of an upcountry town. Records authenticate the names came from the surveyor, John W Wilmot, who lived in Ceylon as well.
A British ship named Devonshire had left Colombo with 482 people in 1882. Apart from the 11 Malays, 8 Moors and 14 Sinhala women and eight children; the rest were Sinhalese males. There are contradictory reports on the precise date of departure— Kamaldeen says, November 14, while Arthur C Dep, [former DIG] writing to Sunday Times of November 1983 says, “Devonshire left on this memorable voyage in mid-September 1882.”
White Australians in Bundaberg opposed the state rulers’ move. They banded themselves jointly into an Anti-Cooley movement; the initiative was to oppose trading in of foreign labour. The business was labelled as an invasion. Misinformation carried out by them for months caught the attention of politicians, but they ignored it as a purely a private affair and refrained from interfering.
On November 18, these groups encircled the landing area and pelted objects at ‘Cingalese’ with the aim of forcing them back to the ship.
Brutal confrontation
The Cingalese in an unknown territory though refused to surrender, as an alternative, as eye-witnesses reported, “…at a mass gathering of over 500, the leaders of Anti-Cooley League provoked the white Australians to demonstrate. At the port, unruly scenes were seen which gradually developed into a brutal confrontation between them and agents of plantations that ordered the labour, compelling the latter to vanish from the area leaving the Cingalese stranded.
The deserted immigrants had no alternative but to respond in their own way. Being strained to ‘resolve’ the state by themselves, they dragged their knives, stormed into the Australian’s barrier making a sharp, loud, piercing cry of ruthless and disparaging terminology both in English and Sinhala.
The whites who came upon an abrupt and unexpected occurrence in their home territory suffered an uncouth shock and in an undue swiftness, bewilderment and confusion ran helter-skelter.”
The Cingalese chased the leaguers away from the sight; even caused physical harm to a few who suffered in the stampede.
As a habit 19th and early 20th century Lankans carried a short knife with a pointed blade with them. These courageous and daring men ‘conquered’ Bundaberg, but later peacefully walked inland. Australians never repeated the mistake.
