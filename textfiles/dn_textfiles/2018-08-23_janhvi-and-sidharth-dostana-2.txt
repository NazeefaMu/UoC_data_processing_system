JANHVI AND SIDHARTH IN 'DOSTANA 2'

‘Dostana’ fans have waited years for a sequel to the Priyanka Chopra, John Abraham and Abhishek Bachchan film. The good news is there could be a sequel to the fun, romantic comedy hit on the way.
As per a new report in Bollywood Hungama, filmmaker Karan Johar’s ‘Dostana 2’, starring Janhvi Kapoor and Sidharth Malhotra, is already in the works.“Karan Johar always wanted to make ‘Dostana 2’, especially after the first film worked so well. Now finally he has a script for the film, which of course will speed up production. As for the cast, Karan has finalised both Sidharth Malhotra and Janhvi Kapoor, and is currently looking out for the third lead role that will again be a male lead,” a source told Bollywood Hungama.
The new ‘Dostana’ film would be directed by Tarun Mansukhani, who made his debut as a filmmaker with ‘Dostana’ in 2008.
The bold comedy-drama was set in Miami and told the story of two men pretending to be gay to get an apartment with a woman. “Like the first film this one too will be directed by Tarun Mansukhani.
The only difference will be the story and cast that will change. But as of now with the hunt still on, the film is still a long way off from going on floor,” the source said.
‘Dostana 2’ would mark Janhvi’s second film with Karan’s Dharma Production, after her debut role in ‘Dhadak’.
Sidharth was recently seen in Karan Johar films like ‘A Gentleman’ (2017) opposite Jacqueline Fernandez as well as Sonakshi Sinha and Akshaye Khanna-starrer ‘Ittefaq’ (2017).
