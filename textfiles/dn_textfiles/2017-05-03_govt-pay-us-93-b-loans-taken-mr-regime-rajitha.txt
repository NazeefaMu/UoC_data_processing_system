Govt to pay US $9.3 b for loans taken by MR regime: Rajitha

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the government has to pay US $ 9.3 billion for loans obtained by the previous government. However, the present government obtained only US $ 1,150 million.
Addressing the UNP May Day rally held on May 1 in Colombo, he said the former President lied about the loans obtained by the government. All investigations into murders, corruption and malpractices of the previous regime should be completed before the next year’s May Day celebration. Names and details of the persons who stand in the current regime and protect the Rajapaksas will be revealed.
The Minister said others were shown on state television channels after showing the entire Rajapaksa family during the previous regime. Now the media has been given freedom.
But the media try to bring back the previous regime. It was innocent poor people who brought in good governance, so their hopes should be fulfilled.
A national government can be formed even after 2020. The Constitution will be changed and the Government will face a referendum without any fear. Strikes should not be launched and problems should be resolved through discussions, he said.
