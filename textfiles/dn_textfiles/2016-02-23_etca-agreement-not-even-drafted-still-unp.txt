ETCA agreement not even drafted still: UNP

 
The UNP yesterday brushed aside as unwarranted criticism levelled against the proposed Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) between Sri Lanka and India, claiming that it has not even been drafted.
UNP Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara told the media that some opposition political elements and organisations with vested interests were trying to create apprehension in the public mind using something
which is not even in existence as yet. “It has not even been drafted. So, how could these political elements and organisations keep criticising it.
This shows that they are misleading the public and trying to seek petty political mileage using the issue,” he added. Bandara said there has only been some preliminary discussions over the issue. He said proposals for such an agreement will only be finalised after discussing with intellectuals, entrepreneurs and all relevant sectors.
The MP said this would be done in a very transparent manner which ensures maximum benefits to the country.
