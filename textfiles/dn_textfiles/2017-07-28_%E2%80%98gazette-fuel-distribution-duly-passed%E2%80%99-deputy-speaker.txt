‘Gazette on fuel distribution duly passed’: Deputy Speaker

 
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said that the resolution that made fuel distribution an essential service was duly passed in the Parliament today, despite the commotion caused by the Joint Opposition (JO).
The Deputy Speaker made this observation during a press conference held in Parliamentary Complex today, after the sittings had been adjourned. 
He also said that the motion was moved according to the Standing Orders and was passed accordingly, even amid a calamitous situation.
He also said that although the JO questions of the fact that the mace was not on the brackets, it was only a tradition to keep it on brackets and the resolution was passed duly.
Questioned by the media of the mock session held by the Joint Opposition members following the sittings being adjourned, Deputy Speaker said that an investigation would be held if there were complaints in that regard.
He also said that the members of the Joint Opposition should act with a sense of responsibility as a sum of Rs. 16 million of the people’s money is spent for a single sitting day of Parliament.
