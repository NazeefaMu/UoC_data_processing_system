Fun-filled activities for kids

Little Gym is a leading holistic child development centre uses physical activity as a conduit to build physical, mental and social skills in children from the ages of four month to twelve years. The programme emphasizes the importance of movement based learning and imaginative play to help young children become healthy, well balanced and creative adults later in life. In an era where digital engagement has encroached on children’s playtime and is contributing to development of unhealthy habits, The Little Gym presents a different approach to early childhood enrichment and sports skill development. The core philosophy of the Little Gym is to provide children with fun, warm and nurturing environment allowing them to experience success and build self-esteem in a non-competitive way.
