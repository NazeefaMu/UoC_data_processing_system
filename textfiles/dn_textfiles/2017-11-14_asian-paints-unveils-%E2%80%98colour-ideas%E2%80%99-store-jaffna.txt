Asian Paints unveils ‘Colour Ideas’ store in Jaffna

An Asian Paints ‘Colour Ideas’ storewhich focuses on colour as an idea rather than a product, was recently opened in Jaffna to offer consumers the right mix of inspiration and detail in the world of painting.
The new store is located at Jaffna Hardware, No.32, Stanley Road, Jaffna, and is designed to showcase the Asian Paints Interior and Exterior Emulsion combinations, includingthe range of Royale Luxury Interior Emulsions and Apex Ultima Exterior Emulsions.
The new Colour Ideas store also displays Asian Paints’ Royale Play designer finishes for interior walls, Renner Italian Wood finishes, and the ‘SmartCare’ waterproofing range.
A departure from the traditional way of selling paint, this store is the fifth‘Colour Ideas’ store of Asian Paints in Sri Lanka. Visitors here are greeted with a series of painted and textured panels and recessed displays with miniature settings depicting living, dining and bed rooms in different colour combinations and adjustable lighting. Commenting on the unveiling of the Jaffna ‘Colour Ideas’ store, A. K. Paranthaman, Asian Paints’ National Sales and Marketing Manager said, “Colour choice is something that is very personal to every one of us. With our ‘Colour Ideas’ store, we now offer the people in Jaffna and its suburbs an opportunity to experiment with their favourite colours, the latest finishes and trendy combinations, and to make the best choice based on their individual tastes and preferences.”
Hosted by the Managing Partners of Jaffna Hardware, P. Srikaran and P. Srimugunthan, the store opening ceremony in Jaffna was attended by Paranthaman as well as Asian Paints’ Assistant Sales Manager, Gerard George and Regional Manager, Jaffna G. Krishnarajah.
Visitors to an Asian Paints Colour Ideas store first walk in to an ‘Experiential Zone’ where they are exposed to different shades and colour combinations with painted and textured panels and experience how colour is affected by different lighting and space.
They are able to use Asian Paints’ colour visualiser software that makes it possible to try out various shade combinations and effects on a computer, and meet a colour consultant who would provide them with colour and product recommendations.
Visitors thereafter go to the ‘Transactional Zone’ where they may purchase multiple Asian Paints brands of interior and exterior paints from the company’s extensive product portfolio. ‘Colour Ideas’ stores also serve as a great platform for architects, interior designers and contractors to visit along with their clients in order to visually experience the process of decorating homes.
