Lavigne to release  long-awaited music

Avril Lavigne is finally ready to return to the charts with the release of her first song from her long-awaited new album later this month.
The Complicated singer hasn’t released any new music since 2015, the same year she went public with her battle with Lyme disease, and although she has kept largely out of the spotlight, she has continued to work on her sixth studio project while battling the illness.
Now Avril has announced the wait is over - Head Above Water will be out on 19 September.
“I spent the last few years at home sick fighting Lyme Disease,” she writes in a lengthy statement on her website. “Those were the worst years of my life as I went through both physical and emotional battles. I was able to turn that fight into music I’m really proud of... Truly... by keeping my spirits up, having goals to reach and a purpose to live for, my music helped to heal me and keep me alive...”
Avril goes on to thank her fans for being patient and reveals she wrote the lead single when she was convinced she was going to succumb to her illness.
“It is also the first song I wrote from my bed during one of the scariest moments of my life,” she adds. “I had accepted death and could feel my body shutting down. I felt like I was drowning. Like I was going under water and I just needed to come up for air... Praying to God for Him to help me just keep my head above the water... I grew closer to Him. My mother held me. In her arms, I wrote the first song that I am releasing to tell my story...”
The 33-year-old also reveals she is ready to be “truthful” about her health struggle because she wants to raise awareness for other people who are battling the disease through the work of her charity, The Avril Lavigne Foundation.
“I’m taking my life back into my own hands and doing what it is I know I am meant to be doing in this life time,” she continues. “Making music. And sharing my healing and hope, through my music. I wish for this all to touch you, to bring you strength, to lift you up, to inspire and to encourage you...”
