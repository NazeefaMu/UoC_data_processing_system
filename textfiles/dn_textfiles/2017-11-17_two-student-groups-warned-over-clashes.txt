Two student groups warned over clashes

Two groups of students belonging to two separate classes of a leading school in the suburbs of Mahiyangana have been summoned by Police for engaging in a clash and causing a disturbance in Mahiyangana town on November 15, a spokesman for Mahiyangana Police said. Police said these two groups had been involved in a clash from time to time in the recent past bringing their school to disrepute.
They had clashed during the week prior to 2016 December holidays and several times before this year too.
Police said the two groups summoned to Police this time were severely warned and released by ASP Ujith Liyanage and Mahiyangana Police OIC. They departed after paying obeisance to their Principal and promising to give up their enmity.
