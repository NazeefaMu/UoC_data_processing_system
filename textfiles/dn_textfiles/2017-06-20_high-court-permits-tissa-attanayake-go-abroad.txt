The Colombo High Court ordered to temporally release former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake’s passport today enabling him to travel to Australia.
 Former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake sought Court’s permission to travel to Australia to visit his daughterfrom June 23 till July 12.
 Tissa Attanayake’s passport was impounded by Courts for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election to annul the result of then Common Candidate President Maithripala Sirisena.
 Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared on behalf of the accused.
 On October 19, 2017, Tissa Attanayake was remanded till December 5 for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election by inciting racial or religious hatred among communities.
He is currently out on bail.
 The accused was charged under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007. This is the first time in Sri Lanka an accused was indicted in the High Court by the Attorney General over an offence that comes under the ICCPR Act.
 The Attorney General alleged that Tissa Attanayake publicly announced on December 22, 2014 that there was a secret agreement between then Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
 The Attorney General alleged Tissa Attanayake committed an offence under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007 by inciting racial or religious hatred among communities.
 Section 3(1) of the ICCPR cites that no person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to cause discrimination, hostility or violence.
 The AG alleged that Tissa Attanayake committed a punishable offence under Sections 454 and 459 of the Penal Code by forging a document and displaying it to the public as genuine and that the accused had also committed an offence under Section 80-C of the Presidential Election Act for displaying a fake document prior to an election, for the purpose of affecting the result of the election in relation to the personal character or conduct of any candidate.
 The AG listed 15 persons, including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as witnesses in the case.
This case is to be taken up for trial on July 17.
