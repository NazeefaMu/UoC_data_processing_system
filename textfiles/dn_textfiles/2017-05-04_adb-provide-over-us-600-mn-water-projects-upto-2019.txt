ADB to provide over US$ 600 mn for water projects upto 2019

The Asian Development Bank(ADB) will provide over US$ 600 million as loans, grants and identified co financing to Sri Lanka during 2017 to 19 for water and wastewater management, water security and water supply and sanitation projects.
The ADB has also allocated a staggering US$ 4.2 billion in 2017 for urban and water management projects in the Asian Region, said Asian Development Bank (ADB) Sustainable Development and Climate Change Deputy Director General, Amy Leung addressing media at the opening press briefing of the 50th Annual Meeting which commenced at Facifico Convention Centre Yokohama yesterday.
The Jaffna and Kilinochchi Water Supply and Sanitation Project will receive US$ 100 mn as additional financing and the second tranche of US$130 mn for the Mahaweli Water Security Investment Program will be provided in 2017. US$ 30.83 mn as a TA loan for Mahaweli Water Security Investment Program, Phase 2 will be provided in 2018.
US$ 130 million will be received for the Mahaweli Water Security Investment Program tranche 3 in 2019 and another US$ 180 million for the Greater Colombo Water and Wastewater Management Improvement Investment Program as additional financing also in 2019.
Leung said by 2050 the food demand will increase by 50%, energy 66% and water by 51%. It is also estimated that by 2050 the water situation will get worse resulting in 3.4 billon people in this region living in water deficient areas. “The world economic forum global risk report last year assessed the emerging water crisis as one of the three incomparable risks that we are facing in the near future.
Hence it is very urgent that we have coordinated action to resolve the water factor in the Asia region,” she asserted.
Therefore the ADB has focused its direction on increasing the efficiency of water use, water and climate, integrated water resources Management and in expanding wastewater management, she said.
South East Asia region will receive over US$ 1.8 billion for urban and water initiatives, Technical Advisor (Urban)Urban SG, Sector Advisory Service Centre Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department ADB Vijay Padmanabhan said. The ADB will be funding a new desalination water project in Jaffna to commence end of the year with an estimated funding of US$ 100 million, he added. He said they work with the National Water Board in Colombo and Jaffna and for the Pura Naguma with the Ministry of Provincial Council and local government. He also said because of the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) issue with a loan passed last year they were providing support in curbing CDK.
