SL gets US$ 1 bn eight-year loan from China Development Bank

Sri Lanka secured a billion dollar loan from China Development Bank (CDB) under the Foreign Currency Term Financing Facility (FCTFF) with a maturity period of eight years, the Central Bank said in a statement.
The interest cost is highly competitive and linked to 6 Month USD LIBOR with a grace period of three years. The repayment will be in equal semi-annual payments after the grace period. The resulting inflow increases the official foreign reserves by USD 1,000 million, the bank statement said.
It added, “The Government of Sri Lanka invited to submit proposals from international and domestic banks and investment houses for a Foreign Currency Term Financing Facility (FCTFF) denominated in United State Dollar (USD) or Japanese Yen (JPY) or Euro or of their combination up to a limit of USD 1,000 million in March 2018.
“Accordingly, four proposals were received from international and domestic banks and investment houses. Through a strict evaluation and negotiation process by a Cabinet appointed Steering Committee and Technical Evaluation Committee, the China Development Bank (CDB) was selected as the syndicate arranger based on least cost and longer maturity period given in its proposal submitted.”
