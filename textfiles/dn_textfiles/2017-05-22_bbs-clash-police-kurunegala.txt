BBS clash with Police in Kurunegala

A tensed situation erupted in Kurunegala on Saturday night when a Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) mob led by its Leader Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera tangled with the Police when the monk was to be arrested.
Ven. Ganasara thera hurled abuse at the Police and used obscene language at the Prime Minister also threatening to “take the people to streets to overthrow the Government”.
The incident took place around 10.30 pm at Thorayaya in Kurunegala. BBS Chief Executive Officer Dilantha Withanage said the BBS group led by Ven.Gnanasara thera was returning after a Dhamma sermon at Sulugal Viharaya in Ibbagamuwa.
The Police Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) had informed Ganasara thera on Friday that the Police needs to record a statement from him over a complaint. However, the monk had stated that he could not make it in the weekend as he has got “some arranged work to attend” and that he would come on Monday.
“After the sermon, our plan was to have tea at Kurunegala and proceed to Anuradhapuara as we had arranged a couple of meetings and a Pooja at Thuparamaya. As the Police blocked the road we decided to turn back, but before we do that the Police blocked the other side of the road too” he said.
However, Withanage said the Police could not produce any document to support the arrest of the monk.
“There had been a lot of heated arguments” said Withanage adding that the officers from different Police stations and the STF were called in to the scene. “We were surrounded by over 200 policemen including several officers from the CCD. We had about 20 persons in our group and people who were in the roadside also thronged. Finally, the Police decided to recede” he narrated.
The BBS mob was heard shouting at the Police aggressively demanding to clear the road blocks also threatening to set the area on fire.
Withanage said Ganasara Thera prior to his Kurunegala visit met with the Chief Prelates in Kandy and informed them on the move to arrest him.
