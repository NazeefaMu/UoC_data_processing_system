Why Do Dogs Eat Grass?

Why do dogs eat grass? What does it mean? Is it healthy? Should you be worried? How much is too much? These are only a few of the questions that often concern many dog owners.
Even though you may be worried as a dog owner, the main thing to understand is eating grass is very common among dogs. Actually, dogs tend to eat and chew on a lot of things that do not classify as edible. It may be for playful reasons, especially among puppies.
There are several other explanations to this behavior. The following three explanations elaborate some of the most common reasons why dogs eat grass. This will allow you to have insight on whether you should let it be or take precautions.
Reason #1 –
They want to find new entertaining activities
Dogs as creatures are very playful and energetic. They try to find alternative ways to fill up their time, and they will do it by interacting with their surroundings. This may include eating grass. You can always start to track how much exercise your dog is getting so that you can get an idea of what could be changed.
Reason #2 –
Stomach issues
This is the most widespread belief and probably the one that worries you most. Nevertheless, before reaching any final conclusions, keep in mind that it might not even be that serious. As it was mentioned before, it is normal for dogs to vomit 1 to 2 times a year, just like for humans! It is believed that dogs turn to grass as a self-medication technique.
However, you must understand that grass-eating does not necessarily correlate with vomiting. Actually, it is quite rare! Only around a quarter of dogs vomit from the grass they eat. This means that in the majority of the cases, grass eating does not have any effect in the dogs’ digestive system. So do not expect that your dog will vomit automatically after eating grass.
If eventually vomiting happens and, you notice that it happens frequently, then the dog may have a more serious disease. Two of the most common ones could be gastric reflux or inflammatory bowel disease.
Gastric Reflux is a disease that can be potentially dangerous for your pet, if not treated in time. One of the causes may be unknown (usually inedible) objects that go into a dog’s stomach.
Therefore, it is essential for you to monitor what your dog eats. If you suspect that this is what is happening, make sure to check out for symptoms like bad breath, burping, occasional vomiting or too much salivation.
Inflammatory bowel disease is another disease that causes discomfort to your dog. It is usually manifested with vomiting and diarrhea. This disease affects most organs and makes the dog’s immunity weaker. Some of the most common causes are traveling and recent vaccination but, there may be other causes as well.
The symptoms you should look out for are loss of appetite, diarrhea and weight loss. If you notice that your dog is expressing similar behavior to the above-mentioned symptoms, you must consider taking action immediately.
Reason #3 –
Nutritional needs
Sometimes your dog might turn to eating grass when it is lacking nutrients, especially fiber. If your dog is not showing symptoms of a disease as mentioned above, the issue might be the food it consumes. Another reason could be the taste of grass which for some dogs may be interesting and simply tasty.
Overall, grass-eating should not be a concern for you as an owner unless it is followed by other symptoms as well.
