War heroes will not be sent to gallows: Wijeyadasa

Foreign parties have no right to demand that our war heroes be sent to the gallows. If they do so, we too will have to probe the crimes committed by colonial rulers including the damage to properties and the killing of our national heroes Ven. Kudapole thera, Weera Puran Appu, and Gongalegoda Banda among others during the time of British governors such as Brownrigg, Buddhasasana and Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
He was addressing a meeting at Embilipitya to mark the opening of a new two-storey building at the Embilipitiya Courts Complex recently.
“People dying during wars in any country is a natural phenomenon. Damages to properties are the same. Today western countries have the audacity to speak about human rights in Sri Lanka when our own people have no qualms about this issue.
We in Sri Lanka do not manipulate our own courts system to their tune. We would explicitly reiterate that we do not need any foreign judges to matters concerning our country when we have our own team of competent panel of judges to do so,” the minister said.
Wijeyadasa said Sri Lanka would never legalise homosexualism as it was against the tenets of Buddhism and Buddhist culture. Dr. Rajapakshe who also hinted that the government would introduce a new constitution emphasised that it would never harm the status of Buddhism.
Judges of the Embilipitiya High Court, District Court, and Magistrate’s Court, and the Embilipitiya bar members were present.
