Kangaroo Courts, still a menace

‘Kangaroo Courts’ is a much talked about hot topic almost everywhere around the globe. It seems an alarming threat to the concept of Good Governance which is gaining ground in our soil. First of all, in order to go ahead with the good governance policy, it is discernible to me that the kangaroo courts have to be done away with from our paradise isle, there is no time like the present, for the smooth functioning of law and order for the betterment of the general public.
Since we gained independence from our colonial masters, for known and unknown reasons, kangaroo courts have been in existence and as a repercussion, most of the people who were severely battered by its adverse effects started a dialogue that the colonial masters had given top priority to law and justice prevailed in its supreme position. At this juncture in which it seems that law and order are regaining its pristine glory, little by little yet in a subtle manner, a discussion on Kangaroo Courts seems timely. After all, helping the innocent plays supreme in law.
It is a good omen that even our former chief justice is also appearing on the judicial landscape more and more frequently enlightening us on miscellaneous grounds of jurisprudence to further enlighten us on miscarriages of law pertaining to the welfare of the general public. It is high time to harness the vast wealth of experience of the legal luminary to upkeep the law which has shown its flaws and loopholes from time to time. The smooth functioning of the law of a country could assure a sound sleep to the public.
The very recent dismissal of a schoolgirl from school on the premise of possible pregnancy is definitely an eye-opener. Without accessing the relevant authorities regarding the matter, the principal and the disciplinary masters seem to have jumped into a hasty decision to dismiss the student from the school. That is where sociology of education matters. Sociological and psychological aspects of education are of paramount importance.
School system
The heads of schools and the senior teachers ought to be given a thorough understanding of the gravity of such matters. Crucial decisions shouldn’t be taken according to the whims and fancies of a few. The dignity of the growing child should be taken into consideration. A student of a leading school committed suicide by shooting himself with his father’s firearm the other day. Kangaroo courts at home and schools seem to contribute negatively to the school system. The situation should be arrested without further delay. If these negative developments are allowed to take their own paths, the repercussions on the society would be calamitous.
In most of the schools, the punishments seem to be meted out without following the correct procedures. Once in a way, a few cases come into limelight because of the vigilant media. Some cases are swept under the carpet or go unnoticed. In my over four-decade teaching career, here and abroad I have witnessed many a kangaroo court in the school system.
Not only in the school system, but also in the public and private sector, kangaroo courts are rampant. Even in good old days of yore, our village headmen and other high ranking officers had had kangaroo courts. During the times of insurgencies, they had been in existence. The subject deserves to be explored even for a law degree of specialization.
The status quo related to the procedures of jurisprudence compelled me to make a further access to the concept of the Kangaroo Courts. Wikipedia came to my rescue and I would like to write a few more words in this regard as we are passing through a very remarkable period of jurisdiction in the annals of our legal history.
Legitimate judicial authority
Kangaroo is the national emblem of Australia, yet the origin of the concept could be traced back to America. In the broader sense, it is a judicial tribunal or assembly that ignores recognized standards or justice and often carries little or no official standing in the territory within which it resides.
The term may also apply to a court held by a legitimate judicial authority who intentionally disregards the court’s legal or ethical obligations.
This is where the general public should keep watching whether the judgments are given with ethical authenticity. In this vein helping a known party with the vested judicial authority is undone.
The most published causes of kangaroo courts are the judicial bias of the decision maker. They could give the image of a fair trial, yet time and age prove that such actions are of kangaroo origin.
The trials of POL POT are often talked about as the verdicts had been taken before the trials began. In an inferior form of adjudication, a kangaroo court could be developed. In this sense, the smooth functioning of the rule of law is imperative to a growing nation such as our country.
One shot players could ruin the whole legal system. The court shouldn’t be in someone’s pocket, like in the kangaroo pouch. If, in an inquiry, the evidence is intentionally ignored, a kangaroo jump is evident.
In kangaroo courts, fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
