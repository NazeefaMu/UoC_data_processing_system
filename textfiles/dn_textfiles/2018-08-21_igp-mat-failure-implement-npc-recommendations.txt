IGP on the mat for failure to implement NPC recommendations

The National Police Commission (NPC) has called for an explanation from the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara over his failure to implement the recommendations of the NPC.
The NPC has submitted a letter to the IGP following its meeting held last Thursday (16).
Accordingly, the IGP has been asked to show cause on six points in which he has failed to implement the NPC recommendations, including failure to implement promotions.
The NPC recommendations relate to initiating the Acting DIG post given to the Killinochchi Division SP Palitha Siriwardena, political vengeance, non-implementation of the promotions list, failure to remove the Narammala OIC, interdiction of the OIC of the Police Statistics Division etc, according to a senior police source.
Therefore, the Commission has informed the IGP to tender a written explanation as to why he failed to implement the NPC recommendations.
