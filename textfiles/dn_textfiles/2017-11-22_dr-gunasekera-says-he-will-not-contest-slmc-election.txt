Dr. Gunasekera says he will not contest SLMC election

Public Relations Officer of the Health Minister Dr. Upul Gunasekara says he will not contest the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) election.
He said he did not hand over nominations since he has no intention to contest the SLMC election.The media report published on the issue is completely inaccurate, he said. During a press conference held at the Government Medical Officers’ Association Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said the SLMC vacancy of Dr. Gunasekara would exist from November 22.
The GMOA had sent a letter to the President pointing out the importance of holding the SLMC election after enacting all required rules and regulations.
The legitimacy of members elected through a questionable election will be legally challenged, the GMOA informed the President.
