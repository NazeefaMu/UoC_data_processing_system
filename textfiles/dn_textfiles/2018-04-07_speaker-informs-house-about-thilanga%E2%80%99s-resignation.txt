Speaker informs House about Thilanga’s resignation

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday informed Parliament that Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala had tendered his resignation to President Maithripala Sirisena about a month ago.
He told the House that Sumathipala, who met him nearly a month ago, informed him that he wished to refrain from involving in duties attached to the Deputy Speaker post as he wants to actively take part in political activities.
“He told me that he would not be assuming the Chair because it was not proper for him to engage in active politics and simultaneously work in the Deputy Speaker’s post. It was his voluntary decision and I respect him for doing so,” he said.
The Speaker made this observation when MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena questioned as to why Deputy Speaker Sumathipala does not preside the House when the Speaker leaves the Chamber.
“We did not see him coming to the Chair this whole week. It is a serious problem, if you are denying him of that opportunity,” he stated. Following the reply of the Speaker, MP Gunawardena said if there is such a resignation letter, the Speaker must read it aloud in Parliament.
The Speaker said Sumathipala had only sent the letter to the President and not to him.
