Yal Devi collides with two lorries

The Yal Devi Express met with an accident with two lorries at the Hunupitiya railway crossing in Wattala, causing major delays on the Colombo-Kandy main line, yesterday.
The drivers of the two lorries had managed to escape unhurt.
The accident which occurred at 6.05 am had occurred when a dilapidated vehicle traveling in front of these two lorries had broke down in front of them. Thereafter, a van transporting schoolchildren had, against traffic rules, overtaken the lorries to bypass the broken down vehicle. This has caused the lorries to get stuck on the crossing.
A rail guard had been present at the crossing, but according to witnesses, he was busy on the telephone when the lorries got stuck on the crossing.
They added that he had not taken any steps to prevent the accident. Neighbours, the lorry drivers and witnesses state that if the guard had paid more attention, the accident could have been prevented.
The accident led to delays in the two railway lines at the crossing with the Yal Devi itself being delayed until 8.30, inconveniencing many office workers and schoolchildren.
The commuters, as well as area residents asked that the minister ban the use of telephones by rail guards while they're at work. The Kiribathgoda Police Motor traffic Unit is conducting further investigations into the accident.
