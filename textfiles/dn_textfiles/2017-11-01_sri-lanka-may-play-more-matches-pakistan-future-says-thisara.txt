Sri Lanka may play more matches in Pakistan in the future, says Thisara

There is a possibility of the Sri Lanka national team playing more matches in Pakistan in the futurewith the existing level of security, Sri Lanka T20 skipper Thisara Perera said on Tuesday after playing a match at the Gaddafi Stadium for the first time in nine years. The Sri Lanka team was attacked at the same venue (Lahore) in March 2009.
Only three experienced players, including Perera were in the T20 squad and Perera further said that the players were concerned about safety and were able to convince the other players regarding their security. “In nine years of my cricket experience this has been the first time that I have seen so much of security” Perera said.
“The security arrangements in Lahore were excellent and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) gave the assurance of maximum security and the players were highly satisfied with the arrangements” Ashley De Silva Chief Executive officer of Sri Lanka Cricket said. De Silva spoke on future tours as the junior squads are to be sent to Pakistan as soon as possible. “Our FTP (Future Tours Program) currently has not scheduled any tours for the National team in Pakistan, he said “but we intend to send the under 19 team and the “A” team in time to come.”
National Coach Nic Pothas said that the experience gained by the young players in the T20 matches will stand them in good stead in the future and may help them to gain places in the test and ODI squads.
