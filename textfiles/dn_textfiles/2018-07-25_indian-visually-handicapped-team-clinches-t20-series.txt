Sri Lanka end their record run in ODIs with 2-1 win
Indian visually handicapped team clinches T20 series

The Indian visually handicapped team romped home to victory by 10 wickets in the last game to win the five-match T20 series 4-1 against their Sri Lankan counterparts at the BRC grounds Havelock Park yesterday.
The Sri Lankans taking first lease of the wicket made a modest 189 runs helped by two fine knocks by Chandana Deshapriya 80 and Ajith Silva 64. In reply the Indian openers Ajay Kumar Reddy and Sunil Ramesh paid scant respect to the Lankan bowlers and knocked the required runs easily.
Sunil Ramesh scored 107 and skipper Ajay Kumar was unbeaten on 66. Indian skipper Ajay Kumar was named Man of the Match and Sunil Ramesh received the Man of the Series award. The awards were presented by Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.
“I was told that Sri Lanka had beaten India in the ODI series. It’s a huge achievement as far as the Sri Lankan team is concerned and I like to congratulate the winners,” said Ranatunga. “I hope these bilateral series will help both teams to improve and go from strength to strength.”
The unbeaten Indian team was unbeaten for a record six consecutive years and their winning ODI streak was ended by Sri Lanka when they won the first part of the bilateral series recording a memorable 2-1 win over the world.
