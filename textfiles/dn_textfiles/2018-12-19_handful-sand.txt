A handful of sand

Sand art means moulding the sand in different forms to make sand sculptures. The material used for sand sculptures is only sand and water. Among the different varieties of sand art forms, the sand sculptural art form is considered the most popular, and its history dates back to the prehistoric era of human civilization. It is said that Egyptians created some sand sculptures and later an Indian artist produced a sand sculpture in the 14th century, but it is regarded as one of the excellent art creations of the word.
Sand painting is also considered as another form of sand art. When compared to the sand sculptural art form, sand painting has not gained much popularity in the world.
Carving sculptures
The sand sculptural art form has gained more popularity among the masses all over the world. Presently, the sand sculpturing competitions are taking place all over the world. Actually, carving sculptures with the sand are felt like one of the most difficult carving art forms of the world. Yet it is said carving on sand is quite easier than carving on the solid crude variety of stones. For sand sculptures, only plain and clean sand is used with the correct quantity of water for moulding this attractive art form. Yet it is considered that the type and nature of the sand selected for carving and moulding play a vital role in this art form.
All types of sand are not suitable for sand art moulding. It is one of the most attractive creativity art forms which gained much popularity in the art world in the recent past. It is said that one can easily pick up the techniques of carving in the sand if one has a clear-cut idea about the art. As compared to other types of sculptures, this type of sculptures could be destroyed easily. The lasting nature of the sculptures is less as compared to stone, metal and wooden sculptures. Further, it is said that nowadays this art is promoted in certain countries at a national level for tourist attraction. In Puri India, this art originated and developed and later it spread to other parts of the country.
To create sculptures you need a huge amount of sand. As a result, it is practised in the coastal areas. It is said that sand artists did not earn much out of their creative art form, but today many of the top-level sand artists earn their livelihood during tourist seasons. They exhibit their sand sculptures in the open air. A huge landscape is needed to exhibit their exceptional skills.
Record-breaking achievements
Annual competitions are held all over the world at a national and international level. Some of the record-breaking achievements are noted and recorded in the Guinness World Records.
Most of the sand sculptural artists come from numerous other professional disciplines. Practically, sand sculptural artists do not treat this as a permanent profession. However, in recent times some countries have established beautiful sand sculptural museums. Such attempts might provide a permanent position to some of the creative artists. Even some of the universities have recognized the value of this art form in their visual art faculties.
The International Sand Sculptural Festival takes place annually since 2003 in Portugal. More than 60 artists participate in the festival and nearly 15,000 square metres are allocated for it. More or less 35,000 tons of sand is used for the art festival.
