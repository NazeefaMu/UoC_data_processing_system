Lankan school in Qatar supports flood-hit Welgama Primary

Being the only Sri Lankan school in Qatar, Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha (SSLSD) provides a helping hand to the Sri Lankans living in Qatar and back home. As part of its efforts, the school recently joined hands with the students and parents to support Welgama Primary School located in Mathugama, Kalutara.
Welgama Primary School was affected by the recent floods. SSLSD stepped up to provide funds for the rehabilitation of the school, which was declared re-established on June 28. This was announced by SSLSD Chairman Kumudu Fonseka.
There were several teachers, parents and students of the SSLSD family who joined the cause. On this occasion, the students of Welgama School were provided with school uniforms, shoes and books. SSLSD also donated several items such as computers, computer tables, printers, projectors and photo copiers for the school. Furthermore, SSLSD hopes to build a garden pond, herbal garden and equip the mini-science lab of Welgama Primary School. - Gulf Times
