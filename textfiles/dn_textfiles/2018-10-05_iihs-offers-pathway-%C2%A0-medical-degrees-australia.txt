IIHS offers pathway to  medical degrees in Australia

The Advanced Diploma in Biomedical Sciences offered by IIHS provides a pathway to a medical degree in Australia.
The structure of the program is very attractive where students study the first two years at IIHS to obtain an Advanced Diploma in Bio Medical Sciences and complete the final two years in Australia to complete a Bachelors in Bio Medical Sciences Degree at Deakin University, University of Canberra, Deakin University or University of New England, all located in Australia. Upon successful completion of this degree, students may enter a medical degree in Australia at a graduate entry level.
Biomedical Sciences programs are specifically designed for students who are interested in the Biological Sciences and its practical applications, particularly in the areas of health care and research. Biomedical Sciences programs typically develop transferable skills such as laboratory techniques, data analysis and interpersonal and teamwork skills.
The role of Biomedical Scientists include developing and improving medical treatments, vaccines, equipment and techniques involving healthcare and Biomedical Scientists are widely known for performing and analyzing an array of technical procedures to screen, maintain and improve human health. Registrations are now open for the 2018 intake at IIHS. The IIHS Campus is situated  in Welisara .
