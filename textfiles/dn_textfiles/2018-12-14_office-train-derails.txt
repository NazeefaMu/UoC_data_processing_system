Office train derails

Passengers along the Main Line were inconvenienced yesterday morning when a Colombo-bound office train from Mirigama detached and derailed near the Maradana railway station, where many crossing points are located.
The accident took place around 8 am and it disrupted the other trains to and from Maradana too. Passengers had to walk towards Maradana railway station from Dematagoda. The engine of the power-set train had detached from the compartments and derailed, damaging the sleepers. No passenger was injured, it was reported.
Passengers who were inconvenienced by the incident claimed that they face difficulties in reaching their workplaces on time due to these kinds of accidents.
The aged, children, women and pregnant mothers were inconvenienced as they had to walk from one station to another, they said.
Passengers requested the railway authorities to look into these matters and rectify shortcomings to prevent such incidents in the future.
However, the Chief Train Controller responded to the claim saying that delays can occur when a line is blocked, especially at a place where a number of crossing points are located.
“This is not something done purposely, but we do at our best to run trains on time,” he said. A number of compartment detachments, especially involving office trains, were reported on the Main Line and the Kelani Valley Line recently. The Colombo-bound Yaldevi express train from Jaffna also detached last week, while it was running at a considerable speed between Irattai Periyakulam and Vavuniya.
