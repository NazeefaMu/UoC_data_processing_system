DIMO delivers Mercedes-Benz Actros 6x4 Prime Movers

Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO) recently delivered a fleet of Mercedes-Benz Actrostrucks to Melwire Rolling (Pvt) Ltd to help with their most critical operations.
The first three of a total of five trucks were delivered to P. Muruganandhan, Director of Melwire Rolling (Pvt) Ltd by Ranjith Pandithage (Chairman and Managing Director of DIMO). All units are 6x4 Prime Mover Semitrailer Tractors, used extensively in steel haulage. Incidentally, this was the first fleet of Actros Trucks to be sold in South Asia using Daimler Financing.
Rajeev Pandithage (General Manager – Mercedes-Benz Sales), Shamal Fernando (Business Unit Manager - Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicles), Titus Peries (Manager – Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicle Service) and Devendra Rajaratnam (Service Advisor for Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicles too were present at the handover.
In order to be able to offer a vehicle that is optimal for long-distance transport both today and in the future, and in view of the constantly increasing demands where comfort, economy, driving dynamics and variety are concerned, Mercedes-Benz decided to completely redevelop and rebuild the Actros. In order to make the new Actros a highly economical truck it has been equipped with many innovative and consumption-reducing features, and with particularly frugal engines. The overall economy of a truck is determined by many factors. Some cannot be influenced. But others can: thus, for example, alongside the innovative, cost-reducing vehicle technology deployed, services which are perfectly aligned to the new Actros also ensure that you can positively influence cost factors such as consumption and repairs and maintenance as well. Giving an even more holistic profitable solution.
With a fleet of powerhouses ranging from small-scale tractors to large-scale haulers, the Actros has also come to symbolise the fusion of intelligent design and unhindered performance, extending from the smallest to the most ambitious operations involving construction, haulage and transport. The Mercedes-Benz Actros boasts of a capacity of 33 tons, along with a 12,000 cubic centimetre, 313 horsepower engine. Operating at 1,530 torque-power at a low speed of 1080 RPM, the engine is heavily effective in saving fuel and maintaining smooth and steady power with minimum effort. Moreover, the Mercedes-Benz Actros engine is an Euro 2 engine, which offers a high fuel efficiency and low maintenance intervals of 25,000 km between services - the perfect semitrailer for some of the world’s most critical haulage operations.
