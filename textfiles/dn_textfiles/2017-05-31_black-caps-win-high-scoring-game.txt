Black Caps win high scoring game

BIRMINGHAM, Tuesday: Upul Tharanga’s 104-ball century and Sri Lanka’s challenging total of 356-8 proved insufficient to stop New Zealand from posting a thumping six wickets win with 23 balls to spare in the Champions trophy one-day warm-up match played at Edgbaston on Tuesday.
Sri Lanka’s invited to bat first rode on Tharanga’s 110 that comprised 13 fours and 3 sixes and was supported by half centuries from Kusal Mendis (57) and Dinesh Chandimal (55).
However with Sri Lanka resting skipper Angelo Mathews and their star bowler Lasith Malinga, the Black Caps made hay while the sun shone taking the bowlers to the cleaners. They maintained a healthy run rate of 7 ½ runs an over to coast home comfortably.
Martin Guptill led the Black Caps run chase with a stunning innings of 116 off 76 balls before retiring out having slammed 10 fours and 5 sixes. Equally harsh on the Lankan bowlers was New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson who cracked 88 off 60 balls (7 fours, 4 sixes) before he too retired out.
New Zealand who cantered along at jet set pace eventually won with plenty to spare finishing on 359-4.
It was the final warm-up game for both teams before the tournament commences on June 1.
