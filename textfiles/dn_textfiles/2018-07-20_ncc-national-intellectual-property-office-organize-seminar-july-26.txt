NCC, National Intellectual Property Office organize seminar on July 26

Sri Lanka is expected to obtain Madrid Protocol accession- the international trademark application filing system by end of this year, which will allow the country’s brands to register their trademarks in a single filing, getting activated across many countries at the same time, affording Trade Mark protection for Sri Lankan brands at a global level.
The National Chamber of Commerce (NCC) in collaboration with the National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka is organizing an awareness seminar on July 26, 2018 from 2.00 to 4.00 p.m at the Chamber Auditorium 450 D R Wijewardene Mw, Colombo – 10.
The key speaker a legal consultant retained by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Jatin Trivedi , Attorney and Advocate from India will be in Sri Lanka to provide assistance to the Govt in the process of accession to Madrid Protocol.
Trivedi will explain in detail at this seminar, with regard to filing trade mark applications through the Madrid system, advantages and other aspects involved. He will be accompanied by Piyush Khatri of Rajasthan Bar Council a legal practitioner for 14 years in IPR and Tax Laws, in India; and Geethanjali R. Ranawaka, Director General NIPO will attend.
The Madrid Protocol system provides for the international registration of trade marks by way of one application that can cover more than one country.
The opportunity of having a single registration to cover a wide range of countries gives advantages, both in terms of portfolio management and cost savings, as opposed to a portfolio of independent national registrations. Madrid provides a mechanism for obtaining trademark protection in many countries around the world.
The Madrid system is administered by the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva, Switzerland. There are 101 countries as contracting parties of the Madrid System.
