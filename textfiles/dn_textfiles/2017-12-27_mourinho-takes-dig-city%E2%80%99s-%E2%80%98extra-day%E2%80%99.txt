Mourinho takes dig at City’s ‘extra day’

London: Jose Mourinho aimed a Christmas Day dig at Manchester City, claiming the runaway Premier League leaders have been handed an unfair advantage by playing their next match more than a day later than his United team.
United welcome Burnley to Old Trafford on Tuesday but City, who have a huge 13-point lead over their city rivals, won’t play again until Wednesday night when they travel to Newcastle.
Last Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Leicester was the first of four top-flight games in 10 days for United.
