Midwives need motorcycles - Rajitha

Around 1,500 midwives (family health workers) serving in the country need motorcycles and arrangements will be made soon to provide them motorcycles, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, approval has already been given to change the official uniform of the midwives, considering the fact that they travel by riding motorcycles. “I like the current uniform but it is difficult for them to work wearing it”, said Minister Senaratne while addressing the gathering during an awareness raising programme held for the midwives of Kalutara district.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that he ordered health officials to formulate a report on the requirement of the motorcycles for the midwives. “Sometimes the decisions made by the Health Ministry get delayed or do not get implemented at all. Therefore, it is the duty of the health trade unions to monitor the progress on the implementation of such decisions”, the Minister said.
“It is midwives who pushed Sri Lanka’s health indicators up. I do not know whether health officials understand the standard of Sri Lanka’s health service. But the world health authorities such as WHO recognize Sri Lanka’s health service as one of the best in the world and a role model”, he added.
