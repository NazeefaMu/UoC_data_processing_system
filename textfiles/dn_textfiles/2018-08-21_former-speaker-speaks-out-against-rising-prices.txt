Former Speaker speaks out against rising prices

Former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa said the people find it impossible to keep their home fires burning and live under trying circumstances due to the skyrocketing prices of consumer items.
He was addressing a gathering of SLFPers at Medamulana in Weeraketiya, recently.
He said the price of pepper and cinnamon had come down to a minimum. Therefore, pepper and cinnamon cultivators are left high and dry. “The workplaces that were busy during the previous regime have closed down. The people previously earned their daily bread by engaging in mega development projects. Yet, there is no such thing to engage in now,” he said. The former Speaker added that they still remember how the 1986 Mulkirigala election was held. “Then the ballot boxes were filled with fake votes. Some ballot boxes were set on fire. That was how the Mulkirigala electorate was won by the UNP.”
He said the people now urge for an election to topple this government.
He added that in 1956, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike left the UNP. Thereafter, D. A. Rajapaksa became the Member of Parliament for the Beliatta electorate in 1952. “The previous government was committed to protect and safeguard the country’s unity, territorial integrity, and sovereignty.
“Yet, present-day rulers are giving away the wealth and resources of the country to foreigners,” he said.
