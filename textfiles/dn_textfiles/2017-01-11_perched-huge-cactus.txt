Perched on a huge cactus

Before the arrival of Spanish conquistadors to the regions of Mesoamerica the indigenous civilizations of Olmec, the Mayas and the Aztecs made Empires of different identities. Mesoamerica expanded covering a vast area from the Central Mexico to Belize, Gautamala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Northern Costa Rica.
Mesoamerica was a region of contrasting landscapes and rich in diversity of topographical features such as snowcapped volcanoes , swamps and lowland jungles. Well-irrigated Valley of Mexico covering an area of 800,000 hectares ( two million acres) is in the Southern part of Mexico.
Tenochtitlan believed as the founder of Aztecs was known by Nahuatl, Aztecs, Mexica, and Tenochcas - the mysterious Island City of Cranes. According to the chronicler Hernando Alvarado de Tezozomoc this tribe of Mesoamerica was known as Aztecs because of their place of origin the mysterious island city of Axtlan having the meaning of ‘White Land or the ‘Land of Cranes.’
Under the guidance of the Huitzilopochtli the Tribal God of Aztecs, they ventured on a hazardous migration across the northern landscapes before they embarked on the location destined to found their capital.
Another version of mythology based on the founding of the location of the Aztecs capital was the vision of an eagle perched on a huge cactus eating a writhing serpent on lake Texcoco. The name Mexica was given on the wandering tribes by their Patron God- Huitzilopochtli. Just like all the religious beliefs of rest of the other tribes found scattered in the various regions of Mesoamerica there were similar traits even in the belief systems and cult practices of Aztecs. According to research scholars on Aztec Civilization , there were almost 200 Gods and Goddesses in charge of supervising different aspects of the Universe.
Huitzilopochtli was the Patron God of Aztecs. It was he who gave instructions to the wandering Aztecs where to establish the Capital City of their Civilization.
Tlaloc was the God in charge of rain and also considered as one of the most ancient gods in Mesoamerica. Tlaloc was associated agricultural fertility and this Fertility God’s origin could be traced back to the Olmec and Maya Civilizations. Human sacrifice and feasting on the flesh of the victim were well known religious traditions across the civilizations in Mesoamerica including the Aztec civilization. Sacrificial human victim’s breast was cut open and the heart was removed during Aztec religious festivities.
Blue band had been used to decorate Tlaloc’s shrine symbolically indicating rain and water. During the cult ceremonies conducted in honour of God Tlaloc, new-born children had been sacrificed because the Aztecs believed that the tears could satisfy Tlaloc.
Tonatiuh was the Sun God of the Aztecs responsible in providing warmth and fertility to the human beings. The Aztecs believed that the god was in need of sacrificial blood of the human beings in order to provide warmth and fertility.
Tlalaltlecuhtli was Aztec’s Earth Goddess and in order to propitiate this monstrous Aztec Goddess several human sacrifices had to be made. Xipe Totec was the Aztec God of Agriculture and Fertility. A human skin was worn by him symbolizing the death of the old and growth of vegetation. Quetzalcoatl was the most famous Aztec god venerated by numerous tribes belonged to many civilizations across Mesoamerica.
In 1428, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan formed an alliance and Aztec Empire became a confederation. Referring to appearance of the comet, Friar Bernardino de Sahagun, the Author of ‘General History of the Things of New Spain’ had mentioned, that the comet thrust into the sky just having the appearance of a flame and had spilled a rain of fiery drops as it had broken the canopy of the heavens. The shamen, nor the astronomers could interpret this omen.
The ruler of Texcocan, Netzahualpilli renown in the prediction of future events, said the destruction of the Aztec empire. Long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in Mexico, in 1519, there were rumors spreading about the European visitors.
In the year 1492, the Spanish conquistadors landed in the West Indies and left their marks in Hispaniola, Cuba, Venezuela, and Panama. Seeing large Spanish ships, in 1518, a labourer came to the Imperial Court that he had seen mountains floating in the sea.
The last Aztec leader Moctezuma 11, discovered that men having long beards and fair skin had arrived in floating mountains. Cortes was hesitant whether to treat the strange visitors as Gods or the invaders. According to the tradition of the Aztecs, Moctezuma sent tokens of friendship comprised of large discs of gold and silver representing the Sun and the Moon , ritual costumes and some food ceremonially blended with human blood obtained from a sacrificial victim.
The Spanish Conquistador Hernan Cortes refused to accept the gifts sent to him.
After realizing the mission of Cortes that he had arrived as an invader, Moctezuma obtained the services of the sorcerers to cast spells preventing the movements of Hernan Cortes and his band of the Spanish conquistadors.
Hernan Cortes was not affected by the spells of the sorcerers and the Spanish invaders led by Cortes proceeded towards the imperial capital. Moctezuma conspired to kill the Spaniards but it was revealed in advance. Moctezuma came on a palanquin to meet Cortes and greeted the Spaniards with great respect and gave a gift of a necklace of snail shells and shrimp fashioned in solid Gold and Cortes in return presented a string of Vanetian Glass beads. Moctezuma invited Hernan Cortes and his Spanish followers to the Capital City of Aztecs.
On the arrival of the Spaniards in Aztec Capital, they were kept in the palace of Axayacatl in close proximity to a Aztec Ritual Enclosure. Taken into consideration the previous attempt to kill them, the Spaniards imprisoned the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma.
As Hernan Cortes without consulting the governor of Cuba went beyond his mission of expedition a Spanish force was sent to arrest Cortes. Cortes could defeat them and requested the remaining Spanish warriors to return to Aztecs Capital under his command. The Spaniards attacked the Aztecs and Moctezuma was made to climb to the roof of the palace to calm down Aztec warriors.
After several wars between the Aztecs and the Spaniards, on 13th August, 1521 the Aztec Empire was completely captured by Hernan Cortes.
