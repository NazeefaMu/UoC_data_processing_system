Standard Chartered’s Group CFO Andy Halford visits Sri Lanka

Standard Chartered’s Group Chief Financial Officer, Andy Halford, is on an official visit to the island.
The Sri Lanka branch office is honoured to have the opportunity to showcase the franchise’s long local association to the bank’s top leadership. Last year the bank was delighted to host Group CEO Bill Winters in Sri Lanka.
Andy, the global bank’s second in command, will be meeting with the Minister of Finance, Ravi Karunanayake, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, industry and business leaders, as well as clients and staff, during the visit.
Jim McCabe, Chief Executive Officer, Standard Chartered Sri Lanka, commenting on the visit, said, “This is excellent news for the local franchise and for all the staff. Andy’s visit, following on from Bill Winters’ visit last year, is a clear indication of the Group’s esteem of the operation in Sri Lanka. We are truly honoured to host him and look forward to introducing Andy to our stakeholders.
Most recently Standard Chartered was the international lead sponsor of the Sri Lanka Investment Summit 2017 in Hong Kong and this is yet another example of how the bank is partnering business enterprise in the island. Standard Chartered is extremely proud of its history and association with Sri Lanka.”
