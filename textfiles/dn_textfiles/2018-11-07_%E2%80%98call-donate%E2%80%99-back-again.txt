‘Call to Donate’ is back again

Committed towards the protection and well being of the society, the nation’s insurance provider Sri Lanka Insurance launched the 3rd phase of “Call to Donate” a CSR initiative in aid of raising awareness about the cancer and donating funds to the Pediatric ward of Apeksha Cancer Hospital Maharagama.
The campaign was launched on November 1 and continues with enormous success urging Sri Lankans to join hands with SLIC by simply giving a missed call for this praise worthy cause.
For every missed call the caller makes SLIC will donate Rs.10/- to the Pediatric ward of Apeksha Cancer Hospital Maharagama.
Initiated in 2015 ‘Call to Donate’ is an annual initiative driven with the aspiration to create awareness of the increasing threat of cancer among people of Sri Lanka to give greater attention to this rising problem and to compassionate about those who are affected by this terminal illness.
Through the previous call to donate projects, SLIC was able to purchase a much needed C Pap Machine, Essential Medicines & Prosthesis Limbs for cancer survivors in 2015 and 2016.
Continuing the great cause, this year campaign intended to to build an isolation room for the Pediatric ward at Maharagama Apeksha Hospital. With all facilities required.
