Roaming among bookaholics

That mother was vigilant. She kept a sharp eye on the exhibitors, and took quick action. Did she not know that another party would naturally witness her tuck a CD in her child’s parcel? She not only tucked it in the parcel, but also kept that parcel in another bag.
Such incidents cannot be rare at any exhibition. So the Colombo International Book Fair (CIBF) would be no exception.
CIBF is the bookaholic’s Mecca – that is for sure. Metaphor aside, there is a lot of cons. These cons, sadly, have survived all the years the fair has been held. It looks like no one in the decision-making body is bothered on taking an action. Well, what can they do, when they have so many other things to be concerned about?
The scattered litter is now becoming a usual sight. But you do not need to get irritated. It is part and parcel of our culture. That ‘keep your city clean’ cannot be spoon-fed. Either you have to be fined as in Singapore or you have to be made aware of the consequences in an effective way. Whether either of this would actually work is still doubtful. The crowd is mostly into literature, and they are hardly bothered about litter around them. It is a tiring, yet interesting, excursion. Walking the hard terrains of BMICH looks actually tiring, when you set sights upon fellow pilgrims take a rest here and there on ubiquitous chairs and pavements.
The Book Fair is larger than life, when you see life more than books. Speaking of English books, most of the classics – apart from hackneyed everlasting Shakespeare – were missing. I heard one say publishers do this on purpose to create a market for the translations of English classics. Maybe not all publishers; I saw some publishers sell the original as well as the translation. For Sinhala readers, the book fair should be fair enough, but still most of the Sinhala classics were missing in the shelves. Old ones should leave shelves providing space for the new ones – should it?
On an average stall, you would never miss the sight of readers immersed in books before making the investment. These fast readers at times read the whole book within the stall premises and move on to another book to spare their precious investment. The exhibition crew is very much familiar with this crowd, though they can hardly do anything about it.
Computerized catalogue of the books are still a privilege for the stalls. You will have to browse the books, and even then you would hardly be able to tick off a single title in your list. But let me confess: exhibitors and their helpers are really helpful. If one publisher does not have a book on offer they would direct you to another. You would witness this quite often.
Food! Oh well, the prices are a little improved this time. Except for one or two so-called posh hotels which would never listen to customer pleas, most of the small-scale outlets had good food and drink at reasonable rates. That is why probably the food stalls did not shut down even when the Book Fair officially called it a day at 9 pm and curtains drawn over the book stalls. People still thronged to munch a popcorn, sip a coke and wolf down noodles.
Thank you, Book Publishers’ Association, for gearing up this overly impressive annual experience; on behalf of all book lovers and bibliophiles – though I am not either.
