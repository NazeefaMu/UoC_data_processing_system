Google Play and iOS apps demand surges in India and China

The two leading app stores both experienced a tilt towards Asia in 2016, according to an annual study.
India leapfrogged both the US and Brazil to become the nation that downloaded the most apps from Google’s Play Store, according to analytics firm App Annie.
It also claimed that China became the biggest source of revenue for Apple’s iOS App Store for the first time.
However, the BBC understands that Apple’s own figures contradict this.
They suggest China still lagged behind the US and Japan last year. The tech firm has, however, not commented on the 2016 Retrospective report. A spokeswoman for Google also declined to comment. Google and Apple both take a cut of software sales and in-app fees from third-parties that publish on their respective platforms.
Their differing successes are explained by the fact that Google Play does not operate in China, while iPhones have a much smaller share of the Indian market than they do in most other countries.
San Francisco-based App Annie’s research is widely used by app publishers and others involved in the digital industries.
“We are always confident with the data we release in our reports, attributing the estimates to a veritable degree to accuracy,” a spokeswoman said.
In total, it said more than 90 billion apps were downloaded via the two stores over the year.
