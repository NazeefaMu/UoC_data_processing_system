Aeschliman new Mission Director for USAID in Sri Lanka and Maldives

Reed J. Aeschliman assumed his duties as the new Mission Director of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for Sri Lanka and Maldives on March 5, 2018.
Aeschliman's arrival corresponds with the start-up of several new initiatives and more than 4.5 billion Sri Lankan rupees in programs that advance youth employability, rule of law, and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. "We are fortunate to have Aeschliman join the U.S. Embassy team as we celebrate 70 years of partnership between the United States and Sri Lanka," said U.S. Ambassador Atul Keshap.
"The people of Sri Lanka and Maldives will benefit from his strong experience in managing USAID development assistance. He will also ensure that funds provided by the American taxpayer are spent wisely in support of our shared goals to see Sri Lanka become a reconciled, peaceful and prosperous democracy that contributes to regional security and upholds fundamental human rights and equality for all."
In Maldives, USAID has supported a wide range of initiatives since 2001, including safe and clean water for island residents, management of coastal resources, and strengthening the capacity of government institutions.
Since 1956, the United States Government has provided more than $2 billion (approximately 300 billion LKR) in development and humanitarian assistance that has benefited Sri Lankans across the country.
This assistance has made meaningful impact on inclusive economic growth, good governance reforms, and recovery from humanitarian crises. "I am honored to work in partnership with the Government and people of Sri Lanka and Maldives to be more effective with U.S. development assistance, expand the assistance to the people who need it the most, and strengthen partnerships and cooperation with the United States," said Aeschliman.
Aeschliman has worked at USAID since 2000 and has served in the Philippines and Pacific Islands, Afghanistan, Cambodia, and India, managing the design and implementation of a full range of economic, democratic governance, environment, education, and infrastructure programs. His most recent prior assignment was in Washington where he served as Deputy Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Asia.
