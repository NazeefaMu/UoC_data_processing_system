Simple trick for speedy sleep

Count sheep, have a hot bath and a glass of warm milk, douse yourself in lavender spray, cool down your room, wear socks to bed. The internet is full of advice on how to get to sleep faster - and how to improve the quality of that sleep.
But not all of these will be practical, or work for you in terms of getting to sleep. Maybe you hate milk and lavender makes you want to vomit. In which case, a new and dazzlingly simple trick may be worth a try. Make a list!
Not an Arya Stark-style kill list, but specifically a to-do list of all those tasks and jobs which you haven't yet got round to doing.
Dr Michael Scullin and his team at Baylor University in Texas studied 57 adults aged 19-30 and split them into two groups, which both slept over in a lab.
Each group was given a writing task. The first wrote about things they had already completed while the second wrote a list of tasks they needed to do.
What the researchers found was those in the second 'to-do list' group fell asleep a whole 16 minutes before the other group.
Writing in the journal Experimental Psychology - researchers said worrying about future tasks “is a significant contributor to difficulty in falling asleep." They added:
"The more specifically participants wrote their to-do list, the faster they subsequently fell asleep, whereas the opposite trend was observed when participants wrote about completed activities."
Worth a try?
