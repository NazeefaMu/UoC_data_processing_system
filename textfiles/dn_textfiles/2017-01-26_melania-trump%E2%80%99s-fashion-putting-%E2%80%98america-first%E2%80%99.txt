Melania Trump’s fashion putting ‘America first’

Melania Trump is adhering to a promise of her husband, President Trump, to keep “America first.”
Her entire inauguration wardrobe was designed and made in the United States.
Fashion critics, like Vanessa Friedman of the New York Times, praising Mrs. Trump’s “America first” wardrobe for her decision to wear only American designers during inauguration weekend. Like Ralph Lauren -- who created a pale blue ensemble for her to wear during Friday’s historic events.
The list of designers tasked with dressing the new first lady is as diverse as they are talented.
New York designer Norisol Ferrari, whose family is of Colombian and Venezuelan descent created a military style jacket for Mrs. Trump to wear during the wreath laying ceremony at Arlington cemetery Thursday.
Later that evening, she was donning a shimmery gold gown for dinner at union station by Lebanese-born, New York designer Reem Acra.
For the big finale, a chic white ball gown had everyone talking. The designer responsible, French-born Herve Pierre, who moved to the U.S. in the early 90s , previously serving as creative director of Carolina Herrera, worked with the first lady to create the stunning gown.
Pierre told ABC News exclusively that it was “an honour to dress the first lady of my new country!” and that collaborating with Mrs. Trump - who he describes as “so kind”, was “organic” and “easy because she knows about construction. She was very specific about the lines of the dress. It was an extraordinary project.”
