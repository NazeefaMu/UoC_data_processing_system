CB Governor defends top official

Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy responding to allegations made by former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake against Central Bank’s Senior Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe yesterday said that the former Minister has not produced any evidence to back up his unfounded allegations.
“As the Governor of the CBSL, I want to formally place on record that Dr. Weerasinghe is an outstanding economist who has made a stellar contribution to the work of the Bank during the two years I have spent in this position,” he said. The former Finance Minister has continuously criticised the country’s Central Bank and its top officials over its decisions.
