Sumathipala sweeps the board at SLC elections

 
Sri Lanka's World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga and his brother Nishantha Ranatunga suffered humiliating defeats at the Sri Lanka Cricket elections where former president Thilanga Sumathipala swept the board with all the candidates his team fielded being elected to their respective posts.
Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunga under whose captaincy Sri Lanka won the Cricket World Cup in 1996 was one of four who contested for the two posts of vice-president but the 80 votes he received was insufficient to guarantee him a place as two others from the rival camp Jayantha Dharmadasa (102 votes) and K Mathivanan (90 votes) were elected. A fourth contestant Asanga Seneviratne received 18 votes.
Former secretary Nishantha Ranatunga contesting the SLC presidency for the first time was easily defeated by Sumathipala by a majority of 32 votes. Ranatunga received 56 to Sumathipala's 88.
It was the fourth time that Deputy Speaker of Parliament Thilanga Sumathipala has been elected SLC president after 1998-99, 2000-01 and 2003-04.
The post of secretary went to Mohan de Silva, a former SLC president who was elected uncontested when rival candidate Hirantha Perera withdrew.
CCC president Shammi Silva received the highest number of votes at the election garnering 115 votes to defeat Easman Narangoda (28 votes) for the post of Treasurer.
Former Panadura SC fast bowler and assistant secretary Ravin Wickremaratne also received a thumping 113 votes to be elected assistant secretary. He beat former SSC and Sri Lanka fast bowler Nilantha Ratnayake who received 30 votes.
Lalith Rambukwella was elected assistant treasurer with 108 votes defeating Nihal Lewke who managed only 36 votes. Two other contestants for the post Aruna de Silva and Sujeewa Lokuhewa withdrew.
"It gives me great pleasure, honour, privilege and an enormous amount of satisfaction to be in front of you this morning as the duly elected president of Sri Lanka Cricket," said Sumathipala addressing a media conference soon after his victory.
"It has been a long journey for all of us to be together. I am glad that the entire committee whom we had proposed got duly elected and we are one big team going to give the leadership to transform Sri Lanka cricket to the next level."
Sumathipala said that the pattern of voting by the various levels of representation in the country allowed them to choose the people who are best to transform the country's cricket.
Sumathipala thanked President Maithripala Sirisena and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera for laying the foundation to hold a free and fair election in the spirit of the game and to the letter of the Sports Law and the SLC constitution. He also thanked the Director-General of Sports K.D.S. Ruwanchandra for conducting the elections in a 'professional and meaningful way'.
"In the past 10 years there has been time and again interim committees appointed to run cricket in the country. We need put an end to interim committees and have elected bodies running cricket. Even the ICC does not recognized interim committees. We must thank the Minister of Sport for preparing the ground work to hold this election," Sumathipala said.
Elaborating further Sumathipala said, "We have made our plans - a six pillar five-year business plan in place for international cricket. Our first priority is to transform our national team into a consistently winning side and sustenance at the top."
"We need to have a national coach and our priority is the national team. Everything else like development and domestic structures can wait but the national team cannot. We are already behind schedule and we have wasted a lot of time, energy and efforts."
Sumathipala said that they have already designated Jayantha Dharmadasa to be in charge of international cricket, K Mathivanan to handle domestic cricket and Mohan de Silva - administration.
He also revealed that SLC would like to change its constitution in keeping with the Sports Law of the country.
