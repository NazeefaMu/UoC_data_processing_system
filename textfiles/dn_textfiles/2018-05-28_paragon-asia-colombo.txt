Paragon Asia in Colombo

Paragon Group, a leading Professional Conference Organizer (PCO) and Association Management Company (AMC) has launched its new office in the Southern Asia region; Paragon Asia in Colombo.
This office will extend the services of the company locally, adding their expertise in the local language and culture. Following the existing offices in Latin America (Panama City), Africa (Cape Town) and Europe (Geneva and Tel Aviv), Paragon now broadens its reach in Asia as well. “We have identified as a growing need for high quality meetings in the region,” commented Eyal Halevy, Co-Managing Director of Paragon Group “the accessibility of the region, the demand for top level professional services, leads us to believe that Paragon Asia will soon become a leading PCO in Southern Asia, actively contributing to knowledge sharing among professionals.”
The Trip Square, based in Colombo, has been nominated to serve as the Paragon Asia office, through a set of criteria, where both parties can attest to each others quality of service and benefit from the extended network, knowledge and connections of one another.
