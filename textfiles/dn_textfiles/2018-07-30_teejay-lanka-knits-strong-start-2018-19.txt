Teejay Lanka knits strong start to 2018-19

Capacity expansion in India and an increased order book from the US and EU have enabled Teejay Lanka PLC, Sri Lanka’s only multinational textile manufacturer, to make a strong start to 2018-19 with healthy sales and profit growth.
Profit after tax grew by a respectable 27 per cent to Rs 279.3 million on revenue of Rs 6.8 billion, which was up 26 per cent, the company said in a filing with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
Based on this performance, Teejay Lanka has proposed a final dividend of 90 cents per share, reflecting the confident sentiments for the future of the Group. Elaborating on these results, Teejay Lanka PLC Chairman Bill Lam said securing the benefits of GSP through a carefully-managed European customer portfolio, and new product launches to US customers had contributed to the higher turnover.
