Sabaragamuwa forgoes roof gutters to control dengue

The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council has decided to refrain from using roof gutters in Government buildings to control the spread of dengue in the province.
The council has also decided not to permit the use of roof gutters in constructions by the private sector.
The Ratnapura district has been declared a high risk area after 917 dengue cases were reported from the district during the last three months. Health authorities said that this was an unprecedented increase as against the corresponding period of last year.
