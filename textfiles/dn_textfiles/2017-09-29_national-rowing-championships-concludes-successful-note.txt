Addressing the gathering, President of the Amateur Rowing Association of Sri Lanka Rohan Fernando noted,“What you saw at the finals is the crème de la crème of Sri Lanka rowing.
Some of the rowers just returned after taking part in Asian Rowing Championships in Thailand. 13 of them competed and some of our crews came to “A” finals which is a good standard after many moons.
Our crews are now capable of clocking 6.30 minutes over 2 kilometre course which is commendable when compared with international standards of 5.40 to 6.20 minutes over 2000 metres.
The timings change from venue to venue due to turbulence and wind resistance. I am confident that our crews can shave some seconds off to be considered for entry into world rankings before too long.”
