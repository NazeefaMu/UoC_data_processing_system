Two docs at war over some spilt gravy

Two doctors attached to the Galle-Karapitiya Teaching Hospital had reportedly been at loggerheads over an incident that took place at the hospital canteen over which both medical practitioners made complaints against each other to the Galle police.
A doctor at the Intensive Care Unit and another at the Dental Orthopedic Unit of the hospital have thus charged each other of triggering death threats over one another, Galle police said.
According to the Police complaint, while the doctor of the ICU was having meals at the canteen, some gravy had accidently spilled over his body as the doctor of the Dental Orthopaedic Unit left the dining table.
However, the two doctors had met again near the Hospital Director’s office where they had started a dispute over the same incident using abusive language against each other, the Police complaint revealed.
The Dental Orthopaedic doctor who alleged the other doctor was keeping a knife in his pocket had challenged him to stab him if he dared to do so to which the ICU doctor had threatened to kill his colleague, holding him by his shirt collar. Subsequently, the Dental Orthopaedic surgeon had taken a knife and a spray can out of his pocket and wielded the knife threatening to kill the other, the police complaint further states.
Meanwhile, Police investigations into the complaints reveal that both doctors had been students of the same school in Galle town and graduated from the same university.
Galle Police Miscellaneous Complaints Unit OIC Udaya Senavirathne has initiated investigations into the complaints.
