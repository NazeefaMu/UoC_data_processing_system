Liyanage hat-trick highlight of first day at RBCC World Final

The more established Asian cricket powers of Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan flexed their muscles to begin their Red Bull Campus Cricket World Final campaigns, each registering commanding victories over teams from UAE, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe respectively, on the first day of competition in Colombo. All three winning teams had star performers, but also saw vital cameos from all over their batting orders, while several part-time bowlers also delivered important overs.
With each team playing five round-robin matches in this year’s competition though, the losing teams from day one have plenty of time to regroup and hit back over the course of the week.
The morning was lit-up by a hat-trick from local boy and Business Management School (BMS) opening bowler Janith Liyanage, who claimed stunning figures of 4 for 6 as BMS dismissed UAE’s Herriot-Watt University for 91.
Liyanage had taken the first wicket of the tournament to set Herriot-Watt’s collapse in motion, before returning towards the end of the innings to wipe out the opposition’s tail. He bowled Ram Narayan and Prateek Hiranandani off successive deliveries at the end of the third over, before having No. 11 Ihtisham Sabir caught behind with the first ball of his next. Liyanage also had the honour of hitting his team’s winning runs, batting at No 5, after opener Madushan Ravichandrakumar hit a 25- ball 44 to set BMS racing towards the target.
While that match was going on at the NCC ground, middle-order batsman Umkar Khatpe was providing an MS Dhoni-esque finish to Marathwada Mitra Mandal College of Commerce’s (MMMC College) innings at the neighbouring SSC venue, against University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB).
The MMMC College team, who hail from Pune, had been winless in the 2017 World Final, but could not have made a stronger statement to kick off this year’s campaign, as they rode on Khatpe’s 30-ball 61 not out to an imposing 181 for 6, before their bowlers - led by Rohan Dhamle - stymied ULAB’s chase, and secured a 26-run victory.
Khatpe had come to the crease with MMMC College stuttering in the middle overs, at 61 for 3, but after initially batting unambitiously in order to get the measure of the pitch and the opposition attack, he unleashed in the last four overs, hitting seven fours and three sixes in all. The final over of the innings was especially fruitful for Khatpe, as he hit three fours and two sixes off the seam bowling of Shariful Islam, as MMMC College plundered 26 from that over.
The afternoon match at SSC was memorable for perhaps the best batting partnership of the day, as Karachi University’s opener Abdur Rahman and No. 3 batsman Arsalan Farzand put on 72 runs together, using up only 45 balls, against Zimbabwe’s National University of Science and Technology (NUST). That stand formed the backbone of Karachi’s 183 for 5, which was the highest total of the day, and set up a rollicking 92-run victory. The NUST side lost early wickets, and were unable to break free, as the Karachi bowlers delivered tight and incisive early spells. They found their chase derailed at 6 for 56 in the 12th over, and were eventually 91 all out.
Day two sees the team from Sri Lanka take on India in the morning game - a mouthwatering clash that could help establish who the early favourite for the title may be. Bangladesh also plays Zimbabwe and Pakistan take on the UAE.
