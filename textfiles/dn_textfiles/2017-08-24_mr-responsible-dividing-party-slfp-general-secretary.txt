MR responsible for dividing party: SLFP General Secretary

Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP) General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was responsible for dividing the SLFP.
Dissanayake was addressing an SLFP meeting in the Anuradhapura West electorate,
“A majority of the SLFP supporters voted Mahinda Rajapaksa so that he could become the President for the third time. But, he is the very reason for the SLFP to be divided at present,” Minister Dissanayake said.
The Minister also said he would like to remind of the times when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena sat together at the 64th anniversary of the SLFP which was held in Polonnaruwa two years ago. Minister Dissanayake also said that the SLFP will be celebrating its 66th anniversary on September 3.
“The Sri Lanka Freedom Party has contributed immensely to the country’s progress, including ending the prolonged terrorist war,” he said.
Minister Dissanayake also pointed out that President Maithripala Sirisena introduced a new political culture to the country by establishing a National Unity Government in 2015.
He also pointed out that President Maithripala Sirisena ran for the Presidency in 2015, for the greater good of the country. Dissanayake reminded that even then President Sirisena did not step down from the post of SLFP General Secretary, out of dedication to the SLFP.
“We would like to remind Mahinda Rajapaksa and his supporters,that it is you who are trying to tear this party apart. But, we do not want the SLFP to lose the upcoming election. I want all of us to stand together, united. I would like to forward this message to Mahinda Rajapaksa that he needs to stand by Maithripala Sirisena at the next 2020 election. Does Rajapaksa have a right to demand the SLFP supporters to come to him and leave another part of the party they support? Does it strengthen the SLFP?,” Minister Dissanayake questioned.
Minister Dissanayake also said the personal vengeance that Mahinda Rajapaksa allegedly holds against certain people should not jeopardise the SLFP.
