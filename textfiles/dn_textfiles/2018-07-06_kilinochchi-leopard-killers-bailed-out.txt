Kilinochchi leopard killers bailed out

The ten suspects who were arrested for being involved in the killing of a leopard in Kilinochchi were released on bail by the Kilinochchi Magistrate yesterday.
Ten suspects were arrested for killing a leopard in Kilinochchi and were remanded until July 5.
The arrests were made by the Police after viewing videos and pictures of the leopard killing which went viral on social media.
A group of villagers captured and killed a leopard after it had reportedly attacked and injured nearly10 people at Ambakulam, Kilinochchi on June 21.
