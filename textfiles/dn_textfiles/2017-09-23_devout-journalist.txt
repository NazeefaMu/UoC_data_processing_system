Devout journalist

Noel Robert Jolly Aaron:
At this sad moment of the passing away of Noel Robert Jolly Aaron, I have special reason to be sentimental about his departure.
I am the oldest surviving editorial staffer of Lake House, possessing a wealth of information and personal memories about journalism and journalists of this prestigious institution. My esteemed friend and colleague, who just passed away, was perhaps one of the last surviving members of dedicated journalists. He belonged to an exclusive tribe that held classical devotion to professional journalism as a personality medal.
Aaron was actively present in journalism when he was on the staff of Lake House at a number of levels. Through the hours, he sat at the desk. He was never moved by the hands of the clock. His agenda was set by the need to fulfill his professional duty, whatever the hour maybe.
I tend to think he had hardly any other life than what he had as a professional journalist at Lake House. I remember some people saying that even after his retirement at the end of a fruitful and complete tenure, he was in the habit of standing on the pavement gazing at Lake House. This is not a mere bit of odd information nor a rumour or an attempt to underline an eccentricity. His devotion called for that kind of unusual gesture.
At times, he appeared and sounded stubborn, but that is entirely because his loyalty to his professionalism called for such an attitude. Whatever the external manifestations and gestures were, he was a totally humane individual inside. He was only driven by his insistent urge to be perfectly professional. At times, he would walk the corridors of Lake House in something of a trance probably pondering on something he missed or he had to do. When everything is said and done, what has to be summed up is his classic devotion to the highest values of journalism, in or out of active service that never left his personality. It was a given and built-in. I am quite certain wherever he maybe, after his passage on Earth, he will invariably be preoccupied with what went on in his active life as a classic individual given totally to professional journalism.
