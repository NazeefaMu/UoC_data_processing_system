‘Embrace innovation’

Fostering a culture that nurtures innovation is important for the success of any organisation, Country General Manager for Palo Alto Networks Rohan Jayaweera said.
Jayaweera, sharing examples from various industries, his experience as an employee of Google and as an entrepreneur, said an invention is not an innovation unless it has commercial value.
He was delivering the keynote address at ‘Quality Quest 2018’, organised by the Quality Engineering team of Pearson Lanka at the BMICH last week. It was themed ‘Inspiring Quality through Innovation’. About 250 Pearson Lanka employees, undergraduates and academia from the Universities of Sri Jayewardenepura, Kelaniya, Colombo, Moratuwa, Jaffna and Rajarata and Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology, National Institute of Business Management and Informatics Institute of Technology participated.
Pearson Global Quality Engineering Vice President Teresa Jacobs said technologies such as Virtual Reality, Cryptocurrency, Blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT), are increasingly becoming a part of day-to-day experiences. She highlighted the changes within the quality engineering due to such technologies.
The event included a panel discussion, a performance by Pearson Lanka band, poster competitions, writing competitions for university students, quiz competitions and technical workshops.
Head of Quality Engineering Sanjeewa Senerath launched the Quality Quest Magazine, a publication featuring the latest developments in quality management practices.
