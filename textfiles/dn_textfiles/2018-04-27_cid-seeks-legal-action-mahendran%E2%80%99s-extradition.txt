CID seeks legal action on Mahendran’s extradition

The Attorney General’s Department yesterday informed Court that the CID is in the process of initiating necessary legal action to extradite former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara informed Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne that Interpol has already issued a Red Notice against Arjuna Mahendran in connection with the Central Bank Bond issue. Jayasundara detailed that the Red Notice issued by Interpol would be effective across 192 countries.
In order to institute extradition law against Arjuna Mahendran,the CID sought a Court order directing the registrar of Fort Magistrate’s Court that a certified copy of entire case record be provided to the CID.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till May 10 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English to the arrest former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran in connection with the Central Bank Bond issue.
The court had issued a warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, the first suspect in the case, since he failed to comply with the court orders.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by the defence were not sufficient enough to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Filing a ‘B’ report before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Defence Counsel Jeewantha Jayatilleke appeared for the suspects.
