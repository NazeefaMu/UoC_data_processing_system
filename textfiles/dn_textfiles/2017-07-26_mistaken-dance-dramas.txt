Mistaken dance  dramas

Dance dramas are not a part of classical dance forms. But multiple character dance dramas more or less belong to drama forms rather than that of the classical dance forms. Today there are numerous misconception about the dance dramas.
Dance drama developed and penetrated into classical Bharatha Natyam in the 20th century. From ancient times dance and drama were practised together. Earlier there was no proper distinction between the two. The Tamil classical dance is always considered as a divine art. There are some who believe that dance evolved out of the drama, while some others believe that drama had its origin in dance. Anyway, dance and drama emerged together to attract common people in the 20th century.
According to history, the relationship between the two is very close. Earlier dance and drama were known under one single art form.
New techniques
But in the course of the 17th century, there was a gradual separation of dance and drama.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, dance faced a setback while drama gained recognition and popularity. In the early 20th century, cinema with its new techniques acquired a preeminent position at the expense of drama which was pushed back to the verge of extinction.
This was the period when drama stars of the theatre blossomed into cinema stars and drama halls were transformed into cinema studios. After a brief period of oblivion dance then known as Sadir, blossomed into Bharatha Natyam.
After 1940, Bharatha Natya dance teachers and Bharatha Natya institutions choreographed dance drama for epics. The first dance drama was Kutrala Kuravachi presented by Srimathi Rukmani Devi of Kalashetra. Whatever it may be, it is more or less based on drama than dance.
It was followed by several others. After 1962 dance dramas were presented on several themes even on fiction works. In the last decade of the 20th century, tolerance drama emerged and featured in TV channels. This was a new innovation and acquired a unique position with the aid of lighting and sound techniques. This partakes more of cinema than stage dance drama.
Exquisite combination
Though dance drama has much in common with dance there are essential differences between the two. Bharatha Natyam, for instance, has a repertoire of its own. Bharatha Natyam with its exquisite combination of Adavus, Abhinaya, Bavas Rasas, eye movements, neck movements, and hand madras (gestures) is essentially an individual dance.
Bharatha Natyam is totally based on classical Carnatic music base while in dance drama the repertoire is set then and there based on the story of the dance drama portrays. And many of times most of the dance dramas are considered as a part and parcel of Bharatha Natyam or branch of Bharatha Natyam. Yet one act dance dramas are totally based on classical dance Bharatha Natyam and one act dance dramas are more or less based on Bharatha Natyam. Still, in one act dance dramas, the sole music is not at all always based on classical music. Many of times in one act dance dramas the sole music is in a mixed form. Especially the music is adopted along with classical, folk and fusion music.
Idiom and grammar
For dance drama, the music is not necessarily confined to the traditional Carnatic music. In dance dramas, a variety of musical instruments is used to enhance the effect and beauty of the scene.
But in Bharatha Natyam, the use of musical instruments are limited and strongly adhered to the tradition. However, for Bharatha Natyam the stage is set once and for all while in dance drama the stage has to be rearranged according to the scene portrayed.
Generally, in dance drama the costumes, the make-up and hair dressing are adapted to each character’s needs and necessity, while Bharatha Natyam uses only certain designed costumes and one distinctive makeup.
Dance drama is considered as Bharatha Natyam by laymen because dance drama are presented through the idiom and grammar of Bharatha Natyam.
