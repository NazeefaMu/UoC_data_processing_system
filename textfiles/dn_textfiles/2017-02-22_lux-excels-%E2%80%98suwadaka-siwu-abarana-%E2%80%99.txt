Lux excels with  ‘Suwadaka Siwu Abarana ’

As the excitement that surrounds Unilever’s iconic beauty brand Lux heightens as a result of their latest promotion ‘Lux Suwadaka Siwu Abarana’.
Lux consumers now have the opportunity of winning for themselves an exquisitely crafted piece of jewellery that can be worn as it is, or as a pendant, a pair of earings as well as a ring, and what’s more it contains a signature fragrance co-created by the winner as well, jewellery designer Harshini and lux’ master perfumers have added to the magic that is and always will be Lux .
“Creating the best Lux perfumes ever is a continuing journey of exploration and imagination because the Lux woman is not easily defined. To do her justice, you have to find the scent equivalent of her sassiness, her strength” says Inura Jayasuriya Brand Manager Lux.
As for this unique piece of jewellery, designing the jewellery that encases the rarest of perfumes in the world is a tall order. Like the perfumes it will hold, this item of jewellery is an expression of the amazing character of the Lux woman.
“We hope that with this piece of iconic history, this world’s first jewellery perfume bottle innovation, Lux can inspire that in 25 women. Ignite that moment when she feels she can stop looking elsewhere, and find the confidence she needs from within to be anything she wants to be “, said Jayasuriya.
