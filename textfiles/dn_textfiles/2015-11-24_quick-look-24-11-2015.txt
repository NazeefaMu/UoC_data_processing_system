Please help Sandeepa
Sandeepa Deneth Basnayake, 5, of Puwakwatte,Wewahamanduwa, Matara is suffering from a neuro problem which has retarded his growth. According his mother H. B. Nadeeka he is totally disabled from birth and gets epileptic fits regularly. Nadeeka says that the medication and nutritious food needed for the child costs a tidy sum which her family can ill afford with her husbands meagre salary as a driver.
She requests philanthropists and the public to send whatever financial contributions possible to help in the upkeep of the child. All contributions should be remitted to account number 75303492 at the Bank of Ceylon Super Grade branch. Her contact number is 0752289923.
