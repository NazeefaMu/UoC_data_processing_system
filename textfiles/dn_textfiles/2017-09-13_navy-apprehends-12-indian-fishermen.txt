Navy apprehends 12 Indian fishermen

The Sri Lankan Navy on Monday apprehended 12 Indian fishermen for poaching in Sri Lankan waters.
Naval personnel on-board Fast Attack Craft and SLNS Ranawickrama attached to the Northern Naval Command on routine patrol apprehended the fishermen along with two trawlers about two nautical miles North-east of the Kachchativu Island on Monday, the Navy Media Unit said.
The fishermen were brought to the naval base SLNS Uththara in Kankesanthurai and the trawlers and fishing gear were taken to SLNS Elara in Kareinagar. The fishermen were handed over to the Assistant Director of Fisheries in Jaffna for legal action, the Navy said.
