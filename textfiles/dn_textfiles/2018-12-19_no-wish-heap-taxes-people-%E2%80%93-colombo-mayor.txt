No wish to heap taxes on people – Colombo Mayor

The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) does not have any intention of increasing the revenue of the CMC by increasing the burden on the public, CMC Mayor Rosy Senanayake said.
The Mayor made this statement while delivering the Budget speech at the CMC yesterday.
The Budget for 2019 was presented by the Mayor seeking approval from members to spend Rs. 16,983,730,000 in developing the city, while forecasting a revenue estimate of Rs. 16,984,327,000.
According to the Mayor, one of the main challenges faced by the Council is the collection of rates in arrears. “We plan to lay down a mechanism to collect these arrears in a fair manner through compromise and negotiation,” she said.
The Mayor said the Budget for 2019 targets an additional revenue generation of Rs. 1,303 million compared to 2018, while the expenditure has also increased by a similar proportion.
She said the Budget 2019 should be a key driver to create a political and social environment of co-existence, irrespective of party politics, race, religion and caste, which will pave way for the environment to be developed and maintained so as to create a green environment.
“Though the Budget is a statutory requirement which shall be fulfilled under the Section 211 of the Municipal Council’s Ordinance, it is more appropriate to introduce it as the future vision and the management plan of the CMC for 2019,” she said.
She said the preparation of the Budget of the CMC is an exercise which is both of national and international importance since the development of Colombo city can be applied as a criterion for determining the development of the whole county, and it can be applied as an index through which favourable attitudes regarding Sri Lanka are showcased before the global community.
The Mayor said she plans to provide iPads for the members as a special computer app has been introduced for the purpose of obtaining documents and minutes relevant to the meetings of the Council.
According to the Mayor, Korea has agreed to finance the computerisation of the system of rates and taxes in the CMC utilising the information of the present GIS, for the furtherance of transparency.
It has become necessary to strengthen the five major categories of taxes including Assessment Tax, Stamp Duty, Trade Tax, Trade Licences and Entertainment Tax which represent the bulk of the annual revenue of the CMC.
