Sustainable  Consumption  Practices (SCP)

A business which manages its resources sustainably will last. A consumer who buys a product which is sustainable will ensure that our environment as well as our health is guaranteed. And a country which promotes sustainable production and industry will thrive for generations to come. But the question is how many of our businesses and products are truly sustainable and how do we make the switch?
For the average consumer walking into a supermarket, the shelves are filled with products labelled ‘organic’ or ‘sustainable’. But how do we know this for certain? How many of them are real? How many of them make a difference and how can you tell?
To solve this dilemma, the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment and SWITCH-Asia; a project funded by the European Union to, “support the Sri Lankan Government in selecting, adapting and implementing suitable economic and regulatory policy instruments to promote sustainable consumption policies, have come together to create an eco-labelling platform in Sri Lanka.
Sustainable Consumption Practices (SCP) is defined as a holistic approach to minimize the negative environmental impacts from consumption and production systems while promoting quality of life for all (UNEP,2011). Sitting in a packed conference room, the Ministry as well as SWITCH Asia recently brought together various stakeholders in government and private sector, to outline how this can be done.

Fake labels
Over the years we have become more environmentally conscious and as a result, companies have come up with various false environmental claims for their products, said National Expert SWITCH-Asia Sustainable Consumption & Production, National Policy Support Consumption, Dr. Lalith Senaweera.
This ploy employed by companies to sell their products is called ‘Green Washing’, he added.
But when done properly, eco labels are given to “products that pass ecofriendly criteria laid down by government, associations, standards bodies or certification bodies. The criteria utilize extensive research based on the product's life cycle impact on the environment. Hence such products are significantly less harmful to the environment than similar products”.
Products with eco labels allow consumers to use their purchasing power as a tool to protect the environment whilst also providing the manufacturer with the opportunity to develop his/her product and make it more sustainable.
Dr Senaweera pointed out that eco labelling with ISO Standards will ensure that the “consumer is only being given valid purchasing information, without any “greenwashing”. This applies whether the claim is made through a seal of approval type of system, or in a claim made by manufacturer”.
Sri Lanka has 18 active eco labels at present and they can be categorized unto two groups; system based (which has 10 labels) and product based (with eight labels).
Some examples of system based labels include: The Cleaner & Greener program which promotes the reporting and offsetting of emissions by companies, organizations, buildings, events and transportation fleets; Earth check and Green Globe Standard for travel and tourism, The Forest Stewardship Council, The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Naturland Association for Organic Agriculture, the Sustainable furnishing Council for home furnishing, Fairtrade, The GREENSL® labelling system of Green Building Council Sri Lanka (GBCSL) to ensure that construction related greener products and Energy Star for electrical appliances with better energy use. According to Dr Senaweera, the Export and Development Board (EDB) has also recently established a National Organic Control Unit which would function as the monitoring and controlling body in Sri Lanka for exports, imports, traders, processing and certification of organic products.
The Project 
At present however, apart from the EDB’s unit, there is no central body to regulate and issue eco labels in the country. Hence the SWITCH Asia project which will end in 2019 worked to ensure that: National Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) Policy and Organizational Set-up are strengthened; Sustainable Production (SP) Framework is strengthened and SCP Principles are applied in selected sectors; Sustainable Consumption (SC) Framework is strengthened and Sustainable Procurement Policy and Eco-labelling; Knowledge on SCP is enhanced and awareness is raised among public/private sectors and civil society; Information Management Data Base on selecting, adopting and implementing suitable economic and regulatory policy instruments to promote SCP is developed; Long-term Sustainability of consumption and production patterns are ensured.

At present they have completed the formulation of the draft national policy on SCP; standardization of the policy formulation process in Sri Lanka; decided to focus on introducing SCP to the three sub sectors of tea, rice and dairy and have conducted baseline surveys on it and a consumer survey on SCP.
Secretary to the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Anura Dissanayake added that they were also looking to introducing SCP concepts at the primary, secondary and tertiary education sectors in order to further normalize the concept among the general public. Further the government and SWITCH Asia are working on introducing sustainable public procurement into the government system, setting up an eco-labelling platform, creating an SCP knowledge database and e-learning platform, preparing a funding proposal for the 10,000 Green Villages programme and increasing awareness and capacity building on SCP.
The biggest project will be the setting up of the eco labelling platform by the end of 2018, said, Key Expert SWITCH-Asia Sustainable Consumption & Production, National Policy Support Consumption, Eng. Gamini Senanayake.
International Experience 
The project has also looked at best practices from abroad and International Expert on SCP, Sonal Parasnis making a presentation on the subject noted that most countries used Type I voluntary schemes to get manufacturers to switch to eco labelling. They also use third party verification practices for their labels to ensure credibility.
Having a government body monitor the whole process she said also helped give the program the necessary push and backing during the implementation phase. No country however has introduced SCP to the food industry, added Parasnis because it is difficult to conduct a life cycle analysis on food, “It is hard to complete the cycle with food as it is hard to track at the consumer end”, she said.
The Sri Lankan government however, has indicated that they are ready to take up the challenge in introducing SCP into the food sector.
Implementation
The SWITCH Asia team has recommended that Sri Lanka go with a fully accredited platform for “Type I multi-attribute label in line with the guiding principles of ISO 14024”, said Dr Senaweera.
Once the overall SCP Policy for Sri Lanka is adopted, the SWITCH Asia team has recommended the following framework be set up to implement, regulate and issue eco labels to manufactures in Sri Lanka.
This framework will be guided by the overall SCP policy that will be implemented by the Apex Body which is the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment (owner of the scheme). This will then direct the Execution Body; Sri Lanka Standards Institute (SLSI) to issue labels. The SLSI’s labels would be accredited by Sri Lanka Accreditation Board (SLAB) whilst the eco labels prior to issuing would be approved by Multi stakeholder Committee with stakeholders such as the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Industry Associations, Consumer Bodies, Sri Lanka Standards Institution, etc.
Further SLAB will work with other testing bodies in their accreditation process and the team recommended that the testing capability of testing laboratories namely ITI, SLSI, NERD and SLSEA be further improved to conduct life cycle analysis of products. A multifaceted technical committee has also been proposed so that they can choose the kind of products that need eco labelling and report them to SLSI.
This scheme shall be an internationally recognized scheme and hence should become a GEN member, said Dr Senaweera. The Global Ecolabelling Network (GEN) is an international non-profit association of third-party, environmental performance recognition, certification and labelling organisations. This, Dr Senaweera said would help get Sri Lanka’s eco label greater recognition. “Those countries will accept Sri Lanka’s eco label and Sri Lanka in turn will also accept those countries eco labels”, he said. Senanayake further added that the National Cleaner Production was going to introduce a pilot eco label to test the system out so that they can further learn and improve the system.
As the present SWITCH program ends, another SWITCH 2 program will come into effect, he said and added that this would allow the platform to be further strengthened and allow industries to be supported during the transition period.
Possible Issues
Aitken Spence PLC, Consultant for Social and Environmental Management, Ravi de Silva pointed out that these systems would help businesses cut down their own waste and introduce better management systems in their companies but awareness of such practices was not being highlighted through the current framework.
He further highlighted that labels were costly and certifiers expensive, thus it was important to have local certifiers who would dole out the same system.
De Silva asked that the government step in to provide concessions or tax breaks for companies trying to adopt eco labelling, “This should be state policy as it benefits all”, he said.
Greater consumer awareness he said would also help in making the labels more successful.
A representative from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research also pointed out that most laboratories were not accredited as it was voluntary and thus, this would affect the credibility of labelling scheme. She asked that legal provisions be brought in to ensure that laboratories testing the labels, have to be accredited. She also proposed that the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research also be included as an Apex body along with the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry so that they can ensure better implementation.
Dr Senaweera further noted that as most schemes around the world were voluntary and this too would be such, it was important to first convince industrialists of its importance when implementing it, “otherwise you have them lobbying against it and reversing policy”, he said.
Government Policy 
Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Director Environmental Planning and Economics, Deepal C. Siribaddana speaking on the initiative said, over the years several isolated and ad hoc green initiatives have been taken. But the Ministry of Environment at present was looking to create a network of all these green initiatives, from eco labelling green procurement and green awards so that there was a streamlined process for all, and each would benefit from the other.
“The Multi stakeholder Committee in this eco labelling framework is the most important initiative for us here”, he added. He further observed that eco labelling was not only important for exporters but also for imports coming into the country,
“Whether we give them concessions or not, exporters will go for it because it is their market. But we must think of imports too, this is for our own people, we must get the best goods into the country”, he said.
The Director asked that the labelling initiative also build from what we already have and submit a proper plan to cabinet, “This is an ongoing process and we have to go step by step. If we can get a proper system and way forward, we can calculate our funds accordingly it is not a big deal. We are looking at the big picture”. Siribaddana addressing the private sector said the government was prepared to meet the deficits in terms of any costs, during the initial phases of switching to more sustainable production methods.
The government in the long term will save in terms of health costs, he said.
“The President is our subject minister so we have the support from the highest level. This is not going to be compartmentalized, we are happy to work across sectors”, added Siribaddana touching on working with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research.
To start with the food sector however would be a challenge and Sri Lanka would be the first country to try, “But we are ready to take it up, we will try”, said Siribaddana.
