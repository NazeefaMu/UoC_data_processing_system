Former DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara further remanded until 14th May

 
Former Deputy Inspector General of Police Prasanna Nanayakkara was further remanded today until May 14 on charges related to the murder of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge.
Nanayakkara was first arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) in February on allegations that he destroyed and concealed evidence relating to the 2009 murder.
In April of this year, Nanayakkara and former Mount Lavinia Police Crimes OIC Tissa Sugathapala, also arrested in connection, were both denied bail.
The CID investigation alleges, among other things, that Nanayakkara had pressured Sugathapala not to further investigate the murder of Wickrematunge when it occurred.
