Media should adjust to development: Karu Paranavithana

As the country is moving forward on economic, social, religious and spiritual development, the media should follow suit, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunarathna Paranavithana said yesterday.
He was addressing the Certificates Awarding Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Media Training Institute at the Government Information Department yesterday.
“We have to create a situation where we can say to the world that we have professional media personnel and industry in Sri Lanka,” he said.
“Sri Lanka needs professional journalists. They need to have knowledge, practical training to become a professional journalist, adherence to media ethics and a desire to excell in their professional. A professional is the one who protects the ethics of his vocation,” Paranavithana said.
“If a journalist inflames racial or religious sentiments, it is a slur in the profession. It is a breach of media ethics, if journalists accept bribe or incentives to write in a partisan manner. We see a trend where media ethics are breached more when the media gets more freedom,” he said.
The Deputy Minister said there is a big demand for journalist passing out of the Sri Lanka Media Training Institute (SLMTI) because it imparts professional and ethical studies to students.
