Full message produced below:
I am deeply saddned by the demise of Justice C.G. Weeramantry, an outstanding legal luminary of international fame.
The international community as well as the human rights activities and peace lovers around the world will never forget the invaluable services rendered by Dr. Weeramantry as a judge of the International Court of Justice from 1881 to 2000 and the President of the International Association of Lawyers against Nuclear Arms.
This eminent judge presided over many important cases before the ICJ, including the case on the illegality of the use and threatened use of nuclear weapons.
The nation, recognising the great service of Dr. Weeramantry, conferred him with the highest national honour 'Sri Lankabhimanya'. We, as a nation, are grateful to Sri Lankabhimanya Weeramantry for the expertise provided to us for upgrading the human rights institutions in the country.
His untimely death took place at a time when Sri Lanka was seeking his expertise for further strengthening its judicial mechanism. I have no hesitation to acknowledge that his death is an irreparable loss to Sri Lanka.
I, on behalf of the government and people of Sri Lanka and on my personal behalf, offer my deepest condolences to his family and other close relations.
May his soul rest in peace.
