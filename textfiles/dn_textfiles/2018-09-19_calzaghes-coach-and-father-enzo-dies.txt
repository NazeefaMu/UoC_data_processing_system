Calzaghe's coach and father Enzo dies

London, Tuesday: Enzo Calzaghe, who coached his son Joe to two boxing world titles at different weights and an undefeated 46-bout career despite never boxing himself, has died aged 69.
The Sardinian-born trainer also coached Gavin Rees and Enzo Maccarinelli to the WBA light welterweight and WBO cruiserweight titles respectively. However, it will be the remarkable association with his own son, 'The Pride of Wales', for which he will forever be remembered.
"The family are devastated to have to announce the death of our beloved Enzo," the Calzaghes said in a statement."Enzo led an incredible life both inside and outside of the boxing gym and his loss is a devastating one for the entire Calzaghe family."
Enzo Calzaghe began his training career in very modest surroundings.
His first training facilities were in a shed in the south Wales town of Newbridge, but it evolved into one of the finest developers of boxing talent in the United Kingdom.
Joe won world titles at two weights, retiring as the undisputed super-middleweight world champion having held the WBO version for almost 11 years. AFP
