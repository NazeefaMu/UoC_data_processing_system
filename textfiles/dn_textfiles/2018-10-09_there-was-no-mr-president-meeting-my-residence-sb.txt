There was no MR-President meeting at my residence - SB

Parliamentarian and former minister S.B.Dissanayake categorically stated that President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not have any discussion at his residence as stated in certain sections of the media.
However, it was true that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa attended a dinner hosted by him (Dissanayake) at his residence said Dissanayake in a statement issued to the media yesterday.
 The statement added that no special political discussion took place at his residence on this occasion. There was a general discussion about the current economic crisis and insecurity in the country among the Parliamentarians present as usual.
In his statement Dissanayake requested that justice be meted out to him by giving publicity to his statement.
