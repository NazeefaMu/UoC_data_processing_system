Sri Lanka Malaysia Business Council  organizes panel discussion

The Sri Lanka Malaysia Business Council is organizing a presentation and panel discussion with industry experts on blockchain technology for its membership and other interested parties.
The event will take place on July 5 at 4.30 pm, Galadari Hotel, Colombo.
The presentation will be conducted by Stephen Chia an Industry Expert based in Malaysia who has been tasked to develop and grow the NEM technology in SE Asia as its Regional Head.
He is also a Council Member of the NEM.io Foundation Ltd. and Director of the NEM Blockchain Centre, the largest blockchain centre and blockchain co-working and entrepreneur hub in Asia located in GloDamansara, Kuala Lumpur.
Chia will provide an introduction to blockchain technology, discuss its significance in the digital economy, regulations and challenges, and how Sri Lanka can benefit from it.
He will also highlight its use in the various industries including shipping and logistics, supply chain management, GDPR and personal data etc.
Blockchain is decentralized shared ledger technology. Through blockchain, the total transaction circulation can be easily traced. It is because every node present in the network validates every transaction and the same is updated in all shared ledgers and these ledgers cannot be tampered.
Blockchain is making its way into a variety of industries, creating trust systems that undercut the traditional profiteering systems that have enabled the nascent sharing economy, by providing peer-to-peer interactions with transparency and security.
