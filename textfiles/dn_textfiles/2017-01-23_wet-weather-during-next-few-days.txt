Wet weather during next few days

Due to the wave type disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, showery weather conditions and cloudy skies can be expected during the next few days, Meteorology Department sources said yesterday.
The sources said heavy showers will prevail in most parts of the country until tomorrow with heavy falls (about 100 mm) too likely at some places.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Northern, North-central, Eastern, Central, Uva and Southern provinces.
Showers or thundershowers will occur elsewhere,particularly after 2.00 pm.Fairly strong winds at times (about 40-50kmph) can be expected over the Northern half of the island. here may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The public are requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning activity, the sources said.
