Sanjeewa wins March Grand Prix in style

B. A. Sanjeewa returned a record 13 under par over 4 rounds to win the Cat Solar Pin Fernando Grand Prix, March Edition by a clear 12 strokes. Sanjeewa has been consistently performing well, but the March Grand Prix 4 rounds of 68, 68, 66, 69, is truly exceptional.
J.M.D. Indika, the only other player to complete the 4 rounds under par, became the runner-up from Amarapdma who had an uncharacteristic 79 in the 4th round.
The brilliant form of Sanjeewa in the UTE CAT sponsored March Cat Solar Grand Prix earned him selection to represent Sri Lanka at the Pakistan Amateur Championship in mid April.
The last Sri Lankan to win the Pakistan Championship was Thangaraja in 2013, who is now a successful professional on the Indian Professional Golf Tour. The Cat Solar PFGP continues in April and will be played at the RCGC from April 4 to 7.
