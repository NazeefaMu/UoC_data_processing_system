Infinitely precious, wonderfully flawed

My father and I were walking in the Battarmulla town on our weekly shopping spree when a skinny young man walked up to us and asked for money to buy something to eat. My father handed him Rs. 150 and pointed to the restaurant close by where a packet of lunch with fish cost Rs. 140.
I thought the young man had tricked my father. I was certain he would walk to the nearest 'wine store' instead of the restaurant. When I voiced my doubts on our way home, my father simply said, “Don't always see the bad in a person. Perhaps he really was hungry.”
When we were once again in the town buying things on my mother's shopping list the young man approached us again. Yes, I thought to myself. He knows he can trick us into believing he is hungry again. But instead of asking for more money he thanked my father for the money he had given him and told us he is now employed as a security guard in a private company close by. He was on his way back to his lodgings after the night shift.
I felt ashamed of myself. Whereas my father had believed the young man, I had been skeptical. Why was I such a hard-boiled cynic?
I don't know why. My only consolation is that everyone else's brains too are wired that way.
Negativity bias
Scientists say all of us have an intrinsic “negativity bias", or tendency to focus on and give more weight to negative experiences or information instead of positive ones in our minds.
They cite a common example of the negativity bias by comparing it to our relationship with dogs. Almost all of us have had many great experiences with dogs throughout our lives. But if we were bitten or attacked by a dog, we are likely to be scared of them for the rest of our lives because we focus on the one negative experience instead of the many more pleasant ones. Likewise, we have all been wronged numerous times by our friends, colleagues and even total strangers. It is only natural then, that we find it hard to see the good in everyone around us.
To make things worse, it turns out that the negativity bias is so ingrained in our psychology that it has already developed and become measurable by the time we are seven months old!Clearly, seeing the positive attributes in others is an uphill battle.
That’s what humans do
A battle nevertheless less, that can be won. If you work hard, that is. If you work hard to make yourself realize there is not a single one of us who is perfect and that we all have our dark, twisty parts deep down inside. As Margaret Manning describes in her article,'How to be Happier by Learning to See the Good in Others' we’ve all done things we aren’t proud of and we’ve all hurt people—sometimes unintentionally and sometimes absolutely on purpose out of spite, anger or jealousy. “It happens because that’s what humans do. You have to make a conscious choice not to get so bogged down in all the ugly parts that they start to control who you are in the world,” says Manning. “Choose, instead, to be a person of honor and character. Acknowledge that those parts of yourself exist and then work really hard to rise above the limitations they create for you. And when you do mess up, like we all do, don’t beat yourself up over it.”
As we all know, that is much easier said than done since we tend to be our own worst critics. But, Manning assures that something amazing happens when you can start to accept all the parts of yourself and truly realize you have good inside of you: You are able to find the good in other people—even people you are pretty certain have no redeeming qualities.
Reserving judgment
The best way to go about this is by stopping ourselves from labeling people based on too little information. If we hear someone yell, we start to think of him or her as an “angry person.” If a friend rejects an invitation or disagrees with our point of view, we may think that they “don’t like us.” Even worse, once we form an opinion about someone, and label them it is difficult to change our mind and see them in a new light. Reserving judgment is difficult, yet it is a critical step on the path to positivity.
Manning also says that we must remember that all of us have a unique history and personal story. But at the same time, everyone is also more like us than we know. Like you and I, they too are infinitely precious and wonderfully flawed. “We cannot know the thoughts of others,” admits Manning. “But, this is exactly why it is so important to give them the benefit of the doubt. Every interaction with another person is important. It is an opportunity to learn about someone who, like you, is trying to make the most of their life.”
So, the next time you meet someone remember to do what Dolly Parton does. “When I meet someone, I look at their eyes and their smile and seek out the good first—it's easy to find when you're looking for it,” says Parton. “You let a person shine with their own light and try to connect it to yours. As soon as I say hello, I go right to that light and I don't care who you are! I know we're all pieces of the same thing—I go for that common light because I know it's in all of us.”
Thus, have I learned, someone in need could truly use my help; that in seeking the good in others will bring out the good within me.
Audrey Hepburn was so right when she said, 'For beautiful eyes see the good in others, for beautiful lips speak only words of kindness.
How to see the good in people
1) See The Good In You.
Be honest. You're not always such an angel. At times, you couldn't care less about the world and its problems. At times, you even have a tendency to be rude to others. But you're not always selfish and you're hardly ever rude. In fact, you're actually quite charming and generous to your friends. So why can't other people be the same? By looking at your own wonderful characteristics, you'll have an easier time spotting the same traits in other people.
2) Everyone Has Bad Days.
Have you ever had a bad day? If your answer is yes, then you know just how difficult dealing with everything else can be. The next time someone is rude to you, think about his reasons for being disrespectful. Could it be that he had gotten into trouble at work? Perhaps he had received a bit of bad news. Everyone has bad days. Understanding this helps you in seeing the good in people. Even the nicest of persons would probably slip up when he's bombarded with a boatload of problems.
3) Practise Positivity.
People who surround themselves with positivity have an easier time seeing the good in people. That's because they've already programmed such thoughts in their life. You too can follow in their footsteps. Start with being grateful for your life. Be thankful that you have a family and friends who you can laugh and cry with. Be grateful that you have another opportunity to live a good life and that you have the ability to see the good in others. Seeing the good in people is an admirable trait and something we should all aspire to have. Not only will it make your life more peaceful, it will also give you the power to influence how other people think and react.
