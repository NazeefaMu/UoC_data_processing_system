‘Govt. will fulfill people’s needs’

State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa said it is the responsibility of the SLFP to fulfill the people’s desires while remaining with the National Unity Government while protecting the party’s autonomy.
State Minister Lakshaman Yapa expressed his views at a SLFP media briefing last morning.
“The government has made space for change while fulfilling the people’s needs,” he said.
State Minister Yapa pointed out that the ability to question and investigate the Central Bank Bond issue while remaining a part of the government, itself is a victorious change.
