Resurgent Federer advances to Montreal final

MONTREAL: Swiss superstar Roger Federer turned in a precision performance Saturday at the ATP Montreal tennis, using thundering serves and clever backhands to defeat unseeded Robin Haase for a spot in the final.
The 36-year-old Federer blasted nine aces and lost just nine points on his serve as he extended his match win streak to 16 -- his longest win streak in five years. He raised his game to another level when it mattered most, beating Netherlands Robin Haase 6-3, 7-6 (7/5) in just 75 minutes.
“I'm very excited to be back in the finals,” Federer said. “A bit surprising, to be quite honest, because I hadn't practiced much.” Federer has taken more time off this year than usual. He skipped the clay-court season from April to mid-June. - AFP
