A Vote on Account will fill  the breach - Bandula

There is no issue with regard to financial management of the country as there is a provision in the constitution to allocate money through a Vote on Account, Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said.
He was addressing the media along with Parliamentarians Laksman Yapa Abeywardena and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa yesterday in Colombo.
Gunawardena added that there are provisions for the President to allocate money when Parliament is dissolved. However, if Parliament is continuing, money can be allocated through a Vote on Account for a three month period.
Gunawardena further said the UNP Parliamentarians are circulating falsehoods that the salaries of public servants cannot be paid from January. Besides, they say that loan instalments, Samurdhi benefits, pensions and other welfare payments cannot be paid as the government has no powers to allocate funds. Gunawardena highlighted that there is no truth in that because the funds can be allocated by a Vote on Account for a period of three months of next year.
“According to state monetary regulations, there is no issue until December 31,” he said. He further added that even if a new government is elected, the President has powers to allocate money for a three month period until a budget is presented. Moreover, the President has powers to allocate money even for a holding an election.
“The new government was about to present a vote on Account of Rs 1,735 and the proposal of presenting Vote on Account received Cabinet approval also,” he added.
“Everyone should support a Vote on Account Bill in Parliament if it is presented. Otherwise, no Parliamentarians, who don’t support to pass it, can go to their electorates and face people,” he said.
“The UNP is threatening public servants who carry out their duties. It is an injustice to threaten public servants swho carry out their duties,” he added Parliamentarian Anura Priayadarshana Yapa addressing the media said public servants should not fear carrying out their duties ortop release funds within the provisions of government regulations. He added that the 19th amendment has created a huge mess.
“The UNP wanted to transfer powers of the Executive President to the Prime Minister through the back door implementing the 19th Amendment. But, instead of strengthening the Prime Minister, the powers of Parliament was reduced with the 19th amendment,” he said. “Once we come to power, measures will be taken to revise the 19th Amendment to the Constitution,” he added.
