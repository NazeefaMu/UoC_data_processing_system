Inclement weather hits Ampara

Rains that began last Saturday in Ampara have inundated several low-lying areas and if it were to continue, a majority of the district’s roads would be inaccessible.
Hundreds of houses in Akkaraipattu, Aalayadivembu, Thirukkovkil, Pottuvil, Addaicheniai, Kalmunai, Nintavur, and Kalnmunai have so far been submerged. Many roads in the Alayadivembu too, are under water. Meanwhile, a number of main roads in the Akkaraipattu municipality have been inundated as well.
The Ampara district had experienced severe droughts over the past few months and as a result, several thousand acres of paddy fields had been abandoned.
However, due to the prevailing inclement weather, the water levels of the Senenayake Samudra, the main irrigation tank in the district, is also increasing.
Meanwhile, the Pottuvil Meteorological Department had recorded that 24 hours after the rains began, 86mm of rainfall had been calculated on December 9, at 8.30 am.
If the inclement weather were to persist, more people would have to evacuate their homes.
