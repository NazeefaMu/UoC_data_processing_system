Unqualified SAITM students want KDU Act re-amended

There were 54 unqualified students in SAITM and they do not have the minimum qualifications required to be absorbed into the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU). Now they are trying their best to influence politicians and high-ranking officials to re-amend the KDU Act, media spokesman of the State Medical Students’ Parents’ Union Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said that action should be taken against the officials who recruited those 54 unqualified students to SAITM because now they cannot enter the KDU without sitting for examinations. Therefore, they want to re-amend the Act in order to enter KDU without the required minimum educational qualifications.
According to Alwis, those unqualified 54 SAITM students are from the families who tried their best to save SAITM in the past by holding several press conferences. During those press conferences, they said that their children are more talented and qualified than state medical students, but now their children are scared to sit for examinations outside SAITM.
If they are really qualified and talented, there is no reason to avoid examinations.
The University Grants Commission (UGC) did not give the educational qualifications of SAITM students when the details were requested by the State Medical Students’ Parents’ Union under the Right to Information Act.
The Chairman of the UGC should be removed and a qualified and unbiased scholar should be appointed to this position because the current Chairman has already tarnished his image and tarnished the image of the UGC by openly supporting fraudulent institutions such as SAITM and promoting private medical education while suppressing and neglecting state medical education, he said.
