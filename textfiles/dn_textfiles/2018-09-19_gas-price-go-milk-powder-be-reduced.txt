Gas price  to go up,  milk powder  to be reduced

The Cost of Living Committee appointed by the Cabinet yesterday recommended to increase the price of a 12.5Kg domestic Gas cylinder by Rs.195.
Gas companies had made a proposal to the CoL Committee to increase the price of 12.5 Kg of domestic gas to Rs.325 considering the soaring gas prices in the world market and depreciation of the rupee against the dollar.
However, the Committee has recommended an increase of Rs. 195 after taking the proposal made by the gas companies into account.
At the same time, the Committee has also recommended to reduce the prices of milk powder by Rs 25 per kilogramme.
The decisions were taken during the Cost of Living Committee meeting held last evening.
