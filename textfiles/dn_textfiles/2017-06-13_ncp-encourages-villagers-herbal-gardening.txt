NCP encourages villagers in herbal gardening

The North Central Provincial Indigenous Medicine Department established herbs gardens at 43 Ayurveda hospitals in the Anuradhapura and the Polonnaruwa districts under the initiatives of Provincial Ayurveda Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis.
Elayapaththuwa, Padawiya, Nachchaduwa, Palugaswewa, Wilachchiya, Thabuttegema, Thirappane, Galnewa, Minneriya and Aralaganwila now boast herbs gardens under the programme. They are maintained under the Ayurveda physicians assisted by Ayurveda societies operating at the Grama Niladari division level.
A 100-acre herbs forest will be grown as well in Habarana, Dr. Alwis said. Villagers in the area are encouraged to cultivate herbal plants such as bim kohomba, katuwelbatu, komarika, ela batu, kohomba, ranawara, iramusu, and neranchi among others under the programme. Dr. Alwis said their harvests are bought by the department to produce Ayurveda drugs at the Thelhiriyawewa Ayurveda drugs manufacturing plant.
