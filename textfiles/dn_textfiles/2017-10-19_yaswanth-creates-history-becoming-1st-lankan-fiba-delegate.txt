Yaswanth creates history becoming 1st Lankan FIBA delegate

A well known basketball personalty, Yaswanth Muttettuwegama did Sri Lanak proud by becoming the youngest Asian to be appointed as a FIBA Technical Delegate recently. Yaswanth, 32 is the youngest appointee among 20 Asian Technical Delegates appointed by the world basketball governing body. Yaswanth's appointment will go to the annals of local basketball as the first Sri Lankan appointee to hold a high title in the Federation of International Basketball (FIBA). FIBA recently appointed 103 new Technical Delegates worldwide.
An old boy of S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, Yaswanth possessed a star studded school cager career before he entered basketball administration. He was a pioneering member of Hambantota District Basketball Association and serves in the capacity of its vice president from the inception to-date. He was also instrumental in forming one time local cager stronghold, Hambatota Sports Club (HSC) 'Blues' Basketball Club and carries out duties as its vice president from 2010 to-date.
Reaching another significant achievement in Yaswanth's basketball career, he was appointed as the vice president of the local governing body for cager sport, the Sri Lanka Basketball Federation in 2013. He discharged his duties in SLBF until 2015 to uplift the standard of the sport. He has been a committed administrator who worked hard to popularize basketball through out the island and initiated many training programmes aiming at rural schools. Yaswanth played a key role in organizing international level tournaments such as Carlton Basketball Championship. Under SLBF's programme to uplift the sport at school level, basketball gear were donated to distant schools while developing basketball infrastructure in far and near regions during his tenure at SLBF.
Yaswanth will embark on his fist assignment in Australia on November 27 after assuming duty as a FIBA Technical Delegate where he will be a member of the FIBA official panel for the match between Australia and Japan in Adelaide.
