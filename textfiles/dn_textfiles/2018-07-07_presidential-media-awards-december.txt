Presidential Media Awards in December

The first-ever Presidential Media Awards will be held on December 19 this year, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera announced yesterday.
“A total of 54 awards will be handed over to outstanding journalists working in all three languages in print, television, radio and web media,” Minister Samaraweera said.
“By recognising the efforts of creative and talented media personnel, we will be taking a step towards creating a culture of excellence in the media. We often see only the negative side of the media, but we have to recognise the positive side while also taking cognisance of the many challenges faced by the media,” the Minister told a gathering of top editors and media executives in Colombo.
The awards covering a variety of categories will be decided upon by independent and impartial panels of judges. Applicants can nominate themselves or another person such as a colleague or editor can nominate an applicant. The applications can be submitted online at www.pma.gov.lk. The stories, articles or video/audio productions should have been published or aired between January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 to be eligible for awards. The awards have been named Presidential Awards to impart the highest possible recognition to talented journalists and President Maithripala Sirisena has given his fullest backing to the project, along with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“Instead of worrying about those who misuse the media, we must recognize those who wield the pen or camera in the correct manner, protecting the dignity of the media and their profession. There are many creative and forthright journalists whose efforts we have to recognise. Our aim is to produce a future generation of media personnel who value truth, ethics and principles and who will raise their voice for the progress of the masses,” the Minister said. He said this year’s awards ceremony is only one of the many progressive measures already taken or being planned for the development of media in the country. They will also explore the possibility of adding more types of media and more award categories in the future in the context of the evolving media landscape.
