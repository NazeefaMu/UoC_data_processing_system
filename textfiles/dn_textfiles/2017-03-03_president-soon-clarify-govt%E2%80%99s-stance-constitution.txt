President to soon clarify Govt’s stance on Constitution

President Maithripala Sirisena will soon make clear what the government’s stance on the Constitution is, UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday, as the question of the referendum remained unanswered between the two major political parties in the country.
Confusion has been rife over the nature of the changes proposed to the Constitution with the SLFP insisting that only amendments that do not need a referendum would be made while the UNP has been firm that they there would be a new Constitution with a referendum.
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera earlier this week informed the UNHRC in Geneva that a new Constitution with a referendum would be introduced and co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne affirmed his statement at the weekly Cabinet media briefing on Wednesday, “It is the government’s stance”, said Minister Senaratne adding weight to the argument.
