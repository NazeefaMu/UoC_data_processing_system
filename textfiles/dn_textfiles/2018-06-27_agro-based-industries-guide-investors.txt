Agro-based industries: A guide to investors

Agro-based industries are important for a developing country for its economic prosperity. They lead to the creation of forward and backward linkages of the development process on a large scale, by making agriculture and industries mutually complementary. On the other hand, the development of agro-based industries can help realise various linkages or interrelationships between industry and agriculture. If agro-based industries are developed, it will help create new markets for agricultural produce and reduce post-harvest losses. This will mitigate unrest among the farmer communities due to lack of markets and demand for their produce.
At the same time, it will be possible to generate new employment opportunities on a large scale in the rural sector. In addition, the broad-based development of the agro-products industry will improve both social and physical infrastructure. Therefore, development of this sector is important in terms of the growth of Sri Lanka’s productive capacity, national income, employment and foreign exchange.
However, it was observed that a lot of factors have to be considered for a viable, sustainable, successful and profitable industry before investing. Therefore, this article attempts to propose a set of guidelines which can be used to direct investors before investing. The guide is based on the lessons learnt and from the literature review. Eighteen themes were identified to make the guide and it is advisable to analyse the feasibility of a project prior to making any critical decisions. At the same time, involvement of a multidisciplinary team to conduct the feasibility analysis is also important. In the feasibility analysis, all the parameters should be used to make the decisions and it is not advisable to make decisions by looking at only few parameters.
i. Location
Agro-based industries should be mainly located based on the availability of raw material and if they are in rural areas, they help to develop the rural economy as well.
ii. Land and building requirement
It is recommended to have the land in an industrial zone as such zones offer many other benefits. It is also recommended to construct the building as it will facilitate installing of machines in an appropriate manner. Further, land and building for a proposed industry can be acquired on rent or ownership.
iii. Utility requirement
Facilities such as electricity, water and communication are essential utilities for an industry and therefore, locations where those facilities are available at affordable rates and with easy access are desirable.
iv. Transport facilities
Mode of transport, easy access to the factory from other areas and from factory to other areas and means of transport can be considered as transport facilities. Attention should be paid to ensure the availability of these facilities as the sustainability of an industry depends on this as well.
v. Appropriate technology and production process flow
Technology used to produce a product or technology to manage the regular operations of an industry can be identified as appropriate technology. The help of technical experts has to be obtained to identify the appropriate technology and to monitor and maintain the production process flow at an efficient and effective level. At the same time, technological issues that could affect the industry have to be considered too.
vi. Machinery requirement
The identification of machinery requirement is another key factor and suitable machinery and equipment have to be obtained from local or international markets at competitive rates.
vii. Availability of raw material
To identify the continuous availability of raw materials for an industry, major supplying areas, storage facilities, consumption, current industrial usage, post-harvest losses, and exports and imports have to be considered critically with respect to the time of the year. Further, it is desirable to analyse data for at least 10 years and make forecasts for at least five years, while identifying the trends.
In addition, the scattered nature of available raw materials also requires attention in the planning and implementation stages of the project to make a well-established mechanism to obtain the surplus of raw material at a focal point. On the other hand, crop surplus during the harvest season also inevitably results in irregular supply of raw materials. This factor too, therefore, needs special attention at the planning stage.
viii. Technical appropriateness of available raw material
With respect to agro produce, parameters such as variety, composition, colour and size determine the technical appropriateness of raw material for an industry. Therefore, the support of technical experts should be obtained to identify the suitable indicators and raw materials for an industry, and at the same time, attention has to be paid to critically recognise the varieties cultivated by farmers. If not, this factor may result in a failed project.
ix. Accessibility of raw material
Regular supply of raw materials at a sufficient level throughout the required period is considered as accessibility and it is one of the key factors in the success of an industry.
Therefore, a mechanism of obtaining raw materials at the factory has to be developed with much attention and a comprehensive study has to be conducted for this. The proposed mechanism should touch on the following: scattered nature of raw materials; attitudes, perceptions and behaviour of farmers; strong linkages and continuous dialogue with farmers; and obtaining support of existing groups and societies such as farmer societies and local officials working with farmers. It is also important to have a written document or registry or agreement with farmers with precautions in case of violations of agreements. Further it is necessary to have staff to coordinate, follow up, monitor and supervise regularly at the field, attend to issues immediately, and give inputs at the right time, systematically collect the harvest, and make payments on time. External factors such as the availability of infrastructure facilities and collecting centres and regular discussions with stakeholders, at the right time are also vital. Therefore, accessibility would not be an issue if there is a well-developed collecting mechanism.
x. Affordability of raw material
Poor understanding of the raw material market makes business unprofitable as the high cost of production makes the products not competitive in the market.
To decide the affordability of raw materials for an industry, it is important to analyse the prices of the raw materials in the open market. A study on the wholesale prices for a period of time would help understand the average prices and price trends in the open market. At the same time, prices depend on the availability of products and the domestic demand at any given time. Therefore, all the causes and effects on production and demand also have to be studied to understand price fluctuations. Generally, the supply of raw materials is not stable throughout the year and as a result, there can be huge variations in the prices. Therefore, it is recommended to estimate the raw material requirement for the year and this should be contracted for in advance with the suppliers for the industry so as to be unaffected by drastic changes in the prices of raw materials.
xi. Other fixed asset requirements
A list of other essential fixed assets required for an industry to conduct operations smoothly has to be identified and attention should be paid with much concern to obtain quality assets in a competitive environment.
xii. Human resource requirement
Attention has to be paid to identify the manpower requirement first, and secondly, to recruit the ideal technical experts, skilled labour, unskilled labour, management staff, field staff and sales staff.
xiii. Marketing of the product
Marketing of the product of an industry mainly depends on demand and supply forces. Demand can be either existing demand or created demand. If it is existing demand, the entire demand and the level of the demand which is fulfilled already have to be studied. If it is created demand, strategies that create the demand have to be studied first.
After analysing the demand, the availability of products and the accessibility and affordability of buyers for products have to be considered to identify the potential of selling the product in the market at a profitable rate. Therefore, aspects such as industries of similar nature currently in operation (local and foreign), price of the product, perceptions and behaviour of target buyers and marketing and sales strategy have to be analysed critically.
Apart from that, competitors have to be identified along with their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, strategies necessary to deal with the competition are also required. There would be good potential for a new brand if there is a quality product, unique package, a market network, industry understanding, financial soundness and feedback.
xiv. Market entry timing
Various products and services have high dependence on their commercialisation timing and delivery to the customers based either on the availability of raw material or level of demand for the product. Therefore, these factors have to be studied well to identify the perfect market entry time for the industry.
xv. Management of the industry
Management of an industry mainly includes project investment and the legal status of the business. These factors too have to be analysed critically to have a sustainable product line.
The composition of debt and equity is discussed under project investment and the composition of debt and equity can be changed according to the requirement of the investor. Ownership and business registration come under the business’ legal status. Ownership can be proprietorship or a partnership and it can be registered under the Companies Ordinance, or as a BOI project. The advantages and disadvantages of different types of ownership should be studied and the best should be selected for the industry.
xvi. External factors
A study on the relevant public sector entities will help identify the advantages and benefits which can be obtained from the public sector, as well as identify the existing rules and regulations in order to maintain the viability of the industry. Further, an analysis on the available tax reliefs, subsidies and other opportunities available to encourage investments can be used to reap benefits from those opportunities.
A study on both state and local level environmental laws will help describe the regulations and environmental issues that a company needs to address and it is important for an industry to justify that they follow the existing rules and regulations.
Social, political and economic risks in a country and around the location where an industry is to be set up have to be studied carefully to minimise the vulnerability of a newly established industry.
xvii. Coordination and integration among stakeholders
The absence of proper integration among various agencies and lack of coordination between regulatory bodies and industry have been identified as one of the shortcomings of the industry sector. In the public sector, there are different ministries and departments working in agriculture, industry, marketing and processing sector, etc. However, poor integration and coordination among these institutes does not allow the country to use its resources productively.
On the other hand, there are technical experts, technologists and field officers attached to those institutes and there are databases maintained with important information. However, lack of coordination and integration result in minimum usage of available knowledge and information and later, result in wrong decisions. At the same time, there are institutes in the private sector and in the non-governmental sector rich in relevant knowledge and information. Therefore, proper coordination and integration among the relevant institutes in the public, private and non-governmental sectors would lead the investors to make more accurate decisions and thereby get the maximum use of the available resources.
xviii. Monitoring and supervision
Attention should be paid to establishing a mechanism for the continuous monitoring and supervision of all the project activities at regular intervals. For that, the required resources such as human resources, time and money have to be estimated in advance and a space needs to be reserved for this in the project’s activity plan. At the same time, there should be a mechanism to provide remedies for issues if any, without any delay, to ensure the smooth function of the project.
