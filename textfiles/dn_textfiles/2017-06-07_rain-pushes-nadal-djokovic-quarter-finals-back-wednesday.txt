Rain pushes Nadal, Djokovic quarter-finals back to Wednesday

PARIS Tuesday: Torrential rain forced Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic’s quarter-finals at the French Open to be delayed until Wednesday.
Play was suspended on Tuesday just before 1530 local time (1330 GMT) during the first two women’s quarter-finals at Roland Garros.
Jelena Ostapenko was serving for the second set in her match against Caroline Woznacki after the Dane clinched the opener 6-4.
Timea Bacsinszky was a set up on France’s Kristina Mladenovic on Court Philippe Chatrier, with a resumption not expected before 1830 (1630 GMT). Nine-time champion Nadal is due to take on compatriot Pablo Carreno Busta, while title-holder Djokovic faces sixth seed Dominic Thiem in a repeat of last year’s semi-final. As a result of the downpours, all four men’s quarter-finals will be played on Wedneday with Andy Murray against Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka facing Marin Cilic. AFP
