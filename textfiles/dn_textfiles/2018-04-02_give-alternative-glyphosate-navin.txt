Give alternative for Glyphosate - Navin

Weedicides are needed for the development of the commercial agriculture sector, said the Minister of Plantation Industries, Navin Dissanayake.
Speaking at an event held at the Coconut Cultivation Board recently he said that people who are against the lifting of the ban should come up with an alternative for it.
He also said that people are blaming the government for the high price of coconut which was happen as a result of the drought. “However as the Minister in charge of coconut I cannot blame the drought and wait. We have to invest in new technology and replanting especially in areas in North East.”
Sri Lanka needs 3 billion coconuts per annum out of which 2.7 billion are consume in Sri Lanka.
The Minister said that in contrast to the tea industry where there is lot of innovation and exports, the coconut sector is yet to tap this potential. “There is a growing global demand for coconut water based products and other byproducts and researchers as well as the private sector should look at these.”
Minister Dissanayake also said that he is against the import of coconuts to cushion down the high prices of coconuts. “We have allowed some part of imports and those are for the industrial sector.”
He said that the prevailing drought is expected to clear by June and then the situation should ease.
