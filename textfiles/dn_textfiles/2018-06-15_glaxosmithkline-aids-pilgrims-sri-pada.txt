GlaxoSmithKline aids pilgrims at Sri Pada

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK),through its brands Panadol and Iodex, offered relief to thousands of Sri Pada pilgrims under its Suwa Sahana initiative.
In line with the brand promise of not letting pain get in the way of life, GSK through Panadol and Iodex, offered relief from pain and discomfort to over 100,000 pilgrims within a span of four weeks.
Equipped with a range of medical facilities the relief camp located near Sama Chaithyain Nallatanni, provided free pain relief and first-aid services to all pilgrims. In addition, the relief zone provided free head and leg massages by therapists using Headfast and Iodex. Pilgrims were also provided with Panadol tablets as prescribed by the pharmacist. Speaking about the initiative, Sunil Mehra, Chairman and Managing Director, Smith Kline Beecham (Pvt) Ltd-Sri Lanka, said “Panadol and Iodex have built a long-standing bond with Sri Lankan households over the years and have become an essential part of their everyday lives. The Sri Pada pilgrimage in particular bears special significance to the community and we are pleased to have provided relief to the devotees through our Suwa Sahana medical camps and to have made their pilgrim experience more satisfying. We strongly believe that our continued efforts reiterate our core principle of giving back to the community in the best way possible”.
Spearheaded by Panadol and Iodex, GlaxoSmithKline’s Suwa Sahana relief camps have been consistently covering all the major religious, cultural events and festivals in Sri Lanka for many years. Apart from Sri Pada, GSK’s Suwa Sahana initiative also intends to cover religious festivals in Anuradhapura, Mihintale andThanthirimale during June and July. The program has been able to touch the lives of millions of Sri Lankans, further encouraging GSK to continue this community service and enhance it every year.
