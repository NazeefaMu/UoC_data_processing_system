Manufacturers of Exide, Lucas and Dagenite receives National Quality Award 2016

Associated Battery Manufacturers (ABM) Ceylon Limited, the manufacturers of EXIDE, Lucas and Dagenite automotive batteries, achieved the National Quality Award for Business Excellence under the Manufacturing (Medium Scale) category at the National Quality Awards ceremony held at the BMICH Colombo recently.
The National Quality Awards is organised by Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI), the national Standards Body of Sri Lanka every year in order to recognise the business excellence of Sri Lankan organisations.
The National Quality Award recognises quality excellence based on the world renowned Malcolm Baldrige model. It is judged by a panel of industry experts/business leaders against in-depth scoring criteria covering seven key areas namely Leadership, Strategic Planning, Customer Focus, Measurement, Analysis and Knowledge Management, Workforce Engagement, Operational Focus and Results.
ABM Ceylon Limited is a partnership between Brown & Company PLC (Browns), and Exide Industries India, and Browns has had the privilege of being the sole distributor for Exide, Lucas and Dagenite automotive batteries in Sri Lanka.
“This award is of special significance, as last year too ABM was granted the Merit award under the same category. Winning the National Quality Award in 2016, is a strong testament of the company’s unstinted strife towards quality and excellence,” said M. Ramachandran, CEO ABM Ceylon Limited.
Exide is a long standing and well-known brand in the automotive industry, currently being sold in over 90 countries around the world. It is the only battery to carry the SLS Certification, built to JIS Standards, offering up to 5 years warranty, coupled with a strong island-wide dealer network and BattMobile services; a value add to Fully Loaded Exide products and services.
Lucas was established in 1872, the same year that the petrol engine was first patented. The business that Joseph Lucas founded in Birmingham, represents the consistency and durability of Lucas products and has made Lucas one of the most successful automotive brands in history. These batteries are manufactured in Sri Lanka under UK standards.
Dagenite is an ‘All Terrain Battery’ manufactured in Sri Lanka. Dagenite automotive batteries are suitable for cars, vans, three wheelers, buses, Lorries or any other land vehicle and are priced more competitively than any other competitor brand in the market, making this the ideal battery option for the price conscious consumer.
With an investment of over LKR 250 million, in the year 2015/16, Associated Battery Manufacturers Ceylon Limited have taken active steps towards the constant improvement of its processes and equipment in order to produce Exide, Lucas and Dagenite batteries to the highest modern world standards. Also, over 90 years of industry experience has provided ABM the insight into manufacturing batteries specific to the Sri Lankan consumer and tropical weather conditions.
