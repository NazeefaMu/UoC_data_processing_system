Chinese Government provides Rs. 12 billion
South Asia’s largest kidney hospital soon in Polonnaruwa

The largest Kidney Hospital in South East Asia will be built assisted by the Chinese Government in Polonnaruwa at a cost of Rs. 12 Billion, Health Ministry sources said.
China will construct the fully-pledged 200-bed hospital in response to a request made by President Maithripala Sirisena. A team of Chinese Government officials visited Polonnaruwa to inspect the proposed land for the Hospital located close to the General Hospital in the district at the 28th Mile Post.
Work on the hospital will commence before the end of this year. It would consist of 200 beds, 100 blood infiltration machines and a modern surgery, the sources said.
China has also undertaken to identify the cause of the disease and water samples from affected areas are now under research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the sources said.
