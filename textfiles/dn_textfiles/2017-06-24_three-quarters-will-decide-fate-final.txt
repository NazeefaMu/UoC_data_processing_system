Three-quarters will decide fate of final

Isipathana take on St. Joseph’s:
Isipathana College and St. Joseph’s College will feature in their Milo inter-schools Division one President’s trophy knockout rugby tournament final match at Racecourse international Stadium in Reid Avenue today at 4.15 pm.
The Isipathana lads have brought in former fly half Randy Silva to play in the pivotal position of centre at the expense of skipper Sumudu Rankothge who is expected to play in the second half as centre if needed.
In the pack, Devin Gunaratne will play as number eight alongside their flankers Sudeera Gaynath and Umesh Jayamanna in the third row. Vikasha Madawa will be moved up to the front row to bind down with Ramash Sachintha and hooker Kushmal Ratnaweer.
Rival aptains  Sumudu Rankothge (Isipathana) and Vinul Fernando (St Joseph’s)     
The forte of both teams has been their speedy three quarter line. The Pathana ‘line’ especially with acting skipper Chamod Fernando is expected to give a terrific display in the open play with his sweeping running moves.
If they get their act together to proceed with the famous Fijian style running rugby that they normally play, then Isipathana will have a chance of pulling off this game.
However they face a huge challenge from the Joes three quarter line spearheaded by their full back Gamunu Chethiya who will be ably supported by fly half Chathura Seneviratne, centres Sameera Viranga and Shan Akila along with wingers captain Vinul Fernando and Sachith Silva.
In the set scrums the experienced St. Joseph’s hooker Sven Muller will get the better of his vis-a-vis young Kushmal Ratnaweer, while the line outs should be shared between the Joes solitary jumper Shehan Kalaniyagoda and Isipathana line out jumpers Sudeera Gaynath and Ravindu Anjula.
Isipathana’s new halves combination comprising experienced Harith Bandara and Anjana Kulathilaka are playing together for the first time this season. All will depend on how they will click as a pair in this crucial match. Pathana will hope that their highly talented scrum half cum playmaker Harith will pair off well with his new fly half Anjana.
Meanwhile for the Isipathana lads in all probability, their young scrum half and playmaker Harith Bandara should try to set his speedy three quarters in motion at every given opportunity, as they have two hard running wing three quarters in Nadeesha Chaminda and Ramith de Silva together with their young Manelka Ruberu. This is in addition to the experienced centre Randy Silva who has stood out with his powerful runs down the flank with speedy full back Chamod Fernando there to join the line and form the overlap.
They will hope that their halves combination of Bandara and Anjana will hit it off today. The halves combination of these two players will have to give a very good performance if Isipathana are to emerge victorious.
