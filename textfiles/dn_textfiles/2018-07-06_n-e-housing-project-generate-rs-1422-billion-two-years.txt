N-E housing project to generate Rs. 14.22 billion in two years

The Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry has said the 40,000 housing project for the conflict-affected in the North and East is scheduled to begin soon.
Two factories will be set up to produce construction materials for the houses. The housing project and the two factories will bring Rs. 51.975 billion as financial benefit to the country within the projected two-year period, the Ministry said in a statement.
The construction of 40,000 houses will create 15,000 job opportunities in the North and East in two years. The company intends to pay an average of Rs. 40,000 all inclusive per month for an individual labourer. Accordingly, it will bring Rs. 13.2 billion directly to the war-affected people in the North and East as financial benefit, within the projected two-year period.
By establishing these factories, people of the North and East will get numerous permanent job opportunities as the local agent of the construction company has agreed to establish the factories as a hub of their raw material production and exporting centre for the South East Asian region. As such, these factories will strengthen the local economy by using local resources as input and exporting construction materials.
In Phase 1 of the project, 2,000 jobs will be created for skilled and unskilled labourers.
