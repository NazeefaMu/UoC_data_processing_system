SAITM will not be closed down: Rajitha

Co-Cabinet Spokesperson and Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine, Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said the government would not close down the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) as none have called for it.
The Health Minister explained that all parties had expressed willingness to resolve the matter as soon as possible. The minister is to receive the Panel of Deans’ report on SAITM this week.
“The Deans and the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) have had extensive talks and they want to resolve the matter before it is taken to Supreme Courts. I have also had discussions with the Specialists Association and they too have given some recommendations. No one is asking to close it down,”he said.
The minister was addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing.
Senaratne added that even the GMOA had stated that it was up to the government to decide whether we need to have private medical colleges or not, “Student politics on the other hand are different,”he added.
