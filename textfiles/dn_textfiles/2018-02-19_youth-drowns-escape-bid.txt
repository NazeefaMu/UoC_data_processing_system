Youth drowns in escape bid

Residents of Heraliyawatte recovered the body of 20-year-old Nalinda Kasun of Kahatuduwa, Piliyandala, which was found floating in the Heraliyawatte canal, on Saturday morning.
Mount Lavinia ASP Sarath Jayasekera who held a spot inquiry, transferred a Police Sergeant and a Police Constable of the Kahatuduwa Police to the Mount Lavinia Police Division, pending a full inquiry, in connection with this incident.
It transpires that on Friday, a police party of the Kahatuduwa Police had arrested two suspects for possession of two grams of heroin, while they were walking close to the canal in the Kahatuduwa Police area.
One suspect, identified as Nalinda Kasun, escaped from police custody and, when police gave chase, jumped into the canal.
Although residents and police searched the canal, he could not be found. His relatives rushed to the police station and had a heated argument with the police. They staged a protest against the OIC and other policemen who were involved in the alleged incident.
The crowd was however brought under control with the arrival of Mount Lavinia ASP Sarath Jayasekera who promised an impartial inquiry into the matter. He held a preliminary inquiry.
After the body was found, the Kesbewa Magistrate visited the scene and held an inquiry. The postmortem was held by the AJMO of the Colombo South Hospital and a verdict of 'death due to drowning' was recorded.
The Mount Lavinia SSP has ordered an inquiry into the incident and a team of officers of the Mount Lavinia Police is conducting investigations.
