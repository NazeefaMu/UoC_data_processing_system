Up to speed

The Embassy of the People’s Republic of China, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs, and the China Cultural Center of Sri Lanka organized a Chinese cultural fair, entitled “Happy Chinese New Year-Wonderful Jiangsu,” to celebrate Chinese New Year and honor 60 years of bilateral relations between the two countries. The event took place on Thursday, February 16th.
A group of performers from Jiangsu province graced the occasion, and they put on over ten different acts, ranging from juggling and magic to displays of swordsmanship and traditional dance.
The visitors from Jiangsu took the stage after a medley of Sri Lankan dance that was put on by the State Dance Ensemble.
Act of celebration
The first act was, as the announcer called it, “an act of celebration,” where six male performers dressed in shiny, flowing red pants and yellow vests performed acrobatic dances while each holding their own red and yellow lion puppet. They performed synchronized twists and twirls all the while making their lion puppets dance. In the midst of their routine, eight women came on stage wearing blue and pink and carrying a green handkerchief in one hand and a small flower drum in the other. They performed a more relaxed dance, cerebrally swaying to the traditional Chinese music and waving their handkerchiefs in the air.
Diabolo performance
Up next was a Diabolo performance. This art consists of spinning an hourglass-shaped implement on a string attached to two sticks. It is akin to juggling, and the two women who performed were simply incredible.
They gracefully moved about the stage, all the while tossing the the hourglass object in the air before catching it in all manner of positions.
They even played catch, throwing the
object back and forth and cathing it on their strings.
Traditional Chinese boxing
Wearing bright yellow costumes, six young men bounded across the stage, punching and kicking the air before landing prone on the ground. Each took his turn individually, jumping in the air before coming back to earth and slapping the ground. One went so far as to land in a split after sparring with his invisible partner.
Music of rain
After the boxing a troupe of women dressed in flowing green and pink performed a dance to the music of rain. A relaxed, calming affair, the dancers lithely moved about the stage, their movements evoking the relaxing effect of falling rain.
Hula hooper
After the mysterious conjuror left the stage, a peppy hula hooper bounded on in a
bright red bodysuit and started hula hooping I tup. At one point, she had four different rings going, two around her one arm, one around her torso, and the last around her legs. It was a feat of serious coordination!
Magic performance
A magician then took the stage, and began his set by conjuring white roses out of thin air. With music blaring, he proceeded to levitate a small table, going so far as to lift the table’s cover to show that to is no strings were attached. His effortless performance awed the crowd, which fell silent before applauding rapturously. The magicians next feat was an act of incredible hand-eye coordination, wherein he rotated two figure eights in tandem, making them mimic each other. He then upped the ante, using four figure eights to create all manner of shapes. The magician was certainly one of the evening’s more popular performers.
Another folk dance followed, this one centering on lotus roots. A woman in red took the stage accompanied by two small green objects that followed her around. As she danced, she appeared to care for these green items, watering them and urging them to grow, and they soon sprouted into lotus flowers as the women went from their bent-over position to a standing one. They then continued the dance to lighthearted music before smilingly exiting the stage.
8. The next performance was by a pop singer who sang a Chinese tune before switching over to some Frank Sinatra. He spoke in Chinese and didn’t quite connect with the crowd, but his style was impeccable and he did have a good voice.
9. One of the crowd’s favorite performances was next, where two women lay on their backs while manipulating ceramic vases with their feet high above them. They rotated the jugs and tossed them back and forth without making a single mistake. They then started twirling mats on their hands and feet, a truly exceptional feat of coordination.
10. Much to the children’s amusement, the jugglers then took the stage. First up was a man who juggled badminton racquets. He started with three and then went all the way to five. It was quite a display. His partner then came on while juggling bowling pins. They then did a routine where they tossed bowling pins back and forth.
11. Then there was a display of acrobatic swordsmanship. The swordsmen flew around the stage slashing the air with their blades.
12. The following display was one of puppetry, as a woman came on with a large witch-like figure. The puppeteer deftly changed the colour of the puppet’s face while rocking back and forth to music.
13. The final act was a dance of the jasmine flowers, where about ten women danced to classic Chinese music before producing mock jasmine flowers. It was a calm, beautiful way to end the evening.
