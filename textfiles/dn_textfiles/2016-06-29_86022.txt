Kyrgios loses cool, wins on Wimbledon return

LONDON, TUESDAY: Nick Kyrgios was back in trouble on his return to Wimbledon as the Australian rowed with umpire Mohamed Lahyani and told his entourage to get out during a stormy 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (9/11), 6-1 win over Czech veteran Radek Stepanek on Tuesday.
Kyrgios has earned a reputation as one of the most volatile players on the men's tour after a series of distasteful antics, including briefly appearing to stop trying during his Wimbledon defeat against Richard Gasquet last year.
The temperamental 21-year-old, who was hit with a $2,000 fine for swearing during the same last 16 clash with Gasquet, lost his cool yet again on his first return to the All England Club since that meltdown 12 months ago.
He was warned for bad language by Lahyani following an audible rant that included telling his support team to stop watching him after he lost the third set.
Despite his latest petulant display, Kyrgios insisted he provided great entertainment for fans. “The crowd likes the way I play here, I entertain. I'm comfortable here and they know the tennis I bring every day,” he said. “I knew I had to be on my game, I couldn't lapse at all. It was a tough match.”
Kyrgios has struggled to stay out of trouble through his career, so there was plenty of attention on the world number 18 when he strolled onto Court AFP
