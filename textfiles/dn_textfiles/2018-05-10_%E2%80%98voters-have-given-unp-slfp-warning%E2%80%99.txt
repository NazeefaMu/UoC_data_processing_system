‘Voters have given UNP, SLFP, a warning’

Voters gave a warning signal to the UNP as well as the SLFP at the last election. If we fail to learn a lesson from that signal they will send us home at the next election without any other warning, Anuradhapura District UNP Parliamentarian Ishak Rahuman said.
He was addressing a meeting to mark the inauguration of rehabilitation work on the playground at the Katukeliyawa Muslim Primary School yesterday.
Rahuman said the people voted the yahapalanaya government to power with great faith and expectations. The President, Prime Minister and other Ministers and Parliamentarians alleged that some of their own party members were preventing them from doing service to the people. Sixteen members who resorted to that tactic had now left the government.
Rahuman said he would make one request from the President: to develop schools and roads in Anuradhapura district with equal emphasis as he gave the Polonnaruwa district, since he was considered the undisputed leader of Raja Rata.
He said the government had another two years to complete its tenure. “We could march forward and win the next election too, if we act fast to fulfil the election pledges held out to the people, during the balance term.”
