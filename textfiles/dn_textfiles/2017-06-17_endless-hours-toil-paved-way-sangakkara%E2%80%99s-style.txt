Endless hours of toil paved way for Sangakkara’s style

In a beautiful piece in these pages three weeks ago, Michael Henderson wrote about watching Kumar Sangakkara score a hundred at Lord’s on the day the great Sri Lankan’s portrait was unveiled there.
The piece was as lyrical as Sangakkara’s batting, and Henderson nailed his colours firmly to the mast: “Style, no less than statistical achievement, counts for something in any estimation of greatness.”
He compared Sangakkara with Jacques Kallis, the South African all-rounder, one of only a handful of men to have scored more Test runs, and his considered view was that anyone still in retention of their marbles would not watch the robotic Kallis before the elegant Sangakkara. “Some folk may exist,” he wrote, “but they are usually to be found muttering to themselves on buses.” Henderson is not among their number.
Has appreciation of sport become more utilitarian in recent times? Possibly, and possibly because of the professionalisation of sport, which glorifies the ends over the means. Maybe, too, because of the growth of data as a method of validation. Tom Harrison, chief executive of the ECB, was picked up for his comments earlier in the season about his desire to see the England team prioritising style over substance precisely because it is so unusual to hear that message in modern sport, where the bottom line counts for everything. The glory game has become just a game.
For myself, a key element in assessing greatness is the element of risk. I recall talking to John Woodcock, the former cricket correspondent of this newspaper, about great batsmen and agreeing with his assessment that the greats took calculated risks to subjugate bowlers. It is not enough to wear them down, Boycott-style. His was a plea to Joe Root not to change his jaunty, optimistic way of playing, and he hoped that the captaincy would not burden him unduly. We shall see.
By any and every estimation — pure numbers, ease on the eye, or the ability to take calculated risks to win matches — Sangakkara is a great player, having made bundles of runs in all conditions, all around the world. On Tuesday, playing for Surrey again after a stint in the commentary box, he added another notch to a bedpost scarred with statistical milestones when he scored the 100th hundred of his professional career — 61 of them in first-class cricket and 39 in list A (one-day) cricket. It is not the ultimate hundreds milestone to celebrate, like the one achieved most recently, and possibly for the last time, by Mark Ramprakash, whereby all 100 were made in first-class cricket.
The changing nature of the calendar means that the modern player will have less chance of emulating the 24 other players who achieved what Ramprakash did, but nevertheless Sangakkara’s achievement is noteworthy, especially as it was in a winning cause.
But enough of the numbers, it is the style and elegance, the rhythm and flow of his batting that is under analysis here. Don’t for one minute think because he makes batting look easy, that it is easy. For an indication of the amount of toil and sweat that goes into making batting look that easy, let’s turn to Paul Farbrace, now England’s assistant coach, formerly coach of Sri Lanka.
Farbrace tells a story about his time working with Sri Lanka. How, during a net session, Sangakkara had asked the coach a question about the movements of his back foot before a ball was bowled. In practice, Sangakkara was very particular about his back foot, wanting it to move across from middle and leg stump to middle and off stump. Not back and across, mind, nor forward — just across.
Farbrace hadn’t been watching closely enough and fobbed Sangakkara off with a vague reply, based on the way Sangakkara had been hitting balls nicely in the middle of the bat, the kind of reply that he hoped would pass unnoticed.
Sangakkara later gave him a ticking off: Farbrace, he knew, had not been honest with him about where his foot was moving and had not been watching carefully enough. It was time to sharpen up. It is a small anecdote that tells you a lot about what has made Sangakkara successful: a constant drive, determination and desire to improve, minute attention to detail and a willingness to work endlessly on technique in practice so that, come the match, a more natural, flowing and rhythmical player could emerge and flourish.
Years before, Sangakkara had made that small change to his back-foot movement, from back and across to simply across. It had taken him six to eight months of solid practice before it had become ingrained and natural, so that his foot would move into position, in other words, without conscious thought.
For Sangakkara, rhythm and flow is everything but flow only comes as a result of unconscious rather than conscious thought.
This insight was gleaned from him by another writer in this parish, Simon Hughes, who, remarkably for a useless batsman, wrote an insightful book on batting. In it, he quotes Sangakkara’s principles of batsmanship: “I don’t want to go in to bat worrying about technique because technique is something that is a base, but when you are playing that has to disappear — you’ve got to be instinctive, reactive, unthinking.
“The moment you see technique obviously in someone who’s batting, I think that’s when someone’s not really flowing. When everything is flowing, you don’t see technique, you see style, you see grace, and you see timing. That’s what I work towards.
“I don’t want to be fiddling or worrying about where my backlift is going, or whether my foot is going to the ball, or how balanced I am. I just want that flow . . . everything has to be instinctive in the match. The moment you think, it slows you down.”
The flow and elegance is what so beguiled Henderson that day at Lord’s, and so beguiled the folk at Headingley this week, as he added another hundred to his tally. Rhythm, flow, elegance, style. All earned, though, through hours of sweat and toil. When batting looks as easy as that, you can be sure it is an illusion.
Tongue in cheek it might have been, but Darren Lehmann’s parting quip about only learning from England when they have won a World Cup carried an important truth: when it comes to cricket, Australia think they have a monopoly on knowledge.
So when, two years ago during the previous home Ashes series, I heard a number of Australian players praising a foreign coach who had worked in Sydney for some time, my ears pricked up.
Since Australians tend to shower praise upon only their own kind, this was unusual enough to make a mental note and store it away.
The name of the coach? Chandika Hathurusingha, who had begun to broaden his coaching horizons with New South Wales as assistant coach to Trevor Bayliss after a stint in his homeland, Sri Lanka. He now coaches Bangladesh.Like many of the best coaches, Hathurusingha was a modest international player, a stodgy batsman and sometime medium-paced nagging bowler, someone who had to work hard to rise to the highest level and knew what it took to get the best out of his limited resources.
That is exactly what he has been doing with Bangladesh for the past three years, increasing their winning percentage from 29 to 56 in all one-day internationals, taking Test scalps from Sri Lanka and England, and increasing the respect with which they are held.
I’ve known him a long time, since we played against each other for our respective under-19 national teams in 1987. His softly spoken and gentle presence camouflages a keen cricket brain and determination to succeed. Underestimate Hathurusingha’s Bangladesh at your peril.
