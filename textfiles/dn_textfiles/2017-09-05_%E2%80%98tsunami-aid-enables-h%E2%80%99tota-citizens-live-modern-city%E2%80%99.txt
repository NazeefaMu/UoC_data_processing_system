‘Tsunami aid enables H’tota citizens to live in a modern city’

Rehabilitation work accomplished under the Tsunami aid scheme has enabled people of Hambantota to live in a modern city, said Parliamentarian and former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa.
He was addressing the gathering after opening the Ruhunu Udana Trade Exhibition and Fair jointly organised by the Hambantota Chamber of Commerce and the Hambantota Trade Fair at the Hambantota Beach Park, recently.
Chamal Rajapaksa said the founder of the Hambantota Chamber of Commerce Azmi Thassim is now serving as the Sri Lanka Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
The Chamber set up by him has been rendering a great service to the business community in Hambantota. The Hambantota Port, which is now in operation, would boost exports from the region, including industrial products. The Hambantota Women’s Development Association today had a membership of 77,000 and their savings in Janashakthi Banks had reached Rs. 1 billion. There were signs of Hambantota becoming the most economically developed district in the country. Hambantota District Chamber of Commerce President Hemantha Padmalal also spoke.
