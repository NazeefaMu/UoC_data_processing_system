GARBAGE PILED UP AT SEVERAL AREAS IN COLOMBO

Tonnes of rotting garbage have piled up at several areas in Colombo, following the collapse of the main garbage dump in Meetotamulla last Friday,resulting in the deaths of over 30 people. Residents in the alternative areas chosen for garbage dumping including Karadiyana and Dompe staged protests hampering the waste disposal efforts of the authorities. Following the collapse of Meetotamulla garbage dump the government decided that garbage from Colombo would be disposed of at several sites including Karadiyana and Dompe.
