Gravel roads in Addalaichenai undergoing renovations

The renovation of several gravel roads including the Addalaichenai beach road, under projects funded by the Addalaichenai Pradeshiya Sabha, were implemented in the Addalaichenai DS division recently for the benefit of residents of rural areas.
The beach road, which has not been repaired for a long time, has large pot holes which turn into mud puddles on rainy days, inconveniencing motorists and pedestrians.
Affected villagers had urged authorities to take steps to construct the dilapidated beach road and the Pradeshiya Sabha Secretary had taken immediate action for the renovation.
Residents thanked Addalaichenai Pradeshiya Sabha Secretary M. I. M. Fais for the renovation projects.
Meanwhile, the Addalaichenai Fathima Islamic College road in the Addalaichenai Divisional Secretariat Division, is being reconstructed into a concrete road. The project was initiated by Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen and is currently in progress.
The minister has allocated a sum of Rs.03 million for construction of the first stage, sources said.
Thousands farm families in the several paddy land condoms are benefited by this.
