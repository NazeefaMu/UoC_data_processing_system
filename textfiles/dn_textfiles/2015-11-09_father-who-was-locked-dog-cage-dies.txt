Father who was locked in dog cage dies

The father who was locked in a dog cage by his daughter and later rescued by the police last month has passed away while receiving treatment at the Kandy Hospital.
The father was earlier put in care of an elder’s home by the Kandy Magistrate after the police rescued him from the dog cage. It was reported that the daughter, a 42 year old locked her own father in a dog cage while her three dogs and their pups slept in beds. The police arrested the daughter and presented her in Court.
According to the police, the woman who was an only child had locked her 73 year old father in a dog cage for several years. The suspect had been living with her father, two children and a pack of foreign breed dogs, while her mother and husband were abroad.
