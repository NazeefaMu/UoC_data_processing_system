Over 130 fever patients admitted to national hospital daily

Seventy one with dengue hemorrhagic fever:
About 356 dengue patients are receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital. Seventy one patients are with dengue hemorrhagic fever, Director Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
According to Dr. Jasinghe, between 135 and 150 fever patients get admitted to the hospital daily. Dengue patients receive treatment in 15 wards. They were provided with 25 folding beds. Another 25 folding beds will be provided to more dengue patients, he said.
Jasinghe said there is a decrease in hospital admissions for other diseases because patients try to avoid hospital admission due to the high number of dengue patients at the hospital. Hospital admission of dengue patients has been minimised because of limited facilities to obtain blood reports within 30 minutes. Patients get admitted to the hospital after considering their blood count and clinical status, he said.
He said the capacity of the hospital was increased to accommodate more dengue patients and allocate a cubicle with eight beds for every ward for dengue patients. A nurse with specialised training manages the cubicle, he said.
Two beds from each cubicle function as High Dependency Unit with facilities for monitoring and managing serious patients, Jasinghe said.
