E-bike sector needs adequate exposure - Chrysantha Fernando

The e-bike sector in Sri Lanka needs adequate exposure to pick up pace in growth, said Managing Director, Eco Trans Lanka Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd, Chrysantha Fernando.
He said that Electric vehicles are exactly what the doctor has ordered as the best economical mode of travelling as fuel prices are still high all over the world. “Globally people are switching from fuel to electric vehicles including electric motorcycles but it is slow to happen in Sri Lanka.”
He said that it was to breach this gap in Sri Lanka that Eco Trans Lanka Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd., under the trade mark of ELECTRA Electric Bikes has imported and marketed various types of electric motorcycles to Sri Lanka that can be used specially for town running.
E-Bikes were introduced to the roads to help out the people commute more economically. When it comes to fuel costs, petroleum based motorbikes costs much more per kilometer than an electric bike which only costs just a mere 0.50 cents per km. Electric Scooty types also have no noise, no vibrations, no smoke and no heat; making it very eco-friendly and cost effective option that also helps you contribute towards the protection of the environment. Furthermore, maintenance costs for E bikes are at a minimum.
“We import e-bikes from China and marketed from our show room in Pelawatte Junction in Battaramulla. Eco Trans also imports tricycles of various models, bikes for disabled , delivery bikes, Electra Go Go Light weight range E Bikes with 40-60 km range Lithium Batteries.”
He said that with the high global fuel prices the demand and requirement of electric scooters and motorbikes are now increasing.
He however said that people are still on two minds whether to switch to electric bikes due to several importers of Eclectic bikes shutting down their operations leaving the customer on cross roads without an agent to obtain spears and after sales services.
However, Eco Trans Lanka Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd which commenced its business in 2017 has made unhindered progress and the main reasons for this are the superior quality of the bikes that are imported, the flawless and prompt after sales services and the good word of satisfied customers that send new clients to the company.
The Company says despite the sluggish pace in growth in the e-motorbike segment in Sri Lanka, currently at around 2%, will see a gradual and rapid growth in the years to come. “Slow but steadily the e-bike segment will grow and overtake the fuel powered two wheelers in Sri Lanka making it the preferred mode of transportation in the island very soon.”
These electric –powered models do not compromise on performance, with speeds ranging from a maximum of 40 kmph to 60 kmph and it also covers distances between 50 to 100 km, per charge.
The Electric Bikes manufactures uses high quality material and uses high grade main frame and other parts that are long lasting.
The e-bikes at Eco Trans are powered by Lithium and Lead Acid Batteries with test results showing a more powerful thrust than the normal average one. The changed front shape also provides more space for the Rider’s legs, which will help reduce leg injuries in crashes.
One of the major advantages of the e-bike is that it is emission- free, which would help achieve climate change-related emission targets.
Fernando said that he had a passion to do something unique for the country when he saw foreign exchange bleeding to import fuel based vehicles and then for heavy toll of spare parts and also the environmental pollution and had decided to find a solution for the burning issue. “This is how I moved to the import of E bikes,” he said.
