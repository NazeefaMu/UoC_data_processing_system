GTL seeks two weeks to hand  over company details to CID

Filing a motion, President’s Counsel Shavendra Fernando appearing on behalf of the Global Transportation and Logistics Private Limited company (GTL) yesterday, sought a further two-week period to hand over their company details to the CID.
Fernando made this submission regarding the magisterial inquiry into an allegation that MP Karunanayake had provided false evidence before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Appointed to Investigate into the Treasury Bond Issue was taken up before Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
Earlier, Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake, decided to issue an order permitting the CID to investigate into several documents pertaining to Global Transportation and Logistics Private Limited, owned by former Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Meanwhile the Chief Magistrate observed that there is no legality to name MP Ravi Karunanayake as a suspect at this juncture, since investigations against him have not been concluded.
The Chief Magistrate ordered the GTL Company to hand over the relevant documents before October 29 and the case would be taken up again on October 22.
