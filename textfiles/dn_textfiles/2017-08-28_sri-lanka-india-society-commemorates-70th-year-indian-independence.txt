Sri Lanka-India Society commemorates 70th year of Indian independence

The Sri Lanka-India Society held their 70th Indian independence day celebrations amidst a distinguished gathering of invitees at Taj Samudra on August 19. Minister of Special Assignments Dr. Sarath Amunugama was the chief guest, while the guest of honour was Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu. Suboroto Bagchi, world renowned business author and much-admired entrepreneur who co-founded Mindtree, a $ 500 million global IT service company with over 15,000 employees, was the keynote speaker.
Sri Lanka-India Society President T. S. Prakash welcomed the dignitaries and gave a brief overview of activities of the Society.
In his speech, Dr. Sarath Amunugama recalled the deep ties of cultural heritage shared commonly by the two countries. Dr Amunugama highlighted the similarities between the two national anthems and the connection with Rabindranath Tagore. He narrated many interesting anecdotes that signified the strong relationship between India and Sri Lanka. Addressing the audience, High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu said that the India of 2017 was very different from India a decade ago; with 50 percent of its population under 25 years, India is unleashing the forces of innovation, enterprise and growth.
He also stressed upon the close links between the two countries in recent history with the momentous visit of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the chief guest for International Vesak Day. The High Commissioner elaborated on initiatives undertaken in economic and political spheres, including humanitarian assistance during recent floods. He highlighted that India’s development assistance of over US$ 2.6 billion reflects the commitment Prime Minister Modi has towards our closest neighbour—Sri Lanka. He encouraged citizens of both countries to work together in harmony, quoting Mahatma Gandhi.
In his keynote address, Subroto Bagchi outlined the exceptional leadership qualities displayed by historic figures such as Moses, William Wallace and Mahatma Gandhi throughout the centuries, harping on the relevance of such qualities in the 21st century as well.
Cultural performances added colour to the event. Ever since its inception, the Sri Lanka-India Society has played a stellar role in building greater harmony and unity between Sri Lankan and Indian people.
