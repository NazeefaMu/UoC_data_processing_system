Because you are Irreplaceable

Every 40 seconds, a human life is taken by suicide, according to World Health Organization data. The projected global suicide rate for the year 2020 is one in every 20 seconds. Suicide has now become a silent epidemic that ruins lives and devastates families and communities. It is now among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15 to 44 years. More male suicide deaths are reported while more females attempt.
Suicide, or ending one’s own life, is a tragic event with strong emotional repercussions for its survivors and for the families of its victims. In 1995, the WHO placed Sri Lanka among the countries that had the highest rates of suicide. However, since then suicide rate has greatly reduced from an alarmingly high rate of 47 per 100,000 population in 1995 to a rate of 16 (police statistics 2010). At present an average of 12 persons die by suicide in Sri Lanka every day.
“In Sri Lanka harassment by the spouse and family disputes was the most common reason in 2014 while matters associated with love affairs ranked the second. Chronic diseases and physical disabilities, underlying mental illness, economic reasons were the next common underlying factors for suicidal deaths according to the police reports,” Director Mental Health, Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Dr. Chithramalee de Silva said.
According to statistics of Sri Lanka Police the most popular method of committing suicide is hanging. In 2017, 1,508 males self harmed themselves by hanging while female deaths stood at 306. Consuming pesticide is the other mode commonly used by these persons.
“Some mental health conditions like depression, schizophrenia, substance use disorders are major recognized risk factors for suicides and addressing these risk factors will result in suicide reduction. Many suicides are the result of an impulsive act, therefore identifying the persons who are at high risk and attending to their psychological, physical, mental and socioeconomic needs is of paramount importance,” Dr. de Silva explained.
Suicide prevention
Sri Lanka’s recent decreasing suicide trend could be the result of national strategies instigated in the mid-1990s, which include: de-criminalizing of suicide, which eliminated the stigma attached to the psychological condition, restricting access to poisonous chemicals and assigning more medical officers with mental health training to provincial hospitals to provide psychiatric support.
However Dr. de Silva says those who attempted suicide or died of suicide and their families experience considerable stigma, and may not seek care which in turn affects the mental health of survivors and their families. “Therefore, those who attempted suicide and their family members require continued support from health care providers for long periods of time as they face enormous difficulties in leading their life,” she added.
Although the number of deaths by suicide has reduced gradually, the number of attempts which is 10 to 20 times more is steadily on the rise. This clearly indicates that there is still an acute national need to help those who need emotional support.
She recommends encouraging good social support for adolescents, youth and elderly who are at a higher risk, good parenting care especially for young persons, educational reforms with student friendly education system, establishing counselling services in schools, community and work places, establishing hotlines for counselling, educating identified gatekeepers like police, teachers, health professionals for suicide prevention, further restricting the easy access to means of suicides (safe storage of pesticides, chemicals and drugs at both individual and community levels) and strengthening good marital relationships as few actions to minimize suicides.
“Suicides are preventable and require coordinated and sustained effort from multiple sectors of the society, both public and private, including health and non-health sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, industry, Justice, Law, defence, politics and the media,” Dr. De Silva emphasised.
Role of media
Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Kothalawela Defence University’s Senior Lecturer, Dr. Neil Fernando said Sri Lanka is one of the few countries that possess a suicide prevention policy.
“Presidential Task Force recommendations include reducing the availability of pesticides, reducing the lethality of pesticide, improve the quality of healthcare, changing the attitude of people, promoting mental health and responsible media reporting,” Dr. Fernando said.
“Media can play an effective proactive role in suicide prevention by minimizing the prominence given to suicide reports, informing public about sources of help and emergency helpline numbers, encouraging people to take action and seek care, conveying positive stories of people who have overcome suicidal thoughts and ideations,” he added.
Risk of additional suicides increases when the story explicitly describes the suicide method, uses dramatic/graphic headlines or images, and repeated and extensive coverage sensationalizes or glamorizes a death. Suicide Contagion, or “Copycat Suicide,” occurs when one or more suicides are reported in a way that contributes to another suicide.
Covering suicide carefully can change public misperceptions and correct myths, which can encourage those who are vulnerable or at risk to seek help.
“I think the Lake House group of newspapers has taken a policy decision not to report suicide which is very commendable. Not sensationalizing stories on suicide and not giving a heroic status is vital in reporting. Instead media should emphasize the usefulness of life and use investigative journalism when reporting suicide and contribute positively in suicide prevention,” Dr. Fernando explained.
Talking Helpers
To achieve this mammoth task of preventing the loss of gift of life help lines such as Sumithrayo and CCC line puts in there valuable service.
“At Sumithrayo we are aware that there seems to be a surge in attempts of self harm and deaths by suicide in Sri Lanka. Relationship issues, exams and other social pressures that result in lowering of self esteem, mental illness and the stigma that surrounds it, a steep rise in alcohol and other drug addictions are the leading causes. Sumithrayo was the first ever crisis centre in Sri Lanka when it was set up in 1974. We continue to work silently in helping people cope with distress, despair and hopelessness,” volunteer at Sumithrayo, Jomo Uduman said.
He explained that the organisation has realised the importance of going out from the centre to spread awareness in suicide prevention. “We regularly visit schools, factories and offices for suicide prevention programmes. It is very important that the media publishes contact details of help lines at the end of a suicide report. This will help others who are reading it and vulnerable to seek help and understand that there are other options than suicide,” he added.
Support system
Uduman says everybody has gone through these feelings and moments of hopelessness. “What have helped some of us are our coping skills and more importantly the support system we had around to help us cope and come through. Coping and problem solving skills can also evolve biologically and some are lucky to be born with resilience and courage but if coping skills are difficult to hold onto and there is no support system then the pain will become harder to bear.
Many live in an environment where it is a constant battle to cope. They must then depend on family, teachers and friends to teach them these skills but what if nobody has the time to teach or reach out to them?”, Uduman queried.
He said often such people are labeled, targeted and sidelined. They become vulnerable and prone to emotional pain and thoughts that can lead to self harming. Experts now recognize the importance of emotional intelligence which is – the ability to recognize, understand and manage our own emotions and recognize, and understand the emotions of others.
Uduman feels if emotional intelligence can also be a subject in all schools it can help children learn and understand coping skills early in life to deal with those difficult feelings when they come along.
“Suicide is still a very serious issue in our country. In Sri Lanka, on an average, 10-12 persons die by suicide every single day of the year and for each person who dies by suicide at least 10 others fail in their attempt to end their life. This figure can be much more as it is very difficult to monitor attempts of self harm. So you are looking at least 110 people choosing suicide /self harm as an option to end their pain each day. 110/day is 40,000 per year,” he emphasized.
“Suicide is a complex problem for which there is no single cause or single reason. There is no simple explanation for why someone chooses to die by suicide and it is rarely due to one particular factor. Mental health problems are important influences, as well as alcohol and substance misuse, feeling desperate, helpless or without hope as well as impulsiveness. People who have self-harmed or made a serious attempt at suicide in the past are more likely to do so again, and are therefore at much greater risk of dying by suicide in the future. Taking a minute to reach out to someone – a complete stranger or close family member or friend – can change the course of their life. As members of communities, it is our responsibility to look out for those who may be struggling, check in with them, and encourage them to tell their story in their own way and at their own pace,” Uduman added.

Courage Compassion Commitment
CCC line 1333 established by the Courage Compassion Commitment (CCC) Foundation in partnership with Lifeline in Australia and the National Institute of Mental Health in Angoda, Sri Lanka is another organisation which aims to prevent suicide in Sri Lanka through education, engagement and empowerment to break the stigma attached to mental illness and social issues.
CCC line Manger, Ranil Tillakaratne along with clinical psychologist Nivendra Uduman and the vibrant undergraduate in psychology Sara Nazoor is currently involved in ‘Footsteps to Freedom’ - 72-day walk, covering a distance of 1460 kilometres along the coastline of Sri Lanka, conducting workshops and distributing material including significant and useful information on how people can recognise a mental health problem and support each other on a very basic level until professional help is sought.
“Since its inception in December 2009, CCC line 1333 has been steadily moving forward towards its goal of being a credible, accessible and most utilised telephone counselling service in Sri Lanka. CCC line 1333 is a confidential and free telephone counselling service to encourage people to talk about their problems whether they are personal, relationship or family issues, schools or work worries, mental illness or suicide thoughts. CCC line’s 1333 short code number is a toll free number accessible to all people of Sri Lanka. The service currently averages over 2,000 calls every month,” Tillakaratne said.
“We are passionate about this walk because information does not go out to remote areas. People don’t know that these services are available in Sri Lanka. They don’t know where to go to seek help. They don’t know how to identify someone who has a mental health problem; if a family member or friend is on the verge of suicide they are unaware. We want to change that,” he added.
The walk which commenced on April 1 will continue till June 12 with a series of planned and unplanned awareness raising sessions that will be held in organisations and schools as well as tea shops, bus stands and smaller village community gatherings throughout the period.
CCC line 1333 Telephone Counsellors are trained under the guidance of Lifeline Australia, the largest telephone counselling service in Australia.
Depression can come in any form and it should never be underestimated. Take a minute, talk a minute and help save precious life around you.
