Customs nabs foreigner with 1,70,000 Euros

Bandaranaike International Airport Customs arrested a foreigner who was about to leave the country carrying 1,70,000 Euros. The suspect is said to have been working on the Teheran-funded USD 450-million Uma Oya Irrigation Project.
He was arrested at the airport on Monday.
Customs Spokesman D Kahandawa said the suspect was arrested as he was trying to board on flight QR 655 to leave for Doha. Sri Lanka Customs sleuths found the foreign money (around SLR Rs 29 million) from his hand luggage.
The suspect was at the Airport Customs detention at the time this story went to press yesterday evening. Kahandawa said they had lunched a Customs inquiry into the incident.
The suspect had told the Customs he was carrying other people’s money in connection with the project to Doha, he said.
