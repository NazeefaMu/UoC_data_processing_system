Whiteley’s six sixes in an over in vain

Worcestershire’s Ross Whiteley hit six sixes in an over in a losing effort as they went down by 37 runs to Yorkshire at Headingley in the T20 Blast on Sunday.
David Willey made 118 off 55 balls, the highest T20 score by a Yorkshire batsman, as they totalled 233-6.
And although Whiteley hit six maximums in an over from Karl Carver that also contained a wide, Willey bowled him for 65 as they fell short on 196-7.
There were also wins for Warwickshire, Lancashire and Somerset. And there was a tie between Sussex and Kent at Hove, where the home side were asked to chase a rain-reduced target of 88 off eight overs and ended on 87-3 when Laurie Evans was run out off the final ball of the game.
The South Group matches between Hampshire and Surrey, and Glamorgan and Essex, were both abandoned without a single ball being bowled.
