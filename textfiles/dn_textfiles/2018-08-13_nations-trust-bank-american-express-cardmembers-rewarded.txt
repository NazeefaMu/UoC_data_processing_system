Nations Trust Bank  American Express  Cardmembers rewarded

Nations Trust Bank American Express Card is the ideal travel companion affording you savings of up to 40% at selected Cinnamon Resorts.
Speaking about the promotion, Niluka Gunathilake, Head of Cards, Nations Trust Bank said, “With busy and hectic lives in the city, it’s easy to forget that we are blessed to be living in an island paradise. Thus, we thought that an excellent way to reward our Cardmembers would be to provide them with savings at some of Sri Lanka’s best resorts so that they can experience all of the wonders that Sri Lanka has to offer.Being an island paradise means that memorable holidays are always only a few hours awayand we wanted to encourage our Cardmembers to take the opportunity to see our wonderful country and create lifelong memories. July and August are also the time when school holidays are on and families can take the time to go on vacation and therefore this promotion is timely for our cardmembers.”
