Love and Chrysanthemums

Once upon a time (not so long ago) lived a Prince in the Land of the Rising Sun who searched in vain for a bride. “I’m probably going to challenge Prince Charles for the gold medal in marrying late,” the heir to the throne complained on his 32nd birthday. Finally, the prince sought his mother, the queen’s advice. The all-knowing queen, who could see into the deepest depths of her eldest son’s heart simply told him, “You must follow your feelings and marry Masako Owada.”
Crown Prince Naruhito, the bachelor prince, had met Masako at a banquet in Tokyo. While the prince immediately fell in love with her, Masako harboured doubts about her feelings for the prince, especially as her marriage to the Prince would mark the end of her career in the Foreign Ministry. There were other obstacles to the marriage, too. A Crown Princess, by Japanese tradition, must come from an aristocratic family, be under 25, and have never had a previous romantic relationship.
The 29-year-old daughter of a diplomat did not fit these first two requirements, and the press roared with speculations on the third. Masako’s life in the US and her education at Harvard and Oxford universities also came under scrutiny.
But love prevailed. On June 9 1993, as a soft drizzle fell on the leaves of the trees showering them with tiny drops of water deep in the woods of the imperial palace, the Crown Prince Naruhito married Masako Owada in a quiet ceremony, inside the Kashikodokoro shrine. It is believed that the shrine inside which three other royal couples had exchanged their marriage vows in the last century, contains the spirit of Amaterasu the Sun Goddess, who, according to legend, began the imperial line.
That morning, court ladies had dressed Masako in the formal bridal array, or juni-hitoe - literally a “12-layered garment,” (a 30-pound silk kimono) that cost more than $300,000. Her hair was coiffed in classic style, with long, artificial strands added down her back.
The Japanese tiara she wore had played a previous role in another important imperial wedding: the 1959 marriage of Michiko Shoda to Crown Prince Akihito, today the Emperor and Empress, and Prince Naruhito’s parents. Made of white stones, mostly diamonds with some pearls, the tiara is a large diadem in an exaggerated scroll design, and includes a perfectly matched necklace.
In an inner sanctuary of the shrine, in the presence of a few attendants: the palace’s white-robed chief spiritualist, a chamberlain bearing the centuries-old sword representing the crown prince; a court lady and a priestess - the prince, who was dressed in brilliant garb from the Hein era representing the rising sun, was presented with a sacred sprig. He then read a pledge of loyalty and love to his future wife. In the hushed silence, out of view of television cameras, the two drank the sacred sake. Thus, the graduate from Harvard, the former diplomat of the Foreign Ministry who spoke five languages and had a Yorkshire terrier called Chocolate, renounced her former life to become Her Imperial Highness The Crown Princess of Japan.
That evening, the heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne and his bride took a 30-minute ride through the streets of Tokyo to take up residence at the Prince’s palace. The day was followed by three days of banquets.
So happy was the prince, he composed a poem for the beautiful woman he loved and courted for six years, who was now his wife.
“I gaze with delight
As the flock of cranes takes flight
Into the blue skies
The dream cherished in my heart
Since my boyhood has come true”
- Aditha
