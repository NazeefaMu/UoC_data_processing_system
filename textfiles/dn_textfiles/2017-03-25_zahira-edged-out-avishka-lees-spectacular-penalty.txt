Zahira edged out by Avishka Lee's spectacular penalty

A spectacular 35-metre touch line penalty put over by scrum half Avishka Lee enabled Wesley College to beat Zahira College by 32 points (4 tries, 3 conversions, 2 penalties) to 29 (4 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) in their Singer ‘A’ division inter-schools league rugby first round match played at Longden Place yesterday. Zahira led 15-10 at half time.
Wesley dished out a superb brand of running rugby and gave a torrid time to Zahira with their three quarters with the help and guidance of their newly appointed coaching staff of New Zealander Paul Toia, Dulanjana Wijesinghe and Mohamad Sheriff right through the entire match. This really made the difference for Wesley to pull this game off in their favour.
Zahira went into the lead with winger Uzran Lantra scoring two tries and fly half Said Sinhawansa converting one of them and following up with a penalty. Wesley cut down the lead with a try scored by hooker Zain Doole. Lee converted the try and also put over a penalty just before half time.
At half time the score read 15-10 in favour of Zahira.
After the break Wesley grabbed the lead and made it 17-15 with a try by Lee who also made the conversion. Zahira grabbed the lead once more with Lantra scoring his third try under the post and Sinhawansa doing the conversion to take the score to 22-17.
Lee then scored a try and his twin brother Avishka Lee put over the conversion and Wesley went into a 24-22 lead. Wesley increased their lead to 29-22 with a unconverted try scored by flanker Imesh Aponso.
Zahira made it 29-all when centre Razik scored under the post with Sinhawansa making no mistake with the conversion.
Wesley sealed the match in the 77th minute of play when Avishka put over a sensational 35 metre touch line penalty to take the score to 32-29.
In the very last minute of the game referee awarded a 25-metre penalty to Zahira but to the utter dismay of their fans, Sinhawansa fluffed it and Wesley emerged victorious. Referee: Dinka Peiris
