Food poisoned guests admitted in hospital

Over one hundred invitees to a wedding banquet at Eravur have been admitted to the Eravur Base Hospital Since November 24 due to complaints of food allergies.
Medical officer of Eravur Hospital S. A. C. M. Faleel said that the people admitted are complaining of giddiness, gripe and diarrhea. The 100 persons including 25 children and 18 females are being treated and sent home in batches. The allergic condition is supposed to have originated from a chicken buriyani lunch served at the wedding house.
The food had been prepared in the house of a cook and when the Regional Senior Health Officer S. Pulendrakumar visited the house, he was unable to obtain any sample of the food.
