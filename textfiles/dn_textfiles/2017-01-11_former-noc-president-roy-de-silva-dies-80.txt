Former NOC president Roy de Silva dies at 80

Former National Olympic Committee chief Roy de Silva passed away on Monday afternoon in his hometown Kandy following a brief illness. Roy who turned 80 on October 8 was a gifted sportsman and promoter and a product of Kandy from a top public school Kingswood College.
Only a handful would remember the role played by officials to uplift sport. If it be so, the name of Roy de Silva’s name should never be forgotten in the field of sports and at the National Olympic Committee (NOC) level.
Roy is one of the finest sportsmen to come out of Kingswood College and also Kandy where he excelled at hockey, football, athletics and cricket. Hockey was his pet sport at school and even later. After leaving school, Roy played for Kandy Whites hockey team, and was an automatic choice for the Kandy District and Up-Country teams whenever they played against foreign sides. He also took to hockey umpiring and helped his school in coaching. At one time he was rated as one of the top umpires. Roy also played cricket as a right-arm spinner for Kandy United S.C. along with Dr. C.D.L. Fernando, M.E. Marikar, Bertie Gomes and Mervyn Berenger. He was also a fine cueist and famous in billiards.
Later, Roy took to administration, and was the secretary of the Kandy District Hockey Association for ten years, under the watchful eyes of late M. S. Jainudeen. From Kandy he was elected as the president of the Sri Lanka Hockey Federation, and held the post from 1979 to 1998. During his term of office, the women’s national hockey championship was introduced and a Cup was presented by him. It is now held annually. He also had the rare privilege of being the vice president of the Asian Hockey Federation from 1979 to 1983.
Roy was elected as vice president of the NOC in 1979 and held the post till he became president in 1983. He was president for 14 years, which is a record. He was elected to the post of vice president of the Asian Olympic Council in 1986 and his finest moment came in 1990 when he was elected as the acting president of the Asian Olympic Council, and had the privilege of opening the 1990 Asian Games in China. He took the place of the then president of the Council, Sheikh Al Fahd Al Abah who was killed on the first day of the Kuwaiti invasion.
Roy also had the privilege of being in the finance committee of the Commonwealth Federation from 1990 to 1998 and was elected as the Life President of the SAF games in 1996. He is the first man from Kandy to take up the NOC president’s post, and he held it for 14 years.
He was one time president of the Kandy Cricket Club and later was president of Kandy District Cricket Association, where under him several international games were played in Kandy.
As president of the Kingswoodians Old Boys Union he presented a trophy in memory of the founder of the school L. E. Blaze, for the annual rugby match between Kingswood and Wesley. Now this encounter is famous in the school’s calendar.
Roy was a huge driving force towards the century old Kandy Club and was a member for 35 long years. He was a long serving president of the club for well over 14 years and the president during its 125th year. During his presidency six rooms were put up at the premises from which the club derives their main income. Only a handful of members are aware of this. Everybody feels a sense of loss with Roy’s passing, but there’s no need to be sad for him. We’re all going to make that trip.
Roy is survived by his wife Chandrika, a top hockey player and two sons Asitha and Chulantha. His cremation takes place at the Mahiyawa General Cemetery at 6.30 pm today.
