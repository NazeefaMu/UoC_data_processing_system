Undergrad arrested for debit card fraud

An undergraduate was arrested yesterday by the Peradeniya police for stealing a debit card of a first year female student and withdrawing Rs. 20,000 using the card.
The arrested is a second year student of the Arts Faculty of the Peradeniya University.
The female student had left her bag in a room to attend a lecture. The suspect had then stolen the A.T.M. card and withdrawn money from her account, the police investigation reveals.
The female student had complained to the university security since the ATM card pin code was also in her bag at the time of the theft.
The suspect was produced before the Kandy Magistrate and was released on a Rs. 5,000 surety bail.
