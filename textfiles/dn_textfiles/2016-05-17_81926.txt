Lowry stars as Raptors down Miami to make history

Los Angeles, Monday: Kyle Lowry is relishing the prospect of taking on LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers after leading the Toronto Raptors into the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in franchise history on Sunday.
Lowry scored 35 points as Toronto completed a 116-89 win over the Miami Heat to seal a 4-3 series victory -- and set up a showdown with James and the Cavs on Tuesday.
Toronto will start against Cleveland with the odds stacked against them, having battled through two marathon seven-game series to reach the conference finals.
Cleveland however head into Game One well rested after back-to-back 4-0 sweeps in the previous rounds.
Yet Lowry said he is looking forward to pitting his wits against the in-form James and the likes of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. “I’m looking forward to the opportunity to playing against those guys,” Lowry said. “LeBron is one of the best players in the league, Kyrie (Irving) is always a tough matchup, Kevin Love is always a tough matchup. But we’re going to go out there and play our game, try and do our job and see what happens.”
Raptors coach Dwane Casey says the challenge posed by Cleveland will be “another step for us” as his team chase the ultimate dream of an NBA Finals victory.
“I think we’ve done everything we set out to do, but again, we’re not done yet,” said Casey. “This group is hungry and never say never. I know one thing, our guys will compete.”
Lowry and teammate DeMar DeRozan stole the show as Toronto powered their way to a convincing victory in front of a raucous home crowd at Toronto’s Air Canada Centre. AFP
