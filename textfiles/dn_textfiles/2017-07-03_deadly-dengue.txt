Deadly dengue!

Community Physician, Dengue Control Unit of the Health Ministry Dr. Preshila Samaraweera speaks to T N' C about Dengue fever: symptoms, causes and treatments.
Q – When should people seek medical treatment for fever?
A – Ordinary people should seek medical treatment for fever from a qualified doctor or a hospital with a full blood Count Report in the second 24 hours from the onset of fever. The fever can be dengue.
But when it comes to the elderly, very young children, pregnant women, people who had undergone kidney transplant surgeries etc, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases etc. they should seek medical treatment for fever immediately. They should seek medical treatment during first 24 hours from the onset of fever because it can be dengue.
Q – What are the complications and how can they be avoided?
A - Medications such as Aspirin and Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) such as Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Diclofenac etc should not be taken. All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. No other medications, especially pain killers should be taken to control fever and body pain.
Q – What should be done if one contracts dengue a second or third time?
A - Earlier Dengue type 1 was reported from Sri Lanka, but this time it is type II. When a person who got infected with type I in the past gets type 11, the possibility of developing complications in them is higher than non infected person. Therefore it is better to seek medical treatment without delay with the history of the first dengue infection. The other issue is when the NS1 Report indicates as `Negative’ while the patient is suffering from Dengue Type II. Therefore it is advisable to get a full blood Count and the Dengue Antigen Test (NS1) done together without taking only a Full Blood Count Report.
Q – What are the traits in current dengue outbreak ?
A - The platelet count of the patients becomes very low after two days from the onset of fever. It is visible in many dengue patients who suffer from type II which is the current outbreak.
Q- How can we prevent dengue infection?
A - By wearing long sleeves / fully covered dresses during day time, applying mosquito repellents, house screening (windows and doors) to prevent entry of mosquitoes, keeping bedrooms, kitchen and toilets well-lit, ventilated and airy so that adult female mosquitoes cannot hide inside houses and mosquito breeding places (containers with collection of water) should be inspected and destroyed/removed regularly (at least once a week) for better environmental management.
Treatment Tips
* All fever patients are advised not to take any other medication except Paracetamol to control fever. Other medications can cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome. No home remedies should apply for fever.
* Medical treatment should be sought only from a qualified doctor, a state hospital or a private hospital.
* Mosquito repellents should be applied on the skin of the open parts of the body of children before sending them to the school.
