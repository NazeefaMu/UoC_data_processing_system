Citizens' Mail

Much ado about human rights organisations
We have many organisations. Engineers’ Associations, Medical Officers’ Associations, Accountants’ Associations and Lawyers’ Associations. We also have human rights organisations. Engineers’ organisations are normally concerned about the rights of engineers. Medical officers’ organisation mainly look after the rights of doctors.
In case of human rights organisations, they look after the human rights of all the people irrespective of their nationality, race, culture, religion, etc.
Many human rights organisations around the world dedicate their efforts protecting human rights and ending human rights abuses.
Amnesty International, Children’s Defense Fund, Human Rights Watch and Human Rights without Frontiers are some of the human rights organisations.
Basic human rights are basic rights and freedom that all people are entitled to regardless of nationality, sex, national or ethnic origin, race, religion, language or other status.
Right to marry and have a family.
Freedom of thought.
Freedom of expression.
Right to public assembly.
Right to democracy.
Social security.
Right to life.
Right to liberty and freedom.
Right to the pursuit of happiness.
Right to live your life free from discrimination, are some of the basic human rights.
Following are some human rights violations.
Sexual harassment.
Academic harassment.
Power harassment.
Conduct that uses status and position differential to place others at a disadvantage in their education, research or work.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards another in a spirit of brotherhood.
Human rights that do not apply to all are not human rights.
No one should be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment.
Freedom of speech, freedom from fear, freedom to vote, freedom from torture, freedom of choice, freedom from enslavement and freedom of religion are all human rights,
Let us support human rights organisations. Let us respect others’ human rights.
