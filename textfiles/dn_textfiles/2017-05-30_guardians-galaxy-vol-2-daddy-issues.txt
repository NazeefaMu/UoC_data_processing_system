Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 : Daddy issues

The newfound team’s adventures continue as they encounter Peter Quill’s father, Ego, in the ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2’. On surface despite being a celestial god, Ego seems to be the gentle and fatherly type but Gamora senses that he is keeping some skeletons in his closet.
It does not take long for her to prove her point when it comes to light hat Ego has spent millions of years planting seeds on different planets, which when activated become extensions of himself.
Star-lord is the first of Ego’s progeny to have his Celestial gene. And Ego plans to basically take over the universe. Now the Guardians have to save the galaxy a second time.
One of the greatest strengths in the movie is its ability to exist on own. It does not depend on the success of its predecessor to bring in the audience. The heroes too seem very human and have their weak points. There are exceptionally funny moments like those between Drax and Mantis. The moment when Mantis spills the beans about Peter’s feelings towards Gamora is comic especially with Drax guffawing in the background.
The really touching scenes come with Yondu’s farewell in which he risks his own life to save Peter. Here we realize that fatherly qualities do not come necessarily with blood ties. They emerge from actions which come from the heart.
Another plus for the movie lies in the characters. Writer and director James Gunn has created some unique characters to watch on screen. He uses clever and effective ploys to resonate with fans. For instance Rocket’s use of humour and insults as a defense mechanism for his own insecurities and Gamora’s tumultuous relationship with her sister, Nebula, is some of the features which capture and keep the audience engaged. Even Star-Lord’s clichéd realization that often what we want is right in front of us has been given a new life in the film.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 may not have much depth but it is really entertaining to watch. The greatest plus point is that Vol 2 succeeds on its own merit. Only a few films can boast about this feature.
