Sri Lanka Model United Nations 10th session at BMICH

The 10th session of the Sri Lanka Model United Nations will be held at the BMICH from September 2 - 4, with the participation of over 1,000 youth delegates from all over Sri Lanka.
The theme of the conference will be ‘Engaging the next generation.’
Sri Lanka Model United Nations (SLMUN) is the national MUN Conference and Asia's largest student run conference. The Executive Committee, who has been working diligently to make the event a success, held an introductory press conference at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute yesterday, presided by SLMUN Charge D'Affairs Rohan Ellawala.
“SLMUN wishes to educate the delegates in diplomacy, leadership and provide a platform to improve public speaking. With the world rapidly changing day by day, we would like to educate the delegates on global issues and different perspectives of nations on controversial subjects. We wish to let the youth open out their voices on these issues and unite and form means to resolute. We wish to see all of you this year at SLMUN 2017 to stand up and empathize with the perspectives of your countries as you speak up to the dream of a better future,” the Organizing Committee members said.
