President instructs to re-impose tax on beer

President Maithripala Sirisena instructed Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to increase the tax imposed on imported beer with less than 5 percent alcohol content, which was reduced in the budget proposals.
As a measure to remove tax discrepancy when importing beer, the Finance Minister reduced the tax on imported beer (less than 5 percent alcohol) from Rs. 190 to Rs. 160 per litre.
However, after considering the effect such a measure could have on the opportunities to promote such beer varieties, the President ordered the Finance Minister to increase the tax to its former status, the President’s Media Unit stated in a message.
