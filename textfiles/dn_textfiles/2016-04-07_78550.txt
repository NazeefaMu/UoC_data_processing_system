St Lucia's cricket ground named after Darren Sammy

 
ANTIGUA, WEDNESDAY - The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has honoured T20 captain Darren Sammy and opener Johnson Charles by naming the Beausejour Cricket Ground at St Lucia after them.
Sammy and Charles are both from St Lucia and the WICB announced that the Beausejour Cricket Ground will now be named the Darren Sammy National Cricket Ground and one of the stands will be named in Charles' honour.
Charles is also due to receive a plot of land.
"Both are fitting tributes to the hard work and dedication of the players who just completed an exciting victory to win the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 men's title," the WICB said in a media release.
Sammy was also captain of the 2012 team and makes the West Indies the only team to win the World T20 title twice.
"The honour is fitting and we salute the players." The announcement was made at a "welcome reception" in St Lucia by Prime Minister, Kenny D. Anthony on Tuesday.
