Sugar in Ceylon Tea
New laws to bring culprits to book: Gayantha
The government had realised the gravity of the situation where tea exporters were tarnishing Ceylon Tea's reputation and hence, the Plantations Minister was implementing new laws to punish those who were engaged in such malpractices, Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatillake said.
He was addressing Parliament, yesterday, in response to a question raised by MP Dayasiri Jayasekara.
MP Jayasekara questioned whether dyes, sugar or other flavours were added while drying and processing tea, and what measures had been taken to charge those who were engaged in such practices.
“Adding sugar to tea is a significant problem affecting the quality of our tea and around 53 tea factories were found to be engaged in this practice during a raid conducted last year. However, this had not been discontinued and due to that, it is the tea smallholders who suffer,” he said.
Jayasekara said that little action had been taken against errant factory employees; the matter was being looked into by a mediation board and the perpetrators were getting off scot-free. MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said that sugar and ferrous phosphate were being added to darken the colour of tea. Although raids were conducted to arrest errant factory workers through an initiative taken by the former Tea Board Chairman, there was no mechanism to punish the offenders.
“These factories earn millions; they can afford good lawyers. They find loopholes in the law to elude penalties. Hence, it is vital that we establish proper laws to punish such culprits,” he added.
Minister Gayantha Karunatillake said that the situation had affected genuine tea factories and was a major crisis faced by Sri Lanka's tea industry.
“If found guilty, registrations of factories the culprits are employed at would be temporarily suspended, and they would have to pay mediation board charges. In addition, with the powers vested in the tea commissioner, legal measures could be taken against the offenders. However, better laws are required to perfect the process,” he said.
MP Dayasiri Jayasekara said there were 600 tea factories in the country and of them, 53 were detected to have employees guilty of misconduct during last February's raids.
“Plantation Minister Navin Dissanayake assured that stern action would be taken, but nothing had been done. Further, the tea board chairman who initiated the raids had been replaced,” he added.
He asked as to when the government would take action against the wrongdoers. State Plantation Industries Minister A.D. Premadasa said that 288.9 million metric tonnes of tea had been exported last year to 131 countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Russia. He said measures had been taken to ensure that the quality of the tea conformed to ISO 3720 standards, adding that 4,000 samples were tested, and sub-standard tea was removed.
“Tea prepared for export is tested at various stages before it is shipped. This process is monitored by the Sri Lanka Tea Board,” he added.
 
Better housing facilities for estate workers: Kiriella
The government was constructing houses for estate workers in seven-perch lands, Public Enterprise Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The minister, taking part in the second reading debate on the New Villages Development Authority for Plantation Region Bill in Parliament, yesterday, said that no previous government had granted ownership of lands to estate workers.
Moving the bill for debate, Hill Country, New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister P. Digambaran said the construction of houses in seven-perch lands could be expedited when the new authority to develop villages in the plantation region was established.
The new villages would replace the existing shanties in estates with new houses and improve the basic infrastructure facilities within them. The new authority would be responsible for coordinating the development projects in plantation regions.
The government, with this move, aims to include the plantation community into the social mainstream through socioeconomic, cultural and infrastructure development.
The new authority would work hand in hand with other national, provincial, and district-level agencies in the plantation region. The bill was unanimously passed in Parliament.
 
Chief Minister faces embezzlement allegations
Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake had allegedly deposited Rs.3.5 million collected to purchase schoolbags for pre-school children, into his personal bank account, Parliament was told yesterday.
The sum should have been deposited in the provincial council's official bank account. Deputy Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Sriyani Wijewickrama said that the chief minister had allegedly obtained the money from state banks.
She was responding to a question raised by UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri.
The audit inquiry in this regard, had stated that such funds should be maintained by the official accounts of the provincial council, and that the council’s approval was needed when such funds were spent.
The funds had been deposited to an account under the name 'Chamara Sampath Foundation'.
Deputy Minister Wijewickrama alleging that there had been a misappropriation of funds, said that anyone could go to courts and complain against the act.
 
Sanctions imposed on Iran
Special committee to resolve payment issues: Navin
It had been decided to appoint a special committee to resolve the payment issues related to Iran in the face of sanctions imposed on it by the USA, Plantations Minister Navin Dissanayake said in Parliament, yesterday.
The decision was made during Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, he added.
He was responding to a statement made by MP Lakshman Yapa Abewardena that the tea industry was dwindling, and that 38 tea factories had been closed due to the decline in tea quality. “Last year, tea production stood at 307 million metric tonnes, and we expect to increase it to 330 million tonnes. The process is being carried out systematically, however, some factories have been closed due to administrative discrepancies, ” Minister Dissanayake said.
“The price of tea has declined, but that is due to America imposing sanctions on Iran and Turkey. When Cabinet met on Tuesday, we decided to appoint a committee to resolve the payment issues with regard to Iran,” he added.
JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake said that the Foreign Ministry had issued a gazette notification outlining a large number of sanctions against Iran, which had been approved. He asked Minister Dissanayake whether those sanctions would have an impact on his ministry.
“This gazette was tabled in Parliament during the previous session and it was based on the sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States,” MP Rathnayake added. However, Minister Navin Dissanayake denied any knowledge of the gazette notification.
