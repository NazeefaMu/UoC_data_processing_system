Walk for rights

Elderly citizens all over the world have a firm belief that the month of October belong to them. During this month, many elders not only in our country but in another 96 countries where HelpAge partners and affiliated organizations are established have engaged in various activities to raise awareness on elders’ issues, demanding their rights and entitlements for them to live with dignity.
Although the UN declared October 1 as the `International Day of Older Persons’ many elder’s organizations in our country celebrate it throughout the month.

HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL), one of the oldest organizations in our country that was established in 1986 by the late H. P. Gooneratne with the objective of providing eye care, medical care facilities and many other projects to empower the underprivileged elders, conducted its annual `Elders Walk’ on a grand scale at Nuwara Eliya recently.
The ceremony was conducted by HelpAge with the assistance of the `Age Demand Action’ campaign programme of the HelpAge International, UK and supported by the Nuwara Eliya District Secretariet and the Berendina Development Services.
An unexpected number of over 1,500 elderly citizens, mainly estate workers between the age group of 60 to 85 years in Nuwara Eliya and surrounding areas keenly participated in the walk despite the cold breeze and the mist that enveloped throughout the town during the day.
The walk was witnessed by school children, general public and tourists who were at Nuwara Eliya Town at the time.
Elders shouted slogans and also displayed placards demanding their rights and entitlements. They also took part in fun-filled activities such as singing and dancing.

HASL, Chairman, Tilak de Zoysa said ageing is a challenge in today's world and celebrating the `International Day of Older Persons’ is an opportunity to highlight the important contributions that older people made to the society.
HelpAge, Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge who also keenly participated in the walk highlighted that it displayed the courage and strength of elders and said HelpAge conducts Free Cataract Surgeries at HelpAge Eye Hospital, Wellawatta and Mobile Eye Care camps countrywide for underprivileged citizens. Elders also took part in programmes at Cinisita Cultural Hall, Nuwara Eliya after the walk.
