Royal retains BC Anghie trophy  : Ganindu Dilshan the hero against St Peter’s

Centre Ganindu Dilshan was the hero scoring two crucial tries to ensure Royal College beat a completely off coloured St. Peter’s College by 17 points (3 tries, 1 conversion) to 10 (1 try, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) to retain the B.C. Anghie trophy in their Singer ‘A’ division inter-school league rugby first round match played at Bambalapitiya yesterday, The winners led 17-3 at half time.
It was an excellent performance orchestrated by Royal centre Dilshan with a fabulous display of fast open rugby throughout the entire game where he totally dominated by over running the opponents at will to go along with his booming kicks to touch.
Royal dished out a superb brand of running rugby and gave a torrid time to the Peterites with their three quarters right throughout the entire match along with a fabulous display of defence. This really made the difference for them to come up with a win against all odds.
The Peterites opened scoring in the 25th minute through a 30-metre penalty fired across by fly half Steffen Sivaraj into a 3-nil lead.
In the 33rd minute of play Royal grabbed the lead through a try scored by Dilshan off a three quarter move. Winger Zakir Naufer missed the conversion and Royal went into a 5-3 lead.
Within five minutes Dilshan scored again under the post through a fine off load made by Royal scrum half Migara Perera following a spectacular break by the nippy half back. Naufer made the conversion and Royal went into a 12-3 lead.

Just on the stroke of half time in the 40th minute Royal went further ahead to 17-3, when off a rolling maul their prop forward Himantha Hirushan dived over for a try. Naufer missed the conversion.
After the break the Peterites closed down the gap in the 67 minute when off a three quarter move their fly half Stefen Sivaraj scored a breathtaking try under the post going through the entire Royal three quarter line. He himself made the conversion to make the score 17 points to 10.
St. Peters did attack in the final 10 minutes but their butter fingered ball handling errors cost them the match as there were no further scoring done till the referee’s final whistle.
