House for deceased student’s family

Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan provided a house to one of the families of the two students who were shot dead by the police in 2016.
On October 20, 2016, two students from the Jaffna University were shot by the police for disobeying orders to stop their motorcycle at a road block at the Kulappidi Junction, Kankesanthurai. The minister handed over the house to the family of the late Nadaraja Ganesen, 24, in Bharathipuram, Kilinochchi.
The house, valued at Rs. 1.4 million, was built by the Rehabilitation Authority in cooperation with the Army.
The minister had pledged a house to the other deceased student’s family as well.
