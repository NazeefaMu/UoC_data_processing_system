Herath sends Pakistan batting into a spin

ABU DHABI, Monday: Amazing scenes were witnessed at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi where Sri Lanka defended a moderate total of 136 marvelously to pull off a spectacular 21 runs win over Pakistan on the fifth and final day of the first cricket Test yesterday to go one-up in the two-match series.
Pakistan were bowled out for 114 in their second innings – their lowest total in the UAE that has become their home ground since 2010, and it was their first defeat at this venue in 10 Tests.
The man of the moment in Sri Lanka’s hour of glory was none other than veteran spinner Rangana Herath who has been Pakistan’s nemesis for several years. Yesterday he demonstrated why he can be considered the best spinner in contemporary cricket when he took a match bag of 11 wickets and in the process completed two milestones – becoming the first left-arm spinner to reach 400 Test wickets and also the first bowler to take 100 Test wickets against Pakistan.
There was an anticlimax to the finish when Herath’s spin partner Dilruwan Perera had Yasir Shah caught by Kusal Mendis at short leg and everyone thought including the players and the supporting staff the Test had ended and started congratulating each other. But to their dismay Perera had bowled a no-ball and Yasir survived.
However that no-ball turned out to be a divine hand from above for Herath as it enabled him to take the last Pakistani wicket – that of Mohammad Abbas and reach 400 wickets – the fifth spinner to reach that mark in Test cricket after Muthiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne, Anil Kumble and Harbjahan Singh. The wicket of Mohammad Amir prior to that dismissal brought Herath his 100th against Pakistan. Indian all rounder Kapil Dev had the most Test wickets against Pakistan prior to yesterday with 99.
If Sri Lanka was to defend a modest target of 136 it required something special from the master spinner himself. Herath has never let his country down in such circumstances and he produced a tantalising spell of left-arm bowling to strangle the free-scoring Pakistani batsmen into submission finishing with figures of 6 for 43 off 21.4 overs – figures that confirmed him as one of the greatest bowlers to defend totals in Test history. Herath has 11 fourth innings five-for hauls in comparison to two other legendary spinners Muralitharan and Warne who have seven apiece.
This performance coupled with his first innings effort of 5 for 93 off 40 overs in the first innings easily made Herath the clear candidate for Man of the Match although there were other notable runners for it like skipper Dinesh Chandimal who’s marathon knock of 155 not out set the tone for the Lankan first innings and Niroshan Dickwella’s two crucial innings of 83 and 40 not out.
Pakistan with a strong batting line up as they displayed in their first innings were pushed onto the back foot by Herath from the fourth over when he had Sami Aslam edging a catch to slip with the total on four. Soon it became 16-3 as Dilruwan Perera and Suranga Lakmal also came to the party.
With the target so small it was a game of see-saw as Pakistan crawled their way to 101-6. The Test stood in the balance with either side capable of winning. But eventually it was Sri Lanka who held their nerve to fashion out a famous and much deserved win after being whitewashed by India in all three formats only a month back. The team was also reeling from the criticism that was levelled against them from all quarters following ODI series defeat to Zimbabwe and a rare Test loss to Bangladesh.
Where the Pakistanis erred was that none of their batters decided to bat positively and take on the Lankan spinners. By trying to play a defensive game they allowed the spinners to dominate the innings so that in their entire second innings there was only four boundaries and one six hit. Their first boundary did not come until the 27th over so tightly did the Lankan spinners weave a web around the Pakistani batsmen.
Sri Lanka’s chances of saving the Test took a jolt when within the first 38 minutes of play in the morning they lost both overnight batsmen Kusal Mendis and Suranga Lakmal within the space of 13 runs to Mohammad Abbas who was making the ball swing both ways especially on a fifth day pitch and causing a lot of concern to the batsmen. 
Sri Lanka lost their remaining six wickets by just doubling their overnight score of 69-4 to be all out for 138 with only Dickwella offering any sort of resistance with a plucky unbeaten knock of 40 off 76 balls.
It was a pity that no one managed to stay with him – with only Sandakan sticking it out for 42 minutes to add 34 but undoing all the good work with a rash cut shot to a wide ball from Yasir that led to his dismissal and the end of the innings at lunch. Yasir finished with five wickets and eight for the match.
It was another case of the lower order not contributing to the total that has become a major issue with the team and needs to be addressed. In the first innings Sri Lanka’s last five wickets fell for 32 runs and yesterday Dickwella was left without a partner to stay with him. Statistics reveal that the Sri Lankan lower order has the second worst record for batsmen batting between 8 and 11 where they average a lowly 13.
This Test was an extraordinary one. For the first 11 sessions it looked as if it was heading for a meaningless draw. It only came to life in the final session of the fourth day when Sri Lanka lost four wickets for 69 runs and led by only 66. Compared to the first four days 16 wickets fell on a gripping final day yesterday. Who said that Test cricket was dying or boring?
