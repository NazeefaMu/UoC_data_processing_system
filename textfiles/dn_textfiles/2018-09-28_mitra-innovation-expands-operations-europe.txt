Mitra Innovation expands operations into Europe

Mitra Innovation recently announced the launch of engineering and client servicing operations in Germany. The expansion into Germany further strengthens Mitra Innovation’s presence in the European region.
Co-founder and CEO, Ashok Suppiah said, “As part of our strategic global expansion plans, Mitra Innovation is delighted to announce its first European office in Germany. The German office will serve Mitra Innovation’s customers in the region, including Moneta Bank in Czech Republic.”
Moneta Bank, one of the largest banks in the region, works with Mitra Innovation to implement a comprehensive integration program in line with the bank’s digital transformation program.
Mitra Innovation is a strategic global partner for WSO2 open-source integration platform.
We are the only global partner with the largest number of certified experts and integration consultants.
Mitra Innovation also specialises in Cloud technologies including AWS and Microsoft Azure.
Jochen Traunecker, Head of WSO2 Solutions for Mitra Innovation said, “The European region is in critical need of a credible, trustworthy and reputed engineering organisation that can power digital transformation throughout the entire length and breadth of an enterprise. Mitra Innovation, as a technology service provider, ticks all of the boxes, thanks to its wealth of expertise in engineering integrated systems, organisation-wide digital transformation, cloud solutions, product incubation and accelerated startup growth.” Germany is world renowned as one of the pioneering nations to drive digital transformation and is also largely involved in the rapid evolution of the fourth industrial revolution.
A number of enterprises are shifting operations to more digitalised workflows and are thus realising and investing in the potential for smart factories.
Smart factories help enterprises minimise waste, streamline workflows, increase efficiencies and deliver consistency throughout operations.
Co founder and Managing Director, Dammika Ganegama expressed his excitement at the commencement of operations in Germany, “Mitra Innovation has now found a home in one of the most prestigious industrial regions in the world and shares locality with world renowned brands that are in essence, technologically superior to their competitors. We aim to continue and contribute to the same tradition and work with some of the best in the world.”
