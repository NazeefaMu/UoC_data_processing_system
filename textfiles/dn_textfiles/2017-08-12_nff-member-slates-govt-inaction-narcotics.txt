NFF member slates govt inaction on narcotics

National Freedom Front (NFF) member and MP Jayantha Samaraweera accused the government for not taking action against narcotic related incidents in the country.
Samaraweera said yesterday that there is no trace of the over 1,600 kilos of narcotics detected by the Police during 2016- 2017.
No action has been taken against anyone in this regard, he said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said Police detected around 140 kg of heroin, 1,262 kg of cocaine, 3kg of hashish and 8kg of Kerala ganja in 2016, while 15 kg of heroin and 222 kg of cocaine were found this year from various parts of the country.
"We do not know what happened to the consignments of narcotics. Although the government promised to conduct probes to nab the suspects behind drug hauls, it has not done any investigation. No one has been arrested in connection with the racket," he said.
"We can be happy about the President’s decision to appoint a sub-committee to determine what has happened to narcotics taken into custody from raids recently," he said.
Samaraweera said the Yahapalana government promotes drug use and alcohol consumption.
Several Ministers have said liquor shops should be opened on Poya days and Christmas days, he said.
How can this government be a good governance government, if ministers encourage people to consume alcohol?, he asked.
Commenting on the recent arrest of Minister Mangala Samaraweera’s Public Relations Officer for possession of drugs, while en route to a party, he said attempts were made by key political figures to stop the arrest.
