‘Second Innings’ brings fresh hopes

‘Deveni Inima’ (Second Innings) now being telecast on TV Derana has captured the attention of local teledrama viewers across the board.
Parents sit with their young ones before the TV to go down memory lane recalling their schooling days and what they have achieved and missed out on during their times as budding youngsters.
Subsequent to the ‘Golu Hadawatha’ novel/cinema and the 1979 cartoon creation ‘Ithin Ita Passae’ in Siththara paper, popularity of such magnitude by the masses is gained by the ‘Deveni Inima’ teledrama.
The director of ‘Deveni Inima’ is none other than Saranga Mendis who directed the mind blowing teledrama, ‘Gini Avi Saha Ginikeli’, a sequel to the book and the film with the same name by Anura Horatious and Udayakantha Warnasuriya.
In the midst of shooting some decisive scenes in ‘Deveni Inima’ the young director found time to talk to the Daily News T&C.
Q: ‘Deveni Inima’ is poised to break many records in the local teledrama sphere.
We are reaping the harvest of what we have sowed and I am a content person as the director.
Q: ‘Deveni Inima’ is your third teledrama. It has a unique presentation style just as your first two teledramas, ‘Gini Avi’ and ‘Dedunnai Adarae’.
According to my point of view a teledrama director or a film director should not try to boost his/her image via his works. We have to adapt a style best suited for a particular creation although our philosophy could be a different one. I personally like to differentiate my works and hate to confine to a particular genre.
The most important thing is to be sincere to your creation and ‘Deveni Inima’ is sheer proof of that fact.
Q: How did your past experiences pave way for ‘Deveni Inima’?
A. After ‘Gini Avi’ became a huge success, TV Derana invited me to do an original Sinhala teledrama to counter Sinhala dubbed versions of Indian teledramas shown on local TV channels. Hence I did ‘Dedunnai Adarae’.
With ‘Dedunnai Adarae’ we were able to address the market segment of viewers who have been watching dubbed teledramas brought from India.
But I must admit ‘Dedunnai Adarae’ had its pros and cons due to Pro-Indian presentation style. Thus it did not attract Sri Lankan audiences to the anticipated level.
However via ‘Dedunnai Adarae’ we proved that we can counter Indian soap operas dubbed in Sinhala with local products.
Subsequently we teamed up to do ‘Deveni Inima’ inducing it a more local touch while maintaining Bollywood attributes, taking the hint from Sinhala films made in 1970s. This experiment really worked.
Laksiri Wickramage, Madhawa Madawala, Charith Kothelawala of TV Derana, myself, my wife Chamika Mendis (producer) and the script writer Saman Edirimuni sat together and discussed lengthily prior to writing the ‘Deveni Inima’ story.
Q: Some people try to compare ‘Deveni Inima’ with the films ‘Golu Hadawatha’ and ‘Gehenu Lamai’.
It is a foolish thing to do. ‘Golu Hadawatha’ and ‘Gehenu Lamai’ in their totality were made in different contexts when the world was different. Now we live in a digital era and the thinking patterns of youth and people in general in the present context are very different.
See the big picture. In ‘Deveni Inima’ we shed light on love and compassion that has a universal appeal. We never harp on sensuality.
In that sense Samalka in ‘Deveni Inima’ could be the same character of Dhammi in ‘Golu Hadawatha’ living in a totally different context.
Q: Why did you cast dream star singers and TV presenters as actors in ‘Deveni Inima’?
There were two reasons for this move. We wanted to cast new faces in our story and by doing that we intended to induce novelty to the story.
The other reason is the prior exposure of these youngsters to show business. As up-and-coming singers and presenters they have performed before huge audiences and had been taught by TV Derana how to face the camera. Hence it was easy to direct these resourceful youngsters.
We have no acting schools or academies here so we are compelled to resort to such means in selecting new actors.
Of course we did rehearsals to fine-tune their raw talents. Senior actors who perform with them guided them well through the process. All-in-all there is a fine blend of seasoned and new actors.
Q. How does the script contribute towards ‘Deveni Inima’?
Saman Edirimuni’s contribution as the script writer is enormous. The dialogues written by him are so powerful that it keeps me at ease when directing the teledrama.
Saman also writes the script of ‘Sindu’ teledrama which is telecasting over TV Derana and the Seya radio play that is now being aired.
I have a constant dialogue with him and this is team work at its best.
Q. Is ‘Deveni Inima’ a copy?
There is a saying; there are only six stories in the world. Thus one can even assume ‘Deveni Inima’ is copied from Saththa Kumba Jathaka story that talks of two little parrots being brought up in two different environments.
Q: Some young actors and actresses in ‘Deveni Inima’ seem to develop star qualities.
People flock to see Anuhas when we shoot. That reminds us of the 70s decade when people were yearning to have a glimpse of Vijeya Kumaratunga in real life.
Anura Horatious called me from Australia and said the actor who plays Avantha has the prowess of an actor like Dommie Jayawardene.
Q: How is the local teledrama industry progressing at present?
There is a great disparity when it comes to distribution of finances. The cash flow must be streamlined and for that to happen there should be unity amongst people in the fraternity.
