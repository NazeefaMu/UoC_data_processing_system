Teacher arrested for alleged assault of student over school uniform

A teacher in charge of discipline was arrested by Mirigama Police for allegedly assaulting a student who came to school in a tight uniform. The teacher in question has allegedly cut the uniform with a pair of scissors and later assaulted the student.
The student concerned was admitted to the Mirigama hospital and later transferred to the Gampaha district hospital
The teacher concerned attached to W. Senanayaka Prep School in Meerigama, Gampaha, suddenly decided to deliver a student from his discomfort associated with his seemingly tight school uniform last Monday (19), he could not do otherwise than settling upon a blade to perform his desired task. A blade perhaps seemed easy to get by and user-friendly at he same time.
He called the boy, Nimesh Savich, who is a year-11 student of the school, and made the profound announcement to get the much wanted attention of other students. "This shirt is too tight for Nimesh."
He held the blade in his hand and cut the short sleeve of the boy's school uniform shirt with his preferred instrument.
He pauses for a moment of satisfaction." these trousers are also too tight for him,"says he. He proceeds to slit a section of the student's trousers too. Nimesh, summoned by his teacher is standing before him as his clothes are being cut off as if he was in an Emergency Room (ER) of a Teaching Hospital. His eyes are helplessly cast down at his feet.
He was lucky that his religion teacher did not notice the pair of shoes he was wearing. They looked scruffy and worn off too. Had the teacher seen them, he would have cut them off too. Nimesh had just a pair of uniforms to wear to school, now that it has been reduced to a single pair by his teacher.
Nimesh is not the kind of student who gets to stand face to face with a wardrobe of ten to twenty school uniforms. His father is a mason and his mother is a garment factory worker. They have been finding it difficult to make ends meet. It was due to financial constraints of the family that Nimesh had to manage with just a pair of school uniforms.
Nimesh's parents have lodged a complaint with the Meerigama Police station on Monday (19) about this incident. No parents would send their children to schools to suffer humiliation or to see some wise guys in the school's teaching staff make their children look like ER patients in class rooms.
The complaint was recorded under the minor category of complaints, said sources at the Meerigama Police Station. It is likely that this case will be settled for a song.
Our attempts to contact the Chief Minister of the Western Province and the principal of the school in question for comments on the incident were unsuccessful. When contacted by us, the school officials said that the principal was attending his chores and was not in a position to respond.
