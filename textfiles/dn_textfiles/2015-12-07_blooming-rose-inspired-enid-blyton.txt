Blooming rose inspired by Enid Blyton

She is an English rose growing in Sri Lankan soil. She is a rose that has blossomed. She is Muqaddasa Wahid, an exceptional 15-year-old author. Muqaddasa is a proud product of Buddhist Ladies' College.
The French translation of a book she wrote in English was launched recently by Alliance Francaise De Colombo. The book is named 'Le Role de Modele'.
"I congratulate young author Muqaddasa Wahid for the tremendous effort she has put into writing this book. Those of you who have had a chance to read the book will appreciate how much talent she has in expressing her ideas, views and dreams in her book," said Alliance Francaise De Colombo President Sheriff Abdul Rahuman.
A family who had been close associates of Wahid spoke about her. Leo Fonseka, a guest speaker, said he and his wife had watched over her for several years.
"She is doing great things at such a young age. She is precocious and more advanced than other children of her age. I think she will achieve miracles with her pen. We saw great talent and potential in her. From day one, it was clear to us that she would attain great heights," he said.
The essence of this book is her inner fight with the world around her. It is about the fight she is raging against evil when she writes about the eternal conflict between the good and bad. Muqaddasa shows a lot of analytical ability. "We are sure she will bring credit to her family and nation," said Fonseka.
Another guest speaker P. Venkatesan spoke of Wahid's maturity at tackling a variety of topics. "She is a gifted child with enormous talent. A child like this is rare. I have never come across a child who is so mature at this age. Her parents are blessed to have a child like this," Venkatesan said.
Finally, the child prodigy herself spoke. Wahid spoke of her idol, Enid Blyton whose works are the basis of Wahid's story.
"I am happy that I am here today to present the French Translation of my first book which was launched in 2012 at my school Buddhist Ladies College. The inspiration to write my book came from my Grade 5 class teacher and English teacher Nalini Samarasekere.
I am thankful to her for making me who I am," she said.
She added: "The book is about friendship and mystery.
Although Enid Blyton writes for children between 12 -14, I read her because I like her way of writing. My story is kind of based on her books. So it is a result of reading many Enid Blyton stories such as Famous Five and Secret Seven.
It is also about role models in society. I hope you all will enjoy reading the French version as much as I enjoyed writing the English version."
