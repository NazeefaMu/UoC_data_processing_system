BA cabin crew to stage 14-day strike

British Airways (BA) cabin crew are to stage a further two weeks of strikes, in a long running dispute over pay and benefits.
“Mixed-fleet” cabin crew, who are paid less than longer standing staff, will walk out for 14 days on 19 July, in a strike called by the Unite union.
The strike will begin three days after the end of the current 16-day strike.
BA said instead of striking, Unite should allow its members to vote on the pay deal reached two months ago.
The union said its members were continuing to campaign for a better pay deal.
“Today’s announcement of a further escalation, underlines the determination of our members in their fight for better pay and against British Airways’ bullying behaviour,” said Unite’s national officer, Oliver Richardson.
In its statement BA said: “It seems extraordinary that a trade union should ask its members to give up their pay and benefits for virtually the whole of July, trying to target the holidays of hard-working families, rather than give those members a chance to settle the central issue of the dispute.” BBC
