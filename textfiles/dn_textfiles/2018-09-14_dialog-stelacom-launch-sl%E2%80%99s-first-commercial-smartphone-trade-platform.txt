The trade-in platformenables customers to upgrade to the latest 4G smartphones at an affordable price. Currently, tradeupgo.com offers selected Apple and Samsung 4G smartphones with attractive pricing for the trade-in programme, and will also expand to offer a range of 4G smartphones in future.

The pioneering move by Dialog will easily enable a customer to purchase a new device, without the hassle of waiting for their mobile phone to be sold to have the money in hand, and will keep in line with a legal framework to ensure the trade-in process is well regulated.”
“Through this platform we will spearhead our vision of ‘digital inclusion’ in ensuring Sri Lankans have an opportunity to enjoy the fastest internet and digital services,” he said.
