Moves to revive king coconut cultivation in Moneragala

The Coconut Cultivation Board will uplift the king coconut cultivation in Moneragala.
Moneragala Coconut Cultivation Board Regional Manager M. Jayanama said there is a big demand for king coconuts in the local and foreign markets. A plan is afoot to provide facilities to farmers to cultivate king coconuts.
The project will be launched in Meegahapitiya, Dambagalla, Badalkumbura, Nakkala, Dombagahawela, Siyabalanduwa, Thanamalwila and Wellawaya areas.
King coconut saplings will be provided from Handapanagala and Welipitiya nurseries, Jayanama said.
