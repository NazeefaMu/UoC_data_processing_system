Cherantha sets new swim record in Malaysia

Sri Lankan national swimmer and FINA Scholarship holder Cherantha de Silva set up a new Sri Lankan National Record in the 200 meter Butterfly event with a time of 02:05.10 seconds at the 53rd MILO/PRAM Malaysia Open Swimming Championship 2017 held in Pusatakuatik Hang Jebat, Melaka from March 9 to 12.
Cherantha bettered his own 200m butterfly Sri Lankan record of 2:07.74 secs which he established at the South Asian Games selection trial in December, 2015. Cherantha performed well to bag seven medals at this year's meet including three golds, three silvers and a bronze medal. He bagged golds in 100m freestyle, 50m butterfly and 100m butterfly events and won silvers in 200m butterfly, 200m Individual Medley and 50m freestyle events. Chirantha also secured the 200m freestyle bronze.
Cherantha, 21, an old boy of Ananda College, Colombo has shown great promise and consistency as a school swimmer and went on to win national and international honours at a very young age. He made his country proud by winning seven medals at the South Asian Games 2016 in Guwahati, India.
