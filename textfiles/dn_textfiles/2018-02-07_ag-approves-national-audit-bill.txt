AG approves National Audit Bill

The Attorney General has approved the National Audit Bill, the Auditor General’s Department said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has given instructions to present the National Audit bill to the Cabinet of Ministers as soon as Attorney General’s approval is granted.
Accordingly the Prime Minister’s Secretary has handed over the relevant documents to the Secretary to the Cabinet on Monday.
The National Audit bill enables to establish the National Audit Commission which will help to speed up the audit process while ensuring its accuracy.
In addition to that, the formation of the Commission will distribute powers which were previously centered on a single person, while ensuring the transparency of audit proceedings and utility of public funds.
Moreover, new laws could be introduced to avoid misappropriation of public funds, by this method.
