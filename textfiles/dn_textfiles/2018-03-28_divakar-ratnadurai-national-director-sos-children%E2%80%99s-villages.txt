Divakar Ratnadurai, National Director, SOS Children’s Villages

With over 30 years of experience at SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka, Divakar Ratnaduri who started as an Accountant at the Nuwara Eliya Village has been appointed as National Director, SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka. Since joining SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka in 1987, Ratnadurai has dedicated his career to social care in helping children without parental support regain a family life.
During his multiple roles at SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka, Ratanduri was tasked with building 1,000 homes in the Eastern Coastal area after the Tsunami in 2004, setting up a camp for the children in Chettikulam with the ending of the Civil War and initiating the building of SOS Children’s Village in Jaffna that care for more than 100 children currently.
Whilst excelling in helping Sri Lankan children in need, Ratnadurai was invited for foreign assignments such as to streamline and develop the Family Strengthening programme in Cambodia.
National Director, Ratnadurai said, “Providing good quality care for children and becoming self-sufficient in terms of funding for SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka is my target. Food, clothing and shelter can be provided by many, but providing a loving home with a mother, siblings and security added on to the basic needs is very important for a child’s growth.”
