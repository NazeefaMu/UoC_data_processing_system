Unity government’s agreement renewal after polls

Renewing the agreement of the national government between the UNP and SLFP will be decided after the Local Government elections considering the achievements of the SLFP during the past two years, Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
"The agreement was not registered anywhere. It was a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the parties. Any decision pertaining to the agreement will be taken only after the local government elections,” he said.
Addressing the media yesterday, at the SLFP headquarters, he said President Maithripala Sirisena intends to make changes to the public administration structure.
He said the existing structure needs to be changed after the local government election and added that the President was preparing for it.
He pointed out that there were many drawbacks in state institutions.
"False promises are given about job opportunities for youths and the prevailing vacancies in state institutions would solve that problem. But no measures are being taken to rectify those issues," he said.
