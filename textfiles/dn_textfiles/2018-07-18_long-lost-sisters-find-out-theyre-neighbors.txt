Long-lost sisters  find out they're neighbors

31-year-old Hillary Harris was given up for adoption when she was just a baby. Her and her brother, 33-year-old Tyler Hardy were adopted in 1987 by Lee Hardy, 65, and his late wife Rochelle.
Hillary began trying to track down her biological family in 2011, when she fell pregnant with daughter Stella. Her adoption agency revealed the names of her birth parents but she was heartbroken to discover her father Wayne Clouse had died in 2002.
However, when reading her late father’s obituary, Hillary discovered that she had two half sisters – Dawn Johnson, 50 and Renee Diericks, 49.
Hillary, from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, tried tracking them down on Facebook, but to no avail.
Then in June 2017, a woman named Dawn and her partner, 53-year-old Kurt Casperson in next door. After discovering that Dawn was from Greenwood – the same place that her half sister lived, according to the adoption file – Dawn joked to her partner that she could be her sister.
It wasn’t until she saw Dawn’s surname ‘Johnson’ written on a package that the realisation dawned that she probably was. Hillary was too afraid to ask her in person, so sent her a text asking who her father was. It was Wayne. They had the same father.
“For me this is 100 per cent fate. I was so sad when I discovered my biological father had passed away,” says Hillary.
“But by meeting Dawn, I feel like I have all the answers I will ever need. She’s the missing puzzle piece I have been looking for for so many years. For me something first clicked in June when I first found out her name was Dawn and she was from Greenwood,” Hillary continues. “My husband and me joked for a few weeks that she was my sister but we didn’t know her last name. One day she got a delivery of shingles for her roof and it was addressed to Dawn Johnson, the same name in Wayne’s obituary. I began to shake. It was such an intense moment.”
Hillary had to ask her straight away, but was afraid to do it face to face.
“It was late at night, but I finally got the courage to text her and ask her who her dad was,” she explains.
“She confirmed it was Wayne. I told her we had a lot to talk about and she said, “We have the same dad don’t we?” Ever since then we’ve grown so close,” reveals Hillary..
“When I met my birth mum I thought I would have this tingly feeling and an immediate bond and I didn’t. With Dawn I felt an immediate connection.”
Dawn didn’t grow up with her dad, but formed a relationship with him in later life. “It’s such a weird coincidence,” she says. “Of all the hundreds of thousands of homes we bought a house that shares a driveway with my sister. I was ecstatic and so was my sister Renee. She couldn’t believe it.” After meeting her biological mother, Hillary discovered she and her brother Tyler, a factory worker, were born as a result of an affair with Wayne.
Tyler was reluctant to meet Dawn at first, he Hillary says he eventually agreed to meet his half sibling. Hillary and Tyler plan to undergo DNA tests to officially confirm that Dawn and Renee are their siblings. “We would hope to DNA tests soon but we’re in no rush,” she says. “My brother has met Dawn and said he would have no problem providing his DNA.”
Dawn has two sons – 29-year-old Todd and 27-year-old Tyler – and she’s enjoyed getting to know her new niece, seven-year-old Stella, and 44-year-old brother-in-law Lance.
“I have become so close to Stella,” Dawn reveals.
“I had only ever had boys so it is so fun to have a little girl playing in the front yard. Hopefully my boys will be able to meet the whole family soon.”
Hillary confirms that Stella is a massive fan of Dawn: ‘Stella just loves Dawn. “She thinks she so fun and has loved getting to know her and Kurt. I think all our bad luck with weird neighbors finally turned around because I feel so lucky to have found Dawn.”
