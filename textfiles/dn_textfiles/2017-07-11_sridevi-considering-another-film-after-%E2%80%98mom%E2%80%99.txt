Is Sridevi considering another film after ‘Mom’?

Looks like Sridevi is making good on the promise of keeping her hiatus from Bollywood shorter. The actress is believably considering a film that she has been approached for. She says, “Yes, I have liked something, but it’s too early to talk about it. One thing is for sure - it won’t be as long a gap now.”
If she signs the film, the actress will be approaching the film like it’s her first, like she has done in the past. She says, “Every film is new for me. I don’t feel that just because I have done 300 films, I can do anything then and there. I take every step thinking ki yeh achhe se karna hai. I would be like this on all my film’s set whether it’s my first film or the 300th one.” DNA
