Dogs Have Feelings — Here's How We Know

Q: Only a decade ago, the idea that dogs and other animals had feelings would have been laughed at. Tell us about your work with MRIs and what it can tell us about the emotional lives of our best friend.
A: About five years ago I got this crazy idea to see if I could train my own dog to go into an MRI to see what she was thinking and whether she reciprocated any feelings I have for her.
Callie is a black terrier mix, adopted from one of the local shelters here. She had no particularly defining traits other than she was high energy and very curious, like many terriers are.
I teamed up with a local dog trainer and worked through the details of how to go about training a dog to go in the MRI. The first thing we did was build an MRI simulator in my home and get her used to the very loud sounds these machines make. I recorded the sounds of the magnets and played them at home, at low volume, while I played a game with her, gradually increasing the volume to the real level. It took about 2 to 3 months, working mostly by trial and error. But it turned out to be easier than I thought it would be.
We started with simple things, like teaching her a hand signal that meant she would get a treat and another that meant no treat. When we did that, we were able to observe activity in the reward pathways of her brain indicating that the technique worked.
Encouraged by our success with Callie, we put out word to the dog community here in Atlanta that we were looking for volunteers to participate in this project.
We began holding MRI classes every Sunday. People would bring their dogs in and we’d give them mock-ups of the MRI to take home for practice. Within a year we had a team of close to 20 dogs.
With that many participants, we started doing much more interesting, complicated things in the scanner, like asking how their smell system works, how they recognize people and their household by their own scent.
Scientists find it hard to accept the idea that animals have feelings. Most people who live with dogs understand this intuitively. The confusion comes because we have language and can label those feelings. We have words for things like love, fear, sadness, or guilt. Everything we started doing to elicit positive emotions showed that dogs had corresponding parts of their brains to humans.
Q: You suggest that there are striking similarities between dogs and humans in both the structure and function of a key brain region: the caudate nucleus. Unpack that idea for us.
A: The caudate nucleus is a structure common to all brains, particularly in mammals, which we know to have the richest density of dopamine receptors. Dopamine used to be thought of as a pleasure neurotransmitter but it’s much more complex than that.
The caudate nucleus is active when an individual is in a state of anticipation—something happens and they have to decide what to do with that information. It’s particularly strong when that information is in positive domains. You see something, you want to approach it, maybe consume it.
When we see this structure active in dogs, we can interpret that they are experiencing something important to them and something they like. This is completely analogous to what happens in human brains under the same conditions.
Obviously dog brains are not the same as humans. One big difference is in the size. A dog brain is about the size of a lemon, at best, if it’s a big dog. There’s not the same real estate in there, so they can’t do some things we can do. - National Geographic
