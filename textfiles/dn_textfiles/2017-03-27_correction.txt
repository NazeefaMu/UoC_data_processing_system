correction

With reference to the Page 3 obituary titled ‘Death of Nevil Padmasiri Uyanhewa,’ we have inadvertently published the wrong picture along with the write-up. The picture appearing is that of former Customs Director W.W. Perera. We apologise to the families of Nevil Padmasiri Uyanhewa and W.W. Perera. We regret the error.
