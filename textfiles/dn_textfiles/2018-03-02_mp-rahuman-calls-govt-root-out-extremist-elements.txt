MP Rahuman calls on Govt. to root out extremist elements

UNP Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman called on the Yahapalana Government to make good on its promises to root out extremist elements, adding that continuing impunity will pave the way for continued violence.
Addressing a press briefing in Colombo, Rahuman added that continuing impunity coupled with the lack of political will serve as incubators for continued violence.
“It doesn’t matter if these acts of violence are perpetrated against Muslims, Tamils or Sinhalese, what matters is action being taken on the part of law enforcement authorities, a probe that will see perpetrators being brought to book and political will to ensure it doesn’t happen again,” he said.
He added that if there isn’t political will to tackle the root cause of the issues, a regime change will have no impact. “We keep chasing after crooks and criminals but we don’t heed to simmering racial tensions,” he said.
“We came to power on the premise that we would weed out such elements or take action against them, it’s high time we make good on those promises,”MP Rahuman said. He further said he has made a personal request to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to initiate a probe into the tensions that flared in Ampara which took place two days after the Premier assumed duties as Minister of Law and Order.
“Ampara is not known to be a place that is prone to such extremism,” he said.
“Communities have been peacefully coexisting for years and if elements can run riot in a place like that, one needs to question if we are doing enough,” MP Rahuman added.
