Tea tree anti-imperfection night mask

The Body Shop launched tea tree Anti-Imperfection night mask recently. The community trade organic tea tree oil used by the brand has been clinically proven to yield clearer skin from the first week of use. Products in the range also use Tamanu oil extract to help generate new tissue and improve the healing process for skin.
The tea tree anti-imperfection night mask is the first sleeping mask designed to help women and men care for blemished skin concerns overnight. The mask is a cooling memory-gel texture infused with the key active ingredient-tea tree oil sourced from the Kenya Organic Oil Farm Association. This ingredient is renowned for its powerful antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, which makes it an essential oil and a popular ingredient in skincare products.
The mask reduces imperfections overnight whilst soothing, controlling excess oil and resurfacing. With regular use, pores and marks are reduced and the formula helps to prevent imperfections in addition to solving them.
