Coal cost is Rs. 14, not Rs. 7 - PUCSL

The electricity sector regulator, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) says that the average cost of a coal unit - Rs. 14.41 - based on the official data submitted by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the approved plan of the PUCSL, reflects the current price trend in the world market.
The PUCSL recently wrote to the CEB asking the Board to forward a new power generation plan which aligns with the newest government policy on power generation mix, which the CEB management had rejected, asking that the old electricity generation plan submitted earlier be approved.
The CEB submitted the generation plan 2018-37 in May 2017 and the PUCSL amended and approved the plan in July 2017 after hosting two public consultations.
“It is not ethical to approve the CEB’s generation plan submitted earlier, neglecting public comments and price trends of the world market. Also, the plan has to have 50 percent of renewable energy, according to the government policy direction on energy mix,” PUCSL Director – Tariff and Economic Affairs Kanchana Siriwardane said.
The CEB Engineers’ Union is on a work-to-rule trade union action against the PUCSL asking the regulator to approve their plan without any amendments. The Union says coal power is the cheapest energy source, quoting a unit price of Rs. 7.9. However, the PUCSL says otherwise.
“Well, it is not correct. The CEB officially submits two types of data to the PUCSL. One is forecasted data and the other is actual data. The CEB has officially submitted the actual cost of generation for the last quarter of 2017. So, according to their data, the unit cost for October 2017 was Rs. 12.04 per kilo watt hour, Rs. 16.45 in November and Rs. 14.75 in December,” Siriwardane said.
“When calculated, the average cost is Rs. 14.41 per kilo watt hour. But that number does not reflect the loan that Sri Lanka has taken for the Norochcholai power plant and the interest.”
Speaking about the approved generation plan, the PUCSL said it has not yet been technically challenged by the CEB.
The approved Least Cost Long Term Generation Plan 2018-37 describes a plant mix of 241 MW of hydro, 4,800 MW of liquid natural gas, 425 MW of oil-based power, and 2,897 MW of renewable energy.
The cost of the CEB’s plan stood at Rs. 2,411 billion and the cost of the approved plan was Rs. 2,053 billion, making a difference of Rs. 358 billion to Sri Lanka’s economy.
