Scholarship award programme held

The Sisu Nena Pradeepa scholarship award programme was recently held to felicitate bus conductors drivers and to also award schoolbags, stationery and scholarships to their children.
It was organised by the Southern Provincial Road Transport Authority, in collaboration with the Chief Minister's Office.
Addressing a gathering, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said that bus drivers and conductors do not want their children to do the same job when they grow up, but to give them a better education in the best possible schools so that they could engage in good jobs that would give them a better salary. The Chief Minister further said that it was the duty of the children to concentrate on their education and excel in all the exams they have to face in future.
There are unruly elements in society who are all out to mislead children in the wrong path. Parents should be vigilant to protect their children from such elements.
Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said it was not big people that we require, but good people for the progress of the country and as such, children who receive awards today must concentrate on becoming good people.
"Today, we felicitate the employees who come under the purview of the Southern Province Road Transport Authority as a mark of respect for their services and also to encourage them," he said.
The Chief Minister said that it was the sixth programme and that it was the only such programme launched in Sri Lanka.
He said the wives of drivers and conductors must make up their minds to treat their husbands in the best possible manner when they come back home, because they come back home after engaging in their jobs under trying circumstances.
Southern Provincial Council (SPC) Member S. V. P. Ananda, Southern Provincial Road Transport Authority Chairman Kapila Tyrone de Silva and Director General B. M. A. Raja Kumara were present for the occasion.
