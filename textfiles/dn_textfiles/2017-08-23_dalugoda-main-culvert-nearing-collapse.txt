Dalugoda main culvert nearing collapse

The main culvert at Dalugoda on the Thihagoda-Welletota via Malimbada main road is currently on the verge of collapse. This situation has badly affected motorists, as well as pedestrians, residents complained.
Residents said that road accidents had already occurred at this point as the point of route is very narrow. People urge authorities to put up a new bridge with strong side-walls in place of the dilapidated culvert for the safety of motorists and pedestrians.
According to residents, they can use this route to reach Kadduwa, Malimbada, Kanburupitiya and Akuressa towns. In addition, it is a shortcut to the Godagama interchange of the Southern expressway.
