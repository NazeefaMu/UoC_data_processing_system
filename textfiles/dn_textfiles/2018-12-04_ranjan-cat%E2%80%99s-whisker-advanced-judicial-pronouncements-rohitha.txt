Ranjan the cat’s whisker on advanced judicial pronouncements - Rohitha

If there is anything to clarify about law and order and the judiciary, all including journalists should put their questions to UNP MP Ranjan Ramanayake, because he can predict as to what happens in the judiciary, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana said.
“There is a crucial judgment to be given in December in connection with him and the entire country is waiting for that,” he said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday, Abeygunawardana said that UNP MP Ranjan Ramanayake had also told the media that the Chief Justice’s performance is satisfactory at present and that he is waiting to see his future performance.
“Now the entire country while focused on MP Ramanayake eagerly awaits a General Election to select their representatives,” he said.
MP Abeygunawardana alleged that the price formula introduced by the former Finance MP cannot be understood.
The former Digital Infrastructure MP talks about the country’s President in an unacceptable manner.
May be, he had used dancing oil (Netum Thel) before his speech.
“The Government is ready to face any election and therefore the UNP, JVP and TNA should withdraw their petition from the Supreme Court allowing for the holding of elections,” Abeygunawardana added.
