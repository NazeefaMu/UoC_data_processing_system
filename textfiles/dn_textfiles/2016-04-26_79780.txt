Sebastianites owe their success to coach Imal Boteju

St. Sebastian’s College Moratuwa was crowned as the all island under 19 Limited Overs Schools Champions 2016 in the tournament conducted by Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association for the Singer Trophy.
The architect of their success is none other than their Head Coach Imal Boteju who took over from Nalin Wijesinghe last year.
Imal represented his alma-mater Nalanda College at all levels of cricket whilst at school and led the under 17 ‘B’ cricket team to clinch the all island championship. Leaving school he was employed at Metropolitan Agencies and later shifted to Arpico and played for Colts Cricket Club.
He commenced his coaching in 2003 initially at Colombo International School and then at Nalanda Cricket Academy. Coaching Mahanama College Colombo under 15 cricket team they were runners up in 2012 and Nalanda College under 13 Division one team emerged champions under his guidance.
Under his coaching at St. Sebastian’s along with former Panadura Royalist Manoj Chanaka as his assistant Sebs played nineteen games both traditional and tournament and won two outright, fourteen first innings wins and lost three on first innings. They missed the services of their Star batsman and Skipper Avishka Fernando who was involved in Sri Lanka under 19 cricket and under 19 World Cup. He played only in six matches.
They carried away the major honours at the 66th Big Match against their arch rivals Prince of Wales which ended in a tame draw. Any how they beat Cambrians in the 31st limited overs match convincingly.
In the limited Over under 19 cricket tournament organized by Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association for the Singer Trophy they clinched the championship by beating formidable Trinity College but they lost to them in the Semi Finals at the T/20 Schools cricket tournament. Four players from the School are currently involved in the Provincial Tournament.
He told the Daily News Sports that the former Bro.Director Rev. Fr. Bonnie Fernandopulle, the Prefect of games Rev. Fr. Priyan Tissera, Master in Charge ever green Frank Cooray and the present Bro.Director Rev. Fr. Ranjith Andradi extended their fullest support to achieve his goal.
