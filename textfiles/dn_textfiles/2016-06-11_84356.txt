Colombo Port City investors willing to cancel demand of US$ 163 Mn - Alagiyawanna

The Chinese investors to the Colombo Port City project at its initial stage demanded for a US$ 163 million compensation, but had later expressed their willingness to cancel the demand, Parliament was informed yesterday.
Megalopolis Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, made this observation yesterday in Parliament, responding to a question raised by Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila during the round of questions for oral answers.
“The demand was made initially by the investors, but during discussions they had with Sri Lankan authorities, they expressed their willingness to cancel it,” the Deputy Minister said. “Besides that, we could negotiate with them to grant the 20 hectare land on a 99 year lease basis which the previous government had promised give it outright to them. He said, "so far no fresh agreement had been signed by the incumbent Government with the investors, but the Government might do so in the future.” A committee headed by the Secretary to the Prime Minister had already begun negotiations with Colombo Port City investors with an objective of signing a fresh agreement,” the Deputy Minister said. “I don't agree with Gammanpila's statement that the delaying of the project had discouraged the investors, as the project had been initiated without proper environment reports.”
He also said that a fresh environmental assessment had been conducted on the project and the interested persons could obtain it from the Central Environment Authority or from the Parliament Library.
