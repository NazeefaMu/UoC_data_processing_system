Man in deathtrap robbed house

A person who entered a house saying that he was chased by a gang to kill him has robbed the house of gold items worth Rs. 568,000, Gandara police said.
When the owner of the house, a woman, returned after closing her café at a nearby place, she had seen a person with tattoos and long beard was sitting on the doorsteps of her house. He had told her that a gang was chasing him to kill him and asked her for a glass of water.
While she was bringing the water for the man, he had run and fled the scene on a motorcycle. Then the woman had seen that the door of her cupboard was open and checked to find that the man had taken two gold bangles, one bracelet, four rings and two chains which were in a cup in the cupboard.
Gandara police are investigating.
