Off beat artistic coffee mugs

These gorgeous coffee mugs mimic the natural beauty of crystals and metals. They look just as much like sculptures as they do mugs. Want to feel fancy in the mornings? Drinking your coffee from one of these should be all you need.
Self-taught sculptor Katie Marks has been handcrafting coffee mugs which instead of dangling over your kitchen sink, could easily be placed in the middle of an art gallery.
Inspired by the world around her, Katie crafts these exquisite mugs layer by layer, either glazing breathtaking galaxies on them, or hand forming delicate crystals on the sides. “I love the fact that I can take a lump of dirt and turn it into something unique and beautiful from my brain,” Marks said.
She started her sculpting career after finding a pottery wheel on Craigslist, which she worked without any formal training. This led her to a production potter, where she got a job as a studio assistant and learned everything from glaze chemistry to kiln firing.
But if you want to take your morning coffee out of one of Katie’s works, you’re gonna have to be quick. Because the forever growing fanbase of her ceramics at her Silver Lining Ceramics Etsy shop is prone to snatch any new creation of hers in mere minutes.
