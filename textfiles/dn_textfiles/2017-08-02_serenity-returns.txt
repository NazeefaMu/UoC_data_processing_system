Serenity returns

The royal banquet is in full swing. Suddenly a messenger appears to inform the king to indicate something catastrophic. Despite everyone’s discord, the king sets off to the battle. Later on, a triumphant king returns to the palace and is approached by a courtesan en route. The young female tells a tale about the queen and chief minister. Led by anguish, the king orders both chief minister and the queen to be executed. That only invites horror into the palace. The king and the whole royal palace became plagued with the horrors.
