Welgama’s remarks detrimental to JO - Gammanpila

The remarks made by UPFA MP Kumara Welgama on his opposition to the possible Presidential candidacy of ex-Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa are unfounded and detrimental to the progress of the Joint Opposition (JO), Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said yesterday.
Joint Opposition MP Kumara Welgama recently said there was no point in talking about former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa becoming a candidate at the next Presidential election as he was a US citizen and therefore ineligible to contest.
Addressing a news briefing in Colombo, Gammanpila said Welgama’s comments can create a rift within the JO.
Gammanpila said that Welgama had been advised not to make such disparaging remarks on several occasions. “Welgama worked hard for the uplift of the JO. This is why we did not comment on his remarks. But, if he continues in this manner, irrespective of what he has done for the party, we have to take action,” he added.
Kalutara district MP Welgama during a public event recently said former President Rajapaksa should not talk about fielding a member of his own family as the next Presidential hopeful.
He said family bandyism is not suitable for the country and former President Rajapaksa faced defeat at the last Presidential election due to this family centred rule.
