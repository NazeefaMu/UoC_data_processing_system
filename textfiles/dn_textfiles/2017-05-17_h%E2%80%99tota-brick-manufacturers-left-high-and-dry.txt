H’tota brick manufacturers left high and dry

Brick manufacturers in the Hambantota district are left high and dry as a result of restrictions imposed on soil mining and transport.
They said it was the brick production that kept their home fires burning and that they have been left high and dry because wildlife officials prohibit soil transportation.
They said wildlife department officials often file action against them. They added that they have no time to engage in brick manufacturing as they often have to appear in court. Manufacturers said thousands of families engaged in the industry are badly affected.
