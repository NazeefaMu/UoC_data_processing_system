Sri Lankan alternative for ‘Mixed-Voting system’

It is learned that the proposed, imported ‘Mixed-Voting system’, is designed to elect more than 225 parliamentarians through FPP and PR on an ad hoc 50:50 basis. The declared objective of FPP is to assign an MP from the area to be responsible for each electorate. In our view, the introduction of this complex system merely to assign central Government MPs to peripheral electorates through a high-cost General election exercise is preposterous, superfluous and meaningless, as it leads to, MPs usurping the main role of some 455 Provincial Councillors and of 4486 local Govt. members at grass root level who are already unproductive.
The latter figures work out to an average of 26 politicians for each electorate! Now, it is shuddering to hear that the number of local Govt. members will increase by another 3,500 to inter-alia accommodate female members.
As a result, each electorate will have 44 unproductive politicians in the future! People never asked for these frightful increases in the numbers of our unproductive politicians breeding bribery and corruption at the expense of the Tax-payer. Besides, a practical necessity for MPs to maintain an ‘Umbilical cord’ connection with the grass root level voters should not arise at a time the ‘Preference Voting’ system stands to be abolished.
Unproductive political fraternity
Surely, it is not good governance to duplicate functions on the one hand and waste tax payer’s money on the other, on the expansion of the infrastructure to accommodate the increasing numbers of our unproductive political fraternity. The writer has submitted a comprehensive package of proposals on Electoral reforms several times during the recent past through the press with copies to Public Committee on constitutional reforms, Constitutional Assembly, Election Commission, President’s office, PM’s office a few concerned Party offices, Civil Organisations and individuals to of no avail. In essence, the proposals address the following important national imperatives triggering from our emerging political culture, which are not adequately dealt with under the imported ‘Mixed Voting’ system which is practiced only in 30 countries out of 213!
Resolving ethnic conflict by mandatory recognition of equality of all citizens of Sri Lanka as ‘Sri Lankans’ bereft of Race, Religion or Caste differences by giving an equal value to all votes at any General or Provincial Council election buttressed with the introduction of an all-party Cabinet (35 to 40 Portfolios) based on proportionate national vote obtained by each party big or small.
Introduction of ‘Grama Rajya’ concept acceptable to all communities by depoliticizing Local Govt. elections to allow independent persons to be elected as ward members by the local people supported by steps to increase the efficiency of much-maligned Public Service, Police and the judiciary. With depoliticisation, the present fiasco of delaying LG elections would never have occurred!
Improving the effectiveness of Provincial Councils which now remain as white-elephants by streamlining the existing Decentralized Political administration with specific allocation of functions to avoid duplication and wastage of resources.
Decentralized budgets for provinces to be effectively utilised by discontinuing separate allocations for MPs at the centre.
Hoodwinking the voter by false promises to be stopped by transforming Party ‘Election Manifestos’ to legally enforceable documents.
Wasteful and unproductive electoral system to be replaced by simple, cost and time saving electoral reforms such as substituting Preference Voting system with ‘District merit lists of Parties’ carrying names of political professionals selected under robust national criteria leading to avoidance of Bi-elections, ‘Hung-Parliament’ and ‘Crossovers’ et al.
Reducing exorbitant, unproductive expenditure incurred by the political fraternity by rationalising the numbers, salaries, allowances and the role responsibilities of all politicians including the Cabinet.
Cutting down wasteful expenditure by holding Elections on specified dates.
Simplifying the work-load of the Elections Dept. paving the way for Election results to be announced before midnight.
Removing the draconian powers remaining, if any, of Executive Presidency while maintaining the post to deal with Provincial Governors and other executive functions to ensure enhanced productivity of the country as a whole.
Making Executive President a ‘Statesman’ cum ‘Care Taker’ by prohibiting participation in Party politics during his tenure of office.
Steering committee deliberations
Readers will appreciate that the above proposals constitute a ‘Model’ of our own anvil with Social equality, Justice, simplicity and passion for high productivity forming its Metal Plates. Therefore, looking for examples from other countries is superfluous.
At last, we are happy to learn that citizen concerns will be addressed at steering committee deliberations after the current session of the constituent assembly. We therefore, appeal to all sensible citizens, academics, politicians and civil activists to carefully study the above proposals with an open mind and persuade the authorities to dispense with the redundant and complex ‘Mixed-Voting’ system that will breed more unproductive politicians draining the resources of our country already burdened with a colossal debt portfolio and low productivity.
