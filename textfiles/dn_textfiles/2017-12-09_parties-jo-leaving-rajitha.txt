Parties in JO leaving: Rajitha

"Several parties in the Joint Opposition (JO) are leaving `opportunists' politics'. We will see how many remain to contest the 2020 elections once the investigations on corruption end. This Government will rule the country till 2025," Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratn said.
The Minister was addressing the UNP Balamandala (General Committee) meeting held at Sucharitha Hall, Keselwatta yesterday under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.
He said the Middle Eastern countries ended dictatorships in January 2015 through revolutions but Sri Lankan people ended it in peace. The President and the Prime Minister got together and created the National Government to develop the country.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that Germany has a national government and Indian Prime Minister wants to have one but he meets so many difficulties.
"The UNP face the election in a victorious path because several parties in the JO have strugged against `opportunists' politics'. Some ask what this Government did. They calculate everything by the price of coconut and rice. This Government increased the salaries of public servants by Rs. 10,000 and reduced the pries of gas, fuel among others," he said.
He said the Government increased the Mahapola Scholarship and Samurdhi grants.
"The expenditure of the present President is far less than the previous. The previous gave lifts to rapists and robbers in his vehicle. Wasim Thajudeen was murdered since he was an excellent ruggerist. Many media personnel speak to culprits who come out after giving evidence. Only three media personnel report the evidence given at commissions," he said.
