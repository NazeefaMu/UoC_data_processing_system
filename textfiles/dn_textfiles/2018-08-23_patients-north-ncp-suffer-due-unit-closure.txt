UNDERGRAD’S ATTACK ON NEURO SURGEON
PATIENTS IN NORTH, NCP    SUFFER DUE TO UNIT CLOSURE

Around 800 patients who were receiving treatment at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital’s Neurosurgical Unit have been inconvenienced due to its temporary closure.
Consultant Neurosurgeon Dr. Yohan Koralage, who heads the Unit, was injured following an attack by a gang of undergraduates on August 3. Dr. Koralage sustained serious injuries from the attack by some students in Hilda Obeysekarapura Mawatha in Peradeniya-Galaha Road. He received treatment at Kandy and Colombo National Hospitals.Anuradhapura Hospital sources said that it would take about another two months for the full recovery of the Consultant as his hand had been injured and he finds it difficult to perform complex surgeries.
This had led to the suspension of all scheduled surgeries at the hospital and critical patients with head injuries are being transferred to the Colombo National Hospital. Dr Koralage was treating neuro-patients coming from Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Vavuniya, Puttalam, Jaffna and Mannar districts.
Patients who had been inconvenienced due to the absence of the doctor expressed their strong displeasure over the unruly attack by undergrads.
Meanwhile, One of the students who allegedly attacked Anuradhapura Neurosurgeon was taken into custody by Girandurukotte police yesterday. Accordingly, three student suspects who were involved in this attack which took place at the Peradeniya University premises are in remand custody.
The suspects are scheduled to be produced before the Mahiyanganaya Magistrate today(23).
