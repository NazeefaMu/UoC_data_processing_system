Cambrians enter under 15 semi-finals

 Price of Wales College has booked a berth in the semi finals of the on going inter schools under 15 division one cricket tournament when they bet Mahinda College, Galle by six wickets and worked off at Veyangoda.
The Cambrians captain Tharindu Amerasinghe played a vital role for their success. He opens batting and he is a left hander and bowls off spin occasionally. Cambrians played twelve matches and the match against Dharmapala Vidyalaya Kottawa washed away due to rain and he scored 497 runs with the top score of 128 versus St. Aloysius College Galle and he collected two fifties. He missed a well deserved century by ten runs against Kalutara Vidyalaya and his average was 45.2.
Cambrians are coached by former Cambrians Kalpa Fernando and this is the third successive instance that they reached the semi finals.
Mahinda College – 155 in 48.5 overs: Navod Paranavithana 64, Sandupa Jayan 20, Pasindu Pathum 4/26, Sandas Bandara 3/30).
Prince of Wales – 156/4 in 43.2 overs – Pasindu Pathum 68 n/o, Dinura Fernando 36, Navod Paranavithana 2/37)
