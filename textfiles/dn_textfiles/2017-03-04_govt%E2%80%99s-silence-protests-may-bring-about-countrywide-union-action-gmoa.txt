Govt.’s silence to protests may bring about countrywide union action: GMOA

If the relevant authorities follow a deaf, dumb and blind policy towards the anti SAITM protests, there is a danger of taking more serious countrywide trade union action soon, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
He said so while addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday morning. He said that even the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) had revealed that SAITM did not have the authority to offer degrees, as reported by the media recently. The Government should immediately take over this fraudulent institution and put it under a state mechanism, he said.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the SAITM issue could be solved quickly and easily by gazetting the minimum standards of medical education in Sri Lanka, adding the Health Minister’s signature to the Report issued by the Technical Committee of the Sri Lanka Medical Council on SAITM in order to make it legal and informing Courts that SAITM lacked the authority to offer degrees (this should be done by the Higher Education Minister). The former Higher Education Minister S.B. Dissanayake had used his powers arbitrarily.
The four hour strike launched in Western Province state hospitals yesterday, extended till last midnight due to the silence of the relevant authorities towards the SAITM issue. The protest walk commenced from near the Colombo National Hospital and ended at the Viharamaha Devi Park. The protest rally was held with a large number of protesters at the Viharamaha Devi Park in Colombo yesterday. The roads leading to Town Hall, Maradana and Punchi Borella, were blocked due to the protest.
