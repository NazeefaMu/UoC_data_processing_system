JR’s grandson to contest forthcoming elections under SLFP

The late President J. R. Jayewardene’s grandson, Pradeep Jayewardene, yesterday said he would contest the upcoming Colombo Municipal Council elections in January under the SLFP.
Jayewardene, who is SLFP organiser for the Gampaha district, held the position of Sri Lanka Consul General in Frankfurt, Germany under the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s government.
Addressing a media briefing held at the Colombo Swimming Club, Pradeep was of the opinion that his entry into politics at the local level would help him in his campaign against the new Constitution.
“The country will be unmanageable if the Executive Presidency is abolished and power further devolved,” Jayewardene said and added that the Government should not even talk about a new Constitution at this time.
He said constitutional making process had no consensus and the various parties were so opposed to each other that there was no way they could agree on a common document.
Jayewardene said his grandfather would have never agreed to a new Constitution and that there was no need for a new one, “In 1972, we needed one to establish a republic, in 1978 to form the Executive Presidency which brought stability to the country. It helped us concentrate on economic development. There is no justifiable reasons to have a new one now,” he said.
He said a new Constitution would not solve the ethnic problem in the country. He said the 13th Amendment was the best and the Government should not move away from the word ‘unitary’ and use the words ‘ekiya’ in Sinhala and ‘Orumitha nadu’ in Tamil instead. He saw a plot to divide the country through such means.
Jayewardene said that granting land rights to the people through a new Constitution would only take away valuable state land in the North. "They must be developed and hand over to the people there," he said.
He said he would work with all parties to fight against the new Constitution though he no longer believed in the UNP, which has sought to abandon his grandfather’s Constitution.
