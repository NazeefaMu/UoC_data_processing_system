Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh's birthday plans in Sri Lanka

 
The couple had brought in the New Year in Maldives with their respective families, sparking off speculations of an impending engagement. Close on the heels of the Bollywood wedding of the year, comes news of another A-list wedding in the offing.
Speculations are rife that actor-couple and frequent co-stars Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone are set to celebrate the latter’s 32nd birthday by getting engaged at a private island in Sri Lanka today.
Over the last three years, the couple who hit it off on the sets of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Goliyon Ki Rasleela: Ram-Leela, have made a yearly ritual of celebrating each other’s birthdays together.
While Ranveer’s spokesperson denied news of the engagement to Mirror, we’ve learnt that after bringing in New Year’s Eve swimming and snorkelling over a six-day getaway at an extremely private beach resort in the Noonu Atoll island of Maldives with their respective parents in tow, the couple arrived in Sri Lanka on Thursday. The duo who will next be seen as Allauddin Khilji and Padmavati in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s upcoming historical romance Padmavati, took off for the Maldives vacation separately.
Pictures of Ranveer, bumping into Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani at Sri Lanka’s Katunayake airport on his way to the destination, had led to the buzz that he and his ladylove would be in the country for New Year’s Eve.
But a source from the Maldives International airport confirmed to Mirror that Ranveer and Deepika, along with their respective families, arrived in the archipelagos on December 28 and headed out to their resort in the blue lagoon, surrounded by reefs, in a private jet.
Deepika, who had brought in Christmas with a midnight mass at a church in Vienna, took connecting flights via Colombo to unite with her beau in the island country.
The families were booked at the resort until January 3.
“This isn’t the first time that the actors, along with their families, are holidaying overseas. Last year, the bunch had taken a trip to London together and has stayed at this resort three-four times in the past. The couple indulges in windsurfing and canoeing, along with sunbathing on the pristine beaches, spending time at the fitness and spa centre, both of which boast of a lagoon view. Ranveer and Deepika love the privacy the island offers, along with water sports like waterskiing and diving off a catamaran, among other adventures,” informed a source close to the couple, adding that the exotic holiday destination is a favourite among European royalty as well.
