BeWaxed  opens first outstation branch

Sri Lanka’s premier waxing salon BeWaxed recently opened its very first outstation branch in the hill capital of Kandy. The outlet located at 327 William Gopallawa Mawatha, Kandy was declared open by Founder of the waxing salon Durga Kenny. Kandy’s first exclusive ladies waxing salon is conveniently located just 1.5km from the Kandy Town and is easily accessible.
Speaking at the opening ceremony Durga said, “Ever since we opened our very first waxing salon 5 years ago, women from around the country have been asking us when we would expand to locations closer to them. Taking our exclusive services outside of Colombo and in to other key cities has always been in the pipeline and Kandy is only the first of many we have planned to open in key cities. We are also looking at targeting tourist hotspots for international clients looking for luxurious waxing services.”
The fully-fledged Kandy branch will provide the complete range of BeWaxed services including waxes, scrubs and packs. The branch managed by staff trained by Durga herself will be open from 9am to 6pm from Tuesday to Sunday.
