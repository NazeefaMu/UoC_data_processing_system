We changed our lengths and pace to stop the sweeps – Sandakan

Sri Lanka had certainly learnt from their mistakes fast. They successfully managed to stop the Zimbabwean batsmen from using the sweep and reverse sweep shots that eventually led to them dismissing the opponents for a mediocre total of 155 and then going on to win the second ODI by seven wickets at the Galle International Stadium yesterday.
Man of the Match Lakshan Sandakan who was the chief destroyer of the Zimbabwe innings finishing with career best figures of 4 for 52 explained, “We had a few plans against their batters. We carried them out very well I thought. They were scoring heavily off the sweeps, we identified that and the deal was to bowl a lot more slower.
“We bowled wicket to wicket and we wanted to stop some of those shots. The plan was to bowl straight and bowl it slower. We tried changing the field and then slowed the ball a bit and changed our lengths. Didn’t try to do too much, but length and pace was important and it worked for us today.”
Comparing the first ODI and the second Sandakan said, “We batted well the last game, but they outplayed us totally. They had come prepared to play our spinners well. If you see, they didn’t play straight to our spinners, they were always playing across and it paid off. That was good planning and we had to adjust today.”
The Zimbabweans who came face to face with Sandakan for the first time couldn’t fathom his deliveries.
“I think they struggled to pick me off the hand. Every game I get, I try to do my best and get as many wickets as possible,” said Sandakan who fell so ill that he could not train and was sent home thus missing the first ODI.
“When you are playing after a long break, you need confidence. I was given a lot of confidence. I tried bowling the usual stuff and it all worked well for me.”
Talking through the hat-trick performed by debutant Wanindu Hasaranga, Sandakan said, “When someone is debuting he is under pressure. He managed the pressure well and bowled his googlies, flippers and leg-spin well. There was lots of support for him. Everyone needs a bit of support when on debut.”
We didn’t pick Sandakan’s deliveries - Cremer
Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer admitted that his batsmen failed to pick up the deliveries of left-arm chinaman Lakshan Sandakan which led to their defeat in the second ODI at Galle.
“Our guys didn’t pick him that well because he is a lot different to what we are used to. We haven’t faced a lot of him he was a bit of a mystery to us,” said Cremer at the post-match press conference. “They took enough runs off him but he just bowled the wicket taking balls and we gave him a few soft wickets in that middle period.”
Commenting on debutant Wanindu Hasaranga’s hat-trick, the Zimbabwe captain said, “To get a hat- trick on debut that’s something special. He looked a little bit nervous when he started, it’s understandable but credit to him. He stuck at it and the skipper having faith in him to keep him on and to clean up the back end of the innings was excellent.”
Defending the ploy of sweeps and reverse sweeps which the Zimbabwe batsmen failed to employ yesterday, Cremer said, “Thought the wicket was a little bit different and we didn’t adjust early enough. We should have hit the ball down the ground a bit more. Maybe we will stop playing those shots it’s just one of those things. At one stage we could have batted off the overs. 230 could have been a decent score but we lost too many wickets in the middle.”
Looking ahead at the remaining three matches in the series, Cremer said, “First we will have a look at the wicket I can’t see too many changes to our team maybe change strategy a little bit. Have a look at Sandakan and those guys and see how we can play them. We will come up with a good plan and then hopefully it will come off in the next couple of games.”
Cremer confirmed that left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza who injured his ankle at practice had gone home and been replaced by 22-year-old right-arm fast bowler Carl Mumba.
