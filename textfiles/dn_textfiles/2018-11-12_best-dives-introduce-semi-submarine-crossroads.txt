Best Dives to introduce semi-submarine at Crossroads

As part of an initiative to acquaint visitors with the breath-taking underwater lives in the Maldives, Best Dives Pvt Ltd is to introduce a semi-submarine as part of the company’s excursion activities at Crossroards.
Crossroads, the largest integrated destination in the Maldives, developed by premier property development and investment holding company Singha Estate Public Company Limited, is set to redefine the Maldives’ vacation experience and captivate the international family-leisure markets to the Maldives.
“We are very keen on attracting holiday makers from Sri Lanka, both those residing in Sri Lanka as well as expatriate Sri Lankans. The proximity between the two countries is definitely an attraction, while there is no doubt that the Maldives is one of the world’s leading up market tourist destinations. Sri Lankans wishing to make the short trip to the Maldives could avail themselves of this exciting new holiday excursion opportunity”, said Thiti Thongbenjamas, Chief Operating Officer of Crossroads. Thongbenjamas also went on to say that the Crossroads development would present exciting new career opportunities for Sri Lankans who are known for their proficiency in the hospitality industry.
The project is scheduled to open in Q1 of 2019 and has much to offer nearby visitors coming on day trips, including water excursion activities, international restaurants and cafés, and a very exclusive shopping experience featuring global brands.
The new semi-submarine is intended to provide an introductory experience to visitors who are keen to see the rich underwater lives in the Maldives. The semi-submarine will acquaint hesitant visitors to the joys of experiencing the diverse ecosystem that inhabits the oceans surrounding the islands. Best Dives expects the semi-submarine to be an excellent stepping stone to other water sports such as snorkelling and SCUBA diving.
Best Dives was appointed by Singha Estate to provide a wide-range of water activities and excursions for the CROSSROADS project. This includes SCUBA diving, motorized and non-motorized water sports activities and various excursions that will showcase the natural beauty of the Maldives both above and underwater, as well as the unique Maldivian cultures.
Best Dives is one of the leading and fastest growing diving and water sports companies in the Maldives. The Gold and Silver Awards winner for the Leading Activity/Water sports Centre by the South Asian Travel Awards 2018, Best Dives has had an established Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and emergency action plans for every recreational activity they offer. Best Dives maintains a special focus on the security and safety of all aspects of the company’s operations.
“At this point, things are starting to take shape. This submersible submarine is a key addition to the experience that CROSSROADS is offering. Lots of key aspects are starting to come into play to be ready for next year’s opening. Seeing partners come together to make this happen is a wonderful feeling,” said Thongbenjamas.
