The discussion was held for nearly three hours. After the discussion, Minister Jayawickrama said that Kataragama was a place where the Buddah had visited and there, invaluable things had been treasured by King Dutugamunu in the past. He said that therefore, they had to keep the respect of the place. He added, in the past also there were difference of opinions between kapuralas and Basnayake nilames, but this problem had aggravated due to the intervention of outside people.
Jayawickrama said that there were five senior kapuralas to conduct the rituals of of each month of the year. So it was decided to give five excess months for five kapuralas whose fathers were dead, from those recently appointed.
There would be a special fund called 'Sacred City Development Fund' and each kapumahattaya should contribute Rs. 2 million to this fund at the end of their months. The Basnayake Nilame had consented to contribute Rs. 50 million for each year.
This money would be utilized to construct houses and promote infrastructure facilities for low-income families in Katargama.
