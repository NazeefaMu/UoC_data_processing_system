PM unveils COMBANK ATM at Welisara

Commercial Bank of Ceylon has installed an automated teller machine (ATM) at the refurbished Sathosa Mega Outlet in Welisara. The Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe unveiled this ATM.
The Commercial Bank ATM network is the largest owned by a private bank in Sri Lanka.
Commercial Bank has established many ATMs outside its branch network, mainly in public places such as bus stands and railway stations to facilitate customers’ and non customers’ access to their money.
In addition to withdrawals, the Bank’s ATM machines enable convenient settlement of utility bills, and Commercial Bank Credit Card payments 24-hours a day.
The ATM network of the Bank has been upgraded to EMV Chip capability, significantly enhancing security against fraud by conforming to the EMV standards of the various card brands that it accepts.
