CR crashes to third loss in a row – lose to Navy 34/37

CR&FC crashed to their third successive defeat in a row when they went down by 34 points (5 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 37 (3 tries, 2 conversions, 5 penalties, 1 drop goal) to Navy Sports Club in a Dialog ‘A’ division inter-club league rugby second round match played at CR & FC grounds. Longden Place yesterday, Navy led 21-19 at the breather.
It was an awesome performance orchestrated by Navy with a fabulous display of fast open rugby throughout the game where they totally dominated the set pieces through their heavy forwards who combined effectively with their entire three quarter line and totally dominated the game simply overrunning the opposition at will in the last quarter.
The CR coach did not lay out any defensive plans or attacking rugby and proved that he has failed miserably as the head coach throughout this year's entire league where he took out fly half Ashan de Costa who had a good game and replaced him in the second half due to reasons only known to him. This move spoiled the superb pattern of play that the red shirts carried out.
CR players are capable of doing wonders for the club but lack a good head coach who is capable of fine tuning the players in order to get the entire team to rally around and play as one unit rather than playing in patches.
For the winning Navy team the tries were scored by fly half Chanaka Chandimal (one), hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe (one) and winger Supun Dilshan (one). Full back Thilina Wijesinghe put over two conversions and the five penalties. The solitary drop goal was fired across by Chandimal.
Number eight Omalka Gunaratne (two), winger Anuradha Herath (one), flanker Shemal Weerasekara (one) and winger Randhitha Warnapura (one) scored the tries for CR. The three conversions and the penalty was put over by full back Nalin Kumara.
