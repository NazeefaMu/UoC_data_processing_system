Taylor replaces Malinga in Mumbai Indians IPL team

New Delhi, Wednesday: West Indies fast bowler Jerome Taylor on Wednesday signed for the Mumbai Indians, replacing Lasith Malinga who was ruled out of this season's Indian Premier League (IPL) with a knee injury.
The 31-year-old Taylor will join the Ricky Ponting-coached side for the rest of the Twenty20 tournament after the required paperwork was completed, India's cricket board said in a statement.
The Jamaican played just one match for the West Indies, in the group stages, during the World Twenty20 earlier this month when the Caribbean side clinched the title for the second time, defeating England in the final.
Taylor has played in previous IPL editions, representing the Kings XI Punjab and the former Pune Warriors franchises. Sri Lankan veteran Malinga returned to Colombo after the first three IPL matches without having played in the tournament to recover from the lingering injury that also kept him out of the World T20 held in India.
