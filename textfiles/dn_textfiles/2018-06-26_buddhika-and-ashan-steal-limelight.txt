Colombo Supercross – 2018
Buddhika and Ashan steal the limelight

The Colombo Super Cross 2018 organized by Sri Lanka Navy along with Sri Lanka Association of Racing Drivers and Riders (SLARDAR} and Nuwara Eliya Motor Sports Club ended on a grand scale at the Navy Super Cross Track with Driver Ashan Silva and Rider Buddhika Kasun Silva taking major honours.
It was a day filled with thrills and spills as both drivers and riders had to use all their skills and strength to race on a track that was not supportive for them to reach peak form due to wet conditions
All leading Drivers and Riders who are aiming to win the ‘Hutch Sri Lanka Super Series 2018’ were in action as the points gained from this meet are added to the Championship points table for the Series Title.
Ashan Silva who heads the points table for the Motor Cars Series Championship gathered the maximum points winning both races in the Group SL GT Cars with ease. The other drivers were way back Ashan as most of the other drivers had difficulties in controlling their machines due to soggy conditions. The winner Ashan was on pole position maintained his position from the word go to be the easy winner in both races.
The most thrilling racing was witnessed in two wheeler events with all leading Riders in action challenging each other in almost every event to get to the front. Last year’s Champion rider Shanuka Sandaruwan had to face many challenges from young riders in the calibre of Ishan Dassanayake, Buddhika Kasun Silva, Lahiru Jeewantha and Sameera Premaratne.
He was over ridden by Buddhika who also went on to win the Colombo Super Cross 2018 Championship.
The final race of the day saw former National Champion Rider Gayan Sandaruwan the founder of the Colombo Super Cross Track and coach of the Sri Lanka Navy Motor Racing team competing along with up and coming riders. Using his experience to the maximum he managed to reach the podium as a runner up in the biggest event of the day for Motorcycles.
