ANC Education and CIM in partnership

The ANC Education and the Chartered Institute of Marketing have entered into a partnership with the aspiration to build awareness and share industry know-how and to provide the CIM students who have completed the Professional Diploma in Marketing (Second Stage of CIM) entry on to the MBA programme offered by ANC in collaboration with the University of West London [UWL]. 
“This is yet another extension of our many corporate partnerships and it is unique in that no other MBA programme in Sri Lanka offers this particular entry path way to CIM Stage II students”, said CEO and Executive Director ANC, Dr Punarjeeva Karunanayake.
“We see this as an opportunity to work closely with the marketing fraternity in providing higher education opportunities, while CIM students as well as graduates will have a pathway to obtain a MBA qualification and progress in their chosen career”, said Dr Karunanayake. 
“We are pleased to be associated with ANC Education, an educational conglomerate specializing in providing the best of international undergraduate and postgraduate education through it’s partnerships with some of the leading universities world-wide” said Brian Selvanayagam, Chairman of CIM Sri Lanka.”
As the leading transnational education service provider in Sri Lanka, ANC offers a range of internationally recognized Masters Level Degree programmes in Business and Law which could be availed of by CIM students.
The University of West London is recognized by the University Grants Commission of Sri Lanka and is listed in the Commonwealth Universities Yearbook as well as the International Handbook of Universities . This joint collaboration by two leading educational institutions such as ANC and CIM can only serve to prepare and propel local students for and into the international career arena.
