Once in a lifetime cast

A new film premiering soon starring Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen aims to stir up new feelings in people over 60.
The four lifelong friends have gathered for years in a monthly book club, but breaking out of the norm, Jane Fonda’s character introduces them to “Fifty Shades of Gray,” which stirs up feelings about what they actually want during their ‘Golden Years.’
The book club begins to change their attitudes, and the new outlook corresponds to new men who’ve arrived on the scene. Andy Garcia, Don Johnson, Richard Dreyfuss and Craig Nelson star as the four men who are attracted toward the women in this newly blossoming stage of their life.
