ASIRI HOSPITAL HOLDINGS to  amalgamate Asiri Hospital Kandy

The Board of Directors of Asiri Hospital Holdings PLC and Asiri Hospital Kandy (Private) Limited have resolved to amalgamate Asiri Hospital Kandy (Private) Limited (fully owned subsidiary of Asiri Hospital Holdings PLC) with Asiri Hospital Holdings PLC, in terms of Section 242(1) of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 (the “Act”) on September 28, 2018 whereby Asiri Hospital Holdings PLC will remain and Asiri Hospital Kandy (Private) Limited will cease to exist.
The amalgamation is to be effective upon the Registrar General of Companies issuing the Certificate of Amalgamation in terms of Section 244(2) of the Act subsequent to filing necessary documents with the Registrar General of Companies. The delay in making the disclosure to GSE is due to obtaining Certificate of Solvency required for this purpose from the Auditors.
Further announcement in this regard will be made to the CSE in due course.
