Dhamma education to be made compulsory

Provincial Councils countrywide have agreed to make dhamma education compulsory for students. All Chief Ministers put forward this proposal to President Maithripala Sirisena at the recently held 33rd Chief Ministers’ Conference.
The proposal was unanimously approved for implementation and necessary steps are being taken to draft due rules and regulations to be implemented in this regard.
The NWP-PC has already taken steps to ban private tuition classes on Sunday morning till 2.00 p.m. Accordingly, all leading private tuition classes have been instructed officially not to conduct classes on Sundays till 2.00 p.m., said Dharmasiri Dassanayake, speaking at a meeting of Dhamma School teachers of the Kurunegala District held recently in Hettipola of Kurunegala.
He added “We need to create a generation of morally civilized future citizens in this country and the decision to make Dhamma Education compulsory was taken. All prelates of all Chapters have praised this timely decision," the Chief Minister of the NWP-PC pointed out.
