SLC U23 division one limited overs tournament: SSC, CCC, Chilaw Marians and Army reach semi-finals

 
SSC, Chilaw Marians, CCC and Army SC qualified to play in the semi-finals of the SLC Under 23 division I limited overs tournament after the conclusion of the quarterfinals yesterday.
In the semi-final line-up for July 22 SSC will meet Chilaw Marians in one match at the NCC grounds and CCC will play Army SC at the SSC grounds. The final is scheduled for July 24.
In yesterday’s quarterfinals CCC, Chilaw Marians and SSC scored easy wins over SLPACC, Navy SC and NCC respectively while the fourth match between Army SC and Saracens turned out to be a thriller with the soldiers edging out a gallant Saracens unit by eight runs at the NCC grounds.
After Leo Fransisco (63) and Shasin Dilranga (64) had put on 113 for the second wicket to give Army a decent score of 243-9, Saracens began badly losing the first four wickets for 50 before recovering to 183-5 in 43 overs through half-centuries from Sangeeth Cooray, Ishan Nilaksha and Tharushan Iddamalgoda. But they could not sustain the pace and were dismissed for 235 in 49.4 overs falling to the left-arm orthodox spin of Sanjika Ridma who finished with four wickets for 54. In the clash between traditional rivals SSC came out on top defeating NCC by five wickets. SSC chased down the highest total of the day 244-6 with wicket-keeper K Sanjula leading the way with a fluent 106 off 131 balls (11 fours) and sharing a 97-run fourth wicket stand with A Punchihewage (53).
