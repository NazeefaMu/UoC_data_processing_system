Former  Dy. Minister’s travel ban revoked

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday, issued an order directing the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to revoke the travel ban imposed on former Deputy Minister Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan alias Karuna Amman.
Filing a motion before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the FCID made a request to revoke former the Deputy Minister’s travel ban citing that he had been released from the case under the instructions of the Attorney General.
On October 30 last year, Court ordered the release of former Deputy Minister from a case over his alleged involvement in the misuse of a Presidential Secretariat bullet proof armed vehicle worth Rs.90 million, taking into consideration the instructions given by the Attorney General.
The former Deputy Minister was arrested by the FCID on November last year over the allegation that he failed to return the vehicle to the Presidential Secretariat following the loss of his ministerial position in 2015. The FCID had further alleged that the former Deputy Minister had failed to return the said vehicle until August 2016 by violating the provisions of the Public Property Act.
