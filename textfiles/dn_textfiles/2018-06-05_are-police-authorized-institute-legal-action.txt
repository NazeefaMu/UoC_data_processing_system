Offences under the Excise Ordinance
Are Police authorized to institute legal action ?

At present, the authority of Police in instituting legal actions under the Excise Ordinance, is being debated and the majority Magistrate Courts entertain the plaints, filed by Officers in Charge of Police Stations, whereas the plaints are not accepted in some jurisdictions on the ground of non-empowerment of Police. Therefore, the article endeavours to analyze the legal provisions and the case laws related to the contemporary issue concerning excise offences with the role and the functions of Sri Lanka Police.
Sri Lanka Police
The concept of policing in Sri Lanka started with the Dutch ruling and the Dutch appointed paid guards to protect the Colombo city in 1659. Thereafter, police functions came to be clearly defined by the British with the regulation No. 14 of 1806. Subsequently, Police Ordinance was enacted and the Ceylon Police Department (Force) was established in 1866. However, after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution, Police Department has been re-named as Sri Lanka Police in 2016.
Empowerment of Police
Deputy Inspector General of Police Ajith Rohana 
The absolute term of Police is the section 56 of the Police Ordinance, which states:
Every police officer shall for all purposes in this Ordinance contained be considered to be always on duty, and shall have the powers of a police officer in every part of Sri Lanka, It shall be his duty;
(a) to use his best endeavours and ability to prevent all crimes, offences, and public nuisances;
(b) to preserve the peace;
(c) to apprehend disorderly and suspicious characters;
(d) to detect and bring offenders to justice;
(e) to collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public peace and
(f) promptly to obey and execute all orders and warrants lawfully issued and directed to him by any competent authority.
Furthermore, the section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, has empowered Police officers as peace officers to take actions to prevent cognizable offences. In addition to the Police Ordinance and the Code of Criminal Procedure act, several legal statutes including Excise Ordinance have empowered Police to perform duties with the issues of public order and preservation of peace.
The Excise Ordinance
It was enacted by the British rulers in 1912, and this has been the law of the country with 21 amendments and Gazette Notifications promulgated by the minister time to time, for a period of 105 years, concerning the offences related to excise matters. The section 2 of the Ordinance defines the excise officer; means a Government Agent, Assistant Government Agent, or any officer or other person appointed or invested with powers under section 8; The section 8 of the excise ordinance deals with the powers of the minister and he can appoint;
(a) Any person other than the Government Agent to exercise all or any of the powers and to perform all or any of the duties of a Government Agent in respect of the excise revenue, either concurrently with or in exclusion of the Government Agent, subject to such control as the Minister may direct;
(b) Officers or persons to perform the acts and duties mentioned in sections 33, 35, and 48 (a);
Members of Police; Are they Excise Officers?
In pursuance of the power vested in the Minister by the aforesaid section 8(b), Excise Notification No. 509 dated 9.2.1963 had been issued by the Minister and published in the Government Gazette of 22.02.1963. Accordingly, the Minister had ordered that the powers and duties of an Inspector of the Excise Department under the section 37 of the Excise Ordinance shall be exercised by “all officers of the Police Force throughout the island and also the Minister had appointed “all officers of the Police Force to perform the acts and duties mentioned in sections 33, 35 and 48(a) of the Excise Ordinance throughout the Island.”
In view of the above provisions, the minister has given powers to Police in respect of the sections 33,35,37 and 48 (a) of the Excise Ordinance, and the sections 35 and 37 embody the sections 46 and 47. Therefore, the following powers are vested in Police in terms of the gazette notification.
* Power to enter and inspect places of manufacture, bottling, and sale – Section 33
* Cases in which offenders may be arrested, and contraband liquor and articles seized without warrant – Section 35
* Power of excise officers to search without a warrant – Section 37
* Illegal import – Section 46
* Illegal possession – Section 47
* Fails to produce such license, permit, or pass on the demand of any excise officer – Section 48 (a)
In terms of the above provisions Police have been dealing with the offences since 1912.
How a sudden controversy, AROSE REGARDING Police Powers under the Excise Ordinace
The controversy of police powers under Excise Ordinance was highlighted, after the judgments of Supreme Court FR cases; Everard Anthony and Others vs. Sub Inspector Anandasiri and Others and Udugama and Others vs. Chandra Fernando and Others. Both cases contended the similar facts but Udugama case has been reported as 2011, 1 SLR 192 and therefore the facts of the Udugama case is discussed in order to ascertain the contemporary legal impact that has been arisen in the present context.
According to the petition of Udugama Case, the 3rd petitioner, (the salesman) has been arrested for allegedly selling arrack to a customer (a Police decoy) to be consumed on the premise. The 3rd petitioner’s (1st and 2nd petitioners’ are the owners of the liquor shop) position was that there was no such sale as alleged by the police and in any event, the sale of liquor for consumption in the premises is not an offence for which the police officers are empowered by law to arrest any offender or to take any action under the Excise Ordinance.
In the judgment of His Lordship Justice Gamini Amaratunge, the legal issues that were sought be resolved are mentioned in the following way;
“The position of the petitioners is that police officers do not have power or authority to detect violations of the conditions of the license issued under the Excise Ordinance.
In view of the position taken by the petitioner, what this Court has to decide is whether police officers have powers to detect violations of the conditions of a license issued under the Excise Ordinance”?
The petitioner argued that Police have no powers to file plaints in terms of the section 52 (1) of the ordinance which states; No Magistrate shall take cognizance of an offence punishable-
(a) under sections 46, 47, or 50, except on his own knowledge or suspicion, or on the complaint or report of an excise officer; or
Finally His Lordship has concluded the judgment, stating that; although the Police have the power to detect and apprehend a person who had committed an offence under Section 46(g), in view of the provisions of Section 52(1) (a), the Police have no authority to initiate proceedings before a Magistrate against an offender. Such offences, commonly called technical offences, have to be referred to an excise officer.
In view of that finding, the 1st and the 2nd petitioners’ assertion that the respondents have violated their fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 12(1) and 14(1) (g) fails. For the same reason the 3rd petitioner’s claim that the respondents have violated his fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 12(1), 13(1), 13(2) and. 14(1) (g) also fails. This application is therefore dismissed without costs.
The judgment was delivered in favour of the Police and the procedure adopted by the police was approved at the raid. However, it was held that police have no powers to initiate proceedings in court without a certificate of an excise officer for the offences of the section 46 (g) which are called technical offences.
The situation after the Udugama Case
After the judgment of the above case, a controversy has been created in several Magistrate Courts about the acceptance of plaints under the Sections 46 and 47 of the excise ordinance filed by Police, specially in the cases of confiscation of vehicles which have been involved in the offences.
The defense attorneys made submissions on the basis of police powers as per the doctrine of the judicial precedent relevant to the Udugama case. In a case of the Kaluthara Magistrate Court, the Magistrate had confiscated the vehicle in refusing the submission of the defense. Thereafter the respondent had filed a revision application in the provincial High Court. Police have no power to file cases.
Another case was reported in the Provincial high court of Matara on relatively similar facts and it has also been held that Police have no powers to file cases;
In addition to the above high court cases, the cases filed by police in Magistrates Courts of Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Deiyandara, Hingurakgoda and Galgamuwa, had been challenged under similar circumstances by the defense parties.
The Police Submission
The Police have been making submissions on the following facts;
The concept of Judicial precedent has been generated from the legal maxim called Stare Decisis which means when court has once laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle, and apply it to all future cases, where facts are substantially the same or also the maxim expressing the underlying basis of the doctrine of precedent, i.e. that it is necessary to abide by former precedents when the same points arise again in litigation or a doctrine requiring that judges apply the same reasoning to lawsuits as has been used in prior similar cases.
Accordingly, Police argued that the legal issue in the Udugama case was; whether police officers have powers to detect violations of the conditions of a license issued under the Excise Ordinance? Therefore the Ratio Decedendi which means the ground of the decision and the point in a case which determines the judgment, is that Police have no powers to file plaints under the section 46 (g) of the ordinance which are commonly called technical offences.
The police emphasized that other facts in the judgment of the Udugama case are Obita Dictems which means words of a prior opinion entirely unnecessary for the decision of the case, or Something said by a judge while giving the Judgment that was not essential to the decision in the case and it does not form part of the ratio decidendi of the case and therefore creates no binding precedent.
Moreover, the case of Lister Pinto Vs. OIC Wellawatta has been decided by the Court of Appeal in respect of police powers under the excise ordinance in 2010 before the judgment of the Udugama case. In the Lester Pinto case, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew has held; “The contention of the learned President Counsel was that the learned magistrate could not have acted on the plaint in terms of Section 52 of the excise ordinance as it was not a report filed by an excise officer. Therefore, the most important question that must be decided in this case is whether the OIC/Wellawatta could perform a function as an excise officer. I now advert to this question. The minister under gazette No.13529 dated 22.2.1963, issued in terms of Section 2 and 8 of the excise ordinance authorizes all police officers to perform the functions of excise officers assigned to them under section 37 of the excise ordinance. Section 37 of the excise ordinance covers offences committed under the excise ordinance. Thus when OIC Wellawatta filed the plaint under Section 46(a) of the excise ordinance, he was in terms of the gazette No.13529 dated 22.2.1963, performing the functions of an excise officer. Therefore it was lawful for the magistrate under Section 52 of the excise ordinance to have acted on the plaint;”. Accordingly, the petition has been dismissed by the Court of Appeal.
However the accused petitioner Lister Ponto, had submitted an appeal to the supreme court against the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The decision has been delivered on February 7, 2014 and His Lordship Chief Justice Mohan Peiris has held: “having carefully considered the Judgment of the magistrate court of Mount Lavinia as affirmed by the judgment of Court of Appeal dated 31.03.2010, this court is of the view that this matter is not a fit matter in which this court should interfere with the findings.”
Hence the Supreme Court has upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal. This decision came after the decision of the Udugama case. Therefore Police made submissions in the Magisterial Courts that the decision of the Udugama case is confined to the offences of Section 46 (g) of the ordinance which is called technical offences and the other facts of the judgment must be considered as obiter dictems which are not bound by the inferior courts.
It was made further submissions that Police have powers to detect and file plaints under Sections 46 and 47 (except 46g) of the ordinance in terms of the judgment of Lester Pinto of the Court Appeal case which was affirmed by the Supreme Court subsequently.
Before the excise notification 509 of 1963, the same issue has arisen in the cases of Cicilin Perera vs Samaradiwakara and Perera vs. Nagoor Pitche and in both cases, the court has decided that the Police officers who were appointed in terms of the powers vested in the minister, must be considered as excise officers within the scope of Excise Ordinance.
Do the Police have powers?
In view of the above facts, certain magisterial courts held that Police have powers to institute legal action, but some courts have decided that police have no authority in filling plaints.
Hence a legal clarification is required from the superior courts in respect of the issue in which the officers appointed by the minister in terms of the Sections 2 and 8 of the excise ordinance and the Ratio Decidendi of Udugama and Lester Pinto cases.
Therefore, the decision made in the Matara Magistrate Court Case No.1933 which was mentioned above (held that police have no authority), has been appealed to the Court of Appeal under Case No CA/ML/RV/09/2017 by Hon. Attorney General and the authority of Police would be determined accordingly.
