Budget allocation for early childhood development to be upped

Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said that the government has recognised the importance of early childhood development (ECD) and measures have already been taken to increase the allocation from the national budget for the improvement of ECD centres.
Attending the launch of the National Census of Early Childhood Development 2016 yesterday at Waters Edge, Minister Bandara said that instilling a positive attitude, discipline and skills in children at a young age will foster the development of human capital for the country’s future.
“An ECD centre is where the foundation for education is made. Building a nation based on good health, education and life skills is the foundation for a country’s development,” she said.
She said that most teachers at the early childhood centres have no adequate qualifications and even parents are unaware of the importance of early childhood education.
Minister Bandara further said that this was the first time such a project was conducted in South Asia.
The Early Childhood Development (ECD) project is funded by World Bank and implemented under the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MWCA) with the objective of ensuring equitable access to and improving the quality of ECD services.
The census reported that 578,160 children in the two-five year age group were attending 19,668 ECD centres around the country. Of them nearly 47.6 percent were five years old, while further 37.3 percent were four years old. The attendance of younger children at the centres was relatively low: about 1.8 percent were two years old, while 13.3 percent were three years old.
A majority (70.8 percent) of centres in Sri Lanka were managed by private individuals or organisations. A further, 19.8 percent were managed by the government (local government authorities and other government institutions). Of the rest, 6.5 percent were managed by religious organisations and 3 percent by non-governmental organisations.
The report also affirmed Minister Bandara’s statement on the lack of qualified teachers in ECD centres. The report stated that a majority teachers (59.9 percent) and teacher assistants (62.8 percent) possessed GCE A/L qualifications. About 33.6 percent of teachers and 31 percent of teacher assistants possessed GCE O/L qualifications.
The percentages of teachers and teacher assistants with degrees and higher educational qualifications were 3 percent and 2.2 percent respectively. Teacher and teacher assistants with educational qualifications below GCE O/L were around 2 percent to 5 percent respectively.
