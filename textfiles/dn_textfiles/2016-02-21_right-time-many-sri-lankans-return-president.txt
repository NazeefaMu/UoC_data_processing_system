Right time for many Sri Lankans to return - President

President Maithripala Sirisena meeting the Sri Lankan community in Austria has confirmed successful State visits to Germany and Austria. According to President many benefits for the betterment of the country were received during the discussions.
 
“My tour in Austria and Germany turned out to be very good. Concluding this tour, we have been able to bag many benefits. We have been able to convince the business community why they should consider Sri Lanka for investment and collaboration,” he said.
 
President met with the members of the Sri Lankan community living in Austria at the premises of the Austrian National Libraryin Vienna yesterday (20). Sri Lankans representing all communities including Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim attended the gathering.
 
He expressed there that at present the country has no enemies in the world and no country or organization is against it. "Since I came to power I worked with all countries and organizations to work together with Sri Lanka. It is as a result of this friendship that the Austrian government invited a state leader from Sri Lanka to visit their country. I am lucky that I could make it happen,” President said.
 
He added that passing of the 19th Amendment to the constitution made the background to make sure that no war repeats in the country and that everybody lives happily and in harmony. Now we want to rise as a great nation in the world, the President said.
