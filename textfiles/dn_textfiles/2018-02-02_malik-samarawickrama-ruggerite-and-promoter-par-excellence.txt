Malik Samarawickrama: Ruggerite and promoter par excellence

The name MALIK SAMARAWICKRAMA, like good wine needs no bush. Be it the sport he loved best and in politics a different game, he is a household name and is still making waves as a politician and god father of Kandy Sports Club rugby. The hill country club, in the good old days when I watched and reported on the game, the names of Stanley Martin, Col. Stanley Ratwatte, KB Sangakkara and Philip Buultjens were synonymous with the club. Over the past 50 years however, there has been no one who has given more of his time, his wealth and his heart and soul to the club than MALIK.

SAMARAWICKRAMA.is a selfless man who’s charm, winning ways and humility are exemplary.
Tagged as ‘MR.RUGBY’, Kandy Sports Club and the Hill Capital will have his name inscribed in letters of gold for the wonderful and stunning revolution he made in the game in Kandy.
From the time he planted his business interests in Kandy, and while watching rugby there, he quickly spotted the talent flowing like the Mahaweli and with Royal rugby blood in him did not lose time in throwing his lot with Kandy Sports Club.
He brought about a rugby reawakening in Kandy and today Kandy Sports Club is the kings of rugby in Kandy. The club’s record of winning the league 13 times, the Clifford cup 15 times and the ‘sevens’ 11 times is ample testimony.
Rudiments of the game
After schooling at Royal College where he was baptized in rugby, he learnt the rudiments of the game and excelled in inter-school exploits as a famed scrum half, he launched his career in the game that saw him sports Ceylonese Rugby and Football Club and Sri Lanka colours.
Excelling the man’s game from schoolboy level which is much more demanding tough and rib bruising he continued to play in many CR teams that won trophies with the CR-Havies game being the local rugby derby at that time.
During his playing days at Royal from 1966 to 1968 his team mates were Jagath Fenando, H.C.P. Malwatte, A.J. Yusuf, Maiya Gunesekera, Fred Pereira, B Liversz, C.R.de Silva, D.J. Perera, R. Thurairatnam, Brian Baptist and G.Mohammed to mention a few. At the CR he had team mates Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Ronnie Shockman, Jagath Fernando,Reggie Bartholomeusz, Ratnapala.
Representative rugby
SAMARAWICKRAMA also sported Low Country colours playing in the Capper Cup game against Up Country and played for the President’s XV quite regularly. Once he had enough of club and representative rugby he hung up his boots when everyone was asking why and why not.
He was a wippy and daring scrum half who gathered the ball from the base and slung intelligent and well directed passes to his fly half who always was well positioned to get the line moving that resulted in an avalanche of tries for school, club and the country.
But quitting the game he loved best did not mean that he would be lost to the game. On the contrary he moved on to the administration, the sponsoring scrum and many schools and clubs enjoyed his largesse, especially Kandy Sports Club and the Kandy players have rewarded him by winning trophies at will with no club able to stop this rugby juggernaut. In the early days to take Kandy rugby to the top he had a brilliant coach in Nimal Leweke who helped them win the triple.
President of SLRFU
He served as treasurer at the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union, Vice President and it was not long when he attained the high office of President. He was also manager of many Sri Lankan teams.
He with his expertise realized that sponsorship and professionalism is what is urgently and badly required to help players and take the game forward. Rugby too is an expensive game and it is not all players who have finances to keep playing.
When professionalism is being spoken about the pioneering names in this endeavor that come to mind are philanthropists the famous E.W.Balasuriya and ‘My way’ Kishin Butani. Balasuriya first did it for Kandy Lake Club and Butani for CH and FC.
Professionalism
At that time Balasuriya and Butani were scourged for introducing professionalism into the game. One remembers Balasuriya getting Maurice de Silva and Didacus de Almedia among others to play for Kandy Lake and Butani getting down Simon Hunter and the Fijians to play for the Maitland Crescent Club, outstanding being Nagata. Butani had an efficient helper in ‘king’ Hassan Singhawansa. But what Balasuriya and Butani pioneered then is the done and must thing now.
SAMARAWICKRAMA while being in the scrum of Kandy Sports Club introduced foreign flavor into the game when he introduced the Singer/Sri Lanka Airlines International Sevens tournament to celebrate 125 years of KSC in 1999. He saw to it that the tournament which was much looked forward to went on for 10 years.
He helped KSC rise Phoenix like from the ashes and today the club is dominating the game, with some of the finest players in the game and is the envy of all clubs with no club in the scene able to bring them down. Every club takes the field determined to beat them, but finally come a cropper.
Modern pavilion
The new look he gave to the Nittawela ground is amazing. He brought it to international standard by adding tiers round the ground and after building a modern pavilion named it after one of Trinity’s and Sri Lanka’ great player and daring soldier the late Denzil Kobbekaduwa. The cry now is for the Nittaela ground to be named the MALIK SAMARAWICKRAMA rugby stadium. It will be a fitting honour if it is done.
SAMARAWICKRAMA’S contribution to the game has made many schools in Kandy to take to the game and show their prowess putting to second best some of the leading rugby paying schools in the country. It is sports promoters of the calibre of SAMARAWICKRAMA that Sri Lanka sport is lacking and yearning for.
The trophies that are packed in the shelves of Kandy Sports Club are ample testimony for SAMARAWICKRAMA’S popularity and the great work he is doing for the player, the game, the club and the country.
SAMARAWICKRAMA is now Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade in the Unity Government.
