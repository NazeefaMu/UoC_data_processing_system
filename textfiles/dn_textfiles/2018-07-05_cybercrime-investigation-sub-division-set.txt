Cybercrime Investigation Sub-Division set up

The first Cybercrime Investigation and Digital Forensics Sub-Division set up outside Colombo was opened by IGP Pujith Jayasundera in Kandy yesterday. It is located at the Central Province DIG’s Office premises and is controlled by the CID.
CID Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne said the new sub-division was set up in Kandy as it recorded the highest number of cyber crimes after Colombo.
He said crimes related to the internet, cyber space and mobile phones are on the rise.
