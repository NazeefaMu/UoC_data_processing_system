Health Ministry website hacked - Media Secretary

The website of the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine was hacked yesterday.
According to Media Secretary to the Health Ministry Nipuna Ekanayake, the IT team of the Ministry suspected that an Indonesian extremist organization was responsible for the hacking.
The website is now in order and steps would be taken to prevent such attacks in future, Ekanayake said.
He further said that an investigation was already on regarding the cyber attack.
The 13th UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice says, cyber crime is an emerging form of transnational crime and was fastest growing.
According to the UN, developing countries lack the capacity to combat cyber attacks and also other forms of cyber crime. It is therefore not surprising that the victimization rates are higher in countries with lower levels of development.
