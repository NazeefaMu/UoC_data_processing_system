Dearth of anesthetists shuts down ICU

Kantalai Base Hospital has been transferring critical patients who need regular supervision of specialists to other hospitals in the district as the Intensive Care Unit has been closed from Monday owing to the dearth of anesthetists.
Hospital Director Dr. D.G.M Costa said the hospital requires at least 12 anesthetists to continue the services in operating theatres and the Intensive Care Unit. “We have only five anesthetists,” he said.
Dr. Costa added that many anesthetists who served at the hospital were transferred without replacements.
