Suzuki launches Dzire in India

Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corporation’s Indian arm and the leading car-maker in India, Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL), has launched the all-new Suzuki DZIRE compact sedan in India on the 16th of May 2017.
The all-new Suzuki DZIRE sedan is a combination of modern sleek and elegant looks infused with encompassing state-of-the-art technology. The DZIRE is one of the main models of MSIL and it is India’s largest selling sedan with accumulated sales of approximately 1.4 million units in India, since inception.
The all-new Suzuki DZIRE shares the same new HEARTECT platform as those adopted for the all-new Suzuki Swift, which is being sold in Japan, Europe, and other countries from 2017. Thanks to its lightweight and high-rigidity body, it strikes a balance between running performance and fuel efficiency, while meeting safety regulations that are scheduled to be introduced in India.
Encompassing all the virtues of a true sedan, the all-new DZIRE is all set to shake the compact sedan segment yet again.
It comes with an entirely new design, which lends it impeccable sedan proportions. Indulgent interiors with urbane satin chrome and burl wood ornamentation and a unique flat bottom steering wheel give passengers a plush experience.
The now popular and much-admired AGS (Auto Gear Shift) technology will be offered on both petrol and diesel variants. New-age technologies such as a touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto would complement the all–new DZIRE. Under the hood lie the acclaimed 1.3 liter DDiS 190 diesel engine and the proven K Series VVT 1.2 liter petrol engine.
While the primary focus of the all-new DZIRE will be in India, it will be exported to India’s surrounding countries, Sri Lanka, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, subsequently. The pioneer of the Sri Lanka’s motor car industry, Associated Motorways (Private) Limited (AMW), is the sole agent of brand new Suzuki vehicles in Sri Lanka.
