SriLankan gets QAS with ‘Flygreen’ carbon offset programme

SriLankan Airlines, has achieved the distinction of becoming one of only six airlines worldwide to obtain the Quality Assurance Standard (QAS) accreditation for its Voluntary Carbon Offset Programme, ‘Flygreen’.
SriLankan is now authorized to display the QAS Carbon Neutral Quality Mark, demonstrating that it is using the global best practices for carbon offsetting. QAS (www.qascarbonneutral.com) is an accreditation that is awarded following a comprehensive independent audit system for companies who wish to evaluate their carbon offsets against the high standards available. QAS audits involve a 40-point checklist to ensure that companies meet the very highest standards in the world in terms of carbon offsetting.
The ‘Flygreen’ Programme (www.srilankan.com/environment) obtains the participation of the airline’s passengers, who are given the opportunity of voluntarily donating a prefixed amount to offset the carbon footprintof their respective flight. These donations are then channelled through the International Air Transport Association (IATA),and are utilized to procure carbon offsets on behalf of SriLankan and neutralize the footprints.
At present the offsets are sourced from two Sri Lanka eco-ventures,the Hapugastenne Mini Hydro Project and Hulu Ganga Mini Hydro Project- in order to support the country and local eco-ventures.
Global aviation accounts for approximately 2% of the world’s human inducedcarbon emissions, making it increasingly vital for airlines to actively seek out methods to promote conservation and reduce their carbon footprint.
