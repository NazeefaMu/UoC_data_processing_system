Liquor party raided; 8 students caught

Kegalle Police raided a liquor party at Pinnawela and held eight students from two leading schools in Kandy yesterday.
The students are said to have skipped tuition classes and been to an island close to the Pinnawela elephant orphanage to celebrate a colleague’s birthday with a liquor party.
The students are to sit for the ordinary level exam in December.
Police handed over the students to their parents after warning on the dangers of underage drinking.
