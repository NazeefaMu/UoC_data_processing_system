Walls on canvas

‘Murs/Walls’, an exhibition of paintings by Marie-Caroline Senlis will be held from February 27 to March 12 at Black Cat Café.
After graduating in Literature, Linguistics and Fine Arts studies, Marie-Caroline Senlis began her career as a professional artist in 2002 with a photographic project in China. This first exhibition marks the beginning of a photographic research, enriched by many travels abroad, and by her 15 years’ experience living in Asian countries, such as China, India, Pakistan and, today, Sri Lanka. Through her work in black and white, she captures atmospheres and people, fixing on film hazy lights, misty Nature, and inviting the audience to a fantastic world of multiple interpretations and reinterpretations. Exhibitions of her have been, and continue to be, exhibited worldwide.
