Deprived of deep  sea fishing

Fisherfolk at Welipatanwila, Ambalantota, say they have been deprived of deep sea fishing as a result of sand dunes that block the mouth of the harbour at Welipatanwila. The harbour was set up at a cost of Rs.28 million a couple of years ago. A breakwater to an extent of 375 meters was planned, but it was built up to only 275 metres.
