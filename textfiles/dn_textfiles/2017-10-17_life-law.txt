Life in the law

The man in the dock was ex-president Charles Taylor of Liberia, whom he had once described as Africa’s Hitler. Was history going to be made on this day in 2012? The last head of state to have been convicted by an international criminal tribunal was Grand Admiral Donitz, who had succeeded Hitler as Fuhrer and faced the judgment of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1946.
Sir Desmond de Silva QC, now aged 77, was ready to wage war against a rising trend of Hitlerism, but not with conventional weapons. This particular case study and some more intriguing episodes from his law life are memoirified in his autobiography Madam Where Are Your Mangoes? The well known battle to bring former Liberian president and warlord Charles Taylor to justice in The Hague remains to be the first conviction of a former head of state for war crimes since 1946 during the Nuremberg trials.
In his career of over 50 years, Sir Desmond has contributed to numerous legally momentous areas such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, espionage, treason, drugs, terrorism, human rights, white-collar fraud and sports. He has been a much sought-after personality by celebrities such as Harry Redknapp, John Terry, Ron Atkinson, Hans Segers, Lawrence Dallaglio, Graham Rix, Lee Bowyer and Jamie Osborne.
Madam Where Are Your Mangoes was launched at the Vijitha Yapa bookshop at the Crescat Boulevard recently. The book is now available at any Vijitha Yapa Bookshop.
“In a career of over 50 years at the Criminal bar of England and Wales, with hundreds of cases to choose from, I have drawn on very few to write about. Those I have chosen, in the main, either have a relevance to my life, or sometimes even my near, or enjoy some rare quality that does, perhaps, give them an interest outside that of the normal diet of a criminal barrister,” Sir Desmond notes.
The strange title of the book refers to a particular incident that happened while the Queen’s Counsel sought accommodation in a Sierra Leone hotel with a colleague. Blissfully uninformed that the hotel is really a brothel, the QC and the colleague booked a room. One of the ladies on duty approached the QC and inquired if he would like to have mangoes. A while later Sir Desmond was interrupted by the sounds in the corridor. He opened his door to see his colleague dangling around with a lady on duty with a scream: “But madam, where are your mangoes?”
Desmond de Silva was honoured with knighthood during the Tony Blair administration while Prime Minister David Cameron made him a privy councillor.
“This book is intended as a record of interesting times through which I have lived and practised law in England and in numerous jurisdictions outside the UK. It has been a journey measured in memories, friendships, political duplicity and a wealth of varied experiences. I do not propose, as some do, to take a scalpel to myself in order to dissect why I have turned out as I have. I do, however, sometimes take such an instrument to others, but sparingly, I hope. This is meant to be a light-hearted, episodic memoir of certain events as opposed to a comprehensive autobiography,” Sir Desmond recalls.
He calls his story as something of an odyssey; from a colonial childhood in Ceylon where the imprint of Empire was still visible, to life in post-war Britain under Attlee’s Labour government.
“It is sometimes said that a person is moulded by a particular decade. In all species, individuals grow within groups and these social groupings imprint their values on their offspring. If this is true, then I was perhaps influenced most by the first ten years of my life: the 1940s. Looking back, that period was my comfort zone. However, the professional life I have led since my call to the Bar has dragged me away from this arena of comfort and placed me squarely in the modern world.”
Sir Desmond has a reason to author a book of this calibre. His primary target is his daughter, Victoria, who (like most others in the modern world) will have an insight into his early life both in Ceylon as well as England.
“England was, however, where I spent most of my professional life and it was from England that I sallied out to other places when the finger of fate beckoned. As I only kept a diary sporadically, the account is a series of recollections and anecdotes: a gossipy personal memoir confined to a career in the law.”
George E de Silva of Ceylon War Council fame is the grandfather of Sir Desmond de Silva. Interestingly Lord Louis Mountbatten was Uncle Dickie for him. A few decades later he married Princess Katarina of Yugoslavia, the great-niece of Lord Mountbatten.
“Where a country has changed its name an author must choose which name to use. I have decided to use the name that applied at the time of the events about which I am writing. I hope I will be forgiven for referring to the land of my birth as Ceylon – as it was then popularly and geographically known – when I refer to events prior to 1972, after which it became the Republic of Sri Lanka. So names such as the Ceylon National Congress, which my grandfather was president of and which played such an important in the Ceylon Independence movement, will remain; as will the Battle of Ceylon in 1942 and the Ceylon War Council, which came into existence during World War II.”
Sir Desmond’s details may not narrate the whole story. But those shards of memory, written in a crisp language, let us view and review the good old Ceylon through the periscope of Sir Desmond’s colonial childhood.
My grandmother Agnes Nell was a strong-willed woman and an early motor enthusiast. The first car was imported into Ceylon in May 1905 by Edward, the playboy son of the philanthropist Sir Charles de Soysa. When driven from the docks, thousands lined the streets to view the marvel of the automobile. By 1906 Agnes was driving a Belgian five-horsepower chain-driven Belgian Minervette that made a terrible puffing sound that attracted the unwelcome attention of local dogs who clearly mistook the vehicle for some form of mechanical beast. Rumour has it that these motoring pioneers discharged pistols to scare off canine interest.
Kandy, in the central highlands of Sri Lanka where I was born, has been described as one of the most entrancing cities of East Asia. It is also the crossroads of many faiths: the meeting place of those who worship Buddha, Vishnu, Mohammed and Christ. The Temple of the Tooth still houses the eyetooth of the Buddha, the most sacred of Buddhist relics. A drumming, which can still be heard today, wafted up from the temple, across the Kandy lake and up the hillside to my parents’ home. In my early ears at the Bar in London, I was instructed to defend at the Old Bailey the son of the former keeper of Buddha’s tooth, who faced charges of living off immoral earnings in Mayfair; the story ended happily with his triumphant acquittal at the hands of a London Jury.
Madam Where are Your Mangoes is a fascinating story of Desmond de Silva’s life in the law, from the arrest of Charles Taylor for war crimes in Sierra Leone, to defending household names such as John Terry, via murder, celebrity and spy trials. Born in Ceylon during World War II, de Silva went on to become one of the most distinguished and high-profile jury advocates of his generation. This memoir provides an authoritative account of some of his most remarkable cases, covering over half a century of practice in the courts of England, the Commonwealth and as Chief Prosecutor of an international criminal court that in 2012 brought to justice the first Head of State since the Nuremberg trials in 1946. The reminiscences are complemented by a series of stories relating to his most colourful cases by the Evening Standard’s veteran court correspondent Paul Cheston.
