BOC Ran Kekulu scholarship awards concludes

BOC’s Ran Kekulu Grade five Scholarship Awards 2016 National event concluded at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) Colombo on June 22.
This was organised by the Western Province (North) office of the Bank of Ceylon. In line with this main event nine other events were organized by each province to felicitate those achievers.
Highflyers of the 2016 Grade five Scholarship examination who have scored above 174 marks were awarded scholarships worth Rs15,000/- each at this ceremony. Apart from this scholarship each student received a valuable certificate and a gift pack at the event. The Bank’s Chairman, Ronald C. Perera, the General Manager D.M. Gunasekera, Deputy General Manager Sales and Channel Management Senarath Bandara and several other members of the Corporate and Executive Management of BOC graced the main event. As a part of the Bank’s strategic Corporate Social Responsibility activities the Bank of Ceylon conducts this annual programme to support and encourage school children to make an extra effort in their studies. Simply maintaining a minimum balance of Rs.5000/- in a Ran Kekulu account or by opening a Rankekulu account with any of BOC’s 627 branches across the country, on or before the date of the scholarship examination fulfills the eligibility to be considered for BOC’s Ran Kekulu scholarship.
In addition to the scholarship scheme there are also special merit awards for all-island ranks where 1st will receive Rs.100,000/-, 2nd will receive Rs.75,000/- and the third will receive Rs.50,000/-.
