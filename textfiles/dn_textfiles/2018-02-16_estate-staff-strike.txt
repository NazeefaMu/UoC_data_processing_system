Estate staff on strike

Estate staff attached to the Bogawantalawa Kirkswall Elboda Estate lower division launched a strike yesterday demanding that police arrest a labourer who had allegedly assaulted one of their staff members.
Agrapatana Police said the labourer concerned had fled the area after the alleged incident.
However the other estate labourers continued their daily work. Tea pluckers faced inconvenience since no one was present to take stock of their daily pickings of green leaf. Bogawantalawa Police is investigating.
