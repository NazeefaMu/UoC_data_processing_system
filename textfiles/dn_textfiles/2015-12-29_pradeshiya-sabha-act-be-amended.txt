Pradeshiya Sabha Act to be amended

The Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry has decided to amend Pradeshiya Sabha Act targeting the welfare of the estate labourers under the development programmes carried out by the government. Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said according to the legal conditions it is not possible to use the Pradeshiya Sabha funds to provide public services to the estates.
Members of Parliament P. Digambaram and Mano Ganeshwaran have made the President and the minister aware of this fact.
The Act 1987 No. 15 will be amended to have solutions to this issue. It will be presented to Parliament soon after getting the Cabinet approval. "It will be possible to serve the estates with Pardeshiya Sabha funds," the minister said.
