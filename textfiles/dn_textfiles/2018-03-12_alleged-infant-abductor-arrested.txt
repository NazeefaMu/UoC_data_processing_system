Alleged infant abductor arrested

Both a woman and a newborn infant whom she had allegedly abducted from the Vavuniya Hospital, were discovered by police at the Anuradhapura Hospital on Saturday (10).
The Vavuniya Police said the woman who is alleged to have stolen the two-day old infant had been arrested.
A 37-year-old woman from Bogaswewa had given birth to a male child at the Vavuniya Hospital on March 7. The Child had gone missing from the hospital on March 9. The child had been allegedly taken by the arrested woman when the mother had gone to use the washroom. Vavuniya Police had initiated investigations after the mother lodged a complaint that her child had been abducted.
Meanwhile, on March 8, a female resident of Kebithigollewa had arrived at the Anuradhapura Hospital with an infant who had a skin disease.
The woman had claimed that the child was her own and had produced a hospital admission card to prove her point.
However, doctors who felt suspicious had subjected her to a medical examination and had realised that she had not given birth to a child recently.
Subsequently, doctors had informed Anuradhapura Police and they had contacted Vavuniya Police after coming to know about the infant’s disappearance.
Police were also awaiting the results of a DNA test to prove the identity of the child.
