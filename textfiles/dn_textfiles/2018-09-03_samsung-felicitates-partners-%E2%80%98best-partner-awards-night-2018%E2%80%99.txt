Samsung felicitates partners at  ‘Best Partner Awards Night 2018’

Samsung Sri Lanka recently held a gala ‘Samsung Best Partners 2018’ Awards Night during a 3-day partner engagement programme from August 24 – 26, 2018, at Shangri-La’s Hambantota Golf Resort & Spa, Hambantota.
Samsung selected 150 of the highest growth achievers for this programme and inducted them into a first-of-its-kind, ‘Samsung Best Partner Forum’.
The selected partners were invited along with their families to witness the gala ‘Samsung Best Partner Awards Night 2018’. As it was a programme dedicated to show appreciation to its partners, Samsung also invited all of its national distributors to the programme as key partners of the Samsung network.
This is the first time in the Mobile Industry that such a mega partner appreciation programme was held. Apart from the warm hospitality, invitees engaged in various activities organized by Samsung fostering a mood of fellowship and warm camaraderie.
The programme also provided an opportune moment for Samsung to launch the Galaxy Note9 amongst a gathering of the best partners in its network under one roof. Having a sustainable growth in the market, Samsung plans to consolidate the brand’s position in the industry by leveraging its partner network.
Hanbae Park, Managing Director, Samsung Sri Lanka said, “It gives me great pleasure to recognize and reward the exceptional efforts by our partners in Sri Lanka. Samsung prides itself on long-term business partnerships that help drive mutual success and growth in a competitive marketplace. Together, we are stronger as we seize new opportunities.”
Shantha Fernando, General Manager, Head of Mobile Business, Samsung Sri Lanka, said, “As Sri Lanka’s most preferred mobile brand, Samsung has carved out a leadership position for itself in the smartphone industry. This achievement has been made possible by our extensive network of partners across the country, who have gone the extra mile to drive sales, strongly supported by Samsung’s extensive global best practices in collaborating with dealers and distributors.”
