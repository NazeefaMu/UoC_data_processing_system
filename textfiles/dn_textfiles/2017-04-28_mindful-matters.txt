Mindful matters

Hilton Colombo Residences announced their pledge towards supporting Hilton’s initiative of ‘Meeting with Purpose’ effective as of April 2017. Daily News visited the JAIC Hilton to be briefed on how meetings can be conducted in an environmentally sustainable manner.
“Tonight we would like to introduce you, to the launch of a new initiative which is actually a global initiative of Hilton. Two weeks ago Hilton formulated the first stages of a plan to give rise to six new Hilton Properties or Hilton brands. So we are going to have in the future more than two Hilton hotels in Sri Lanka. On top of that we would like to inform you Hilton is currently the fastest growing hospitality company in the world. Hilton has 14 brands and we have over 4900 Hilton hotels worldwide, represented in 107 countries. Last year we celebrated the 100th country,” said General Manager, Karim Schadlou Schadlou also pointed out that Hilton has been in Sri Lanka for nearly 30 years.
“I have been with the Hilton for many years, and I am proud to be here today to launch the new initiative, which is a global initiative. Today is the launch of the ‘Meet with Purpose’. The pillars of the ‘Meet with Purpose’ is actually three components – Mindful Meeting, Mindful Eating and Mindful Being. They form the launch of the ‘Meet with Purpose’,” said Schadlou
Assistant Manager, Public Relations, Minoli Senanayake said that this initiative spans across the globe. “One of the three components is Mindful Eating. And this concept is based on sustainability and healthy lifestyles.
When you go for a meeting you see so many food products. But this concept focuses a lot on mindful and healthy eating, so that you are aware of what you eat. This is all based on healthy food items which are locally sourced. So while we focus on our delegates, we also focus on the local produce and the farming community who need our support,” said Senanayake
At the press conference there were a collection of Tuna sourced from down south, Crabs from Negombo and even the cheese is sourced from our local dairy farms. “We believe that with Mindful Eating, we are also looking at the delegate and the local communities around us,” stated Senanayake.
Manager, Marketing, Thivanka Tennekoon, focused on Mindful Meeting, which is basically about the environment
“We have to be Mindful about our environment, to sustain the environment and have less impact on the environment. We have made all our lightings LED. We have made the investment this year. This is a huge investment for us and has less impact on the environment. Secondly our air conditionings are inverter type. It has less impact to the environment. The bottles we have here are all glass bottles. They can be refilled. We have thrown away all our plastic water bottles, so we have all glass water bottles,” said Tennekoon. Tennekoon also pointed out that the food items are all locally sourced. Minoli picked up from where she ended to inform us about Mindful Being.
“We have covered the food and facilities and now we must speak about the delegates themselves. We know that meetings are super stressful. Especially if you are in an area from morning till evening, you are stressed out. And you feel you are drained of energy. So this component is primarily focusing on the health of the delegate. So we want to incorporate some fun into the package. So we have our in-house supervisor and in-house instructor Manjula Jagath, who with his team, will incorporate some fun. We might have some stretching, some yoga sessions, a three to five minute massage session for the shoulders just to ease out by a therapist, when you have your coffee breaks. We also have a soccer machine so people can break away from that stressful mode. We also have a mini golf area so you can have some fun,” explained Senanayake. Senanayake also pointed out that it is a great ice breaker because meetings can be stiff and formal.
“We feel that with these three components, the meetings can be more productive for the delegates, the organizers and even for us as a hotel,” pointed out Senanayake.
Head of Conferences & Events, Charith Edirisinghe elaborated more on the packages.
“We are very excited about this which we will launch soon. We know that all our corporate companies are forward thinking corporate companies who will be joining with us because everyone is now thinking about health and well- being. In this health conscious society, this is a great opportunity for us to help society, as well as corporate companies.
Package wise we are starting from Rs. 3000 plus taxes, it includes morning coffee break, lunch and evening coffee break, where we give them the option of selecting the items that they really like,” explained Edirisinghe.
