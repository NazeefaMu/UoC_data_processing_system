Sri Lanka, Korea celebrates 40 years of diplomatic ties

The Sri Lanka food festival to mark diplomatic ties with Korea was held at the Millennium Seoul Hilton recently with an array of Sri Lankan dishes laid out for food lovers in Seoul.
Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale inaugurated the food festival.
Minister Atukorale said Sri Lanka has been part of the historical Spice Route since time immemorial. Sri Lankan food has been cross-fertilised over centuries by Portuguese, Dutch, Southeast Asian and Indian cuisine.
The combination of spices, coconut milk and coconut oil, vegetables, fish and meats, and the use of clay chattis or cooking pots, all contribute to the end product of complex yet exquisite dishes, she said.
Two dance performances by choreographer–percussionist Master Ravibandhu Vidyapathy and his dance troupe delighted Korean art lovers at two performances at the National Theatre of Korea in Seoul and the Asia Culture Centre in Gwangju.
