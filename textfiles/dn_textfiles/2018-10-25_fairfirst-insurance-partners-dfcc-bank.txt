Fairfirst Insurance partners DFCC bank

Fairfirst Insurance recently signed a memorandum of understanding together with DFCC Bank as part of a special health insurance promotion initiative which will be facilitated by Reliance Insurance brokers.
As part of this, health coverage worth Rs 100,000 per person entailing a dengue insurance policy with an added extension for influenza will be made available to all DFCC credit card holders at a special discounted rate.
Fairfirst Insurance the largest private health insurer in the country introduced the revolutionary dengue policy last year in response to the nationwide dengue fever outbreak. Subsequently, with the uprising of influenza in the southern region of the nation earlier this year, Fairfirst added influenza as an extension to the existing dengue policy.
This unique offering is available to the credit card holder base of DFCC for a nominal premium of Rs 3,160 per annum which can be paid via a zero percent installment scheme. DFCC credit card customers can also extend this cover to their family members with a minor increase in premium.
Guaranteeing ease of access to customers, this policy is available for purchase via the Fairfirst corporate website – www.fairfirst.lk. Additionally in the event of hospitalization all claims are settled directly to the hospital through the cashless facility.
The signing of the MoU took place together with the Managing Director and CEO of Fairfirst Insurance, Dr. Sanjeev Jha, Deputy CEO of DFCC Bank, Thimal Perera, Chairman of Reliance Insurance Brokers, Athula Sahabandu and other senior management personnel of the three parties.
Commenting on the partnership, the Deputy CEO of DFCC Bank, Thimal Perera said, “We are pleased to partner with Fairfirst Insurance to offer our credit card holders this unique opportunity. Health is wealth – and this customized health policy offers coverage against both dengue and influenza hospitalization costs. Considering the high incidence of dengue and influenza in Sri Lanka which can entail hospitalization and heavy expenses, we felt this is a timely offer for our valued credit card customers to offer them the best protection. DFCC Bank constantly seeks to forge such partnerships to bring unique value additions to our credit card customers.”
