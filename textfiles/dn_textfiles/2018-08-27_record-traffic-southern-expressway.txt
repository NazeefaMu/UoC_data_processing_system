Record traffic on Southern Expressway

A record number of vehicles used the Southern Expressway during the weekend, according to the Expressway’s Director (Manitenance and Operations) Saman Opanayake.
He said that usually the expressway recorded around 70,000 vehicles daily, but the number recorded on August 25 was over 110,000, causing an unprecedented traffic jam, particularly at entrance and exit points at Kadawatte, Athurugiriya, Pinnaduwa and Godagama. School holidays may have contributed to this heavy increase in traffic, he said.
