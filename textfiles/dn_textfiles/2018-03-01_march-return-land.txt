March for return of land

Members of the Fisheries Solidarity Movement, accompanied by members of several civil organisations, held a demonstration opposite the Mullaitivu Kachcheri on February 26, demanding the release of civilian land held by the Security Forces in the North East, including Mullaitivu, to their rightful owners.
The participants also released a report about the problems encountered by people in the North East, including the fishermen community, on account of the military occupation of their lands.
It is reported that this demonstration and the release of the report were held to coincide with the UNHRC sessions currently underway in Geneva. Northern Provincial Council's Women and Children Affairs Minister Anandi Shashidaran and North East Fishermen's Solidarity Movement coordinating officer Anton Jesudasan also joined the participants.
