Aloysius logged into Apple account within the last 48 hours: ASG

 
Arjun Aloysius of the Perpetual Treasuries has logged into his Apple account within last 48 hours using the password he claims to have forgotten, it was revealed at the Treasury Bond Commission today (01).
Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Yasantha Kodagoda raised concerns of a possible attempt to destroy evidence in Aloysius’ Apple account.
ASG Kodagoda pointed out “the evidence sought by the PCoI should be secured at all costs,” and contemplated that the investigators may already be too late in deriving crucial evidence.
“We don’t know whether he (Aloysius) has already deleted this data.” ASG Kodagoda said.
ASG Kodagoda said Aloysius has logged into his Apple Account using his wife Anjalee Mahendran’s Apple phone.
“How can he (Aloysius) plead amnesia?” Kodagoda asked, “While using the password he claimed to have forgotten?”  
Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera requested the PCoI to consider Aloysius’ attempt to erase important backup data in his Apple user account and to issue an order to Aloysius, or anybody else on his behalf, prohibiting the access or meddling with backup data in the said Apple account.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda pointed out that Aloysius’s claim to have most conveniently forgotten his Apple user account password, while actually having it in his possession, is an instance of contempt of the order given by the Commission. 
ASG Kodagoda further said if Aloysius continue to utter falsehood and not give his Apple account’s password, the Attorney General can consider seeking legal action against Aloysius.
Aloysius’s lawyer President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratne said his client does not remember the password to his Apple account. He also said his client’s email account has been hacked into, after being submitted to the CID.
ASG Kodagoda rose to point out that Premaratne PC was also mislead by his client and told that “Nothing has been hacked into and why would a CID officer hack into an account?”
Referring to Premaratne PC’s claim that his client has “forgotten” the password, Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena asked, “When you say your client cannot remember, does it not imply that there is an Apple account and a password to it?” Premaratne PC answered in affirmative.
Justice Jayawardena asked SASG de Livera and ASG Kodagoda under what law an order should be issued regarding the latest development in the matter relating to Aloysius’s Apple user account. ASG Kodagoda said the order should come under the inherent powers of the PCoI while SASG de Livera said it should be a consequential order.
The PCoI is to make an order regarding the matter tomorrow, after considering the reasons given by both AG’s panel and Aloysius’ lawyer. 
The PCoI issued an order in July third week, to hand over all his digital communication devices used by his from 2015 to 2016, to the Criminal Investigation Department to conduct a digital forensic examination.
Complying with the order, Aloysius handed over his laptop computer and his mobile phone which he was using for the last six months to the CID team attached to the PCoI, on 24 July.
On 24 July morning Aloysius’s lawyer informed the Treasury Bond Commission that Aloysius’s Apple phone which he was using in 2015, was destroyed in Singapore. A statement was also recorded from Aloysius on the same day (24) he handed over his communication devices.
According to ASG Kodagoda, Aloysius initially giving a statement to the CID has claimed that he does not have an Apple user account. Later on, the investigators have found out that Aloysius has used an Apple user account to download certain applications. Aloysius has refused to give his password at that instance.
The PCoI then issued a written order on 28 July, to Aloysius to reveal his Apple user account name and its password.
Aloysius sought permission from the Commission on 31 July, to purchase a SIM card with the same mobile number that he has handed over to the CID. The AG’s panel objected to the application.
