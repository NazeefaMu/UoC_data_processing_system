Konawatta bridge in disrepair

No steps were taken to repair the bridge over the Konawatta River in Addalaichenai so far, residents in the area said.
Residents of Konawatta and Palamunai in the Addalaichenai DS division are inconvenienced due to the lack of a proper bridge to travel to work and marketplaces. This bridge was demolished last year due to congestion of weeds such as salviniya and water hyacinth, which blocked the flow of the Konawatta drainage water.
Residents had complained over the matter for several months.
At least a suspension bridge would tide over their present problem, they said.
