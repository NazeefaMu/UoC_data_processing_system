Constitution is supreme: Dr. Deepika Udagama

‘ Dr. Deepika Udagama, Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission, was present at the Bandaranaike Centre for International Relations (BCIS) for a session of the lecture, Question and Answer (LQA) series which marked International Women’s Day on March 8, 2017.
Dr. Udagama has informed that an article titled “Women’s Rights: Still to go a long way” published by the Daily News has given a very distorted and wrong impression to the reader and it has received very negative public feedback. She has noted that the position she articulated was that on the matter of personal laws, the HRCSL takes the view that Constitution should be supreme. There cannot be any other law above the Constitution.
She notes that her position was that the Constitution as the supreme law should take a principled position on all these matters rather than entertain exceptions.
Regarding consultation with communities she pointed out that community consultation is encouraged as a strategic means to ensure that community has a say over matters that affect them.’
