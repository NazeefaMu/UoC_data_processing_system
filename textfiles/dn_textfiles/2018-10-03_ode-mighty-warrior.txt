Ode to a mighty warrior

One is a university professor cum linguist, the other a lawyer cum artiste. So what will happen when they get together? Weeramuni’s cast gives a majestic ode to the age-old legend of Ravana.
Namel Weeramuni’s 2018 theatre production, an excavation of Ravana, focuses not on the god-like human figure, but the humanity of a human god. Professor JB Disanayaka found a suitable producer in his batchmate, Namel Weeramuni. The seasoned playwright gave the nod to his erstwhile batchmate’s proposal provided some modifications applied. There was aesthetic value embedded in it all right, but Weeramuni did not find enough depth or meaning to complement the aesthetic elegance.
“I took some time and suggested to him to add an interlude with a powerful depth and meaning. I also suggested a story outline. But he was not quite satisfied with my idea. Yet he authorized me to alter and modify the plot.”
Disanayaka had a reason to oppose Weeramuni’s play. He has placed the play in the god. Rama is considered a god in India where an effigy of Ravana is burnt every year. As for Weeramuni, he claims to have done justice to the play with the modification. He took advantage of the permission given by Professor Disanayaka and applied breakthrough-kind of modifications.
Weeramuni took time to combine his own part and the part Professor Disanayaka had written in his childhood. Rama questions Seetha’s purity. That speculation is fair, as Seetha was under another man’s custody and chances are high for a molestation. Rama also entertained fears if Seetha was unfaithful. In response, Seetha claims that she stayed untouched. Ravana kept Seetha in captivity only to avenge Rama who cut his sister’s ear.
Weeramuni moves on to another stratosphere with that well-known story. Ravana offers a plea to Seetha to become his queen consort. He is capable of anything as the lord of Sri Lanka. But then Seetha puts forward something that Ravana cannot fulfil. That particular demand is something even an animal could not fulfil. What is that demand? You will get to see in the play.
“I think Seetha must have got a bit of a soft corner for Ravana while she was under his captivity. Because he did not harm that would have sufficed for her to grow fond of Ravana,” Weeramuni said.
Weeramuni believes in Ravana, as he has read quite a lot about the mighty king. He believes in evidence that the king was smart and clever. He does not set aside the belief that the king had ten ways of thinking. As a medicine man, astrologer and so many other roles coupled together, Ravana could have existed, Weeramuni notes with confidence though he is not sure about the exact period.
Probably 5000 years ago, but the surprising fact is that Ravana had already engineered a plane long before the Wright brothers. That advanced civilization came in tatters owing to the invasion from many quarters.
“The invaders devastated our civilisation. Our decline is because of them. They call us demons. Ravana was not a demon. He could have been a tough man though. That could be why he was called a demon. It is simply like Sinhabahu. He was not a beast. He was not a lion. He was exactly a man who was a leader of a sect or a cult. I am not a fanatic of Ravana like most other people. But I do believe that such a man existed on this very land,” Weeramuni remarked.
The Ravana tale is relevant to the contemporary society because of might and strength the ancient king has showcased. He is reputed to be one of the greatest kings that the Sri Lankans had in the history.
“These great men became gods afterwards because of the noble deeds they had executed. They are worshippable. That is what I believe. They were also intelligent and important people. I remember SWRD Bandaranaike was an object of worship close on the heels of his death. There were people lighting lamps in memory of him in Maradana,” Weeramuni said.
