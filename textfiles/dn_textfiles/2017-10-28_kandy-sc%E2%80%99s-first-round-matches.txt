Kandy SC’s first round matches

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP
Defending league champions Kandy Sports Club who are under the watchful eyes of Mr. Rugby Malik Samarawickrema will come out for the first time on Saturday November 4. This time too thanks to the rugby committee headed by Lasantha Wijesuriya, they have a well balanced side, Sad to say their newly appointed skipper Gayan Weeraratne is a doubtful starter due to an injury. The first round fixtures are November 4th CH & FC in Colombo (venue still not known), November 11th v Police SC at Police Park, November 19th v Army SC at Nittawela, November 26th v Air Force SC at Nittawela, December 2nd v CR & FC at Longdon Place, December 10th v Navy SC at Nittawala, December 16th v Havelock SC at Havelock Park.
Kandy needs another well-equipped ground
Kandy could reign in sports only if another well-equipped ground is built. Sports is so popular in Kandy and developing fast that today there is an urgent need for another playground, especially for sports like cricket. Most of the Kandy schools that are without a playing field go out of town to play matches. Thanks, to the KMC they leased the Nittawela grounds to Kandy Sports Club which is now their rugby grounds at Nittawela. They make good money by hiring it for schools. The Bogambara Stadium was an asset for sports activities earlier when it was under the KMC. But today most of the clubs and schools are finding it difficult due to high ground fees and separate payments for marking lines using the pavilion, referee change room etc. for a playground which is not up to the required standards. Most of the schools and clubs heavily depend on this stadium for their sporting activities, except cricket. Pallekelle cricket stadium was built to promote cricket but today only international games, and big matches are played. Schools who cannot afford to pay the high cost have decided to come back to their old grounds and play.

This will be the 5th rugby academy in the hills, if it is conducted correctly it is going to be the education guide for talented young rugby players. Dozens of up and coming rugger players under the age of 16 are expected to attend the academy for an entry fee of Rs. 1750 and Rs. 2000 as academy fee for a month. Every entry will be given a T-shirt. It will be weekly affair (every Saturday, if Kandy SC has a match on Saturday then it will be on Sunday).
Emil to say good bye to KSC committee
Emil van der Poorten the famous ruggerite, who led Kandy Sports Club in the mid 1960’s, keeps off from the KSC committee in the early days he was in the committee, vice president and secretary. This time he was invited by the present president to serve in the committee and he accepted that invitation on condition that the major shortcomings in the operation of the club be addressed, inclusive of the need for a complete revision of its “Rules & Regulations.” He is not happy with the irresponsible manner in which the club’s affairs are being conducted. He has said that he will not serve on the KSC’s General Committee until and unless the commitments given are lived up to.

Murali Stadium?
Pallekele International Cricket also known as Muthiah Muralitharan International Cricket Stadium was declared opened on November 27, 2009 and became the 104th Test venue in the world. The first Test was played between Sri Lanka and the West Indies. The stadium is Sri Lanka’s eighth Test venue. In 2010 floodlights were installed. It was suggested years back to be named as Muthiah Muralitharan Stadium, in the name of the greatest bowler the country has produced. In July 2010, the Central Provincial Council unanimously made the renaming decision to hono ur the legendary Sri Lankan cricketer Muthiah Muralidaran. Now why is a Pradeshiya Sabha proposing it again, when it has been done years back. The stadium is wholly owned by Sri Lanka Cricket it is their duty to do the needful.

Sylvester’s prove themselves at cricket
Despite having limited facilities St. Sylvester’s College Kandy has emerged as one of the top cricket playing schools in the central hills. They have a playground which can be used only for training sessions. Earlier the Police ground served as their venue for matches and they played all their matches, including the big match on that ground.
Today most of their games are played at Pallekelle Stadium. But they hardly get an opportunity to practice and warm-up on a centre wicket. Despite the lack of facilities the school has performed quite well. Out of three tournament matches against S. Thomas’ College, St. Joseph’s College and De Mazenod College ended in draws, and in the non-tournament games they drew with Joseph Vaz College and Kingswood College.
They were to play Dharmaraja College on 26th and 27th but the game was not played due to ground problems. Their next tournament game is with Lumbini College on 30th and 31st. Vice-captain N. Heshan Ataragalle a right arm pace bowler has done well taking 22 wickets in the matches played so far.
