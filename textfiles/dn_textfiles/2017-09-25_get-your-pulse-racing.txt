Get your pulse racing

She says that she has known him more than half her life. For Tatum Hertogs, the doting wife of ace racer Pasindu Peiris, the relationship has been her anchor. Pasindu has been by her side through good times and hardships. Losing her father last year has been one of the greatest blows in her life. Pasindu has been attending to his father-in-law when Tatum had to take care of their one month old baby. This incident and many more has strengthened their bond.
The meeting
My father, Alan Hertogs, was in charge of organising car races. I would accompany him to the races. I saw Pasindu for the first time on the Fox Hill track in Diyatalawa in 2007. He was only riding bikes then. I was around 13 years old.
We hold a huge party at the end of each year for the racers. We also give an award to the best racer at the event. Since Pasindu performed so well he stood out among the rest. We got the opportunity to chat and dance together at the function. Later we exchanged phone numbers and continued our alliance. Pasindu is seven years elder than me. He is an old boy of Isipathana College and Gateway College, Colombo. I schooled at an international school in Negombo before moving to Colombo International School.
He is ‘The One’
Pasindu and I share a lot of common interests. We are both crazy about cars. We also love animals, adventure and nature.
I come from a foreign background. My Dad is from Belgium while my Mom is Sri Lankan. Therefore Pasindu and I learnt new things from each other. That was an interesting experience for us. I introduced him to different types of food like Japanese, Vietnam and German. He has not tried them out before and soon he became hooked to tasting various types of cuisines. He even established a Japanese restaurant called Sushi Cai in 2014. ‘Cai’ means ‘Ocean’ in Japanese which suggests that we have a wide range of dishes available at the restaurant.
The wedding
Pasindu never really proposed. We always knew that we wanted to get married so it was not really a big shock when we decided that now was the time to tie the knot. We have been going out for five years.
My parents knew about our relationship from the very beginning. They are more laid back because of our foreign background. Pasindu’s parents are a bit stricter and since he is seven years elder than me, they were looking for a bride for him. This hastened our marriage.
We got married on January 30, 2013. We have been married for five years now and altogether we have been together for 10 years.
The children
Our eldest daughter, Ariya, was born on September 12, 2014, while our second daughter, Teyhana, was born on August 18, 2016. I always wanted two girls so I was overjoyed when they were born. A lot of people expected our second child to be a boy because they wanted someone to follow Pasindu’s footsteps. Obliviously we are not stopping both of them if they show interest towards racing just because they are girls! Ariya is already Pasindu’s number one fan and is cheering him all the way along the race track.
The racer vs the husband and father
Once Pasindu goes for a race, he is in a serious mood because his concentration is fully on the track. He is not the sweet and funny guy you find at home then. You need talent and a lot of confidence in yourself to become an ace racer because there are a lot of people who are putting pressure on you expecting you to win. That is why Pasindu is in a different mindset and fully focused on the game when he takes part in a tournament.
Pasindu is a wonderful husband and father. He is very playful with the children. He loves playing with them and taking care of them and they too adore him in return.
The ‘racing passion’
I am passionate about racing. I believe that is one of the key factors which drew Pasindu and me together. I have taken part in a go cart race and came in second place. I would love to take part in racing but since the kids are still young I have to give it a miss. However I definitely hope to get more involved in racing in the future. Pasindu is very supportive towards my passion. He has no objections but has only requested me to give it some time till the kids are older.
I do feel a little fear at the back of my mind when Pasindu is on the race track. However I have seen how much he enjoys engaging in racing. True, it is a risk that you are taking but on the other hand the cars are equipped with a lot of safety gears.
Other passions
Pasindu is a total foodie. He loves inventing new dishes for our restaurant menu and trying out new flavours. He invented a yummy juice once which is a combination of lemongrass, lemon and ginger. It is called the ‘Cai House Glass’. That is one of the items which are most in demand at our restaurant. He also came up with a sushi birthday cake recently. That too has become a hit among our customers.
My family comes from a restaurant background. We have a restaurant in Negombo. So I have always tried out different types of food. My Mom is a superb cook. She used to make all types of dishes for my father. So it was not all rice and curry at home. Pasindu loves the Tom Yam soup that I make.
He is also very social and loves entertaining people too.
Racing tournaments
Pasindu has taken part in many racing competitions abroad, especially in countries like India and Indonesia. He takes part in the Fox Hill Super Cross annually. Before marriage I would always accompany him to such events but now that the kids are here, it is a bit difficult to attend every event. We did take them both to Udawalawe when Teyhana was two weeks old but it was crazy because it was dusty and sunny and keeping an infant in the car for a whole day was not easy.
Greatest strength
Pasindu embodies great leadership qualities. He is good at organizing things and getting people engaged in whatever he wants them to do. He trains young racing drivers and teaches them all the tricks in the trade. He motivates them a lot.
Goriest moment in a tournament
Pasindu raced against an Indian rally driver in Fox Hill Super Cross in Diyatalawa in 2012. There was a lot of tension then because the Indian racer was the Asian champion. Pasindu managed to beat him and win the race in the end.
One change
I wish Pasindu would pay more attention to fitness. He actually does not have time to go to the gym or engage in much fitness activities since the restaurant and races keep him busy. He drops Ariya to Montessori in the morning on the way to his office. He stays in the office most of the time till he has to pick her up and bring her home. Then he goes back to his office in the evening.
Most touching thing
It is something small and simple but very touching like unexpected flowers. Pasindu took me out to Cinnamon Grand hotel for my last birthday in January. My youngest daughter was three months old then and that was the first time since I gave birth that I got the opportunity to dress up and get out of the house.
10 years from now…
Hopefully we would have a few more restaurant branches. I hope Pasindu gets an opportunity to make more use of his talents as a racer and establish his own school to train young racers. I also wish that the kids would excel in studies as well as sports.
