Sustain Lanka programme to help Lanka achieve SDG’s: President

President Maithripala Sirisena said the government has taken another step towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) by launching the Thira Sara Lanka (Sustain Lanka) programme.
The President was speaking as the Chief Guest at the launch of “Thirasara Lanka (sustain Lanka)” programme at the BMICH yesterday. The “Sustainable Lanka”, education and trade fair organised by the Presidential Secretariat along with the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency aims to create awareness over various facets of a sustainable country among the general public.
“It is the responsibility of the government and the people to take these ideas forward. We are currently taking measures to eradicate poverty. In January 2017, the government launched the “Sustainable Era” initiative and the year 2017 was declared as the year for eradicating poverty. An expert committee was also appointed to fulfill the commitments made underthe SDG’s”, he said.
President Sirisena said these measures were taken to move Sri Lanka into a sustainable future and added that policy level decisions are being made to incorporate SDGs into national level programmes.
The President emphasised that all the stake holders should work collectively to make it a success.
“Criticisms are common in a democratic country. There is no need to trace them and try to respond to their criticisms. The government has a clear target.
The initiatives taken are for the betterment of the country therefore we should work towards achieving them”, he said. MP Ven. Athureliye Rathana Thera said the people should come out of the industrial era and change their perspectives towards development programmes.
