Kandy Sports Club has the edge over CR and FC today

A superb game of rugby is on the cards when CR and FC play Kandy SC in their Dialog ‘A’ Division Inter club league rugby first round match at CR grounds in Longden Place today, kick off will be at 4.00 pm.
CR and FC in their last game lost to formidible Army SC who were without some top players at Longden Place last week.
It will be interesting to see whether both sides are capable of playing open rugby, in today’s game. Both teams are famous for playing good qu ality rugby and should give the large crowd something to cheer about.
Red shirts will hope to play their best available side as they are hampered and will play without some of the key players who were side lined due to injuries and thus far not recovered, hence will not play in today’s match.
This season CR’s plus point is their mobile pack, which is about the best equipped with some top class players in the calibre of Omalka Gunaratne, rolling maul pilot Supun Warnakulasooriya, Shemal Weerasekara, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Udara Gayn, Wageesha Weerasinghe and Sashika Fernando should deliver the goods together with the rest to grab ball position in the set pieces.
But in today's game CR and FC will rely more on their speedy three quarters. Their new halves combination of Kavindu De Costa and Chanaka Chandimal who paired off well in the last couple of games, should give their best.
Kavindu is an intelligent player, and has class written in his play, as he often draws the opposition defence and finds the gaps with his clever foot movements for the fast moving three quarter line to do the scoring.
Mean while the Kandy SC who thrashed Air Force SC last week in their own den at Nittawela will be fielding the same victorious team which did duty for them and will be at full strength. One can easily expect a thrilling game from their playing fifteen.
Kandy SC coach, Sean Wijesinghe a former Sri Lanka national captain who is a master tactician will be out to guide his side to another win in this match. Wijesinghe is confident that his team would deliver the goods today.
But, one should keep in mind the CR side who has a superb three quarter line and if they play their usual brand of rugby under Fijian coach Fereti Verabula then they can pierce any team defence as their ball handling as they showed against the formidable Navy SC is the best seen this season against top opponents.

Havies -Army should be a close game
The battle between two top rugby sides in Havelocks SC and the Army SC in their Dialog 'A' Division inter-club league rugby first round match for the 2017/18 season at Ratmalana today should turn out to be a close game. The match will kick off at 4.00 pm.
Haveloc’s have been training really hard under their new captain and Sri Lanka national player Jason Melder during this week and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win.
Army SC on the other hand trained really hard this week under the watchful eyes of their new head Coach Veteran Nilfer Ibrahim who is also a former Sri Lanka national sevens and the present St.Joseph college 1st XV rugby team head coach.
Soldiers will have to be at their level best if they are to beat the Havies outfit at Ratmalana.
But looking at the two teams, Havelocks will definitely go out as the favourites to clinch this contest.
