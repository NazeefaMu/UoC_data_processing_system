SAITM issue
Parents hand over letter to President’s Secretary

The parents’ union of State Medical Students handed over a letter to the Presidential Secretariat yesterday, demanding that the government inform the official stand on SAITM to the Sri Lanka Medical Council and the Attorney General's Department, Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
According to Alwis, the letter requested the President's Secretary to inform the SLMC and the Attorney General's Department immediately about enrolling qualified SAITM students in Kotelawala Defence University’s Medical Faculty.
Any delay of informing the decision to those two institutions will have a negative impact on the Supreme Court judgement to be given soon on the SAITM issue and there will be a conflict between the government's decision to enroll qualified SAITM students in KDU and the judgement given by the Supreme Court, he said.
If there is a conflict between the government's decision and the Supreme Court judgement, the decision taken by the President to enroll qualified SAITM students in KDU will be useless and meaningless, he added.
Meanwhile a group of SAITM students held a press briefing in Colombo yesterday and demanded that the government send all SAITM medical students to KDU without performing any selection.
