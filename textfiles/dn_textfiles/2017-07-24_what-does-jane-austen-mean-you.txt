What does Jane Austen mean to you?

I came late to Jane Austen. She was not on my O level or A level list in the 1950s, nor, as I remember, was she at all promoted by Mr Tillotson, the English Master (in every other respect a remarkable teacher).
I read widely in the school and town libraries but – no Jane Austen. By the time I got to university my reading outside the curriculum was extensive but basically the Russian novelists, the American, French, Irish novelists, and as many comic novels as I could get my hands on, coupled with a conscientious desire to read English – the Brontës, Fielding, George Eliot and Poets. Still no Jane Austen. I read History at university and in those days the perhaps rather sniffy History tutors said that English was something you read for yourself, not for a degree.
The woman who became my first wife lodged with Professor Peter Strawson, and it was he who took me firmly by the hand and led me to the six books which a Philosopher colleague of his thought were the only works of English fiction worth reading.
I suppose I may have dodged or ducked Jane Austen for what now seem to be silly or spurious class reasons or a foolish and mistaken notion of what she might be like. Certainly if I had any thoughts back then up to the age of twenty-one, it would be that – compared with D. H. Lawrence and Thomas Hardy and Thomas Mann . . .
But then I got hooked and have stayed hooked. Sometimes she is so good it’s unbearable and I have to put the book down for a while. The older I got and the better reader I became, and the more I get from her. And she just gets better! Television adaptations have led her to mass audiences and she has thrived there as well. She is incomparable.
PAULA BYRNE
I’m not ashamed to admit that Jane Austen’s novels are my comfort read. After years of Austen scholarship, poring over every perfectly balanced sentence, decoding hidden meanings, trying to filter her sinuous use of free indirect discourse (just where does it begin in Emma?), I now read her for pure pleasure. I understand why so many soldiers (including A. A. Milne) read her in the trenches. Think of a sentence like this: “Elinor agreed with it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition”. Or Catherine Morland: “I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible”. Or this gem: “‘Really, Mr. Collins,’ cried Elizabeth with some warmth, ‘you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one’”.
Austen achieves effortlessly the most difficult thing a writer can do – she makes her reader laugh out loud. But Walter Scott said it best: “That young lady had a talent for describing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life, which is to me the most wonderful I ever met with . . . . What a pity such a gifted creature died so early!”

It’s astonishing how much writers owe to Jane Austen. Most love her, and rush to claim her, and even the few who don’t (principally because they’re ignorant of her work) have to admit she’s been important to them in some way. I belong to the second category. It was my search for an alternative to Austen that took me, eventually, to a way of writing about the world and place that I found in D. H. Lawrence’s Sons and Lovers. My avoidance of Austen came not from an enlightened critique of her work, but strategic disengagement; this disengagement was as important to me as embracing Sons and Lovers would be later. Austen portrayed a kind of provincial English life which I neither had a place in nor recognized. Her drawing room and its conversations denoted an interiority in which I felt unwelcome: not just because I am Indian, but because of the peculiarities of my temperament. At the Morels’, I felt at home – not because I’d grown up in such a home in Bombay, but because, in the way the smell of linen being ironed or the sound of Walter Morel’s whistling drifted from room to room, I was reminded, subconsciously, of my uncle’s house in Calcutta. Provincial modernity brought me joy: it was one of the things Lawrence helped me understand. Austen helped me, too, because her notion of the province was so powerfully different.

I can follow with pleasure the shifting relations between Darcy and Elizabeth, so masterfully manipulated, and relish Darcy’s ultimate capitulation, as though it might not have happened this time around. And I can more generally appreciate Austen’s nuanced social satire, sly digs, perfect timing, broad comedy and outrageous characters. But perhaps I chafe within the necessarily tight parameters of an Austen novel, its domestic settings and familiar imagery, or perhaps the central preoccupations of the plot do not strongly engage me – in any case, I do not come away from reading her with the same exhilaration as I do from other superb books. This exhilaration may come from various sources – among them a delight in the density or distinctness of the author’s language, or the sense that I have been transported into a world that mirrors some recognizable reality but is so strange it verges on dream. Recent deeply satisfying reading experiences, for instance, have been Malcolm Lowry’s Under the Volcano, with its haunting descriptions of an intolerably extended impending storm or a caged eagle or a drunken solitary Ferris wheel ride; Regina Ullmann’s stories, recently published in English, with their eccentric, lost characters; a uncanny love story of 1930s New York City by Millen Brand, The Outward Room; and, to shift into non-fiction, the rural life, human and animal, of nineteenth-century England described in such loving detail, with such compassion and crystalline clarity by W. H. Hudson in A Shepherd’s Life.

We did Emma for A Level, so it was one of the first serious novels I ever read. In a sense, then, Jane Austen is literature to me. She was not just one of the first novelists I read but also the oldest, i.e. earliest. You can start further back, of course, but romping through Tom Jones feels like a bit of a waste of olde time in the way that Persuasion never does. I associate reading Austen with a consciousness of the gap between my limited life experience – swilling beer, basically – and the expanded grasp of the psychological subtleties and nuances of situations and relationships that her books gradually revealed. But I’m conscious also of a different kind of gap: that between the riches afforded by the novels and the tedium of the criticism served up alongside them. Macmillan Casebooks – anthologies of critical essays – were the default educational tools even though most of the pieces in the one on Emma are complete dross. The process whereby “doing English” morphed into “doing criticism” began with Austen and continued all the way through university. - Times Literary Supplement
