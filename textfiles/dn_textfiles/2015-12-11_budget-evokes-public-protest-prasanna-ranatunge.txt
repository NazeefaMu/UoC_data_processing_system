Budget evokes public protest - Prasanna Ranatunge

The Budget for 2016 evoked the biggest howl of public protest in recent history, UPFA Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunge said.
The Budget laid the ground work to destroy the public service, privatisation of state sector institutions and exploitation of the country's resources by foreigners. He said the Budget caused injustice to the state administrative sector and doctors. The Budget could be described as an anti-people Budget, he said. Ranatunge said even though the government blamed restrictions imposed by the Budget on the alleged corruption and fraud committed by the Rajapaksa regime, he believed that this was a Budget framed to recover the loses concurred due to the Central Bank Bond issue. Any vote in favour of the Budget would amount to a betrayal of the people.
They would vote against the Budget even if disciplinary action is taken against them by the party, he said.
