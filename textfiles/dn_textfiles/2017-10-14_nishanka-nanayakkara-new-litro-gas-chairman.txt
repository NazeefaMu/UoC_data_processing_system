Nishanka Nanayakkara, new Litro Gas Chairman

The Ministry of Public Enterprise Development yesterday appointed Nishanka Nanayakkara to the post of Chairman of Litro Gas Lanka Ltd.
Nanayakkara who is a President’s Counsel by profession, is expected to assume duties on Monday (16).
The Ministry had to take action to remove former Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe on Wednesday (11) after criminal charges were levelled against him. He was arrested for his involvement in the case of hacking into a Taiwanese bank account. Moonasinghe has been remanded until October 25.
