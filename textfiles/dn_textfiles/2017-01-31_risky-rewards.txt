Risky rewards

Kianoush Ramezani is a seasoned Political Cartoonist who is very experienced in his chosen profession. An Iranian artist and activist living and working in exile as a political refugee since 2009 in Paris, Kianoush spoke to the Daily News about his love for Political Cartooning and his passion which sustains him, though he faces such life threatening risks.
“I have been living in France since 2009. I am a political refugee. I had to leave Iran, my homeland because of my activities and my cartoons. And now I am involved in many projects in France. I also run an international cartooning organization called ‘United Sketches’, which is a very active network of professional cartoonists in the world and we are promoting freedom of expression in the world of professional cartooning and we are trying to support exiled cartoonists in the profession,” said Kianoush Ramezani
Why political cartooning? What is it that inspires him to take us such a profession?
“Since my childhood I was very sensitive about what was going on in my society. I always had some ideas and I had visuals which means I could see some images in my head and I loved to just bring them out and share it with people. I did not like the regime at all in Iran. I started drawing when I was five and when I was 18, I just discovered my aptitude for political cartooning. Then I started really working as a cartoonist when I was 20,” explained Kianoush.
For Kianoush, the importance of being involved and passionate about one’s job, 100 percent is paramount.
“I couldn’t have done a better job than Political Cartooning. I love photography, I am just enjoying photography but I am not passionate 100 percent. We need to select a job or career only if we are 100 percent passionate about it. I was just passionate about cartooning. I love to take risks. Some people like risks and others just like to lead a calm life. If my two days look like each other then I am already bored! I really love to see change all the time and excitement in my life. In cartooning you can always get this excitement,” pointed out Kianoush.
A man of the people Kianoush has a duty towards himself and towards society at large.
“I feel a responsibility to society, I do not feel myself as obliged but I see a huge responsibility to be in contact with the society and to communicate with the society. I always need society as my audience,” added Kianoush.
The field of Political Cartooning is ever evolving and changing.
“I am optimistic about the future of political cartooning. Because of the new technology and the impressive gadgets that people have – smart phones and tablets, they are always connected all the time anywhere. Now people don’t have the time reading big articles or a book. When it comes to cartoons I believe it has a better chance now because also it has humor, it can surprise people and people like to laugh and be provoked to think, to see what they don’t expect, and I believe the future of cartooning is positive,” informs Kianoush.
The danger to Media in this world is always there. It is field of great risk, but one that holds great promise.
“After the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, many newspapers and main media, they preferred not to publish or publish very less cartoons than before, which means that a lot of cartoonists they had the potential to get a salary or get paid, they are going to lose their job. This is the risk right now cartoonist are suffering, but at the same time because of alternative media now cartoonists have more visibility and more independence let’s say. For example now I am a cartoonist for Courrier International. It is a French Language international magazine which is a unique one- they are using a lot of cartoons even in their cover. The way I am working with this magazine helps me to keep my independence and also get paid,” elucidated Kianoush.
It is very good to be a cartoonist and live in Paris. Because of the history, people respect cartoonists a lot. Even if they don’t understand or even if they are not educated in Art, whenever you present yourself as a Cartoonist, they really respect you.
“I was always welcomed when I was introduced as a Cartoonist. It does not matter which level of education. After the Charlie Hebdo attack, this respect also was added to fear as well. People started to fear as well, you could see if you were introducing yourself as a political cartoonist, sometimes it makes them panic. They were not comfortable to sit beside you. Unless you say – by the way I am not working with Charlie Hebdo. Then they can stay beside you and sit with you. But now after two years now the situation again is kind of normal,” clarified Kianoush.
For Courrier International there are more than 50 cartoonists, who are working with this magazine from many countries.
“In my travel I am hoping to and I am searching for Sri Lankan Cartoonists. To invite him/her to be part of our association. Because we need Sri Lankan ambassador for our organization. Also I would like to propose one Cartoonist from Sri Lanka for Courrier International,” said Kianoush
United Sketches is a new born international organization of Cartooning.
“I founded this organization in 2015. Now we have more than 100 active members. They are some of the most talented political cartoonists in the World. They are from 33 countries. Usually we appoint one ambassador for each country. Which means we share the responsibility. The Cartoonist who is the ambassador, he/she is responsible to observe the situation of other cartoonists and bring potential members to United Sketches. Also to send us an alert if a Cartoonist is in danger. In this way we can help by just raising a voice,” stressed Kianoush.
Kianoush has accepted the risks in life
“When I look at the world right now it is a mess. The people who are ruling it they are stupid. I strongly believe in that. This conflict in Syria, Iraq and Libya, it should not have happened, if the world politicians could have better ideas. We are all connected to each other. We cannot ignore one part of the world. In the current world we cannot avoid the consequences,” argued Kianoush.
Stating that he thought ISIS is a cancer, summed up the interview
“A very developed cancer, always comes from inside. Some bad mistakes made Islamic State a huge cancer. Occupying Libya and killing Gadaffi was a historical mistake. And now you see the consequences. When we involve ourselves in a country without knowing the country, this will happen. We killed a country like Iraq. We already killed Syria and Libya. Ideologies was used to get revenge by ISIS leaders. I hear some of the leaders were some of the former commanders and officers of Sadaam Hussein. ISIS must be removed from the face of the earth.
However not by war. We need the local people to fight against Islamic State and we need to educate the other people not to join Islamic. We need to educate European, African and Australian youngsters. Because they are becoming ISIS soldiers,” summed up Kianoush.
