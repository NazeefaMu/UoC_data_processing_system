Plastic menace

The disturbing image of a Cormorant bird with a plastic bag stuck around its beak at a lake in Boralesgamuwa. Environmentalists assert that tens of thousands of animals and birds die every year from plastic bag litter. Plastic bags, once ingested, cannot be digested or passed by an animal so it stays in the gut. Plastic in an animal’s gut can prevent food digestion and can lead to a very slow and painful death. Recently, the Giritale Wildlife Department nursed to health an elephant that was found to have consumed vast amounts of polythene. The elephant found lying in a swamp at Manampitiya later discharged 40 kilogrammes of polythene, after being given 40 litres of water and three litres of coconut oil. Picture by Saman Sri Wedage
