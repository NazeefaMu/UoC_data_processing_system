Amalgamation of tastes and talents

A gala event showcasing the musical and thespian talents of primary level students of one of Sri Lanka’s premier boys’ schools St. Peter’s College, got underway at the open air stadium of the school recently. The creative talents of students were unleashed at this event, that earned kudos of the large and involved crowds present.
Upwards of 5000 audience members were treated to a smorgasbord of culinary delights by Na Tree Caterers, a trusted name in the food and beverage industry in this country.
“The innocence and guilelessness of childhood were celebrated. ‘Beyond Imagination 2018’ encapsulated, galvanized and enthralled the audience, and compelled them to recognize the limitless possibilities of childhood imagination. It definitely was a scintillating, exciting and a tantalizing experience transcending the immediate, engaging with the creative intellectual dynamism which is uniquely human. It created the possibility to go beyond human imagination, which in itself is a tangible experience of the transcendent,” said the Rector Principal of St. Peter’s College, Rev.Fr. Trevor Martin, assessing the event that was an amalgam of the students talents,and Na Tree’s hospitality.
‘I congratulate St. Peter’s College for staging an event of this nature that brings out the innate talents and creative instincts of students. We are thrilled to sponsor this extravaganza.
Students of this day and age are stressed out and often do not come by their nutritional needs as a result. Since nutrition is a key component in their intellectual development, Na Tree caterers are mindful of nutritional aspects, no matter what type of food is being prepared for consumption by students,’ said the CEO of Na Tree Caterers, Viran Perera.No Tree caterers also provided hospitality to the media that covered this key event in the school calendar.
Na Tree caterers, 45 year veterans in the food and beverage industry, have earned a local and international reputation for providing quality, healthy food that’s free of artificial additives.
Na Tree which participates regularly in vital Social Responsibility projects, hopes to organize some special events in the near future,focusing primarily on providing schoolchildren with a healthy and wholesome diet. -NP
