‘Yala, Bundala deer population under threat’

The deer population in the Yala and Bundala National Parks would soon be extinct if steps are not taken by the relevant authorities to put an end to deer hunting, residents of the area said.
They said venison had become a delicacy among locals and foreigners.
Park Wardens attached to the Lunugamwehera, Yala and Bundala sanctuaries request visitors to abstain from polluting the parks, adding that certain people leave behind polythene sheets and plastic bottles.
Meanwhile, senior fisher folk in Hambantota said that lobsters would soon be extinct in the Southern Province due to illegal fishing activities as well.
