The 7th World Construction Symposium provides a platform for both local participants and international delegates to share their knowledge and ideas with regard to the sustainable design, construction and operations of built assets. The essence of sustainability and eco-innovations are emerging in modern constructions as a fundamental necessity to sustain the country’s future.
In this context, the symposium theme ‘Rethinking design, construction and operations for built asset sustainability’ is timely.
