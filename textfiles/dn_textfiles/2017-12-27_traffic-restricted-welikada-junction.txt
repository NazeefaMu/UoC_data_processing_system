Traffic restricted at Welikada Junction

The traffic flow in the Sri Jayewardenepura Road will be restricted to two lanes (both ways) near the Welikada Junction in Rajagiriya due to the construction work on the Rajagiriya flyover, the Police said.
Police urged motorists to use alternative routes as much as possible to avoid traffic congestion until the flyover is completed.
It is slated to be opened on January 9.
