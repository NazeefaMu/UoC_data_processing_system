‘NWP's Poultry farmers incur losses’

Poultry farmers in Kurunegala and Puttalam said that they had to sell their products at low rates due to the increased imports of chicken and eggs.
They urged the government to discontinue the importation of chicken and eggs in order to save local poultry farmers from poverty.
The North Western Province (NWP) has about 25,000 small-scale poultry farmers, Kurunegala District Poultry Farmers’ Association Chairman S.M. Premaratne told the Daily News yesterday.
Farmers were running at a loss of Rs.50 per product, he said, urging the government to take immediate action to resolve the issue.
