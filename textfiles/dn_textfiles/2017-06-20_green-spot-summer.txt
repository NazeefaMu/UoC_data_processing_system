Green spot for the Summer

Swim Week Colombo 2018, presented by OLU Tropical Water, will showcase the latest swimwear collections of 11 progressive Sri Lankan designers and three international designers. As demonstrated in its previous editions, Swim Week Colombo is the foremost platform for swimwear designers in Sri Lanka as well as the region and brings together some of the leading minds in the fine art of swimwear the world over. Swim Week Colombo 2018 will take place from June 27 to July 2 with runway shows taking place on 30 June and 1 July.
Swim Week Colombo was established in 2015, with the vision of creating a global platform for swimwear and positioning Sri Lanka as the swimwear capital of the world. Sri Lanka is renowned globally for its world-class swimwear manufacturing capabilities, which has engineered and produced swimwear for some of the world’s finest swimwear brands. This existing knowledge and expertise, along with Sri Lanka’s strategic position as an island with world-famous beaches and holiday attractions, lends itself the potential to become a global swimwear hub.
“Swim Week Colombo is a strategic fashion development project which aims to showcase Sri Lanka as an expert is swimwear, resort and active wear. This year we are adopting a positioning which is close to our heart and creates an ecosystem based on Green Consciousness. This is another level of activities,” says Ajai Vir Singh – Founder of Swim Week Colombo.
Swim Week Colombo is strongly attempting to take the position of the world’s first eco-ethical fashion week, and branding has been developed as ‘Swim Week Colombo, Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive’. To qualify this, three pillars of impact have been detailed; Impact on Garment, Impact on Supply Chain and Impact on the environment.
This season, each participating designer needs to implement any one or more of the above impacts to participate. So every collection is in some way contributing to being Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive.
Over the last decade, swimwear has been identified as one of the strongest categories in the global fashion industry, with an estimated worth of more than US$17.6 billion. Although once a status symbol of the elite, high-quality swimwear is now more accessible than ever due to the rise in the number of designers who are branching out to swimwear and the introduction of innovative fabrics and silhouettes that target a wider audience. The rise in beach culture, ease of travel to holiday destinations throughout the year and social media influencers have also lead to the rise of swimwear as a versatile, essential piece of clothing in the wardrobes of discerning fashion consumers.
