LG members to be named after consultations

The local government members elected from the UPFA and SLFP lists will be named in consultation with the respective electoral organisers and district leaders. This will be done once the Election Commission announced election results on ward basis and the number of representatives elected, UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said in a statement issued yesterday.
"In the case of local government institution where no party is able to set up an administration of its own, specific instructions and guidance would be given on the course of action to be taken. "However, no agreement had been reached with any party so far to set up an administration," Minister Amaraweera added.
"It has been observed that the co-operation of UPFA and SLFP representatives is needed to set up an administration in nearly 167 local government institutions where elections were held," the statement added.
