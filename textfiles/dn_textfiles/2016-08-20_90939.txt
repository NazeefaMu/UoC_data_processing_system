President threatens to reveal political secrets if new party is formed

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday warned the rebels that he will show no hesitation in bringing to light political secrets which were kept under raps hitherto, if moves are made to form a new political party in the country.
“We will create an atmosphere for them to wander in the streets, if they form a new political party,” the President said.
President Sirisena added that he will not allow them to form a government forever and will let out all secrets if a new political party is formed.
“Some elements who identify themselves as patriots are dreaming of forming a new government overthrowing the unity government. Their attempts will never come to a reality as this government is in power for five years for the well being of the public," he said.
President Sirisena was addressing a massive public rally at the Sanath Jayasuriya grounds in Matara to mark the first anniversary of the Good Governance government.
“Those who crowned corruption and fraud will not be allowed to come into power again,” the President stressed.
President Sirisena said he and the government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are committed to protect this country more than those who identify themselves as patriots.
“We will never give into the pressure of foreign powers and we will not let any country to interfere with our internal affairs," the President said.
He said the unity government led by him and the Prime Minister was able to reestablish the lost international recognition.
“We have initiated a number of strategies to rescue the country from the vast economic crisis created by the previous regime," President Sirisena said.
The President added that certain quarters in the country query about the achievements made by the government during the last one year.
“Our biggest achievement as a government was to re-establish the lost democracy and freedom in the country and winning the trust of the international community,” he said.
President Sirisena said the country faced an economic down turn due to enormous loans obtained by the previous government.
