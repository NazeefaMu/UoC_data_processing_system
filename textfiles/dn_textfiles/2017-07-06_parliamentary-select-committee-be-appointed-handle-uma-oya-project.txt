Parliamentary Select Committee to be appointed to handle Uma Oya project

 
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said today that a Parliamentary Select Committee to look into the future of the Uma Oya project will be appointed.  
The Minister said that the decision was made by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
A protest was held by Bandarawela residents against the Uma Oya project on June 28.
They protested against the construction of the 26 km long tunnel since it has caused water levels of wells and canals in the area to drop and has also threatened the stability of houses.
