Samsung Galaxy S9, S9+ smartphones to be launched in Sri Lanka

Samsung is proud to announce that its latest flagship devices, the Galaxy S9 and S9+, which were unveiled at the Mobile Word Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona on February 25 February, will be launched in Sri Lanka. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ will be available for sale in Sri Lanka from March onwards. Samsung phones are highly popular in Sri Lanka and the launch of The Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ has been eagerly anticipated amongst the high-end consumer segment.
The Galaxy S9 features Dolby Atmos, enhanced front-facing speakers and a camera that has the potential to beat the Google Pixel 02. The Galaxy S9 retains its overall slick look, with the fingerprint scanner now beneath the camera, rather than being tucked tightly beside. It also offers iris scanning and facial recognition. The metal and glass body retains its curved display, IP68 water-resistance rating and a headphone jack, which is almost a novelty in 2018.
The Samsung Galaxy S9 is with a 5.8-inch display and a massive 6.2-inch display for Galaxy S9+. The camera is a distinct improvement over the S8 thanks to the new adaptive-aperture technology and the world's first f/1.5 aperture on a smartphone. The low-light photos are going to be top-of-the-line and changes have also been made to the fingerprint sensor location and stereo speakers.
