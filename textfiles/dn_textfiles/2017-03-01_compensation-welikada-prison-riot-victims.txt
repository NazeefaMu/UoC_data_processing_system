Compensation for Welikada Prison Riot victims

 
The Committee appointed to investigate the Welikada Prison riot has recommended a sum of Rs. 2 million is paid to the families of 16 victims who lost their lives.
A further sum of Rs. 500, 000 will be paid to each victim that sustained injuries.
The Committee decided that compensation was unnecessary for 11 prisoners, as they were killed while trying to escape the prison.
The proposal to pay compensation to victims of the riot was put forward by Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan.
The Welikada Prison riot occurred when prisoners took control of the prison after objecting to a Special Task Force search for hidden arms, drugs and mobile phones, on November 9, 2012.
Twenty-seven prisoners were killed in the resulting gun battle, 40 were injured.
