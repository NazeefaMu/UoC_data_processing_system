‘New Colombo’ must cater for all: Dr. Amunugama

One must not look only at the requirements of the business community and the affluent classes in designing 'new Colombo' that is emerging, but also into the interests of the needy, many of whom had migrated from villages decades ago, seeking greener pastures, Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
Participating in the inauguration of the annual sessions of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects as chief guest on behalf of the President recently, Dr. Amunugama said the poor have catered to various needs of city life over the years and they must share the benefits of upgrading the city.
The minister referred to the emerging Port City and observed that one third of the newly reclaimed land will be earmarked for parkland and public spaces.
Dr. Amunugama referred to the industrial city that will soon develop in the environs of the Hambantota harbour and the Mattala Airport.
The minister said negotiations have been held with 450 companies and that many more are due to follow.
He said the development of Kandy, Trincomalee and several industrial corridors is on the cards. Architects will benefit from all this, he said.
The minister said in the advance towards increasing urbanisation with about 40 percent of the world population coming to live in cities within the next three or four decades, the environmental sustainability and the upgrading of the quality of life in the cities must be a prime concern of every one.
