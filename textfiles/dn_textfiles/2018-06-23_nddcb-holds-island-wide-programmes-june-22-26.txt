International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking falls on June 22:
NDDCB holds island-wide programmes from June 22 to 26

The International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (June 22) will be marked with several programmes island-wide from June 22 to June 26, National Dangerous Drug Control Board (NDDCB) Chairman Prof. Saman Abeysinghe said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday morning.
The Chairman said drug abuse has become a major threat to schoolchildren above grade nine. The country has hot spots for drugs, but still eradicating drug menace is possible. Thirty two institutions implement a various projects and programmes island-wide to address the issue, he said.
Wasantha Kumara Liyanage attached to the Presidential Task Force on the Prevention of Drugs said the circular number PS/DSP/DUP/07.18 was issued to implement island-wide programmes to mark the day and the week and schools, dhamma schools and others will participate the programmes. He said the progress of the programmes will be reported to the Presidential Secretariat. DIG Sajeewa Medawatta attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau said the illicit drugs have become a serious issue.
The country has several ordinances to deal with the issue. Ganja (KG), Heroin and Cocaine are the top three illicit drugs. But the schoolchildren are getting addicted to new artificial illicit drugs that come as gels, stamps and stickers. Parents should be vigilant on their children's behaviour and take corrective measures immediately if their children go wrong ways.
The public can provide any information on illicit drugs on the hotline 1984 and their confidentiality will be strictly protected, he said.
Excise Department Deputy Commissioner Kapila Kumarasinghe said 1,000 officers were deployed island-wide by the Department to implement programmes. Everything related to illicit drugs changes very fast. Therefore, the raiding methods must be changed fast. The department does its best with the limited resources, he said.
Former DIG Sirisena Herath said that around 6,000 youths were imprisoned on illicit drugs-related issues.
