UTE-CAT conducts internationally recognised construction mechanic programme

In Sri Lanka, there exists many opportunities for youth to progress towards a career in technical and mechanical related areas such as motor mechanic and machine operators etc. However, the lack of a recognised qualification for construction equipment mechanics has hindered the advancement of this important cadre. Though some courses are available, United Tractor & Equipment (Pvt) Ltd (UTE) is the only company in the forefront to provide two internationally recognised training programmes at its state-of-art- training facility.
As pioneers in providing turnkey engineering solutions, UTEhas identified that Sri Lankan youth need internationally recognized certificates in Construction Equipment Maintenance and Repair.Youth who have completed their Advanced Level examination can enroll in the National Certificate in Construction Equipment Mechanic (NCCEM) programme conducted by UTE. This programme is also recognized under the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Level 04 in Sri Lanka presenting ideal opportunities for our youth to be transformed as true professional technicians.
Importantly, this is one of the most sought after certificate course available in Sri Lanka for Construction Machinery with a NVQ Level 4 qualification. UTE’s unique relationship of seven decades with Caterpillar has paved the way for the curriculum of this programme to be approved by world renowned Caterpillar USA, the number one construction equipment company in the world.
Another distinct aspect of the NCCEM programme conducted is that it also paves the way for participants to receive two internationally acclaimed certifications. During the course of the NCCEM programme, after a period of one and a half years, further training by Caterpillar covering areas such as Electrical, Engine Repair, Engine Performance, Hydraulic, Powertrain, Brakes and Air-conditioning will also be conducted.
Participants are able to leverage the best training in the industry via access to Caterpillar University e-Learning training modules and receive both the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Level 04 and the Caterpillar 07 Fundamental System Service Training certificates. The entire programme is conducted by an experienced panel of UTE Training personnel who have received special Caterpillar accredited training. Participants receive training via classroom sessions and also through on-site field workshops.
The training programme is ideally suited for participants within the ages 18-23 and after successfully completing the course, based on an evaluation, participants are assured of employment at UTE.The two and a half year programme consists of three terms. The first and second terms span a period of three months each and are geared towards class room training. The third term consisting of a six-month period affords the participants access to workshop situations.The final 12-months of the programme includes two three-month classroom participation and the remaining six-months are on the field.
The training programme will be conducted at UTE’s state-of-the-art multi-million dollar training center equipped with all the necessary facilities to host successful sessions.Built with an investment of Rs. 200 million, the center is furnished with ten Engine Workstations, a Tractor Dozer, a Computer Room, a Hydraulic Laboratory and other sophisticated equipment.
The course fee is an affordable rate with guidance to obtain bank loans.Also participants who complete the course and receive their certification are assured of a fruitful technical career in the Construction Equipment Industry. The programme offers easy payment facilities where students can make payment for the programme by installments or through a bank loan. In addition, UTE offers a 10% discount on the course fee for participants who pay the total amount. Students will also be paid an allowance when they are engaged in fieldwork.
