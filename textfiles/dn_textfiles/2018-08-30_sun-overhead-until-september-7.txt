Sun overhead until September 7

On the apparent relative southward motion of the sun, it will be directly over the latitudes of Sri Lanka from August 28 to September 7 this year.
The nearest towns where the sun is overhead today are Tarakkundu, Pallamadu, Putur, Puthukkudiyiruppu and Kokkilai at about 12.10 pm, the Meteorology Department said.
Meanwhile, according to the Meteorology Department, showers or thundershowers will occur at a few places in Uva, Eastern, North-Central and Northern Provinces after 2 pm.
Fairly strong winds up to 40 to 50 kmph can be expected in the Hambantota District. There could be temporarily localised strong winds during thundershowers.
The public is requested to take precautions to minimise the damage caused by lightning.
