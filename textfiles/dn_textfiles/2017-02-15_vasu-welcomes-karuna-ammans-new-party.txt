Vasu welcomes Karuna Amman's new party

Welcoming the new party formed by Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman, Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara yesterday said he hoped the new political party will oppose the extremist politics practiced by certain Tamil politicians in the North and East.
Addressing a press briefing organised by the Socialist Alliance in Colombo, Nanayakkara noted that the new party should stand against extremist politics practiced by Northern Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran and certain other political leaders.
He suggested the new party should form closer links with the main stream political parties in the South and promote democratic values rather than pursuing the path of extremism.
Certain extremist Tamil politicians were conniving with foreign elements with vested interest, he said adding that the new party should deviate from this norm and promote reconciliation while standing for the rights of the Tamil speaking people.
The former LTTE leader turned Deputy Minister, recently formed a new party named the Tamil United Freedom Party in Batticaloa.
Muralitharan said his party will voice the concerns of Tamils in the North and East.
After the end of the war in 2009, Muralitharan joined the SLFP with a group of his supporters and was appointed as a Vice President of the SLFP by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
