Never say cheese always!

Eating too much cheese may raise your risk of getting breast cancer by more than 50 per cent. Cheddar and cream cheese in particular could increase the danger, a study of women's diets found.
Dairy, with the exception of yoghurt, has been linked to the disease because it contains a growth hormone called IGF-1, thought to turn good cells into malignant ones and encourage breast cancer growth.
It has also been linked to obesity, which raises the risk of 13 types of cancer.

Researchers at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in New York looked at more than 3,000 women - of whom 1,941 had breast cancer - over 11 years, measuring dairy intake.
They found cheese raised the risk of breast cancer by 53 per cent, particularly a high intake of cheddar and cream cheeses, while eating yoghurt appeared to cut the danger by 30 per cent.
Lead author and professor of oncology Dr Susan McCann said: 'Dairy foods are complex mixtures of nutrients and non- nutrient substances that could be negatively as well as positively associated with breast cancer risk.'
Charity Breast Cancer Now said the cancer link was still not proven but people should eat a balanced and varied diet.
However, dairy products have also been linked with obesity, which raises the risk of getting 13 types of cancer.
The US scientists looked at more than 3,000 women over 11 years, measuring dairy intake using a food questionnaire.
They found cheese raised the risk of breast cancer by 53 per cent, particularly a high intake of cheddar and cream cheeses, plus American varieties.
However eating yoghurt appeared to cut the risk by 30 per cent for the women studied, 1,941 of whom had breast cancer.
Lead author and professor of oncology Dr Susan McCann said: 'Dairy foods are complex mixtures of nutrients and non-nutrient substances that could be negatively as well as positively associated with breast cancer risk.
'Future studies are needed to confirm the protective potential of yogurt in this type of cancer.'
Manveet Basra, senior public health officer at Breast Cancer Now, said: 'Despite this, and many other studies looking at whether or not there is a link between diet or specific foods and breast cancer, this link is still not clear.
'We do know that eating a balanced and varied diet can help to maintain a healthy weight, which in turn can lower an individual's risk of developing breast cancer.
'However, it is difficult to separate out the real impact of specific foods from other lifestyle factors.' -Dailymail
