Marie Musaeus-Rohini Alles Challenge Trophy :
Musaeus-Gateway netball encounter

Musaeus College and Gateway College are set to take the netball world by storm as they join hands to inaugurate an annual encounter, with the aim of making netball a spectator sport.
Students from one of Sri Lanka’s oldest private schools will pit their skills against those from a premier International school in an atmosphere of healthy rivalry and camaraderie. The two schools will vie for the ‘Marie Musaeus – Rohini AllesTrophy’, named after the founders of the two schools.
Marie Musaeus Higgins, a German educationist, is best known as the founder and Principal of Musaeus College. She authored several publications based on Buddhist and Sinhala cultural themes, including Poya Days in 1924. She is recognised as an important figure in the pre-independent Buddhist revival in Sri Lanka and a pioneer in female education in the country.
Rohini Alles is a former teacher of Royal College, Colombo and the founder Deputy Principal of President's College. Mrs. Alles played a decisive role in the establishment of Gateway, especially in instituting the Primary School. Having been a strength to the founder, R.I.T. Alles during the formative years of the organization, Mrs. Alles continues to play an important leadership role at Gateway.
The main focus of the encounter will be the Under 20 encounter between the two schools. An exhibition match will be played between Visakha Vidyalaya and Gateway College Kandy. Due attention will be paid to upcoming talent by incorporating an under 15 match at the start of the event. The event will include activities for spectators and a joint follow-up social welfare program. This inaugural event, to be held at the Royal College Sports Complex on 30 of June is jointly organised by the Musaeus College and Gateway College Netball Committees. The organisers are confident that this encounter will foster enduring traditions and unite the two institutions, both on and off the field.
