Rehabilitation of Labugama Kalatuwawa Water Treatment Plants completed

Access Engineering PLC braces its presence in the water sector with the recently completed rehabilitation work of Labugama and Kalatuwawa Water Treatment Plants. These time-worn water supply schemes have been accounting for 15 -18% of water requirement in Colombo City and Suburbs before rehabilitation work began.
Labuagama and Kalatuwawa Treatment plants were constructed by the British in 1886 and 1957 in close proximity to each other with a capacity of 60,000 m3/day at Labugama WTP and 90,000 m3/day at Kalatuwawa WTP which have been later reduced by 30% due to the severe deterioration that has occurred over the years.
Recognizing the vital rehabilitation work required for the said the treatment plants, National Water Supply and Drainage Board initiated a project with a tied aid loan provided by the Government of Hungary together with Access Engineering PLC and Fevarosi Vizumvek of Hungary. Design and the construction of all the non-process components of the project and civil work of process based components were primarily awarded to Access Engineering PLC under a consortium formed by Access engineering PLC and Betonutepito Zrt of Hungary while Betonutepito Zrt proposed and designed the new water treatment process and the supplied all mechanical and electrical materials.
The long awaited rehabilitation work proceeded under the three stages of design, construction and assistance in operations and maintenance. The scope of the work includes the renovation and replacement of existing filters and clarifiers, intake well improvements, modification of aerators and other process structures , design, supply and installation of all M&E equipments, reconstruction and renovation of existing buildings , internal roads and site work, etc,
With the completion of the project by 26th of February 2017, the productive capacities of the treatment plants were extended and the water quality was significantly improved.
The excess of water treated after the rehabilitation work, is now supplied to the areas situated in western -east zone of Colombo (Maharagama, Homagama, Padukka, Kaduwela, Seethawaka, Kotte, Kesbewa & Kolonnawa...etc,)
"The engineering team worked in a highly challenging environment as the rehabilitation work proceeded while the treatment plants are in operation.
Yet Access Engineering made every effort to complete the work while ensuring minimum disturbance are made to the supply of water to the city of Colombo" said Dhanushka Munasinghe, Project Manager of Rehabilitation of Labuagama & Kalatuwawa Water Treatment Plants.
