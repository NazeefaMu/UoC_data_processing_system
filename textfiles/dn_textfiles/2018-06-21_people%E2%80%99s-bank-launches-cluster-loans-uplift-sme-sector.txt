People’s Bank has launched a cluster of loans aimed at empowering micro, small and medium sector businesses to scale up and become financially viable.
These loans schemes are aligned with 2017 Budget Proposals to uplift the SME and Commercial Sector under the ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ Banner. People’s Bank’s new loans consist of concessional, re-finance and interest subsidized loans to address every obstacle faced by small and medium scale entrepreneurs in terms of accessing financial support.
Demonstrating its commitment to help its target groups avail of these new loans, People’s Bank has established Regional Credit Units in the Regional Head offices covering 348branches island-wide where trained and dedicated teams will help entrepreneurs secure the ideal credit facilities for their businesses.
 The Regional Credit Units will also provide non-financial assistance, flexible conditions, less paperwork and act in an advisory capacity to facilitate approval and documentation.

Vasantha Kumar says, “People’s Bank remains committed to partnering the socio economic progress of the nation as it has done for decades before. These new cluster of loans are devised to address critical needs of micro, small and medium scale businesses in order for them to upscale their businesses.”
