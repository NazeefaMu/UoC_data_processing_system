Magical forest creatures from avocado pits

Jan Campbell was preparing an avocado for lunch one day when she was struck by the beauty of the pit inside, an object most people throw away without a second thought. After weeks of pondering its potential, a deeply pigmented surface scratch inspired her to carve away its layers until a beautiful piece of art appeared.
Ever since that day, the Irish artisan has been turning avocado pits (or 'stones,' as she calls them) into tiny, intricately detailed figurines inspired by Celtic folklore. She carves the tranquil faces of forest spirits, the flowing hair of ancient goddesses, and even a handful of wild mushrooms now and then. The miniatures can be simply displayed as statues, or worn as pendants, and are meant to provide the holder with a unique sense of companionship and comfort. Bored Panda
