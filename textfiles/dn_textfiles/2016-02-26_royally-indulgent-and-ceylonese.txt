Royally Indulgent and Ceylonese

 
Spa Ceylon products are world renowned. What started as one outlet rapidly grew to several places in Colombo itself and then extended an arm to Kandy, Galle and few more to various parts of the South East Asian countries. Recently, they grew even larger when they opened the Royal Indulgence Spa (truly a royal feel once you enter) on Galle Road, spotlighting itself in the heart of Colombo where even in the night, when you drive by, you won't miss it.
So I met up with two young lads Shiwantha Dias and Shalin Balasuriya, who are not just business partners but brothers, to share their success story in bringing Spa Ceylon to where it is today.
Q: How did you both come into this trade?
A: Well, our mum (Janet Balasuriya) was the inspiration behind this and she always taught us to dream big, go out take risks and do things, giving us confidence. Plus growing up in a business family so this kind of business was in our blood. We never planned to open a spa in the first place as we were in the production business.
We had our Janet brand which was a mass market brand. We saw an opportunity while running the business, product development, factory production facilities in place and saw an opportunity create something different and create something that can sustain itself internationally.
When the war ended, everything was falling into place and it gave us much more in Sri Lanka than we expected. The first store was opened in Crescat.
Q: For Royal Indulgence, why did you choose this location?
A: We were always looking out for new locations as the brand has been expanding plus it has been popular with tourists and targeted high end consumers. Galle Road is tourist hub of Colombo - so it made sense location wise and also given the space you want.
We wanted to create a store that has more experience, luxurious, and more pampering - so all this fits into this store.
There's approximately 6000sqft of space with half of it been the store and other half the spa.
What we did was basically take a building that was here from 1970, ripped it to the shell and custom built it to the store. With people working 24/7, this building came up in 3 months.
Q: Can you tell a bit about the interior décor and the reasons behind it?
A: As part of our strategy to increase the profile of the brand and to strengthen the connection with Ceylon. We had a designer from France who we got down to Sri Lanka and took him around the country to give us new inspiration as part of our strategy to take it to the European and American markets. Looking at what was left of old Ceylon, old palaces, temples, art and culture of the country, he gave us this idea of developing a range based on pld palace art and traditional Ceylonese art. We reached out to an artiste who does art in temples and gave a brief of the colour palates we wanted and gave him the freedom to develop this 'flower designs'. And also this sort of art is passed down in generations and it's a technique that looks easy but not so easy.
Apart from the complete brand experience, even the exterior look is to give it the iconic luxurious store for a Sri Lankan brand. The highest quality LED screens are what are used outside for the display of the store. We wanted to create a space that looked international. Another thing is that our doors are closed where entry is from the inside. The interesting part is also that the most of our customers are walk-ins. Even though the locals don't walk much the tourists love to walk. So we are targeting large tourist groups.
Q: How many ranges of products do you have?
A: the whole product range we can break it down to two larger segments. First of which is the Dosha range that has body lotions, shower gels and much more. Then we move to our more indulgent range which is also the Royal Indulgence Range which has about There are about 8 royal indulgence ranges. Apart from that we have the Majestic Ceylon Elephant range where 10 percent of its revenue sales internationally to the Elephant conservation of Sri Lanka. Then there is the Fragrance range which is from Home aroma, Essential oils. What we have done is that every section has an experience area where people can try it. And if they like the fragrance we can get it in a diffuser, candle and whatever mode they like. We have about over 400 ranges experience in the brand at the moment. The nature of the industry is that there some new products coming in and its continuously expanding.
Q: How many therapy rooms do you have here?
A: We have got 5 therapy rooms, one royal suite which is rather large. The royal suite is the largest and most indulgent pampering space Spa Ceylon has at the moment. It has a separate bath area, two oversized spa beds. Then there is one room which is traditional ayurveda room which gives Shirodhara and traditional ayurveda treatments. There are two couple rooms, a facial room and foot spa which have 8 seats plus a room for manicure/pedicure. In terms of capacity this is one of our largest spas we have.
Q: What about the rest of the team of Spa Ceylon?
A: We have a good team in place. Shalin looks after the customers, meeting corporate customers. I look after the product design and the formal relation side of it. There's a sister who handles all the financial aspects of the company, and another sister who handles the spa training and services. Each of specialize in different area. WE have a lot of extended family as well who help out here. Plus we have a good team of people who have been with is for a very long time. We have a superb back office team.
Anyone who has used Spa Ceylon will be able to detect it from miles away and the fragrances just last for days. So if your nose detects a really indulgent aroma on Galle Road - then you know you are heading the right way for an exotic, royally indulgent treatment.
This Royal Indulgence store is truly a "must do" on your list when in Colombo. There is seriously nothing like this. And to feel really royal, you get to sit on the replica of King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe's Royal Throne and take selfies to your heart's content and have your very own reigning moment!
