National Movement to ‘Protect Sri Lanka’ conducts protest

The National Movement to ‘Protect Sri Lanka’ yesterday held a protest march in Colombo against the privatisation of unused state plantation land.
The group of environmental activists, university students and young professionals were led by the group ‘Hadabima Surakina Jathika Satana’.
The group marched around Viharamahadevi Park shouting slogans against deforestation,the privatization of state plantations and the leasing of estate land near Knuckles rainforest.
The march coincided with World Environment Day which fell yesterday.
Protect Sri Lanka, National Organizer, Palitha Wickremaratne said they had just taken two weeks to organise the protest and that those who attended were enough to change things, “We don’t need great numbers. All of you here came voluntarily and that is important”.
They allege that the former Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim had through the Cabinet Paper bearing number 2017/18 had given out 60,000 acres in the Central Province for private businesses.
According to the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation however, the total extent of land owned by the government is only 23,927 acres.
Protect Sri Lanka Executive Member Shashikalana Ratwatte also spoke of the need to stand up against environmental degradation in the country.
“We will fight for Knuckles as we fought for Wilpattu. We were not able to stop the destruction of Wilpattu completely but we were able to have everyone talk about it until development was arrested within the forest,” he said.
He also alleged that Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma was involved in giving out 4,000 acres of flood plain land to his supporters.
Sajeewa Chamikara of the land and agriculture reform movement in the meantime alleged that the government was preparing a National Resource Plan 2018-2050 to privatise many state owned lands for industries, large scale agriculture and foreign investments.
He asked that those who were gathered to come together to oppose the sale of natural resources.
Ven. Ananda Sagara Thera (President, Protect Sri Lanka), Hemantha Vithanage Independent member of the Balapitiya Pradeshiya, Ruwan Sampath and other veterans in the environment field were present on the occasion.
