Appointment of Director to Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital : Health Minister responds

Dr. Rajitha Senaratne responding to an accusation made at him that he had appointed a director of the Tobacco Company to the Director Board of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital, said the person the Minister appointed to the Director Board of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital is a Charted Accountant and an Advisor to the Prime Minister.
This person did the coordination between the Government Medical Officers’ Association and the Prime Minister during the recent discussion.
“He did the coordination with the knowledge of the high officials of the Association. It is not ethical to criticise the person who once helped. It is not a sign of professionalism,” the statement said.
“Media did not highlight when the tax on tobacco increased up to 90 percent and it was not the headlines in newspapers. But media make headlines with what the association says. It is surprising the media did not admire the tax increase on tobacco. Even WHO highly admired it,” the statement said.
