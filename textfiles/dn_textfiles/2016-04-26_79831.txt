Tokyo 2020 unveils 'snake-eye' logo after plagiarism row

Tokyo, Monday: Tokyo 2020 Olympic organisers on Monday unveiled a new "snake-eye" logo nearly eight months after the original choice was scrapped over a plagiarism scandal.
However, they faced an immediate backlash from critics calling it "dull" while in another twist, there was further embarrassment for Japanese Olympic chiefs after local media revealed the winning design well before the official announcement.
The new emblem -- with roots in feudal Japan -- was created by Tokyo-based designer Asao Tokolo and features a circular indigo-coloured Japanese traditional chequered pattern above the words "Tokyo 2020" and the Olympic rings.
Its three varieties of rectangular shapes represent "different countries, cultures and ways of thinking", organisers said in a statement.
"I don't know what to say, my mind's gone blank," a blushing Tokolo told a news conference. "The Olympic logo is a traditional design resembling a snake's eye and the other (Paralympic) is shaped like patterns often used by feudal warlords."
Tokyo organisers were forced to ditch a logo by Japanese designer Kenjiro Sano last year following allegations it too closely resembled that of a theatre in the Belgian city of Liege created by designer Olivier Debie. Sano denied any plagiarism. Officials insisted their decision had not been in response to a lawsuit filed by Debie but slumping public confidence as Tokyo organisers lurched from one crisis to another.
"It has been a tough process," said Ryohei Miyata, head of the Tokyo 2020 emblem committee, after Tokolo's artwork was chosen from a shortlist of four finalists.
"But now we have a new emblem and we hope Japan will love it like a new-born baby."
