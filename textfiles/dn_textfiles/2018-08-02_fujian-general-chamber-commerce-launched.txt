Fujian General Chamber  of Commerce launched

To further strengthen economic ties between Sri Lanka and Fujian Province, Fujian General Chamber of Commerce based in China and Fujian Association in Colombo was established at Cinnamon Lake on Tuesday.
President of Fujian General Chamber of Commerce and Fujian Association in Sri Lanka, Zheng Jinshan, said that China’s Belt and Road initiative will bring benefits for Sri Lanka as well as different countries and regions that are connected through it. “Sri Lanka is one of the most important countries along the maritime silk road, and we believe there`ll be more and more opportunities and cooperation between China and Sri Lanka to provide better benefits for both countries due to this initiative.”
While Sri Lanka has many resources and huge potential for development, the country also needs to build more infrastructure and financial systems. “With the rapid development of the tourism industry and service industry in Sri Lanka we see more opportunities to attract foreign investors to Sri Lanka. The establishment of Fujian General Chamber of Commerce and Fujian Association in Sri Lanka is fully supported by the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka and The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of Fujian Province, as well as the Sri Lanka Overseas Chinese Association.
