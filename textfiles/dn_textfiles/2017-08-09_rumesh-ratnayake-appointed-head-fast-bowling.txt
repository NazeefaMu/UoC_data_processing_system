Rumesh Ratnayake appointed Head of Fast Bowling

Former Sri Lanka fast bowler Rumesh Ratnayake has been appointed as the Head of Fast Bowling for Sri Lanka Cricket.
The 53-year-old pacie renowned for his nine-wicket haul against India in 1985/86 which resulted in Sri Lanka’s inaugural Test series victory against India will take over the role from another former Sri Lanka fast bowler Champaka Ramanayake who has now joined Bangladesh as their fast bowling coach.
Ratnayake will head the National Fast Bowling program spearheading its talent identification, skills development and training processes in cohesion with the National High Performance plan.
Sri Lanka Cricket has invested heavily over the past year in infrastructure and specialist resources for the national feeder programs in order to identify groom and develop the next generation of talented young players from across the island, an SLC media release states.
