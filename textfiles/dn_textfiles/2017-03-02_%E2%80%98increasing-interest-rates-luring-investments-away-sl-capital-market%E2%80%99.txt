‘Increasing interest rates luring investments away from SL capital market’

 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Tilak Karunaratne says increasing interest rates are luring investments away from Sri Lanka’s capital market.
Noting that liquid, efficient stock markets are the foundation for achieving sustained economic growth, Karunaratne stressed that for these reasons, countries which have been overly dependent on traditional bank credit for many years are now gradually turning their attention to capital markets.
“Unfortunately in Sri Lanka the situation is different.”
He made these views speaking at the South Asian Federation of Exchanges (SAFE), conference held in Colombo this week.
He also spoke on the importance of regional integration of capital markets and working towards developing a regulatory environment which encourages Stock Exchanges to embrace integration.
According to Karunaratne, more recently, capital market integration has continued to accelerate, as new investing opportunities emerge.
Unfortunately, South Asia is the most mal integrated region in the world as a result of highly restrictive national policies governing financial markets.
“Removal of controls on capital transactions within the region, harmonisation of capital market infrastructure including regulations, taxation, accounting, trading systems and cross-listings of securities are necessary steps to move towards regional financial integration.”
If markets are not operated in a transparent, efficient and fair manner investors are quick to flee environments that are unstable or unpredictable, he said adding that therefore, securities regulators are expected to detect market malpractices that distort price discovery and erode public confidence in the market and act promptly to deter such aberrations and protect the investing public.
