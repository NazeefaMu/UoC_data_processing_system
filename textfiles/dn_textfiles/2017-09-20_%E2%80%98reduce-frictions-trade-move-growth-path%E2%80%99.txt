‘Reduce frictions in trade to move into growth path’

National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva urged the need to reduce frictions in trade in order to lubricate Sri Lanka’s trade with the rest of the world.
Noting that para tariffs and other protectionist taxes slow down growth of the export sector, the Minister emphasised the need to reduce frictions in trade, by formulating necessary trade reforms on an urgent basis.
“We must be enlightened enough to be able to appreciate the fact that trade reforms are absolutely essential,” Minister De Silva.
Stressing that the government has provided unprecedented tax holidays for those who were interested in investing in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, the Minister expressed hope that huge capital allocations given by the government would attract more foreign investors to the country.
He was speaking at the Sri Lanka - USA Business Council of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Seminar on US GSP programme, held at JAIC Hilton yesterday.
He further added that Sri Lanka needs to do different things to fulfill set targets in the economy and to be the hub of the Indian Ocean. To this end, it is essential to make structural changes and to move into the growth path, the Minister said.
The US GSP programme promotes economic growth in the developing world by providing duty free entry to the US market for the goods imported from beneficiary developing countries. As a GSP Plus beneficiary country, Sri Lanka may export over 3,500 different products to the US duty free. This is in addition to the 3,800 products that are duty free for all countries.
US companies and customers benefit from the GSP programme because the products that they purchase under GSP are exempted from import tariffs which can range between 2%-20% of the item’s cost.
US businesses imported US$ 18.9 billion worth of products under the GSP programme in 2016.
