Leicester striker Vardy gets top award

 
London, Monday: Leicester City forward Jamie Vardy has been voted the 2016 Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers' Association (FWA), it was announced Monday.
The 29-year-old striker took the award as a clear winner ahead of team-mates Riyad Mahrez, who had already taken the Player of the Year award voted on by his fellow professionals, and N'Golo Kante.
Vardy has scored 24 goals for club and country so far this season as the Foxes close in on what would be a remarkable Premier League title triumph.
They will be crowned champions should closest rivals Tottenham Hotspur fail to beat Chelsea on Monday.
In total seven Leicester players received votes in the FWA poll, with Danny Drinkwater, goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, captain Wes Morgan and Danny Simpson also receiving votes.
Vardy will be honoured with the prestigious FWA accolade, which has been running since 1948, at a gala dinner in London on May 12.
FWA chairman Andy Dunn, of the Sunday Mirror, said: "It is testament to their all-round excellence that so many Leicester players polled votes from our members. The Jamie Vardy story, though, clearly captured the imagination of so many writers.
"His record-breaking feat of scoring in 11 consecutive matches is the jewel in what will surely be Leicester's Premier League crown.
"And the Footballer of the Year award is not just a reflection of his fantastic season, but recognition of a remarkable journey from non-league to the international stage."
Other players to receive votes from FWA members were Tottenham striker Harry Kane, West Ham playmaker Dimitri Payet, Manchester City duo Sergio Aguero and Kevin de Bruyne as well as Spurs midfielder Dele Alli.
