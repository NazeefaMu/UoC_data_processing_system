New Constitution along with referendum : Rajitha

Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday, said the government would proceed with a new Constitution along with a referendum, keeping to its mandate.
“The government has not changed its policy. We want a Constitution which would abolish the Executive Presidency and introduce a new electoral system,” Minister Senaratne said, addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department.
He insisted that the Constitutional making process had not stalled, but was going ahead as planned. “Various political parties are studying various reports. We will then submit a draft to Parliament,” he said.
The SLFP in the meantime, has said that it would not support a referendum and that it would be better to go for an amended Constitution rather than a new one.
Despite these contradictions within the two main parties in the government, Senaratne stressed that the government would go ahead with the referendum, “Only certain people in the SLFP did not want it and they were not with the President when he came to power. We have given certain promises in our manifesto and we will keep to it,” he said.
Foreign Affairs Minister and UNP MP Mangala Samaraweera in his speech to the UNHRC recently said.
