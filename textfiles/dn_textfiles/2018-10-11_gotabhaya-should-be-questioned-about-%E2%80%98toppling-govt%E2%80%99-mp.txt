Gotabhaya should be questioned about ‘toppling govt.’ - MP

Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa’s wish to topple the government ‘somehow or the other’, is serious and he needs to be questioned to ascertain the reason for such a statement, UNP Colombo District Parliamentarian Mujibur Rahuman said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha yesterday, MP Rahuman said that as a former defence secretary of the country, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa should be very well aware of the democratic way of forming a new government. So there seems to be a hidden motive for his statement which claimed that he is not aware of the way to form a new government.
He said that this is an irresponsible and conspiratorial statement which challenged the democratic way of forming a government.
Responding to a question by a journalist with regard to the proposed caretaker government, MP Rahuman said that nobody can form a caretaker government without dissolving Parliament and a two-thirds’ majority is required to dissolve Parliament.
