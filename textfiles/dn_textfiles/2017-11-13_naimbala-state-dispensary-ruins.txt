Naimbala State Dispensary in ruins

The Naimbala State Dispensary was suffering with many shortcomings, people in the area said.
The dispensary does not have essential drugs and equipment needed for treating emergency cases.
The Yatiyana and Thihagoda towns lack an Osu Sala outlet or a state pharmacy. Poor patients seeking treatment from the dispensary have to purchase medicines from private pharmacies at high cost, they said.
Clinics at the dispensary are poorly maintained and the entire building in ruins. Water seeps into the building during rains, patients said.
Weeds have encroached on the ground and the place is seen like an abandoned construction. A broken boundary fence around the dispensary cannot protect it from looters and vagabonds, the residents said. Walls badly need paintings and doctors and staff members have no space to have their meals or even for a rest. .
Many emergency cases brought to the hospital daily are transferred to the Matara District General Hospital and the Kamburupitiya Regional Base Hospital since the Naimbala State Dispensary hardly has necessities.
They said over 50,000 people live in the area and they urgently need a proper divisional hospital.
Therefore, they request the authorities to take steps to renovate the hospital and provide it with necessary facilities.
The dispensary was shifted to a private building recently but the new place does not meet required condition or facilities for a proper medical institution, the residents said.
