Firearms, uniforms for Wildlife men

The Cabinet has approved AK 47 firearms for Wildlife officers.
Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said Cabinet had given the approval to import 2,568 AK 47 guns at a cost of Rs 16,000 per rifle. Wildlife officers will be given training related to the use of the fire arm and new uniforms similar to the armed forces will also be given to officers to boost their morale in their profession.
Initially 1500 fire arms will be purchased under this programme this year. These fire arms will be issued to small maintenance groups in wildlife parks and another lot will be given to Assistant Range Officers attached to the Wildlife Department.
