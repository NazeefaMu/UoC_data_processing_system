Foetuses with Lethal Congenital Anomalies should be allowed to be aborted: Health Minister

 
Foetuses with Lethal Congenital Anomalies should be detected early and aborted since allowing an abnormal human being to be born is a sin, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne stated.
Minister Senaratne said that the proposal to allow abortion of foetuses with Lethal Congenital Anomalies and foetus conceive due to rape will be submitted to the Cabinet once the Health Ministry receives it in writing. 
During the Annual Academic Sessions of the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka, a proposal was made to legalise abortion in two occasions. But still the proposal has not been forwarded to the Health Ministry in writing, the Minister stated.
