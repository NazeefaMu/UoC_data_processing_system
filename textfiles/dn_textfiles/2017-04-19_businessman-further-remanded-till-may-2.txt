Businessman further remanded till May 2

Businessman Nandana Priyantha Perera, a spare parts supplier to Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till May 2 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyram Trotsky
He was accused of cheating and misappropriating Rs. 125 million of public funds when purchasing a stock of leaf springs to the SLTB between 2010 and 2012.
SLTB former Chairman Shashi Welgama, who was also arrested over the incident, is currently out on bail.
At a previous occasion, the Court refused to grant bail to the businessman citing there are no exceptional circumstances to release him on bail.
A revision application filed by the businessman challenging the Magistrate’s court order to refuse bail is to be taken up before the Colombo High Court on April 28.
On December 20, 2016, Shashi Welgama and Nandana Priyantha Perera, the owner of Nandana Auto Products Co. Limited, were arrested by the CID regarding an investigation into a financial fraud said to have taken place when purchasing leaf springs to the SLTB.
The CID had informed Court that the SLTB on two occasions had paid advance payments amounting to Rs. 40 million and Rs. 166 million to Perera to provide leaf springs to the SLTB. The CID further alleged that the suspect had supplied the leaf springs to the SLTB with a deficiency amounted Rs. 24 million and Rs. 101 million.
The CID further alleged that the former SLTB Chairman had authorised the financial transactions acting in his capacity as the then SLTB chairman. The CID further informed Court that original documents pertaining to this fraudulent transaction had been destroyed by the previous administration and a complaint regarding the incident had been made by present SLTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena. The suspects are charged under the Public Property Act.
