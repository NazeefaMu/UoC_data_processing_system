Nearly 30 pc of farming population fallen prey to kidney diseases

The population in the North Central Province is 1,367,776 and of it, 65 percent earn their livelihoods by farming. It is learnt that 30 percent out of the farmer population in the province suffer from kidney diseases while 6.2 percent of those employed in the government sector are prey to the menace, according to a recent survey.
Those between 51 - 80 years are the most vulnerable to kidney ailments, it was found.
According to the provincial health service information sources, the number of kidney patients registered for treatment at government hospitals in the province is 16,676, which is 10,016 in Anuradhapura and 6,663 in Polonnaruwa. Around 300 persons in the North Central Province die of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
According to statistics, the majority of kidney patients in the country live in Medawachchiya MOH division amounting to 1,609 patients. Patients are also found in Padaviya (844), Kebithigollewa (608), Rambewa (1,100), Horowpothana (882) and Kahatagasdigiliya (549). With regard to Polonnaruwa, the majority of kidney patients live in Medirigiriya and Dimbulagala MOH divisions. The number of patients in these two divisions is 1,922 and 1,292. The least number of kidney patients in the Anuradhapura district is found in Palagala (311) and Rajangane (296).
In the Anuradhapura district, kidney patients were reported for the first time in the first quarter of 1990. Although nearly three decades had passed, the main reason for CKD and CKDu is yet to be found. Contaminated water, water containing heavy metal molecules such as Cadmium and Arsenic, and overuse of chemical fertiliser, insecticides and weedicides are among the main reasons cited by medical agencies and healthcare research teams.
Meanwhile, at a recent meeting concerning the controversial Thambuttegama and Rajangane water project, NCP Water Supply and Drainage Board Regional Manager C. S. Lokubarana said kidney patients were not found in areas that the Water Board distributed treated water. He said this encouraging situation is more evident in Anuradhapura, its suburbs and areas where Mahaweli water is used for drinking purposes.
