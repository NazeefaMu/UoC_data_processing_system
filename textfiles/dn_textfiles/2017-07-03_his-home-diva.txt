His Home Diva!

Her bubbly smile is infectious. Her humanity touches hearts. Her talent for acting had brought her fame and fortune and made her the darling of the Sri Lankan silver screen. Many have dreamed of winning the hand of beautiful Indian-Sri Lankan actress Pooja Umashanker but it was Sri Lankan businessman Prashan David Vithakan who finally won her heart and hand in marriage. The couple said “I Do” at a low-key ceremony held on December 18, 2016.
First impression
I was actually still trying to read Pooja then. We met in my car when I picked her to up to go to the visually handicapped centre in December 2014. The first thought that ran through my mind was how big her sunglasses were! It looked like she was wearing a windscreen on her face! I was attracted to her humility and willingness to help those in need.
Most surprising thing about Pooja
After getting to know Pooja the most surprising thing I discovered about her was how compassionate she is towards people. Her willingness to give and actually do something about peoples’ needs is simply amazing. She embodies a positive attitude and this is generated to anything she takes up.
Favourite film she has acted in
Nope. I was not one of Pooja’s fans. I had watched only one of her films which was ‘Attaghasam’. It is a Tamil action masala film written and directed by Saran featuring Ajith Kumar in dual lead roles. Pooja played the female lead in it. I didn’t know she lived in Sri Lanka. I didn’t notice her much in that movie. It is only after I met her in person that I realised that it was her in that movie.
The proposal
We have been seeing each other for about six months by then. I knew I couldn’t live my life without Pooja by my side... So I took the plunge and decided to ask for her hand in marriage. I flew to India to meet her father to ask him permission first and he said “yes” without batting an eyelid. Then I asked her mother the same question and I got the same reaction and response. After that I proposed to my beautiful angel at 98 Acres in Ella.
Passions and talents
Pooja loves helping those in need. She has a fire burning in her heart to continue building houses for the less fortunate. She is amazing at organising things. Anything, anywhere – she will get it done. I can continue to go on and on about her talents but you would need more pages to jot down the list… Oh, and she makes the best omelettes!
Day off
If Pooja and I could have some time away from our busy schedules we would order our favourite pizza and spend the day watching movies at home.
Outings
We both love the food and service at The Fat Crab. Jaffna Crab curry with roast paan, pol sambol and dhal curry is our favourite meal. Their weekend brunch is also just amazing. I personally like the katta sambol sandwich as well.
Most memorable thing Pooja has said or done for Prashan
It is not what she said but it is how she said it and how it made me feel at that time that made it special. It was the moment when she looked at me and told me that she is in love with me...I know it sounds cliché but there is a personal connection between us which said much, much, much more than just “I love you”. She said that on September 22, 2015.
Most romantic gesture
I am the one who wears the romance hat in this marriage. Pooja isn’t a big fan of surprises as well.
Pooja sans the glitz and glamour
She’s my Home Diva! Basically what you see is exactly what you get with Pooja and I love that about her. She is the same personality you guys see in public when she is at home. There isn’t the slightest change.
One change
One thing I would like to change about Pooja? She asked me the same question in 2015. My answer was her address! I meant that we should live in one house together.
Alternative profession
If she did not become an actress Pooja would have made an excellent lawyer because she takes time to gather all the facts before putting her argument across to you. I would say 99 percent of the time she will win the case.
Fans
Pooja is thronged by fans wherever she goes. That is inevitable and it was a bit difficult to get used to at the beginning because it was invading our privacy. We found it difficult to travel to hotels in and around Sri Lanka without people constantly hounding her for selfies. There are times where I need to take a stand and say “no.” This is simply because some people fail to understand that we go to a holiday destination to get away from the hustle and bustle. Most of the time we go to supermarkets just before they close because we want to avoid people following us to take photos!
I guess it is something I need to deal with progressively and I am hoping that people would try to understand...
Most memorable moment together
One of the most memorable moments of our time together was when I took her to Ella to propose to her. I was so nervous and I knew she doesn’t like surprises. So I had to tread very carefully. Eventually, when I gathered my courage to go down on one knee to propose to her, she actually tried to pick me up, thinking that I had tripped and fallen on the floor! That was a moment of happiness, relief and sheer embarrassment…
Life with Pooja in a few words
Stress free – It is easy to live with someone who has characteristics that are similar to yours. She knows about my likes and dislikes and I know all about her favourite and least favourite things.
Fun - We fill our days with life and laughter. I dislike being serious all the time.
Prioritizing - She always puts my life before hers and I do the same. We live for each other.
God - Last but not least, we keep God as the centre of our marriage. We both love God beyond measure and that too keeps our flame burning bright.
Upcoming plans
I guess you are hinting about us having kids. Well, not at the moment. We are currently focusing on our marriage, travelling and spending time with each other every opportunity we get.
