INTERNATIONAL DAY OF NON-VIOLENCE
The International Day of Non-Violence is observed on October 2, in honour of the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. He was one of the most influential political activists of all time.
On June 15, 2007, the United Nations General Assembly voted to make the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth the International Day of Non-Violence. The day is mostly dedicated to spreading the message of non-violence to as many people as possible in all countries of the world.
The world has seen its share of bloody wars that ended countless lives and filled many more grief. No matter what country you go to, there are stories of how someone’s greed or lust for power resulted in the killing of innocent people and the destruction of beautiful cities.
Gandhi used nonviolent civil disobedience to eventually overthrow the British, who ruled India at the time. Despite being thrown in jail numerous times, but nothing ever caused him abandon his peaceful approach, which eventually resulted in India finally gaining the independence they had wanted for years.
Even wars that that were fought for a good cause, like Civil War of the United States of America, that resulted in slavery being abolished, have been responsible for a great many deaths.
Fortunately, however, there are people in this world who have gone about making changes they thought necessary without violence or pure brute force, and these are the people that the International Day of non-violence celebrates.
United Nations UN International Day of Non-Violence is a global observance that promotes non-violence through education and public awareness. It is annually held on October 2 to coincide with renowned Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday.
Many people, government organisations and non-government organisations around the world observe International Day of Non-Violence through various events and activities such as public lectures, seminars, discussions and press conferences about non-violence.
