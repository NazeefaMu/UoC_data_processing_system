Point of view
Equities reversed last week’s uptrend, with the benchmark ASPI hitting a 7-day low on Tuesday before recovering slightly to close the week ~ 22 points lower than last week.
The ASPI which hit 6127.49 on Tuesday was able to pare-down some of its losses on Wednesday and Thursday as it recovered by ~11 points largely due to positive earnings reported by financial institutions.
Average turnover levels meanwhile, hovered around LKR 0.47Bn during the holiday shortened week (26% decline W-o-W) as retail activity in particular, remained muted with investors remaining on the sidelines.
Large parcels in Dunamis Capital (32% of the total crossings), Commercial Bank (18% of the total crossings), Cargills (11% of the total crossings) helped extend the HNI and Institutional contribution to turnover, and total crossings for the week accounted for ~44% of total market turnover.
Foreign investors meanwhile, continued to remain net buyers for the 4th consecutive week, although net inflows declined by 78% W-o-W to LKR 0.11Bn.
The continuous net buying since the start of February has helped ease-off net outflows from equities in January; the YTD net foreign position was consequently an outflow of LKR 0.14Bn (cf. an outflow of LKR 1.66Bn recorded in Jan’17).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum.
Fitch outlook change positive for potential ISB
Fitch Rating’s Revision in its outlook for Sri Lanka (to Stable from Negative) is positive in light of the fact that the country hopes to tap international markets with a $1.5Bn sovereign bond later this year.
The revised outlook should help restrain some of the risk premia attached to the proposed sovereign debt.
Despite Fitch’s rating s downgrade (to B+ from BB-) and negative outlook on Sri Lanka last February, the country successfully raised a $1.5Bn Dual-tranche ISB in July 2016 within the price guidance of 6.125% and 7.125%, as global financial markets recovered from the high volatility (and EM capital outflows) immediately following BREXIT.
Continued net inflows to EM assets since the US presidential elections coupled with the revised ratings outlook for Sri Lanka could therefore, aid the country in raising the new ISB at potentially lower risk premiums.
However, some upside to the risk premium attached to the sovereign debt is possible in light of the fact that risk appetite for EM assets may wane (due to the US’s trade and monetary policies) along with Sri Lanka’s continued weak external liquidity position. If the GoSL can successfully raise the sovereign bond though, the fund inflows should help bolster the country’s declining FX reserves ($5.5Bn in Jan’17 vs. $6.0Bn in Dec’16) and ease some near-term pressure on the LKR and domestic interest rates.
