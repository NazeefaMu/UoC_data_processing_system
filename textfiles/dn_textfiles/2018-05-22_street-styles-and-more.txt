Street  styles and More

It’s that time of the year again! A time when editors, buyers, influencers and models flock to Sydney for Australia’s fashion week. And this year for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia, the best dressed guests were those outside. Donning their best for the shows, the street style set proved logomania, colour blocking and great tailoring aren’t going anywhere, taking to the pavement to showcase the cool-weather trends we’re going to be seeing everywhere this season. And whether you’re after suit/sneaker inspiration, a reason to pair socks with sandals this winter or some guidelines for looking chic in the rain, consider the below your handbook for transeasonal dressing-because one thing we know for sure is that the street is where the real show happens.
