Contempt of court proceedings :
Ven. Gnanasara’s case postponed to Oct. 4

The inquiry into the writ petition filed by Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera appealing the order issued against him by the Homagama Magistrate was postponed to October 4 by Homagama High Court Judge Amal Tilakaratne when it was taken up yesterday, since Ven. Gnanasara Thera was not present in court, as he is receiving treatment at Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital. Attorney Manjula Mahakumbura appeared for Ven. Gnanasara Thera.
The High Court Judge had also issued summons on the first and second respondents in the case to appear in court on October 4.
The Homagama Magistrate has issued a contempt of court order against Ven. Gnanasara Thera for abusing Sandya Ekneligoda and obstructing court when the disappearance case of her husband, journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda, was taken up for hearing.
