The open economy

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has thanked all SLFP led governments, which ruled the country after 1977, for continuing with the open economy introduced by late President J.R. Jayewardene. Speaking at the opening of the exhibition organised to mark 40 years since the introduction of the open economy, at the Youth Centre in Maharagama on Thursday Premier Wickremesinghe said the open economy was introduced by the late President J.R. Jayewardene but his successors also continued with it. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga continued with it while some of those in the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime did the same. “I would like to thank all of them for it,” he said.
True, at the very inception of the open economy the SLFP was among the most virulent critics of the system along, of course, with the Marxists, and not entirely for invalid reasons. Most saw the system as exploitative, and that which widened the gulf between the haves and the have-nots. The market economy also made inroads into social and cultural values hitherto taken for granted, with the creation of a new class of nouveau riche. It is still being claimed that the influx of hard drugs into Sri Lanka had its origins in the open economy when the country was thrown open to the outside world and to all comers. The unbridled consumerism that was spawned by the market economy also exacerbated the poor - rich divide and created a breed of ‘fat cats’ who raked in the shekels from the ample opportunities that came their way, with some becoming billionaires almost overnight.
However, on the plus side, the country took off in the sphere of economic development as was never witnessed before in the post Independence era, with the free trade and burgeoning economic activity providing a climate for employment generation. Free Trade Zones sprang up with the establishment of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission, providing a bonanza for the job starved youth and garment factories virtually mushroomed, bringing village girls to the cities for gainful employment. The country which was hitherto in virtual slumber, suddenly began to stir with commercial activity. Giant infrastructure projects were coming up at a rapid rate with foreign investments flooding into the country while multi-purpose projects like the giant Mahaweli was telescoped from the original 30 years to six years to cater to the irrigation, agricultural needs of the rural community and to meet the rapid demand for power generation in the wake of heightening economic activity.
No doubt, the open economy was firmly entrenched by the time Chandrika was waiting in the wings to take over the reins after seventeen years of UNP rule and it became a fait accompli. Perhaps, to make a virtue out of necessity, CBK made the pledge to continue with the open economy, which was so anathema to the SLFP not many moons ago, but giving it a ‘human face’. The rest, as they say, is history, except that the onetime avowed socialist went about the job with a vengeance, outdoing the UNP in the privatization exercise, even recalling the Shell Company which her mother booted out of the country during her first tenure as Prime Minister in the early sixties. Mahinda Rajapaksa, for all the rhetoric he bellowed against the open economy and despite the janagoshas and pada yatras held to highlight the evils of the system, picked up the reins from CBK and continued with even greater zeal.
It is in this light that it is difficult to comprehend the stand taken by certain elements of the SLFP in the unity government when they say that they could not work with the UNP, whose policies are diametrically opposed to the SLFP. True, the SLFP was said to have evolved to cater to the needs of the marginalized sections of society and it owed its electoral successes largely to this constituency. Hence, some of the SLFP stalwarts may feel vulnerable to appear to take a divergent path in alignment with the UNP and are obviously making sounds in order to send a message to this segment of their vote base.
But, as the Prime Minister said, the other day, the allies of the national unity government should concentrate on the country’s development instead of turning against one another. Speaking at a religious ceremony held at Kande Vihare in Aluthgama the Premier said there was no point in confrontational politics at the moment as what is needed at present is for everyone to focus on development.
The PM was obviously referring to the sniping that has been a regular feature between the UNP and SLFP members in the unity government which is being pounced on by the Joint Opposition to portray a crisis in governance. For the first time since Independence both major parties have joined together to work towards achieving a common goal and it is only right that petty differences be put aside and all players pull together in one direction for the good of the country.
