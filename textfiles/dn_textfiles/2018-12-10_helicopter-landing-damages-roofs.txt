Helicopter landing damages roofs

A number of houses in Tangalle were damaged recently when a helicopter transporting a group of tourists was landing in the Mahinda Rajapaksa playground.
The roof of the stadium was damaged as well.
Residents said the helicopter had landed in the playground despite there was a helicopter pad at Kotugodella, Tangalle.
