Technology can help build superpowers - Zuckerberg

INDIA: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and caped crusader Batman have one thing in common -- both believe technology is a superpower.
Speaking to students at IIT here at the Townhall, the young billionaire was asked what is the one super power he would want to help people.
Dressed in his signature grey T-shirt and jeans, Zuckerberg replied, “One of the great things about technology is that you can build superpowers for people in the world and that some of the stuff that is really exciting.”
Citing the example of virtual technology Oculus, he said this could allow people to “teleport”.
“You will be able to put on a headset and go anywhere in the world, play ping pong with somebody in some other part of the world. That is pretty crazy... that is going to be pretty good,” he said.
While there were times when the audience grilled him about issues like net neutrality and how the world’s largest social networking platform intends to connect billions, they also wanted to know if the unwanted invitations from Candy Crush would stop.
“We’re working on a solution to address that,” replied Zuckerberg to the question that has been the most voted by users.
Troubled by unwanted invitations to play Candy Crush on Facebook, users have complained and even started online petitions to block the invites.
He also talked about being passionate about what one wants to do with their start ups and asked the youngsters to focus on solving issues they saw rather than just “starting a business”.
Zuckerberg also talked about his wife and how he was looking forward to their daughter’s arrival.
