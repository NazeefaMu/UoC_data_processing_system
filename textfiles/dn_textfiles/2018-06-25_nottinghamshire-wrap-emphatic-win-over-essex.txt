Nottinghamshire wrap up emphatic win over Essex

LONDON, Saturday: Defending champions Essex suffered their second loss of 2018 as Nottinghamshire completed a 301-run win on the final morning at Chelmsford. After resuming on 88-4, the home side survived for just 23.5 overs before being bowled out for 139.
Ravi Bopara only added six to his overnight 33 not out before being caught behind off Matt Milnes (4-44).
Last-wicket pair Neil Wagner and Matt Quinn faced 50 dot balls before Wagner finally edged Samit Patel to slip.
The victory was Nottinghamshire’s fourth of the season and the 23 points earned lifted them to second in the Division One table, 13 points behind leaders Surrey. Having been set 441 to win, Essex’s slim chances of victory disappeared on the third evening as they lost four wickets before the close, including Alastair Cook for a duck.
Worcestershire registered their first Championship win of the summer as they beat Lancashire by 202 runs on the final day at New Road.
Lancashire’s last four wickets went down after lunch for one run, three to Ed Barnard (4-95), as they were bowled out for 399.
Keaton Jennings was Lancashire’s main hope of batting out time for a draw, but he was bowled by Patrick Brown. England opener Jennings made 177 from 295 balls, including 27 fours. But he could do nothing about a delivery from Brown which seemed to keep a little low and hit his off stump.
His downfall left Lancashire 359-6 at lunch, having resumed day four on 269-4 after being set a target of 602, but their fourth defeat of the season was not long in coming after the restart.
Warwickshire made a gallant attempt to set a new Championship run-chase record before losing to Kent by 73 runs.
Chasing 519 to win at Tunbridge Wells, Ian Bell and Dom Sibley extended their second-wicket partnership to 260. Sibley was caught at slip before lunch for 104 and Ivan Thomas claimed the crucial scalp of Bell after the break, trapping him lbw for 172.
Adam Hose continued the chase with 65, but Joe Denly took three wickets in six balls as they were all out for 445.
Warwickshire remain top of Division Two despite losing their unbeaten record, while Kent’s fourth win lifted them back into second place, just eight points behind.
Middlesex held their nerve to beat Leicestershire by one wicket following a tense final-day run chase.
The visitors’ chances of reaching their target of 381 appeared in the balance when Stevie Eskinazi was run out on 97 as they went from 82-3 to 197-6. Hilton Cartwright kept their hopes alive but Ben Raine removed him lbw for 80, leaving Middlesex requiring another 38 runs with two wickets remaining. James Harris (58 not out) hit a four to deny the Foxes a third successive win.
Yorkshire batted through the final day at the Ageas Bowl without undue difficulty to secure a draw in their Championship game against Hampshire.
The home side had half a chance after dismissing Gary Ballance (21) and Cheteshwar Pujara (32) early. But teenager Harry Brook put on 108 with Jack Leaning before he was unluckily run out by a deflection into the stumps at the bowler’s end for 68. Leaning made 54 not out before the game ended when Yorkshire declared on 263-6.
Derbyshire clung on for an unlikely draw with a score of147-8 as tail-ender Tony Palladino led the late resistance against Glamorgan at St Helens.
Palladino (30 not out) and Duanne Olivier blocked out the last 13 overs after Michael Hogan claimed 4-43. Earlier Usman Khawaja (126) and Kiran Carlson (152) allowed Glamorgan to declare at 403-7. Derbyshire were set 325 in 63 overs but they toiled apart from Wayne Madsen’s 55 before their late resistance.
