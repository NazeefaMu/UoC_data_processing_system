Bald Soprano looms over  again

 
We remember Thatta Gayikawa an adaptation of Eugène Ionesco’s La Cantatrice Chauve, The Bald Soprano, performed by veteran actress Deepani Silva on stage some time back. Deepani by grasping the core of the absurd drama style with perfection brought to fore a superb presentation of the character.
The new production of Thatta Gayikawa will be staged on July 29 at 3 pm and 6.45 pm at the Namel-Malini Punchi Theatre, Borella. The venue matches perfectly with the presentation style of the drama. A viewer can sit comfortably and feel at home at the Punchi Theatre to enjoy the drama.

Thatta Gayikawa this time around is directed by Kanchuka Dharmasiri and presented by the Department of Fine Arts and the Theatre of the Melting Clock. Kanchuka currently is a lecturer in English at the Peradeniya University. She is a past student of UMass Amherst in Massachusetts and an associate of New World Theatre.
La Cantatrice Chauve, the Bald Soprano Ionesco wrote in French in 1949 is regarded as one of the classical texts of the Theatre of the Absurd. Ionesco called his play an Anti-play. The Bald Soprano is both tragic and farcical. Not only does the play disrupt the linear narrative, it also questions the relationships between cause and effect. As a result, the characters do not always respond to the question being asked and often times, situations cannot be explained logically occur.
Ionesco came up with the idea of writing the play when he was learning English as an adult. He states that suddenly he realized the absurd nature of language because he was learning phrases such as “the ceiling is on the top” and “the floor is in the bottom.” Ionesco asserts he wanted to write the tragedy of language. In the end of the play, language loses all meaning and the characters hurl at each other.

The theatre of the Absurd, a theatre genre that developed after the two world wars explores a variety of issues including language and communication, human existence and the universe, isolation, the absurdity of bourgeois ethics and materialistic values. Cast of Thatta Gayikawa include Sameera Hewage, Sandamini Ranwalage, Chathurika Sachinthanie, Vidumina Ihalagedara, Madhushani Chandrasekera and Dhanushka Gunathilake.
Thatta Gayikawa is translated by Kanchuka Dharmasiri and Lohan Gunaweera. Music is composed by Manoj Alawathukotuwa, make-up is by Ranjith K Rajapaksha and sound design and stage-management are by Lahiru Prabodha.
