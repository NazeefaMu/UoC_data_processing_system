Sustainable Resettlement in Sri Lanka:
UK Government extends partnership with UNDP

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka, recently entered into a partnership agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom, to extend support for sustainable resettlement at lands recently released in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
The GBP 1,000,000 (US$ 1.3 Million) project would support more than 2,500 people returning to their homes in the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa Districts. Under the agreement, UNDP Sri Lanka would work in close collaboration with the government, to facilitate sustainable return, resettlement and integration of conflict-displaced persons, while strengthening institutions for equal and transparent access to services.
The overall intended impact is to improve the well-being of conflict-affected communities in line with the Sri Lanka Peace-building Priority Plan, agreed by the Government of Sri Lanka and the UN, to support long-term peace-building and reconciliation, as well as the National Policy on Durable Solutions for Conflict-affected Displacement.
The project would help those returning to their homes in the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa by supporting livelihood opportunities in fisheries, agriculture and livestock, and facilitating access to local government services.
It would also help families to rebuild their lives by promoting entrepreneurship through training in small business management, and by assisting in re-establishing community support structures and local civil society organisations.
British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka James Dauris said, “The UK is pleased to support the return of families to their villages. This is a crucial element of addressing the legacy of the conflict, and contributes to the steady progress being made. There remains a lot to do and, as a partner with a firm commitment to working with Sri Lanka, the UK is supporting the rebuilding process as well as encouraging the government to deliver its commitments to the people of this country and to the international community.”
The Sustainable Resettlement project would prioritise empowering women and youth, promoting diversity and inclusion, and reaching vulnerable and marginalised communities.
UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director Jorn Sorensen said, “The UNDP is pleased to join hands with the UK Government, to support families to resettle and reintegrate back into their communities. Through this project and beyond, we remain fully committed to help build a more inclusive, peaceful, and resilient Sri Lanka, to advance sustainable human development.”
