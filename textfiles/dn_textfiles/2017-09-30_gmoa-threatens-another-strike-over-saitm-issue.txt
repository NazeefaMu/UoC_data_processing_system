GMOA threatens another strike over SAITM issue

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will launch an islandwide strike without prior notice if the
Government tries to implement a fake `solution' for the SAITM issue, aiming at legalising the fraudulent private degree shop, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA's Central Committee has granted permission to launch an instant strike without prior notice if the problem persists.
According to Dr.Aluthge,the GMOA will extend its fullest support to any of the actions to be taken by the MBBS degree holders waiting for their intern appointments. The appointments have been delayed due to the failure to solving the SAITM issue in a people friendly manner.
"The GMOA will demand a meeting with the Health Ministry Secretary to discuss the issue of doctors' transfers getting delayed. The GMOA will strike if the Health Ministry publicizes the list of intern appointments without the approval of the Transfer Board," he added.
