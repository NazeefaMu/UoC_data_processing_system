Lanka shows fight but Australia wins T20I series

Sri Lanka put up a poor batting display but compensated to some extent when they gave a glimpse of turning the match around by grabbing four cheap wickets for six runs in 13 balls, however Australia had enough batting firepower in their line up to knock the required runs off with 13 balls to spare and win the second Twenty20 International by four wickets at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Dilshan salutes the crowd by going down on his knees after being dismissed for one in his final international innings.  
The win gave Australia the two-match series by 2-0, having won the first T20I at Pallekele by 85 runs and saw them head home after a lengthy two-month tour of Sri Lanka on a triumphant note having also pocketed the five-match one-day series 4-1. Their only setback was losing the Test series 0-3.
For Sri Lanka to make a fight of the match their total of 128 for nine after winning the toss and batting first was hardly enough to contain Australia.
Another crackerjack innings from Glenn Maxwell – 66 off 29 balls with four sixes and seven fours saw Australia make Sri Lanka’s total look even smaller.
Maxwell and skipper David Warner (25) set Australia towards reaching Sri Lanka’s total in a canter posting 93 off 51 balls before the former’s dismissal triggered a mini collapse with four wickets tumbling for six runs off 13 balls. From 93 for no loss Australia was suddenly reduced to 99-4 in the 11th over but they had plenty of overs in hand to score the required 30
runs for victory which they achieved quite comfortably despite losing a further two wickets.
Former captain Tillakaratne Dilshan closed the final chapter of his career five weeks before his 40th birthday by dismissing Usman Khawaja (6) and Mathew Wade (14) off successive overs to have the crowd chanting ‘Dilshan, Dilshan’ but his cameo role came a wee bit too late to turn the game in Sri Lanka’s favour.
Man of the Match and Man of the Series Glenn Maxwell on the attack during his knock of 66 off 29 balls.  
However the two wickets he took compensated somewhat for his batting failure when he was dismissed for one by John Hastings.
Sri Lanka were only briefly in the game when Kusal Perera and Dhananjaya de Silva were batting together in partnership. They raised 35 off 26 balls for the second wicket, but otherwise the rest of the batting was a mixture of poor shots against accurate bowling.
The Aussies gave nothing away on the field and the energy they displayed was too much for the Lankans to handle.
Leading them from the front was skipper David Warner with three brilliant catches taken from three different positions. The bowling changes that Warner made were also spot-on with John Hastings and James Faulkner each taking a wicket in their opening overs.
Faulkner once again proved what a great one-day bowler he is by picking up three wickets and leg-spinner Adam Zampa whose bowling action resembles that of the great Shane Warne broke the middle order with three wickets for 16 runs. Dhananjaya de Silva played a lone hand for Sri Lanka scoring his maiden half-century in T20 internationals making a useful 62 of 50 balls but lacked support from the other end.
Apart from De Silva’s half-century the only other batsman to get into double figures was Kusal Perera with 22.
Maxwell picked up his second successive Man of the Match award and also the Man of the Series award.
Dilshan was honoured by Sri Lanka Cricket with its president Thilanga Sumathipala presenting him with a silver plaque.
