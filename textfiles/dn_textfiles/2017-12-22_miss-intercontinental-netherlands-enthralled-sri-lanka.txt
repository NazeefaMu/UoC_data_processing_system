Miss Intercontinental of Netherlands enthralled by Sri Lanka

Miss Intercontinental of Netherlands 2017, Ms. Cathelijne Heppenhuis who was on a special two-week visit to Sri Lanka organized by Aitken Spence Travels, expressed her enchantment with the island, saying “I loved the hospitality of the Sri Lankan people where they would always smile and say hi….This has made me feel as if this is one big family. This is also an opportunity for people from Netherlands to learn from Sri Lankans where the Sri Lankans are very rich in their hearts”.
Heppenhuis said that her most memorable experiences were seeing a leopard at Yala, making coconut rotis and coconut sambols, coming into contact with “the real Sri Lankan lifestyle”. “I enjoyed seeing the wild life in its natural habitat and not in a zoo. Seeing monkeys in person was definitely a lovely experience of Sri Lanka”, she said.
Heppenhuis visited Sri Lanka’s hill country and the Southern coast. She was hosted for a for lunch by Aitken Spence Travels in Colombo.
