Gota’s appeal against Magistrate’s Court Inquiry
AG objects to CA interim order

The Attorney General (AG) yesterday informed the Court of Appeal that the AG is objecting to extend the Interim Order preventing the Police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act, regarding a Magistrate’s Court inquiry since it had been issued on the basis of an exparte proceeding.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appearing on behalf of the AG made this submissions when a writ petition filed by the former Defence Secretary was taken up for support.
Meanwhile, Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne yesterday further extended until tomorrow (28) its Interim Order preventing the Police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
Both parties are to make their further oral submissions today as well.
The Court had upheld Rajapaksa’s version that the certificate issued under Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of his legitimate expectations.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.
President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva under the instructions of Counsel Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne with Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake and Senior State Counsel Udara Karunatilleka and SSC Nirmalan Vigneshwaran appeared for the Attorney General.
