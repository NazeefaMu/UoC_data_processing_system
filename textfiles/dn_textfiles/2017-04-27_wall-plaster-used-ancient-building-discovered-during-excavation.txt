Wall plaster used in ancient building discovered during excavation

A small piece of wall plaster used for coating a wall of an ancient building or a monument, was found close to the eastern wahalkada of historic Ruwanweliseya chetiya in Anuradhapura.
This discovery has been made during excavations one meter beneath the ground surface in the site.
Ruwanwel Chetiya Chief Incumbent Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera told the Daily News that a piece of six inch wall plaster was found during Mahavihara excavations.
The Thera said this is the first time that such a piece of wall plaster discovered at an excavation from the sacred city’s Mahavihara premises. The Thera said the piece of wall plaster will be referred to further laboratory tests to judge the time of the origin. Some archaeologists insisted that this could be a part of a building existed before the construction of the Ruwanweli dagoba.
