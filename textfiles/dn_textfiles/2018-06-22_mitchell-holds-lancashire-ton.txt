Mitchell holds up Lancashire with ton

LONDON, Wednesday - Worcestershire opener Daryl Mitchell batted all the way though his side's innings to post his second century inside a month against Lancashire in the English County Championships.
Mitchell's 118 helped Worcs rally from 81-5, but they were all out for 247 with Joe Mennie and Jordan Clark both claiming four wickets. After an opening stand of 77 in reply, Lancashire then slumped to 86-5, as Ed Barnard took four late wickets.
A staggering 20 wickets fell in the day on what is usually a batsman's paradise at Tunbridge Wells as Kent earned a first-innings lead in the meeting of Division Two's second against first.
Keith Barker returned his best bowling figures in four years - 5-32 - as Kent were bowled out for 197. Only Kent captain Joe Denly offered any lasting resistance with 59 before Warwickshire collapsed to 125 all out.
Jonathan Trott was unbeaten on 51, then Kent, batting again, closed on 4-0.
Colin Ackermann's unbeaten 151 helped Leicestershire take control on day one but Middlesex's Tim Murtagh's five wickets limited the hosts’ total.
Neil Dexter added 66, as he and Ackermann put on 129 for the third wicket, before Dexter was caught behind off the bowling of the in-form Murtagh. At the close, the hosts were 353-8 with Ackermann and Gavin Griffiths (18*) securing a fourth batting bonus point.
Northamptonshire recorded their highest County Championship total of the season but were unable to take full advantage on day one against Gloucestershire. The hosts went from 99-0 to 220-6 as Luke Procter, Ben Duckett and Richard Levi all failed to convert good starts. Matt Taylor (4-70) and Ryan Higgins (3-52) shone for Gloucestershire, who restricted them to 282 all out. With 13 overs to face Joe Dent fell lbw for 11 to the final ball of the day as the visitors closed on 25-1. Phil Salt and Tom Haines hit maiden Championship hundreds as Sussex piled on the runs to reach 439-5 on day one against Durham at Arundel.
Salt hit a six and 18 fours in his 130, while 19-year-old Haines collected 19 boundaries in his 124. Their stand of 244 was a second-wicket record for Sussex against Durham, beating the 196 compiled by Bill Athey and Alan Wells 22 years ago. Glamorgan struggled to 175-7 on a rain-shortened first day against Derbyshire after choosing to bat in Swansea.
Seamer Tony Palladino (4-49) wrecked the top order as he swung the ball prodigiously in cloudy conditions.
But Chris Cooke (69) led the counter-attack, sharing half-century stands with both David Lloyd (21) and Andrew Salter (26 not out). Palladino returned to bowl Cooke shortly before the close of play to reassert the visitors’ grip.
