SP Motor Traffic Dept. gets new office premises

The new office premises of Southern Province Motor Traffic Department were inaugurated on November 12 under the auspice of Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva. A permanent location was a long felt need of the department.
The institution had to be shifted from place to place on several occasions thereby causing immense hardships for the public and the officials of the department for the establishment of the Motor Traffic Department had no permanent building for its operations since its establishment.
The new office of the department is located at the Southern Provincial Council building complex located on Lower Dickson Road at which Southern Province Health Services Department is also situated.
