‘Stabilising country is President’s duty’
Chamikara Weerasinghe
Foreign affairs analyst and critic Mohan Samaranayaka said the President had seen smooth sailing of Parliament yesterday because of his deliberations at the all-party conference held at the Presidential Secretariat with composure and patience at a time when the actions of the Speaker was under criticism.
Samaranayaka said, “The President had called the leaders of United National Party, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and other political parties and discussed the importance of maintaining the standards of behavior in Parliament, as well as the need to keep its traditions, the prevalence of Standing Orders and Parliamentary maxims.”
He said the Speaker was absent at the meeting and added, “It is not surprising that he is under pressure by more than one political party, in addition to hegemonic powers that have been breathing down his neck ever since he saw the Presidential Gazette appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister.
“The President may be hoping that this could give some respite to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to realise his duties. For the past few weeks he has been communicating to the world that he was taking action to stabilise the country, which is not his duty as the Speaker of Parliament but the duty of the President and the government,” he said.
“His duty is to ensure that the House is in order. The masses in the country are waiting to see that the Speaker will get his act together in future,” he said.
“However,” Samaranayaka said,” the UNP is unlikely to give up on their regime-change project, which they started with hegemonic powers no sooner than the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa defeated the LTTE in 2009, which involves the Tamil National Alliace’s agenda to have a federal structure in the North and East by dint of a Constitutional change.”

‘Speaker created unnecessary crisis’

State Transport Minister C.B. Rathnayake said that parliamentary proceedings ended yesterday peacefully without clashes, as per the agreement at the all-party conference held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena last Sunday.
A fight broke out among rival MPs in Parliament during the past few days due to the partial actions taken by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, which is undemocratic. The Speaker acted in a manner which violates the Constitution, Standing Orders, as well as Parliamentary traditions, when taking up the no-confidence motion against Mahinda Rajapaksa and the government.
The nation always rejected the Speaker’s unruly conduct, which later developed into a crisis. The Executive is above not only the Legislature and Judiciary, but also the Constitution itself. However, the Speaker always acted while neglecting this.
“A crisis situation did not arise from the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. It was Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who crated an unnecessary crisis in the country,” he said.
“A clash was created between the Executive and the Legislature by exceeding the powers vested with the Speaker by the Constitution. But today, as per the agreement reached at the all-party conference, it has been proposed to appoint a select committee to consider the matter. That is democracy,” he added.

‘MPs should show more restraint’
Former Israeli and UAE Ambassador and one-time Consumer Affairs Authority Chairman Dr. Sarath Wijesinghe yesterday said that Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri managed to bring back the proceedings of the Parliament to the right track.“I am pleased about the outcome of the proceedings of Parliament today by the Deputy Speaker’s efforts to bring back the proceedings to the correct track from the unpleasant happenings that took place during the past few days that tarnished the image of the country,” Wijesinghe said.
He urged legislators and the Speaker to strictly follow the due process and the Standing Orders of the Parliament used only in exceptional cirucumstances.
“It is unfortunate that a confused state arose due to the immaturity of institutions. The Judiciary too, should have been careful and foreseen the situation as we now go trough a crisis, and the Members of Parliament should show more restraint and be peaceful; we urge to await for the final decision of the court case,” he said.
In the maze of the legal field, the interest and intention of citizens in holding democratic rights and values are to be respected by offering the freedom to elect representatives on periodic intervals, he said, adding that citizens should not be restrained from choosing the representatives; it was the general conscientious that it was time for Provincial and General elections.
It was time for professionals and the public to come forward to protect citizens’ rights, as well as to create a better future for all, he added.
