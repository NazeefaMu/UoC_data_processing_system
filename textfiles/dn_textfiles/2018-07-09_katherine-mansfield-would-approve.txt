Katherine Mansfield Would Approve

On Katherine Mansfield’s birthday, I walked up the edge of a long driveway in gale-force winds. I walked for a long time, with cars passing me. “The wind—the wind.” I was walking to Government House, which is at the top of a hill, where there would be a party. Katherine Mansfield was 125 years old today.
The driveway to Government House has bushes and trees on either side, and these were beaten and pushed about by the wind. I thought about turning around and just going home, but that would mean walking past the guard at the entrance again. Every time someone drove past me, I felt more self-conscious. Finally, a hybrid car stopped, and a woman wound down the window. “Are you going to the Katherine Mansfield party?” I was. “That’s a long way, dear. Do you want to hop in?”
As we zoomed up the hill between the trees, we should’ve talked about the end of Mansfield’s story “The Garden Party,” in which a big dog runs by like a shadow and Laura walks down that smoky dark lane, because that driveway recalled it to us. But instead, we talked about whether we’d been to Government House before. The woman had been many times. I hadn’t been.
Pristine gravel
Government House, the governor-general’s official residence, is an enormous brown-and-cream building with dark jarrah weatherboards and a flag tower. A rectangular pond is feathered by the wind. Cars were still creeping over the pristine gravel or were parked nearby, and the new director of the Katherine Mansfield Birthplace, a woman named Emma, was standing by the door with one of the board members and greeting people. I’d met Emma at the Birthplace that morning, my final morning as the acting director.
I’d shown her through the house: the tiny office stacked high with filing boxes, where the new director would sit each day; the scullery with its steel pots hung on the walls and its meat grinder, on which she, too, would bruise her leg as she went by; the dim roped-off bedroom where Mansfield was born, where a hairbrush and hand mirror were fixed with catgut to a dressing table, and where a dehumidifier now hummed and slurped.
At the end of every day, the birth-room dehumidifier was heavy with water. Now Emma would be the one to carry the bucket down the stairs and empty it in the little sink in the scullery. I’d handed her my lump of keys, which opened countless cupboards and cabinets and internal doors, then wheeled my bike out from where I’d parked it behind a sack of blood-and-bone in the rose garden and cycled down Tinakori Road, grinning as the wind pushed me on.
Permanent director
I got the job at the Birthplace on a whim. The previous director had left suddenly, and the board needed someone to look after the volunteers, to schedule tours, and to organize that year’s birthday party while a new permanent director was found. I’d visited the house—a square weatherboard building with a red corrugated-iron roof, built in 1887—on a school trip when I was maybe nine or ten, and I knew that Mansfield, a famous writer whose story about a garden party had frightened me, had lived there until she was five years old. But I couldn’t remember much beyond heavy Victorian furniture and dark drapes and walls lined with photographs of Katherine and her family.
On my first morning, I sat nervously in the cold kitchen. It was my first full-time job in a long time. The chairman of the Katherine Mansfield Birthplace Society and the four paid staff were there, all in winter coats. “Ashleigh will be here five days a week,” the chairman told us all firmly, “and she’ll be in charge. She is our director for the foreseeable future.” The kitchen had stained timber walls and a hefty coal range. Pretty floral plates were held in place with wire on a sideboard.
A bowl of Granny Smith apples was set on a velvet tablecloth below a single window that overlooked the back garden. I later learned that the garden had once sloped into a gully. Mansfield had complained about wretched people throwing their empty cans into it. And also in the kitchen was the replica of Mansfield’s dollhouse, painted spinach-green with yellow windowpanes and a red roof. Its frontage was locked, but two figures collapsed in armchairs were visible through a window. “Open it quickly, someone!” I knew that inside, the rooms would be papered and that in the middle of the dining-room table would be a tiny amber lamp.
Greg introduced me to Caryl, who managed the accounts, a pretty silver-haired woman with red lipstick; to Linda, whose current job was to sort all the files in the upstairs office (once a nursery) and who had a bad back and seemed to communicate mainly in rapid eye blinks and hand gestures; and to Sue, who worked only on Sundays but had made a special trip to meet me today.
Footpath
“It’s wonderful to have you here,” she said with glistening eyes, “in the grotto.” I’d passed her a few minutes before, as I pushed my bike on the footpath toward the house, and she had beamed at me. “I knew it must’ve been you,” she said now. “You had Katherine’s look about you.” Sue was in her sixties, with bright-gold hair and a constant smile.
