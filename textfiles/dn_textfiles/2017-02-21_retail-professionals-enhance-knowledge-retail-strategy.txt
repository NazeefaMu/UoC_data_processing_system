Retail professionals enhance knowledge on retail strategy

Organized by 3W Consulting, Sri Lanka’s Leading Enterprise Renewal and Management Consultants, together with the Global Retail Academy (GRA), the 2-day program took place at the Crystal Ballroom of Taj Samudra in Colombo.
The aim of the Retail Mastery Programme was to drive thought leadership and top retail talent in Sri Lanka, offering internationally recognized training and qualifications for Sri Lanka’s retail professionals. The programme was the first event of the Retail Black Belt Series an international qualification for retail professional.
The programme was conducted by two of the world’s most influential retail gurus and supply chain experts, Prakash Menon and Andrew Cavanagh, featuring sessions on three primary topics consisting of Retail Strategy, Retail Metrics and Merchandise Planning.
The programme was recognized and attended by top retailersin Sri Lanka including companies.
Speaking about the programme Prakash Menon said, “This programme offers participants the tools and techniques to enhance their retail workspace and is structured in such a way that they can take the learnings back to their teams and impart the knowledge they’ve gained within their organisations. The course work doesn’t end in 2 days; participants need to go back to work and put into practice what they have learnt, over the next couple of months, and report back on the results, the impact, the challenges, through an assignment. We are not trainers, we’re practitioners.”
Andrew Cavanagh also commented on GRA’s partnership with 3W Consulting; “We want to reach out to as many retailers across the globe, and to achieve this we have to make sure we get the right partners to help us. When it comes toour partner in Sri Lanka - 3W Consulting, we’ve seen the same vision and passion that we have at GRA and it has been an honor to partner with them in this venture. 3WC has been critical in connecting Sri Lanka’s top retail space to our Black Belt in Retail Programme”.
