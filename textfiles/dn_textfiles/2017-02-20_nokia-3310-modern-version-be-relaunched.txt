Nokia 3310 modern  version to be relaunched

With news of Nokia 3310 relaunch, Nokia fans are looking forward for a modern version of the ‘indestructible’ mobile phone that has reserved a place for itself among everyone’s list of the most iconic tech gadgets..
There are many great reasons for the love the iconic Nokia 3310 gets even today. From the long battery life to ‘unbreakable’ body, the handset is considered the most reliable phone you can get. And such was its fame that in 2014, 14 years after the original Nokia 3310 launch, the folks at Nokia pranked fans by announcing a modern retelling of the phone with Windows Phone 8 operating system, 41-megapixel camera etc.
But we don’t really need too many features to continue our tryst with the Nokia 3310. Let’s take a trip down memory lane and look at some of the reasons that make the Nokia 3310 the phone every user wants.
The smartphone era may have seen its fair share of innovations in terms of camera, UI, processing power, and features but unfortunately, battery life has taken the biggest hit as mobile communication evolved. The original Nokia 3310 offered a healthy 260 hours of standby time and a decent 4 hours and 30 minutes of talk time for a 1000mAh battery. With the new Nokia 3310, we can expect the era of improved battery life to return.
The Nokia 3310 is no doubt one of the most iconic Nokia phones ever built. Much like other Nokia feature phones that are known for their durability, reliability, and simplicity, the Nokia 3310 was also considered to be among the sturdiest handsets ever built. The Nokia 3310 could easily survive drops or even accidental water spills. The biggest relief was the handset never required a screen protector unlike modern day phones. With touchscreens dominating smartphones, there has been the fear of phones with cracked screens for users.(Gadgets)
