Ravi, Mahendran appear before Bond Commission: Scenes from this morning

 
Former Finance Minister and current Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake appeared before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) to investigate the Treasury bond issue this morning.

Aloysius, the former CEO of Perpetual Treasuries, is under investigation for unprecedented gains made by the Perpetual Treasuries while his father-in-law Arjuna Mahendran was at the helm of the Central Bank.
Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran who is being investigated by the PCoI for his hand in the matter also arrived before the Commission this morning.
