VIASL refutes cover allegations levied by franchise importers

The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) rejected the accusations made by certain brand new vehicle importers in Sri Lanka that VIASL is importing vehicles from Japan and England under the cover of used vehicles in order to pay reduced taxes.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo VIASL, President Ranjan Peiris said brand new vehicle importers are in the habit of issuing statements saying that their association members (parallel importers) used to register brand new vehicles in that countries and again cancelling the registration in the same countries and thereafter importing them to Sri Lanka.
Peiris said the accusation was totally false as even the Gazette notification 2044/32 dated November 9, 2017 mentions that the tax on a vehicles are based on the engine capacity.
He also noted that the engine capacity tax imposed by the Finance Ministry was to prevent errors in calculating tax based on the valuation and to overcome any revenue leakage.
Peiris also highlighted a grave disadvantage faced by parallel importers and said as a result of the depreciation table being abolished; traders who import vehicles that are up to three years old are also required to pay the tax that is imposed on a brand new vehicle. He said an effective action is required to support parallel importers.
“Parallel importers face a volatile business environment with regular taxation changes and depreciating exchange rates resulting in customer difficulties and delays,”
The association also assured the public that they now import vehicles which are compatible with Euro Four Emission standards in keeping with the government’s decision to switch the import of vehicles to Euro 4. “We also thank the government for taking steps to introduce the Euro Four Emission standards which would help the country to maintain high standard vehicles and also help protect the environment.”
