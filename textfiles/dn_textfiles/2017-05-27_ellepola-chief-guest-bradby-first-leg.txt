Ellepola chief guest at Bradby first leg

Tikiri Ellepola, a top class third row forward to come out of Trinity College was the chief guest at the first leg of the Bradby Shield rugby match between Royal College and Trinity College at Pallekelle.
Ellepola, who led Trinity in 1980, said it was a good game and the better side of the day won the match. In this instance it was Royal.
Under Ellepola’s captaincy in 1980, the Bradby Shield encounter produced fascinating rugby and several memorable moments. In 1980 Sujantha Kumar's fresher-laden Royalists edged out Trinity by 7 points to 3 in the first leg at Longden Place helped by a try by young Sriyan Cooray and a penalty by prop forward Nimalasiri.
In the return match at Nittawela the Royalists came up with a superlative display to notch up a convincing 16-6 win with flanker Seevali Jayasinghe and centre Sumith Fonseka scoring two splendid tries. Prop forward Nimalasiri too played a key role in their success by firing across two penalties from 35 metres out and converted the try scored by Fonseka from a difficult angle to help the Reid Avenue school to retain the Bradby shield for the third successive year. Ellepola played with players like J.V. Tissera, R. Bandaranayakle, and B.S.J. Fernando.
