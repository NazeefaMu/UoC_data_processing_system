Police Force to be revamped: Minister Madduma Bandara

The entire police force would be reorganised and rehabilitated in order to improve services rendered to the public, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said while addressing a recent religious ceremony.
He said the endeavour would pave the way for police officers to regain the praise and confidence of the people instead of brickbats. Police officers must be vigilant and efficient in all their duties and should act justly without taking the law into their own hands.
"The Kataragama sacred city will be developed soon and arrangements for the next Esala festival will be discussed with Sri Abhinawarama Viharaya Viharadipathi Ven. Kapugama Saranatissa Thera," the minister added.
Kirivehera Rajamaha Viharaya Viharadipathi Ven. Kobawaka Dhamminda Thera addressing the function, said that Rs. 6 billion was required for the implementation of the annual Esala festival; a burning issue for the management committee of the Esala festival.
