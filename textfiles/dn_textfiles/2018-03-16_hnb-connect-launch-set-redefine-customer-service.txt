HNB announced the launch of HNB Connect, a fully integrated omni-channel contact centre open every day for any customer any inquiry into the bank’s vast range of products and services.
Powered by a dedicated team of 80 Customer Engagement Associates and Specialists, the HNB Connect team has been empowered to offer speedy and effective resolutions to any customer inquiry, HNB Connect’s services can be accessed through its dedicated telephone hotline: 0112-462462, as well as via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and HNB web-chat or [email protected]
“Today’s banking industry is changing at a rapid pace and as an industry leader, we must always stay well-abreast of these changes in order to maintain our steady progress towards the aggressive targets we have set ourselves through HNB’s Vision 2020.
“With the launch of our omni-channel contact centre, HNB aims to take customer connectivity to new heights. Our team is mandated to work closely with all of HNB’s business segments, and our extensive branch network, in order to ensure a prompt response to any inquiry regardless of platform,” HNB Managing Director/CEO, Jonathan Alles stated.
All customer inquiries across HNB’s branch network will also be centrally handled at HNB Connect, which is anticipated to enable greater emphasis on personalised services at individual branches. The enhanced cross-functionality of HNB Connect is a result enabled through the ongoing digital consolidation of HNB’s back-end systems, which in this case, has been utilized towards providing HNB Connect’s Customer Engagement Associates with immediate access to customer profile in order to provide a personalized solution to each customer inquiry.
Commenting on the strategy behind the launch of HNB Connect, Head of Customer Experience Vindhya Wijegunawardane explained how extensive resources had been channelled towards providing Customer Engagement Associates with personalised knowledge of customers, an in-depth understanding of HNB’s products and services, together with an extensive mandate to take corrective measures capable of fully resolving any client issues.
Maintaining an island-wide presence across 251 customer centres, HNB also offers some of Sri Lanka’s most innovative internet and mobile banking services in the country that are designed to usher in a new technology-enabled banking paradigm.
