BoardPAC principal partner for 2018 ‘Directors Conclave’ in India

BoardPAC, the award-winning Sri Lankan iPad-enabled paperless board communication and meetings solutions developer, was the principal partner of the 2018 edition of the annual ‘Directors Conclave’ of the Institute of Directors (IOD), India.
The Chief Operating Officer of BoardPAC, Rajitha U. Kuruppumulle was one of the distinguished speakers and panelists at this event themed ‘Maximising effectiveness and accountability of corporate boards.’ It was held at the TajLands End, Mumbai, recently.
Kuruppumulle was on the panel that discussed “Building World Class Boards” and explored promoting good corporate governance and reporting to foster investment; a board’s role in crisis management; the embedding of risk management and cyber protection in the board’s decision making process; performance evaluation of board Chairpersons, executive directors, committees, and independent directors; the effectiveness of internal audit for overall board performance; boardroom strategies for managing risk and preventing frauds; and board accountability and board dynamics on the shareholder value chain.
Commenting on the event, Kuruppumulle said board meeting automation is the future for all corporations to build world class boards and noted that automation is the way to maximise effectiveness and accountability of corporate boards. He also thanked the Institute of Directors of India, for organising the event.
Manoj K Raut, Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Institute of Directors, India, commenting on BoardPAC’s support to the event as principal partner said, “We value the strong partnership the IOD India has with BoardPAC, and we hope to see BoardPAC bringing digitisation to the boardrooms of corporate India.”
The Chief Guest at the Directors Conclave 2018 was Shri Anant Gangaram Geete, Union Cabinet Minister for Heavy Industries and Public-Sector Enterprise of the government of India. The audience consisting of about 400 participants included personnel and leaders from key industry entities and boards.
BoardPAC is an effective and highly secure method for Board Directors and Management Committee members to access board and committee papers and supplementary information directly from their iPads, thereby eliminating the need for printing multiple copies of each document and couriering such documents to the Directors. It also provides an easy way for Directors to view all documents related to a board paper in a clear manner.
Leading Indian corporations such as the Bombay Stock Exchange, Power Grid Corporation of India, IDBI Bank, Container Corporation of India, and LIC Housing Finance Limited are already users of the product. It has also been deployed by some of the strongest brands across the world such as the Axiata Group of companies, Deloitte and Maxis among others.
BoardPAC clientele span the largest banks and sector leaders in the Asia Pacific region such as Prudential, Petronas, Maybank, Hong Leong Group, MSIG, BSN, Bumi Armada, RHB Banking Group, Affin Bank, and Bursa Malaysia – the stock exchange of Malaysia.
