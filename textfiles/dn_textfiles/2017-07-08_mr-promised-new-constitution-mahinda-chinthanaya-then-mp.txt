MR promised new constitution in Mahinda Chinthanaya then - MP

UNP Parliamentarian Ajith Mannapperuma said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had promised to enact a new constitution,when he contested for the last Presidential election.
Mannapperuma said that while introducing the Mahinda Chinthanaya, the policy statement of Mahinda Rajapaksa, he clearly stated that he will introduce a new constitution to the country once in power.
“Under the chapter titled Lova Dinana Maga of the Mahinda Chinthanaya, it has been mentioned that a new constitution will be introduced within a year” he said.“But now he is opposing the enactment of a new constitution.
He added that the former government never made Parliament or people aware about financial management.
