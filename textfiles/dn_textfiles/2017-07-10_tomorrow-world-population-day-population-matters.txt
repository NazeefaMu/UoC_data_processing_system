Tomorrow is World Population Day : Population matters

Eleventh of July every year is the World Population Day. Celebrations to mark the event commenced in 1987, when the five billionth child was born on this earth, and it has been remembered continuously for 20 years now. The theme for this year is “Family Planning: Empowering People, Developing Nations”.
In a larger sense, Family Planning is the concept of maintaining the good health of, primarily, the mother, thereby strengthening the hands of the father for his all-round well-being, while promoting the sustained growth of the children - all aimed at the empowerment to build up a strong family and a lovable home, culminating with the development of a healthy community of people.
It is to the credit of the Family Health Bureau of the Ministry of Health and the organisations like The Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka, with a history of over 60 years now, that a large majority of Sri Lanka’s population resort to scientific processes of family planning to enjoy the sound status of family health. Studies have shown that the most effective method to achieve and sustain family health is by sincerely following the concepts advocated through family planning.
Life’s challenges and changes
Family Health is not simply the state free from disease, but also “the capacity of family members to adapt to, respond to, or control life’s challenges and changes”. Family health, in its simplest definition, is the well-being of the father, the mother and their children in all aspects of their life, be it hygienically, economically, socially, environmentally or otherwise, and most significantly in the context of a family’s close positive relationships. The health factor relates to enhancing awareness on health issues such as sexual and reproductive health rights, sexually transmitted infections and abortion, and the promotion of easy accessibility to available services like conception and contraception to help couples to decide their family size. Thereby people are empowered to lead a healthy life, which ends up with the creation of a healthy nation.
Family planning supports the growth of the children by protecting their health and enabling parental care and affection for them, due to sufficient gaps between any two children, irrespective of the number of children that a couple wishes to bear. Family planning never limits the number of children for any family but advocates at least two years space between birth of any two children.
Thus, the growth of the children is vehemently supported by the decisions of the father and the mother to allow adequate time between normal pregnancies and to reduce high-risk pregnancies for the mother. Such decisions are all the more important, especially for the mother, the live-wire of the family, by all means, never ever to think of the dangerous concept of abortion.
Adequate spacing of pregnancies is healthily possible by way of safe-sex, which in other words is avoiding unwanted conception, for which, the knowledge and services necessary are embodied in the concept of family planning. It is, indeed, a part of sexuality education, which fortunately has entered the curricula of school education in Sri Lanka now.
Family planning
In any country, there is a sizeable percentage of families without children. Family planning readily helps them through research, advocacy and services to have babies in the family. Thus, helping childless couples to have a child is also an important segment of family planning. Information, counselling and accessibility to a volume of health-related knowledge and services provided through family planning, help a woman to be away from the need for an abortion.
Other than cases of rape or incest, a large number of abortions in Sri Lanka take place due to the neglect of a couple to have ignored scientific family planning, thus leaving the female partner to suffer and face a great deal of hardship, including even loss of life, not forgetting the distress for the male partner and an unexpected burden on the family at large. That again is hampering the status of family health, which damage could be totally eliminated through processes advocated through family planning.
