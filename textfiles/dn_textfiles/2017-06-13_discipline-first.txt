Discipline first!

Muhammadh Irfan Aqeel, a 16 year old boy, has brought glory to his Alma Mater, St Mary’s College, Nawalapitiya, by obtaining nine ‘A’s at Ordinary Level 2016 exam. A student from the school has achieved this feat after a lapse of 18 years.
Aqeel has focused on both studies and sports. In the countdown to the exam, he has done past papers and model papers without depending much on tuition.
Aqeel’s parents, Muhammadh Irfaan and Fathima Rizmiya and his teachers at St Mary’s College, Nawalapitiya, were the great forces behind him, enabling him to achieve this feat.
Daily News T&C interviewed Aqeel on behalf of other students who strive to make mother Lanka proud. The discussion turned out to be an eye-opener.
How did you feel when you got to know of this accomplishment?
I was very proud as I could draw the attention of the country towards my school. Being the only student in the school to obtain nine ‘A’s after 18 years is of course a personal achievement as well.
How did you engage in studies and what kind of support did you get from your parents and teachers?
I mostly did past papers and model papers without depending much on tuition. I attended seminars and workshops held in school with my friends when the exam was nearing. I must thank my teachers for organizing those seminars.
At the time I was studying for Ordinary level, there was no laboratory in my school. I used to watch science experiments on the internet using my mother’s smart phone.
My parents were the pillars of my success. My mother who is a housewife even ironed my cloths and paid for my class fees in time. She taught me Tamil at home.
Did you engage in sports while studying for your Ordinary Level exam?
I played cricket in school and was in under-11 and 13 teams. I was also a member of the under 15 swimming squad. Engaging in sports enhanced my physical fitness.
What good qualities have you derived from your parents?
Our family lived in the Sigiriya Air Force camp when I was five or six years old. My father served for 12 years there. I had many Sinhala friends there.
My father gave me a golden advice. He told me ‘discipline’ comes first. I must give first priority to discipline. He encouraged me to do sports but said if I intend to excel in studies I must make sure sports do not disrupt my studies.
As Muslims we pray five times a day and Friday is a special day where we go to the Mosque. My father insisted that I should respect all religions.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
I have two younger sisters. My elder sister is studying at an International school.
You study in Tamil medium but have a sound knowledge in English. How important do you think English is for children?
English is the gateway to a vast knowledge hub. I am good in grammar but must improve my spoken English.
I intend to enter the medical college. In the university lectures are conducted in English as I have heard. So to continue with my studies I must know my English. When you know your English you can read many books on varied subjects and enhance your knowledge.
Also knowledge in English paves way to find good jobs here and abroad.
I think all Sri Lankan children must be taught English as a common language for communication purposes.
What activities do you engage in these days?
Since I am at home these days on Ramalan vacation, I enjoy spending time with my little sisters and parents. In the meantime since I want to follow subjects in the Science stream, I attend private classes on the subjects; chemistry, physics and biology.
 What is your future ambition?
 want to serve my country by becoming a specialist doctor. I intend to become a Gynecologist.
In my present school, Nawalapitiya St Mary’s College, there is only Commerce and Art streams so I will enter Gampaha Zahira College do to my Advanced level studies.
