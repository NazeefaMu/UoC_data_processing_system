ADG should refrain from signing irrelevant circulars: GMOA

The Acting Director General of Health Services has issued a circular to all hospital directors instructing them to remove black flags from hospital premises. These are not tasks assigned to him. He will have to send more circulars in future if the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) decides to hoist white, red or multi couloured flags as a part of the ongoing protest, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA head Quarters in Colombo 7 yesterday, he said a group of armed persons had entered the Elpitiya base hospital and removed the black flags hoisted at the hospital premises as a part of the ongoing protest.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the doctors of the hospital have currently withdrawn from duties until their safety is ensured. The trade unions have the sole right to protest against anything and that right cannot be violated through issuing circulars.
The GMOA requested
the Acting Director General of Health Services to sign only the circulars that are relevant to him.
This is the first time in Sri Lankan history that a Director General of Health Services had signed an irrelevant circular, he added.
