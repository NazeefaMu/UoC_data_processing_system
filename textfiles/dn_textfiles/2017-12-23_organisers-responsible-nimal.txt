Rejection of SLFP nomination papers:
Organisers responsible - Nimal

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday said that electoral organisers should take the responsibility for the rejection of SLFP nomination papers by election officials.
Addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, the Minister requested the Election Commission Chairman to ensure that all parties abide by the election rules and regulations to ensure a free and fair election.
He added that the SLFP and the UPFA will extend their fullest support to the Commission to ensure free and fair election.
Minister de Silva said that adopting a new electoral system is a victory to the SLFP and added that they intend to adopt the same system at other elections as well.
He requested the people to make use of this opportunity and elect a person of their choice who shows more commitment and dedication in the service of the people.
Speaking about the party’s Colombo Municipal Council Mayoral candidate Azad Sally, the Minister said he was not someone who was suddenly imported to the field.
Responding to a question about the SLFP’s political enemies, Minister de Silva said the party cadres and supporters at grassroots level are aware of this situation and would use their votes in a prudent manner. When the Minister was asked, what decisions the President Maithripala Sirisena would take once the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Bond Issuance is released, Minister Silva said the President would promptly take action on the recommendations of the Commission.
He said that the upcoming election would eliminate racism and strengthen reconciliation among the people.
“We have already created the background for the holding of a free and fair election,” he said.
