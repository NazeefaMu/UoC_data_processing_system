Special beds for dengue patients at NHSL

The National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) has allocated 30 high-dependency beds in several wards, especially for the dengue patients in critical condition. Around 100 dengue patients receive medical treatment at the hospital at any given time, NHSL Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said yesterday.
He said the number of high-dependency beds will be increased up to 60 soon. Once the critical dengue patients are out of danger, they will be transferred to ordinary beds and the special beds will be given to critical dengue patients. The special arrangement made considering the possibility of increasing the number of dengue patients with the ongoing weather pattern, he said. Epidemiology Unit sources said 42,141 dengue patients and nearly 70 dengue deaths were reported from all parts of the country by May 5.
The highest number of dengue patients, 17,234, were reported from the Western Province, and the Colombo district has reported the highest number of dengue patients, 9278.
