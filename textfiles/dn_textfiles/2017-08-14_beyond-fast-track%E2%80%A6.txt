Beyond the fast track…

Her name is synonymous in the Sri Lankan track and field history. She was the first Sri Lankan woman athlete to clinch an Asian Games gold medal. Though she bid adieu to her athletic career in 2007, she still holds five international records to her name: two South Asian Games records, two Asian Championship records and one Asian Games record. Eranda Siriwardene, Damayanthi Dharsha’s husband, unfurls his thoughts on life off the tracks with the Sprint Queen.
The athlete
Damayanthi used to practice for two and a half hours in the morning and two and a half hours in the afternoon during week days. She also had a practice session on Saturday morning which involved weight lifting and speed practice. They also got a one and a half month training program to attend out of Colombo at the beginning of the year. She could not afford to miss any of these sessions because that would affect her career greatly as she is most likely to lose speed. Meeting all these requirements was very demanding and shows that life of an athlete is not rosy. Many sweat and tears are shed to get to the top of the ladder.
Damayanthi has quite a strong mindset. Her determination cannot be wavered easily. Her goal was to win rather than defeat another runner. Victory was what she focused on solely rather than trying to find out who her opponents are and working towards defeating any one of them in perticular.
The wife and mother
We got married in 2003 and since she was still in the field Damayanthi was mostly focused on her athletic career. She did perform the role of a wife well with the little time she could spare. However after calling it quits she had more time to focus on her role as a wife and mother. She is currently employed at MAS Holdings but still balances her career and family life well. Our first child, Esandi, was born in 2007. She is nine years now and is a student of Ladies College, Colombo. Our second child, Disandu, was born in 2010. Our youngest, Vinuth, was born in 2015. Damayanthi’s mother stays with us and helps out.
I manage my own business. Therefore my working hours are quite flexible. We manage our duties as parents between us without any hassle. I used to drop Esandi to school for five continuous years because we both left the house at around the same time. Now she travels by a school van. Since Damayanthi works all five days of the week she has reserved the weekends for cleaning and engaging in household chores.
First meeting
I hail from Badulla and I schooled at Meegaha Kivula Junior School and Central College, Badulla. After sitting for my G C E Advanced Level examinations from the commerce stream I came to Colombo to stay with my sister. She was married to the 400 meter record holder Harijan Ratnayaka. He used to train and coach at the Torrington Grounds and we joined him there most of the time. This paved way for my meeting with Damayanthi.
Though I did not pursue a career in sports, I was a good sportsman during my school days. Volleyball was my forte. I have also taken part in the all island 200m running events. As we started chatting we both realized that our ideas were similar. We had a relationship for about two years which ended in marriage on June 28, 2003.
The marriage function
Damayanthi’s parents were aware of our relationship. They discussed with my party and finally set a date for the wedding. Our wedding was not a grand occasion especially because we were short of time to plan anything elaborate. Damayanthi had to attend the Asian Championship Meet for which she won a gold medal later. We had a small function with our families at our house in Battaramulla. That was the first event we had in the house after the house warming ceremony.
Calling it a day
I believe that Damayanthi has had a fruitful sports career. Though she has not won an Olympic medal she has reached fourth place at the Commonwealth Games and she is the only one Sri Lankan to win three gold medals in the Asian Games. She has seven international records to her name and all of them are unbroken. She has won 15 SAARC gold medals. She is content with those achievements. She retired after 16 years in the track and field. There was a period that Damayanthi missed her career in the track and field soon after retirement. She would have made a good coach or instructor. She could have rendered her assistance to the field in many ways if she had been given the chance. They recently established the Sri Lanka Olympian Association in which Sriyani Kulawansha is the president. Damayanthi is the secretary. Anurudda Rathnayake is the treasurer while Sugath Thilakarathne is the vice president. Susanthika Jayasinghe is the patron. It also includes four committee members: Julian Bolling, Ruwini Abeymanna, Harijan Rathnayaka and Mahesh Perera.
Pros
Damayathi does not get overexcited in matters. She knows how to keep her cool and ponder over a matter before taking a decision. She also has a lot of determination. She would give her maximum to attain her goal. She is not lethargic by nature.
Cons
I am not indicating that Damayanthi is a ‘perfect person’ sans weaknesses, but she has always been an example to other people. The only weakness that I can think of is that she is a bit idle to study when an examination draws near. As a Senior HR Executive she has to sit for exams which are connected with her work to reach the next grade. She needs to complete her degree as well but she is not bothered much about it.
Happiest moments in life
Damayanthi values the gold medals she won at the Asian Games in 1998. She was the first Sri Lankan female athlete to win a gold medal. She also broke the Asian world record during this event.On a more personal note one of the happiest days in our life is when our first child was born. Esandi was born at the Joseph Fraser Memorial Hospital, Colombo, on December 22, 2007. Though we did not particularly vie for a daughter we both had predicted that our first child will be a daughter.
Foodwise
Damayanthi had to eat according to a special diet when she was still engaged in track and field. She was required to eat beef which she did not enjoy at all. She gave up consuming beef soon after retiring. Her favourite food is fish eggs curry. It’s one of our family favourites now.
Free time
We hardly have any free time as we are always engaged in something during the week days. However we have developed a habit if going out for a meal during the weekend as it is a refreshing change from our daily lifestyle. If there is a long weekend around the corner we venture out of Colombo. We visit different locations. Kandy is a place we visit often. We love to go to Nuwara Eliya but since the kids are still very young it is a bit difficult to travel far. Our recent trip was to Anuradhapura. We would go for a holiday abroad if the kids are up to it. We both have gone to a number of foreign countries before having children. We love going to Italy with the kids since Damayanthi’s sister lives there.
One little known fact
Since Damayanthi could not miss out on any of her practice sessions we could not attend most of our friends’ functions. So the initial stages of our life have been full of sacrifices. We had to give the gatherings a miss especially if they clashed with the times when Damayanthi’s training sessions were on. We could not attend events which demanded us to go outstation in particular because that means she has to sacrifice one day of training. Most of the people did not understand this fact and were upset with us because we could not attend their events.
