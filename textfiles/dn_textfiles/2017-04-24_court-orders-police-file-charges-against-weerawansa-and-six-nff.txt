Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara ordered Cinnamon Garden police today to file charge sheets against National Freedom Front (NFF) Wimal Weerawansa and six other party activists for allegedly steering a protest which blocked the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing disturbance to pedestrians and the normal flow of traffic.  
On February 6, last year, the NFF staged a protest march against the visit of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein. 
Six suspects including NFF leader, Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne, Mohammed Muzammil and Don Lusian are currently out on bail.  The seventh suspect Chaminda Jayalal was not present in Court today and the Court was informed that the Police is yet to trace his whereabouts.
The Police informed Court that the suspects who organized the procession has failed to obtain the prior permission from Police to organise the march.

President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe with counsel Kapila Gamage appeared for the suspects.
