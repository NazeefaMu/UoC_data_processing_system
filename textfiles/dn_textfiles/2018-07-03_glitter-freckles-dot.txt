Glitter freckles on the dot!

Gone are the days when people were looking to get rid of freckles. Today, it’s not just about flaunting original but also fake freckles. These small brown spots that are naturally made-up, might seem like a strange concept in India as pale people with red hair are more likely to have them. But, it has become the make-up industry’s biggest invention.
Inspired by the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle’s wedding look, people all over the world seem to be pulling off this trend in a tasteful way. It goes well with many outfits and is suitable for parties, fashion shows, music festivals and other occasions.

How to get the glitter freckles:
1. Before starting, make sure your skin is fresh and radiant by exfoliating and then moisturising it well.
2: Add foundation to give some coverage to the skin, use a lightly tinted moisturising cream or a BB cream as a base layer.
3. Eyeliner or eyebrow pencils work best to dot the freckle. Ensure the tip is blunt in order to get the right shape. Create fake freckles by gently touching the pencil to the skin and twisting it. To make it look natural, you can spread it across your upper cheekbones and the bridge of your nose.
4. Blend the freckles into the skin by lightly pressing your finger over each pencil mark to evenly spread it out. It is important that the freckles don’t look defined.
5. Set it with a translucent powder or bronzer to make it last longer.
6. To add the glitter finish, using a brush dab glitter over the dots. Experiment with different shades like rainbow, silver, iridescent and rose gold glitters to see what goes well with your look!
