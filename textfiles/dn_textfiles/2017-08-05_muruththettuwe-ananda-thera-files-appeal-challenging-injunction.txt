Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera files appeal challenging injunction

Chief Incumbent Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera has filed an appeal in the Colombo Civil Appellate High Court challenging the Colombo District Court’s Interim Injunction to prevent him from utilising the Narahenpita Abhayarama temple property for political, commercial and trade union activities.
The Colombo District Court issued this order on July 14, until the final determination of the lawsuit. When the appeal petition came up before Civil Appellate High Court, parties were directed to propose possibility about a settlement regarding the scope of the interim injunction issued by the District Court.
President’s Counsel Ali Sabry appearing on behalf of Ven.Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera submitted to court that his client’s trade union rights should not be deprived from a court order.
Senior counsel H. U. Senanayake with counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the respondent party.
The District Court had issued an injunction order consequent to a lawsuit filed by Ven. Pathberiye Wimalagnana Thera of Kirulapana Purvaramaya.
Ven. Wimalagnana Thera said he has the hereditary right to claim for the post of Viharadhipathi at the Abhayaramaya temple. The plaintiff said he has already filed a case in the Colombo District Court against Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera claiming his hereditary rights for the Viharadhipathi post in the temple.
The petitioner alleged that the properties of the Abhayarama temple including the buildings and premises are being used by political parties and trade unions to gain political advantage in a manner that brought disrepute to the temple.
He said all these activities have taken place with the consent and blessing of Ven.Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera and thereby he sought an injunction order preventing Ven. Ananda Thera from utilising the temple property for political, commercial and trade union activities.
