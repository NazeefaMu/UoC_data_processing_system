Minister calls for inquiries into three healthcare incidents

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had instructed Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara to conduct investigations into three recent incidents, Health Ministry spokesman said.
The investigations called for the death of a PHI suffering from a heart attack who was admitted to the Hinguraggoda Hospital, denial of treatment for a student at the Rambewa Rural Hospital for a heart ailment and a report that a lady doctor on duty was scolded at the Matara General Hospital OPD.
Minister Senaratne had pointed out that no doctor can refrain from treating patients on the grounds that there is no electricity. All emergency medical treatment should be carried out irrespective of obstacles, the spokesmen said.
