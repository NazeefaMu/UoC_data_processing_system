Electrically operated potter's wheel, introduced as an alternative to traditional Sakaporuwa, whirls in rhythmic twirls, while Matilda moulds the pile of raw clay into an artistry of a clay article in a subtle way.
"I have been doing this for as long as I can remember. I learned to make these clay articles when I was schooling. That was in the 1950s," says Matilda, an award-winning master potter while she turns the potter's wheel.
It is interesting to watch how she works. The earthenware takes shape in the hands of Matilda who works with patience and dedication, fashioning the clay placed on the Sakaporuwa (wheel) into an article within seconds.
"From raw clay to finished product, we follow steps such as preparing clay, throwing, forming, trimming, applying guru and polishing, drying, engraving and firing. That has been established over the centuries by potters. Each step in the overall pottery process is an art in itself and every piece of pottery we make is handcrafted.
"Small Kabok stones found in river beds called guru gal is crushed and made into a liquid which is painted on a clay vessel. Once it is dry, a spoke from an umbrella is used to scratch the design," Matilda explained.
"I draw what I like. If I make a mistake, there is no way you can erase it," she added.
Matilda Yasawathi, a 74-year old professional potter, has won number of awards and certificates including President's Gold Award in 2008. She is currently working for the Government Pottery Workshop of the Department of Industries in Western Province, located in Bandarawatte, Biyagama.
Weerasekerapura in Biyagama, a village famous for its artisans of pottery, is Matilda Yasawathi's home. Around 20 kilometers away from Colombo is the hamlet of Weerasekarapura in Biyagama. Driving through the narrow pathways of the village on either side of the road, one witnesses a photogenic landscape of paddy fields, and a cluster of potters practicing earthenware and clay works.
Stacks of finely crafted pottery neatly arranged in stockpiles in front of houses are a common sight that greets anyone who leisurely walks down the road. Making earthenware has been the sole bread and butter earner of the Weerasekarapura villagers for generations.
Inhabited by about 160 households, the village is native to the traditional potter community. Potters of Weerasekarapura, practice this timeless handcraftsmanship as their primary occupation. Gurulettu (earthen vessels used to store water), flower pots, Meti pahan (lamps) are some of the traditional products people master here on potter wheels.
The process of production is usually organic containing mostly natural ingredients, ultimately hand-made and shaped with no mechanical excesses. The basic raw material clay is procured in tractors from fields. Potters normally excavate clay from the riverbanks in the vicinity. But today potters have to face various hardships to find clay due to legal barriers.
Other raw materials required are 'Guru Gal' (small red colour stones) for making the distinctive red colored designs. Firewood, cow dung, bricks, broken pots, are materials used to make 'natural' or 'traditional' ovens for firing earthenware so as to provide this easily broken produce, with high durability.
"There was a time when there were about 168 families in our village doing pottery. But today only about 10 families engage in this business," said K Upali, another master potter from the village.
Pottery being an age old handicraft in Sri Lanka, the roots of the Sri Lankan pottery industry can be traced back to the first century BC. Sri Lanka is dotted with various pottery firms, big and small especially in Galle, Matara, Kegalle, Kandy and Kurungala.
"The pottery industry in Sri Lanka earlier provided mass employment along with betterment of the living standards; both the village and city people comprise the work force of the industry. But unfortunately the art of pottery-making may soon be a thing of the past," says Upali.
It is a small family-run home-based business. Slightly off the Biyagama Road at Bandarawatta Junction, in a long shed behind their home, Upali sits at his 'wheel' turning out pot after pot while his wife applying Guru and polishing them.
"We are facing much difficulty because clay needs a permit now," laments Upali, "earlier our clay pit was always filled with clay. But today we cannot find enough clay to fill it. We have a good market for our products. But we cannot cater this market demand due to the lack of clay." He also added that the quality the final products based on the quality of clay that we use. Unavailability of quality clay has been resulted to the post production losses.
"Last month I lost Rs.10,000 due to the post production damages," said Upali.
Electric potter wheel which was introduced by a Japanese company makes their works easy and efficient. "Earlier, while I made the pots, Upali would turn the wheel," his wife explains of the days when the wheel had to be operated manually. Now only one is needed because they have switched to electricity," She said.
W Jayaweera, another master potter who has been successfully engaged in pottery industry for the past 35 years said that the government assistance is very much needed to do this business and he urged from the relevant authorities to reduce barriers to employment especially legal barriers.
Officer in-charge of the Production and Training centre of Clay Articles located in Bandarawatte, Biyagama, K.A.Weerasena said that the number of potters in the area has gone down because of the low availability of raw materials and young people opting to work in the garment industry.
"Present generation does not like to continue pottery industry as they belong to a particular caste and they do not want to make it public. So they also ask their parents to stop this traditional industry," he said.
When contacted by the Daily News, an Industrial Promotional Officer of the Department of Industries, Western province P.G.Manjula Priyadarshani said that the Production and Training centre of Clay Articles provides designs and service facilities for the individual traditional potters in this village to continue their industry apart from the usual production of the centre.
"We also plan to introduce short term training programmes for young people those who are willing to engage in pottery. We have also introduced new products and designs such as handmade ceramic jewelry production.
We provide drying and firing facilities for villager, at the training centre." She also added that the country's first ever dedicated Pottery Museum has been set up at the Production and Training centre of Clay Articles.
It houses a collection of fascinating pottery items catalogued into 'household items', 'vessels for religious purposes' and 'red clay products for construction.'
"A large number of locals and foreigners especially schoolchildren and university students visit the museum daily. Those who visit the training centre and the museum do not forget to visit the village too. As a result of that the traditional potters in the village would be able to find better market opportunities for their products," She added.
