SL sentenced  to death in Kuwait

The Kuwait criminal court sentenced a Sri Lankan man to death for murdering his wife. The suspect confessed he was behind an explosion in a three-storey building in Salmiya, Kuwait that injured him and killed his wife and another woman.
The suspect confessed that he planned to make the crime look like an accident, so he made a hole in the gas pipe, which caused a huge explosion. He said the move was the result of complicated disputes he failed to resolve. - Kuwait Times
