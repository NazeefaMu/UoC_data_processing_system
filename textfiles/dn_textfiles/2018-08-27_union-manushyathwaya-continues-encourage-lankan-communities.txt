Union Manushyathwaya continues to encourage Lankan communities

‘Union Manushyathwaya - Danuwath, Suwapath, Yahapath Hetak’ – CSR Brand of Union Assurance continuously elaborates its mission on enriching the life changing partnerships by creating healthy and happy communities around the country.
All these CSR initiatives are organized in favour of delivering valuable and informative content to the communities which they operate in.
Union Manushyathwaya and its endeavours are the focal point, through which the company disseminates vital information to the public on adopting preventive measures against three diseases - Thalassemia, Dengue, and Diabetes.
Active support from the respective authorities and enduring support from the branch network has led Union Manushyathwaya to successfully conduct the fully – fledged programs and awareness sessions throughout the island during the first half of the year 2018.
Dengue Awareness Programs scheduled for the first half of the year included a special house-to-house visit program which was able to cover around 70 households, directing the people for a behavioural change by properly maintaining the households and its surroundings to prevent and control the spread of dengue disease.
A special set of programs were conducted within the schools aiming to initiate behavioural changes of the children within the community to address the dengue issue. Collaborative participation of over 6000 students through three school focused programs were conducted through this special initiative, engaging the youth and the younger generation to be a part of the mission towards preventing dengue. The first ever dengue pilot project executed within Sri Lanka which was commenced on January 5, 2017 in Kirulapana, Siddharthapura Housing Scheme successfully completed the first phase of the project on January 20, 2018. The overall project was successfully concluded during the month of June producing valuable insights on preventing dengue.
In addition, campaigns were carried out during the first half of year 2018 to raise awareness and prevent the spread of diabetes. 24 free pre-scanning sessions were carried out during these programs touching over 1000 lives whilst diagnosing the potential diabetes patients and providing them with the necessary advice on controlling their blood sugar levels leading them to start a healthy lifestyle.
