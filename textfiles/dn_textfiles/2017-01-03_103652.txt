Sri Lanka’s Minister of Parliamentary Reform and Mass Media Gayantha Karunathilaka has said that all arrangements are in place for the implementation of the Right to Information (RTI) Act from February 4.
Speaking at a function held for the official announcement of work for the New Year, the minister said that the RTI service will be provided to every state establishment through the appointment of an Information Officer.
Karunathilaka, recalling that the RTI Bill was presented to Parliament and approved with the consent of all 225 MPs said the necessary initiatives to implement the Act was planned for several months last year and now the necessary background has been prepared for its implementation from next month.
The Right to Information Act, passed on June 24, 2016, was a key pledge in the 100-day work programme of the government, and the 19th amendment to the Constitution recognized the Right to Information as a fundamental right.
Under the RTI Act, ministries, departments, public corporations, local authorities, non-governmental organizations that are substantially funded by the government, higher education institutions, courts and tribunals should provide access to information and maintain records.
