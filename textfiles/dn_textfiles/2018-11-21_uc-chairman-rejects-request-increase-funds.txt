UC Chairman rejects request to increase funds

United National Party (UNP) members of the Ambalantota Urban Council (UC) had requested the ruling party to increase the members’ fund from Rs.50,000 to Rs.100,000 during a recent meeting. They had added that current funds were insufficient.
They said each member received Rs.15,000 as a monthly payment, Rs.3000 for fuel expenses and Rs.1,000 for telephone charges.
However, the Ambalantota UC Chairman had rejected the proposal.
