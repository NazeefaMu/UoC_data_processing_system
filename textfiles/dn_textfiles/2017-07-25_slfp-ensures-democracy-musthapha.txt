SLFP ensures democracy: Musthapha

The SLFP is a party which ensures democracy. Elections will never be postponed against the law. Steps will be taken to hold elections as soon as the necessary Acts are approved by Parliament, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He was addressing the 67th annual convention of the all Ceylon Youth Muslim Men’s Association, recently.
“A majority does not have a clear idea of this system. They make various complaints regarding the delay of Local Government elections. This is not a theme to become popular. I declare with responsibility that this government will never underestimate the sovereignty and that the elections will be held accordingly,” the minister said.
He said the All Ceylon Youth Muslim Men’s Association has a great history. It has been implementing the needs of the Muslim community for a long time, such as education and infrastructure.
Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya was awarded for his service for the country at the ceremony.
Eastern Province Chief Minister Ahamed Nazeer also participated.
