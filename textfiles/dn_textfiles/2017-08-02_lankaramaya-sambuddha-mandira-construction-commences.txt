Lankaramaya Sambuddha Mandira construction commences

The construction of a Sambuddha Mandira (palacial shrine for a Buddha statue) in front of historic Lankaramaya, a holy sites of Atamastana (Eight Holy Places) in Anuradhapura has been commenced.
Lankaramaya Chief Incumbent Ven. Relapanawe Dhammajothi Thera said the foundation for the shrine (over 2,500 square feet in extension) has already been laid.
The Thera said Lankaramaya is a significant dagoba constructed in the 1st century BC by the King Vattagamini Abhaya (King Valagamba) enshrining the relics of the Buddha, a section of the Pati Dhathu as well as the jewellery of Soma Devi , the Queen of King Valagamba, which were offered to the Buddha. “A shrine for Lankaramaya is felt as it has no place for devotees arriving from different directions to worship the dagaba,” Ven Relapanawe Dhammajothi Thera said. “There is evidence of a shrine built in the period of the kings. But it had been destroyed a long time ago,” the Thera said. The Thera said the constructions was expected to be completed before June next year.
The construction of a shrine is one of the Eight Great Efficacious Merits. Therefore, the Committee on the construction decided to open opportunities for Buddhist devotees to make their contributions for the construction.
The Thera, who is also the President of the Anuradhapura Lankarama Temple Shrine Fund, said the construction cost of one square feet of the shrine is around Rs. 7,000 and those who wish to make contributions either could contact phone numbers 0252221884 or 0777855399, or send an email to the address [email protected].
