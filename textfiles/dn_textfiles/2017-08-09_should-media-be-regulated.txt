Should the Media be regulated?

Eng. S. Hettiarachchi- employed at a government institution
Every media institution in Sri Lanka has its personal agenda; I wonder how the regulatory bill or a body could actually handle that part. When media institutions report, it might not be false, but the angle each institution takes has a vast difference.
It is good to have regulations but the government too should make sure that it would not cause any harm to media freedom. I still doubt whether we have media freedom even without any regulations.

Our people are used to comparing everything with the standards implemented in foreign countries, failing to understand should even culture and history of a country would have an impact on the reaction to news or a story. Sri Lankans would not react the same way that foreigners sometimes react to issues and therefore, it is vital to understand that difference. Sometimes the way some media report news on sensitive matters highlight the need to have regulations.
Journalists as well as many concerned groups panicked when the draft bill was released and that clearly shows the trust people have towards the government. People do not immediately believe when the government takes an initiative stating that it is to safeguard democracy, it has been the same in past as well.

I think social media and electronic media need systematic regulations. These days’ people are more dependent on news published by digital media. There is a higher tendency of some websites spreading false news therefore, that needs to be regulated.
At present everybody would put a post on Facebook or tweet when they happen to hear news but the problem is with accountability and accuracy.
The government’s decision to form an independent media regulatory body has caused much controversy with many media stakeholders and journalists raising concerns that the bill would prevent the media from playing the role of watchdog. Many in the media have also questioned the transparency and content of the draft bill which they fear might have a hidden agenda to infringe on media freedom.
The draft bill which has been spoken of by the government many a time, came to the fore as the Ministry of Mass Media appointed a five-member committee to look into the proposed Independent Media Regulatory body. The committee consisted of Seetha Ranjani from the Free Media Movement, D. Lankapeli from the Federation of Media Employees Trade Union Federation, Upali Arambawela, representative of electronic media, R. Bharathi from Sri Lanka Tamil Media Collective and N.M Ameen from the Muslim Media Collective. It was headed by Wijayananda Jayaweera who was the former Communications Director at UNESCO.
The transparency of the process was questioned when it was reported that the draft bill was formulated by Wijeyananda Jayaweera alone who headed the committee and that the remaining committee members had not been involved in the process. The more troubling issue was the presence of a clause that could enable the Commission to compel the journalists to reveal their sources and media organisations, while journalists have refused to accept such a premise. It was reported that several organisations that have already submitted recommendations to revise the draft bill.
Director General of the Government Information Department Dr. Ranga Kalanasooriya recently told the media that the bill was still in its preliminary stages, that individuals and media organizations could present suggestions and amendments to the Independent Media Regulatory Body.
He said that only a discussion paper had been prepared by the Sub-Committee appointed to look into the Independent Media Regulatory Body and that there was no final draft on the proposed body, as yet.
Dr. Kalanasooriya said eight media organizations had participated in the initial discussions in June last year, and said the floor was still open to suggestions and amendments by interested individuals and organizations.
On July 11, Cabinet appointed a sub-committee to look into the preparation of the draft bill on the Media Regulatory Commission. The Cabinet sub-committee is comprised of Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera (Chairman), Minister of Special Assignments Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and Minister of Land and Parliament Affairs Gayantha Karunathilake.
Not all media stakeholders were involved in the process
Even though Dr. Kalansosoriya said that the FMM has been involved in the drafting of the above Act from its inception, C. Dodawatta, Present Convener of FMM denied their involvement in the process.
“Then Convener of the FMM Seetha Ranjanee had participated in an initial meeting called in order to discuss issues related to media institutions and journalists. Soon after the meeting, a committee was appointed to look into matters in which she became a member,” he said.
Ranjanee speaking to the Daily News affirmed that she only participated for the initial meeting and added that she was not a part of the Process. President of the Sri Lanka Muslim Council N.M Ameen also noted that it was just an initial meeting and added he was also curious as to why Dr. Kalansooriya told the media that he was a part of it when he was not.
Dr. Kalansooriya in the meantime said that though various media groups were invited to a few discussions, in the end it was Jayaweera who had been given the task of drafting an Act.
Dodawatte added that after the first meeting that was called to discuss issues, neither Ranjanee nor the FMM were aware of its progress thereafter.
Media organisations and civil society organizations have claimed that it was through newspapers that they learnt that Cabinet approval was granted for a public consultation on the draft.
“For a long period now, the FMM has been lobbying for broader media reforms including regulations for ethical media usage. But, the participation of media institutions in the process has been gradually reducing which becomes problematic for the people to accept it unanimously,” he said.
He said media regulations are vital and added that the process should be transparent, whilst giving space for open discussion on the contents.
One of the media experts, the Ministry had looked to, Nalaka Gunawardane said he was not part of the drafting process, but he took part in the discussions held between media and civil society organisations.
“Everybody did not sit together and draft it, but after formulating the draft, the members discussed it,” he said.
Gunawardene said some of the members were dissenting now as it has turned out to be a bit controversial.
He assured that Jayaweera made sure that all inputs were included in his draft and it was a combined effort.
In the meantime, Gunawardene also explained that another draft had also been prepared by the Executive Director for the ‘Centre for Law and Democracy; an institution which aims to promote, protect and develop human rights, Tony Mendel. Mendel was also involved in the formulation of the Right to Information Act. He also works closely with the Denmark based agency International Media Support (IMS), an organization where Dr. Kalansooriya had been previously employed in.
Dr. Kalansooriya informed Daily News that financial support was obtained from IMS to conduct consultation in all 25 districts with regard to the media regulatory draft bill.
“Toby Mendel was working on a revised draft; it is to be released soon. He met the heads of all private and government media institutions, the Press Commission and Editors Guild Association. He had noted down all the suggestions and recommendations given and all that would be included,” he said.
Gunawardena said Toby Mendel’s draft will be forwarded to the Cabinet sub-committee soon and they would take the final decision on whether to release it or not.
“There is a long way for a final draft but the draft ensures editorial independence and also it ensures the confidentiality of sources,” he said.
Gunawardane meanwhile, pointed out that the problem was with forming an independent council and questioned how independent a council can be in Sri Lanka.
“Several structural and operational concerns were raised by the media organizations.The proposed provisions ensure that the process is fair by all media organizations. After the revised draft is submitted, this would open for further discussions and debate. All the concerns pointed out by the organizations in the initial draft have been taken care of in the revised draft,” he said.
Cabinet and Parliament to decide
Whilst both independent media regulatory drafts are to be completed soon, government sources insisted that they did not have a final draft yet. The Cabinet sub-committee is to decide which draft they would take into consideration.
Speaking to the Daily News, Convener of the Cabinet sub-committee, Deputy Minister of Skills Development and Training Karunarathne Paranavithana said the committee would look into the draft bill and discuss measures that needed to be taken.
He affirmed that the bill would not be a threat to media freedom in the country.
“Though we have regulatory bodies such as the Press Commission and Press Complaints Commission for print media, they are with many shortcomings. The Complaints Commission is not active. Most importantly, not all media institutions are affiliated with it. That's a huge problem and that emphasizes the need for new regulations,” he said.
Paranavithana also pointed out that the electronic media did not have any regulations and said there was no regulatory body to ensure that their reporting was ethical and fair.
“Media standards should be maintained in a healthy democratic country. Media should be more responsible, while being accountable for what they report. It will be a democratic regulatory body not a soviet. All stake holders would be engaged to formulate the final draft,” he said.
He affirmed that the opinions and suggestion of the media institutions, civil society organisations, academics and general public would be taken into consideration. Paranavithana added that the suggestions presented by Mendel would also be considered when deciding on the final draft.
He noted that many media institutions had expressed their displeasure over some provisions.
“Some have sent their recommendations, whilst others consider it as an act of media suppression. Some media institutions actually left the discussion. They insisted that the audience are the regulators and they do not need any expert panel to decide on it. They left because of internal issues. There were representatives from other media who agreed that they need regulations and standards,” he said.
The Deputy Minister explained that the same thing happened when the government brought in the Right to Information Act (RTI).
“Everyone knows how useful it is now. Some people see everything negatively, these are not anti-democratic regulations. I would say if someone is opposing it, just point out the provisions and then I can answer their questions. We cannot entertain the people who always have a negative perception on the initiatives taken by the government. The final draft will be submitted to Parliament and they will take the decision,” he said.
