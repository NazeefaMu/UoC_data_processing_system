Passenger terminal facilitating 400 passengers per hour to be built in BIA

 
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva’s proposal to build a temporary pre-stressed passenger terminal to facilitate 400 passengers per hour at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Steps to improve passenger capacity to 15 million per year by the end of year 2022 are underway, the Minister said.
Accordingly, the temporary pre-stressed passenger was approved to be built as an interim measure.
