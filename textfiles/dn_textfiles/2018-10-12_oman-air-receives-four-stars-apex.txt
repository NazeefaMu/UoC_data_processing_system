Oman Air receives four stars at APEX

Oman Air, the national carrier of the Sultanate of Oman, has received four star rating in the category of Major Regional Airline in 2019 APEX Official Airline Ratings.
Held in Boston on September 24, the awards ceremony took place during APEX EXPO, the industry’s largest passenger experience event, exclusive to experts and decision-makers committed to elevating the level of the worldwide airline passenger experience.
APEX (the Airline Passenger Experience Association), the only non-profit membership trade association dedicated to improving the entire airline passenger experience, announced Oman Air’s four star rating. These awards recognise leading airlines that fly across the globe and represent the opinions of passengers around the world. The APEX Official Airline Ratings, an innovative industry-rating program, were created by APEX, in partnership with TripItfrom Concur. The ratings allow APEX airline members to receive exclusive access to anonymous insights from their passengers, which can be used to elevate the passenger experience. Passengers provide anonymous ratings on seat comfort, cabin service, food and beverage, entertainment, and Wi-Fi.
CEO Oman Air Engineer Abdulaziz Al Raisi said, “We are delighted to receive a four star rating in the 2019 APEX Official Airline Ratings. These awards highlight the airline’s dedication and commitment to delivering the best level of service and product offering to our guests and it is an absolute pleasure to see Oman Air recognised once again as a world-class leader in the airline industry. We look forward to continuing the development of our award-winning product in the year for years ahead.”
