Man kills wife, commits suicide

A husband who had murdered his wife in their home in the Welipenna area on March 17, had committed suicide by consuming poison. Police investigations revealed that the woman had applied for foreign employment in the Middle East and while she was abroad, the man had carried on an illicit affair.
The murder had taken place following a quarrel that erupted between the couple after the wife had returned to the country and learned of her husband's affair. It was also revealed that he had neglected their children.
The man was rushed to the Nagoda Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
