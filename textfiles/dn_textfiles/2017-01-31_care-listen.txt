Care to listen

The countrywide cancer counselling hotline (011-2363211) launched recently in memory of Indira Jayasuriya (the late daughter of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya) is operational for 12 hours a day from 7.00 am to 7.00 pm. The helpline will be made available round the clock. Efforts are being made to offer a four digit number in the future that can be easily remembered by all, the founder and current President of the Cancer Care Association of Sri Lanka, Dr. Samadhi Wishwanath Rajapaksa told the `Daily News'.
According to Dr. Rajapaksa, the main objective of this helpline is to provide cancer patients in Sri Lanka with physical and mental support. Cancer patients, their family members, the public, health staff members, etc can call this line and obtain information on cancer care. Anyone who wants information, befriending, share their grief, anxiety, fear, etc can call this number where a listener will listen to him/her and provide help.
The Cancer Care Help Line was launched to uplift the physical and mental status of cancer patients as well as provide them with medical consultations and advice on treatment. Information on any related matter, such as the specific clinics available, whether specific facilities are available or not, whether it is good to take a shower/bath while undergoing radiotherapy, what is radiotherapy, the side effects of radiotherapy, whether consuming specific food during specific treatment is good or bad etc. can also be obtained through this hotline. The hotline will provide emotional support to callers, he said.

"The staff who provide information to callers are highly professional nursing officers who are currently working at the National Cancer Institute, Maharagama. They work during their free time and they have over 15 to 20 years experiences in caring for cancer patients and dealing with them. We have the Board comprising expertise of consultant oncologists, oncological surgeons, radiologists and other specialists. When specialised service is required to answer questions, callers will be referred to the specialised panel," he said.
The hotline was launched recently based on a concept of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in memory of his daughter, Indira Jayasuriya, who died recently at the age of 40, due to breast cancer.
In addition, there are two more projects that had been launched in the name of late Indira Jayasuriya. They are Indira Jayasuriya Care Service and Indira Jayasuriya Pediatric Care.
Indira Jayasuriya Care Service
Indira Jayasuriya Care Service will be a unique effort that will enhance the availability of mammograms, especially for low-income families of Sri Lanka. The state sector has only 11 mammography machines at the moment, whilst the private sector has 15. The price of a Digital mammography film is priced at Rs. 8,000. Digital Mammography, is the state of the art mammography with minimal discomfort to patients and produce higher levels of accuracy.
The proposal through the Indira Jayasuriya Care Service is to mobilise a mobile mammography unit in a specialised bus that would screen/diagnose patients in a systematic population screening. As per the WHO the only breast cancer screening method that has proved to be effective is mammography screening.
Indira Jayasuriya Paediatric Care Project
There are approximately 200 children at the National Cancer Institute at Maharagama receiving treatment and even the terminally ill children tend to remain in the ward until their eventual demise.
A centre will be initiated under the Indira Jayasuriya Paediatric Care Project for such cancer victims. It will be able to house approximately 25 children with terminal cancer. The atmosphere at the centre would enable them to be attended to by a multidisciplinary team, so that the child's body, mind and spirit is uplifted. This would also free hospital beds that could cater to acute cancer patients. In addition, there are monthly activities proposed at the National Cancer Institute Maharagama children's wards and will be facilitated by the counselling unit at the hospital.
The proposed activities will include monthly activities ranging from art and craft, music therapy, movie day, kids' yoga, entertainment such as magic shows, etc so that one particular item happens every month. Further, measures will also be made to provide a birthday cake to cancer victims to celebrate their birthday like normal children, even while receiving in-house treatment.
