CTB strike in Vavuniya ends

The strike launched by Ceylon Transport Board workers in the north ended on Saturday following talks with Vavuniya District Secretariat officials.The CTB buses operated on schedule yesterday.
At the discussion on Saturday, it was decided to prepare a joint timetable for public and private buses before March 31 and to use previous bus starting locations instead of newly built bus stands.
The CTB workers were on strike following a dispute with private bus operators in Vavuniya.
