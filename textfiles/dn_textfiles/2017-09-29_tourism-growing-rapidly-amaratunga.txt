Tourism growing rapidly: Amaratunga

Tourism in Sri Lanka is economically important and is growing rapidly, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said.
The minister was addressing the gathering at the official ceremony of the World Tourism Day celebrations held at Arcade Independence Square, Colombo.
Sri Lanka has the ability to become one of the best tourism countries in the world. We have already identified many priority projects to boost and sustain tourism growth over the coming years, he said.
The minister said countries and regions with tourism-driven economies have become increasingly concerned with the environmental as well as social-cultural problems associated with unsustainable tourism. As a result, there is now increasing agreement on the need to promote sustainable tourism development to minimize environmental impact and maximize socio-economic and overall benefits at tourist destinations.
Out of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations, SDG8, SDG12 and SDG14 apply directly to the tourism sector.
The effective monitoring and implementation of these SDGs would promote a sustainable tourism industry that creates employment, promotes local culture and products, and nurtures sustainable production and consumption patterns across all major and upcoming tourism hubs in the island.
He said the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) declared 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development. This is fitting for Sri Lanka as we embark on a journey of transforming our tourism sector for the betterment of the planet and its people.
Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairman Kavan D. Ratnayaka said tourism is Sri Lanka’s third highest export industry with foreign exchange earnings and employment numbers increasing annually. “We hope to attract 2.5 million tourists this year and many international tourism promotions campaigns are in the process of achieving this target. Moreover, tourism has created opportunities for a multitude of small and medium entrepreneurs and businesses around the country. Sri Lanka has launched a Tourism Vision and a four-year Strategic Plan that strongly endorses the principles of sustainable tourism,” he said.
The SLTDA has organized a two-day special programme that includes an exhibition on Sustainable Tourism, Photographic Exhibition, the launching of three books on lesser known attractions in Western, Southern and Central Provinces, and awarding certificates to winners of an essay competition conducted at school level.
