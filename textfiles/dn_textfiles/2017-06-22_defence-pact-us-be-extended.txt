Defence pact with U.S. to be extended

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament the Government intends to extend the Defence Pact signed with the US in 2007 for a further period of time.
The Prime Minister responding to a question by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said several rounds of preliminary discussions were held in this regard with the US counterparts.He said it was also discussed with tri-force and Defence Ministry officials. However the Premier said the renewed agreement unlike the previous does not indicate a specific time period, but the provision has been made to terminate it unilaterally after giving notice prior to 180 days.
The Premier said as per the agreement the two countries agree for mutual assistance in providing various services and facilities. “These types of agreements are important considering the current political developments in the world,” he said.
Wickremesinghe, however, said the US counterparts have requested more time to proceed with the agreement.
He said the defence pact would be presented to Parliament after endorsement. MP Dissanayake requested a Parliament debate on the agreement before signing it and the Premier agreed to do so also stressing that the Government has not deviated from the non-aligned foreign policy.
