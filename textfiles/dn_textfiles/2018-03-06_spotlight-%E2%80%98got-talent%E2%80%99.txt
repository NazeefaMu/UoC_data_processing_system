Spotlight on ‘Got Talent’

The Simon Cowell reality show series ‘Got Talent’ is the biggest and most successful reality TV show worldwide.
Originally, started as ‘America’s Got Talent’, it soon captured and enthralled the British audiences with its “Britain’s Got Talent” version just a year later. Today, it covers 64 markets including countries such as Ecuador and Croatia.
Sri Lanka will become the newest market to showcase its talent to an international standard, as Sirasa TV has just announced that it has obtained the local franchise for the ‘Got Talent’ show.
Have you got what it takes to be a star?
The stage is now set for local singers, dance troupes, impressionists, performing dogs, magicians and other professional or even extreme and whacky acts to audition for an elite panel of judges, hoping to beat the buzzer. Auditions will be held across the country in order to give equal opportunity to our talented youth or even a senior citizen who dares to take the challenge.
Internationally, the show has been the springboard for countless new acts around the world, including Susan Boyle from Britain’s ‘Got Talent’, who has gone on to sell over 20 million records worldwide. Nine-year-old singer Amira Willighagen for Holland’s ‘Got Talent’, who’s winning performance of Puccini’s ‘Nessun Dorma’ received more than 50 percent of the television viewers’ vote, and 10-year-old classical singer Jackie Evancho from America’s ‘Got Talent’.
The initial audition for singing sensation Paul Potts, (a mobile ‘phone salesman!) Britain’s Got Talent’s first winner, has had over 121 million views on YouTube and his story was made into a major motion picture, “One Chance”.
The true gift of the ‘Got Talent’ series to local performers will be the opportunity to propel themselves in to the limelight in just one night! With so much talent in our performing arts industry, Sirasa TV is confident that it will play the role of a game changer to these aspiring artists. TV audiences too will play a big role in driving the destiny and dreams of these artists as they cheer them on towards celebrity status and individual glory.
Will they win the judges?
Of course, every act will have to get past some of the most famous judges in the country.
Sounderie David needs no introduction as she is an accomplished singer and is also the Founder and Music Director of Sri Lanka’s premiere female ensemble, ‘Soul Sounds’, the first choir in Sri Lanka, to perform and win awards internationally over the last four years; Jackson Anthony, winner of 46 major awards in television, film, theatre and directing. In fact every major medium. TM Dilshan with 25 Man of the Match awards and more statistics to his name than many others earned during an illustrious career.
