AG summoned to Parliament

Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya yesterday informed the Party Leaders that there is no obstacle in tabling the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Bond issue in Parliament.
Summoned by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, the AG met the Party Leaders at the Parliamentary complex, Parliamentary sources said the AG told the Party Leaders that he had at no point advised against the tabling of the commission report, but only recommended sending the copies to the Heads of the relevant authorities for necessary action.
Parliamentary sources however said a copy of the report was not received to Parliament even yesterday and that Parliament was unlikely to be convened again before January 23.
