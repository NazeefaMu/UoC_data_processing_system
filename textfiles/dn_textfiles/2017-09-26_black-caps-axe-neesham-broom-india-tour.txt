Black Caps axe Neesham, Broom for India tour

WELLINGTON Sept25: New Zealand on Monday dropped allrounder Jimmy Neesham and batsman Neil Broom from the one-day squad to tour India next month.
Coach Mike Hesson named a core group of nine players for the tour, with a further six to be selected from the New Zealand A side currently in India.
Neesham and Broom both missed out after failing to fire at the ICC Champions Trophy in June.
Hesson said Broom had been effective batting at three or four but it was an area in which New Zealand already had a lot of depth.
“We’d like to see Neil develop his game further to show he has the skills to bat at five,” he said. AFP
