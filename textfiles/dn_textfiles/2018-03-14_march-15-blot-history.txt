March 15, a blot in history

An important day in the Roman calendar. March fifteenth, a blot in her history.
And a day woefully reminding Christians some of the similarities that Shakespeare wrote on IDES OF MARCH that had a semblance on Good Friday when Jesus Christ breathed his last on the cross.
Shakespeare being a Christian obviously seized such happenings from the New Testament when he wrote The Ides of March in Julius Ceasar.  As Jesus yielded his spirit, darkness fell across; the curtain in the Temple ripped apart. Graves opened to yield its ghosts who were seen walking in the streets. In open, a lioness whelped her cubs in the street.
When Shakespeare wrote in terms of the impending assassination of Caesar, little did he realize its impact on Good Friday that makes us Christians believe the forty days of repentance finally lead us to the month of March.
(Brutus in his orchard)
….. But it is doubtful yet,
Whether Caesar will come forth today or no:
For he is superstitious grown of late,
Quiet from the main opinion he held once
of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.
It may be these apparent prodigics.
The unaccustomed the terror of the night.
And the persuation of his augurers,
May hold him from the Capitol today…..
(Ceaser's House)
Thunder and lightning prevail indication the horrors that await the Ides of March. Calpurnia's instinct fore-warn Ceasar after her restless night when in her dream she sees Ceaser murdered. Thrice she cried out for help But Ceasar has ears for her pleading.
……… Ceasar, I never stood on ceremonies,
Yet, now they fright me. There is one within.
Besides the things we have seen and heard, 
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. 
A lioness hath whelped in the streets,
And graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead:
Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war.
The noise of battle hurled in the air
Horses did neigh and dying men did groan……..
(A street before the Capitol with Ceasar's senators making their 
way to the Capitol, followed by the soothsayer)
…………………. The Ides of March are come. 
Aye Ceasar, but not gone.
Hail Ceasar, Read this schedule.
(They stab Ceasar. Casca strikes the first, Brutus the last blow) 
ET TU BRUTE? (Ceasar falls and die)
Mark Antony who had no part in the planned assassination of Ceasar, appears immediately to appease the restless crowds that had thronged the Capitol on hearing Ceaser's death and orates one of Shakespeare's famous dialogue delivery:-
…………… Friends, Romans countrymen. lend me your ears.
 I come to bury Ceasar, not to praise him.
The  evil that men do live after them:
So, let it be with Ceasar. 
Brutus hath told you Cesar was ambitious…..
If it were so, it was a grievous fault
And grievously hath Ceasar answer'd it……
