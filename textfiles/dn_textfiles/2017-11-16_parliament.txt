Import of 20,000MT of oil in 2012:
Country did not incur any loss: Premajayantha
Science and Technology Minister Susil Premajayantha complaining of a politically organized attempt to sling mud at him, took pains to clear his name from the import of substandard oil which led to a controversy in 2012.
The minister, participating in the Second Reading debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday, said the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) or the country did not incur any loss from the controversial import of 20,000 MT of oil by the CPC in June 2012.
“Due to a chemical reaction in the oil stock, several vehicles and oil pumps had been affected. Compensation was paid to the damaged vehicles, while measures were taken to recover Rs 55 million from the company which supplied the oil. The CPC acting Chairman at that time wrote to the Committee on Public Enterprises and the Auditor General to clarifying the matter. The COPE report also said the step taken to recover the money from the relevant company, prevented any loss to the CPC or the country,” the minister explained.
He said a few backbench MPs were involved in a mud-slinging campaign against him because he expressed his views frankly on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee.
“I informed the President and Prime Minister about it. I know who was behind the malicious campaign and I will reveal their ugly faces when the right time comes,” he added.

Govt. has allocated Rs. 325 Bn for education: Eran
The government through its Budget 2018 has given priority to education, strengthening state universities and education, but had in no way reduced the allocations for welfare, said Finance State Minister Eran Wickremeratne in Parliament yesterday.
The Finance State Minister said so joining the second reading debate when the Appropriation Bill (2018), (fifth allotted day) was taken up for debate in Parliament yesterday.
“This is a Budget that would fast track the economy. Although there are proposals to create an open market economy, this proposal has been included taking into account the current world we live in. Many proposals have been included in order to rebuild entrepreneurship. Opening the market is a turning point and some are of the view that this was a risk. We live in a competitive world. It is through exports that we could uplift the lives of our people. However, we have not reduced any of the allocations made for social welfare activities. We have established a safety net for low income groups and have invested in improving social infrastructure. Generally, it is after wealth is amassed that how it should be distributed was discussed. However we have done not just re-distribution but pre-distribution. We have allocated Rs. 183 billion for social infrastructure and Rs. 44 billion for Samurdhi welfare. In fact, we have doubled the Samurdhi benefits. However, there are allegations that certain people who are not eligible to receive Samurdhi benefits are getting it and to address this issue, we are in the process of revising the lists,” he said.
Further, Minister Wickremeratne said the government had allocated Rs. 5 billion for season tickets for students. A further 1.9 billion has been allocated for Mahapola scholarships. A greater sum has been allocated for education and also to provide infrastructure facilities, while Rs. 10 million had been allocated for the elderly. Rs. 1.3 billion had also been allocated for kidney patients. Another Rs. 1.2 billion had been allocated for the differently abled services.
“In addition to social welfare, it is through education that society could be developed. Just because a person is born poor, he need not die poor. We could overcome poverty through education alone and that was the reason we had made 13 years of education compulsory with the aim of equipping them with vocational or trade capabilities as not all students could enter university. All this time the responsibility of students who were unable to enter university was on the shoulders of the parents, but now the government aims to take that responsibility on.
Budget focused on attracting foreign direct investment on non-debt based type
A significant focus had been given to this budget in attracting foreign direct investment which is of a non-debt based type. This government is correctly moving away from taxes mainly introduced to fund the war which unfortunately was continued by the previous government to fund their protectionist economic vision, said City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem.
Joining the second debate on budget proposals for 2018 in Parliament yesterday, he said the current macro-economic climate is clouded by indications of retarded integration growth decline in export earnings and foreign direct investments. “To compound these matters further, inadequate foreign exchange reserves cover too was an issue that the Finance Minister had to tackle,” he said.
“Apart from these challenges, climate related disasters compounded the structural weaknesses that the country was facing. Debt services requirements between 2019 to 2022 is in the region of almost US$ 15 billion. Therefore, this budget had to be prepared in the background of such challenges and the Finance Minister had to focus on two important areas. One being to stabilise the macroe conomic fundamentals and the other to stimulate growth,” he said, commending the Finance Minister for avoiding populist and add hock proposals being included in the budget, which is a matter of encouragement.
He said many innovative taxes have been introduced to protect the environment and improve the health conditions of the people, while earning revenue.
However, Hakeem expressed hope that the Finance Minister would take not of the concerns raised against the proposals to liberalise the shipping sector that would negatively impact on almost 500-600 local shipping agents.
‘TNA happy with reconciliation proposals’
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is happy for most of the proposals in the budget for reconciliation which are proposals made by the TNA, said Jaffna district TNA parliamentarian Mavei Senadirajah yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday joining the second reading debate on the budget proposals for fiscal year 2018.
MP Senadirajah also said that yet the government has had to keep the pledges that it gave to the international community and the people in the North or else they would be worried much and act accordingly.
He also said that there are a large number of military personnel retained in the Northern Province causing inconveniences to the people there. They are occupied in the lands in the Northern Province while they are engaged in the agriculture in those lands as well.
He also said that it was his personnel view that those military personnel could be settled in the areas such as in the valleys of the Mahaveli river, Maduru Oya and Malwathu Oya. “They can be given the lands in those areas to the members of the forces,” Senadhirajah. “Then they can engage in agriculture and developing those areas using their expertise. Thenadditionally the issue of the people in Jaffna would be solved. This is my personal view.”
Financial discipline essential for improvement of govt. income: Ravi
Financial discipline is absolutely essential to improve government income to an anticipated 2,325 billion. The country’s economy was on its knees when the unity government took over, said UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake.
He said the biggest issues affecting the country is the country’s debt and decrease in investment. “Why has this country that gained independence for over 70 years ago, still not gained speedy development? Although many governments came into power, gave many promises and tried to take this country forward, we are still stagnating in one place. Our expenditure is far higher than our income, which has put us in debt. By December 31, 2004 the country’s debt stood at Rs. 1,784 billion, but when we took over on January 08, 2015, it had increased to Rs. 9,800 billion a fivefold increase,” he pointed out, adding that despite the bleak situation, the government had taken measures to increase income.
Karunanayake said so, joining the Second Reading of the Budget proposals for the fiscal year 2018.
He said many are concerned about the liberalisation of the shipping sector. “Liberalising the shipping sector does not mean we have opened it to foreign shipping companies to simply come in and dominate the industry. I feel the government has presented this proposal in the proper context, but the manner in which it is to be implemented needs to be determined by the government based on how it would benefit the country. We need to specify the investments that these companies need to make in order to be allowed to come in and invest. Otherwise, it would cause the local shipping industry to collapse,” Karunanayake said.
He said the country cannot move forward because of the Central Bank. “The Central Bank thinks they are in another world. The Central Bank has been established in order to function independently, but they tend to follow a different path. Although the government changed, the Central Bank officials did not change. The monetary policy and the fiscal policy must work hand in glove and that is the only way the country could be taken to a rapid growth,” he said.
TNA MP asks why funds for two projects under resettlement allocated to Industry and Commerce Ministry
TNA Wanni District MP Charles Nirmalanathan yesterday in Parliament, questioned the Government as to why funds for two projects coming under resettlement had been allocated to the Industry and Commerce Ministry.
Rising to a point of order when Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne was on his feet, the MP brought to the notice of the House that Section 188 and 189 of expenditure proposals allocate funds to Minister Rishad Bathuideen’s ministry, but actually those tasks come under the purview of the resettlement ministry.
“Proposal 188 is about providing housing and infrastructure for resettlement of Muslim IDPs, while Rs 2,500 million had been allocated for the purpose. Proposal 189 is about rehabilitating the Mannar town with shopping complexes and a bus stand and continuing with the township development programme at Silawathura. Rs 250 million have been allocated for that purpose. In the previous year, these allocations were made to Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry held by D M Swaminathan. This year, allocations on those projects have been made to the Industry and Commerce Ministry. What is the link between that Ministry to resettlement work?” the MP questioned.
“When I queried this from the Government, a front row senior minister told me that Minister Bathiudeen had made a deal with the Finance Minister in that regard. Minister Rauf Hakeem will prove what I say, because he was also present at that time,” the MP added.
Buttressing this argument JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa also questioned the rationale of that allocation. “If Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne asks for the Beruwala Port Development project, would you allocate money for that project to the Health Ministry?” he argued.
State Minister Wickremaratne however, replied that the matter could be discussed. He also asked the TNA MP to reveal the name of the minister who spoke of a deal between Minister Samaraweera and Minister Bathiudeen. “The relevant minister will respond to this claim. As I understand, the subject of rehabilitation is a broad area and its work could come under several ministries. It seems that there is a personal issue here. That could be taken up separately,” Wickremaratne replied.
There is nothing for the people in this budget: Weerawansa
The people have had to pay an additional tax of Rs. 984 billion this year, in comparison to 2014, said Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa yesterday.
He made this observation joining the second debate on Budget proposal for 2018.
He said the people have had to pay even for obtaining a Police report and a Grama Seva Niladari certicicate. “There is no relief to the public, other than those included to market the budget,” MP Weerawansa said. “There is no relief even to local industrialists. There are more proposals to create investment opportunities for foreigners.”
MP Weerawansa pointed out that there was no proposals to increase the salaries of public servants. He said that the number of loans that has been planned to be taken next year was Rs 1,800 billion. However, the loan rate had been increased by 64 percent today, compared to the loans that the country had when this government took over power. “This loan has been taken even in a situation where there is no civil war,” MP Weerawansa said. “The previous government had taken 5.2 trillion during the past nine years.
He said that there was nothing in this budget for the public.
