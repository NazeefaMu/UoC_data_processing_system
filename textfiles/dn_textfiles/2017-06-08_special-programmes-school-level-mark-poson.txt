Special programmes at school level to mark Poson

The Wayamba Education Ministry has directed heads of all government schools in Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts to organize special ceremonies in schools to mark Poson today.
It is expected for schools to organize meaningful and timely religious programmes to instill noble human values in the minds of schoolchildren. Accordingly, Sil campaigns, meditation programmes, Dhamma sermons, blood donation campaigns and Shramadana campaigns to restore places of worship will be organized by school principals in collaboration with past pupils and school development societies.
It is expected that over 3,000 students and 1,000 school teachers and parents would observe Sil on Poson Poya Day.
