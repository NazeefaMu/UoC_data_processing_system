SP Council meeting on rocky start

The Southern Provincial Council meeting held yesterday lasted for only two hours.
Weerasumana Weerasinghe, who was recently relieved of his Ministry, making a special statement said, no one else had the moral right to take over his seat.
Weerasinghe said the Sri Lanka Communist Party was entitled to hold that Ministry. He said the Communist Party had already written to the President requesting the President to re-appoint him to the Ministry as the party was entitled to a Ministry seat in the Southern Provincial Council.
Members of the Council belonging to the Joint Opposition group displayed banners carrying various slogans and walked out of the meeting. One member who remained in the Council meeting pointed out the lack of a quorum.
As the Chairman rang the quorum bell, some members tried to walk into the Chamber, but a group of Joint Opposition members surrounded them and prevented them from walking in to the Chamber.
Some members later managed to escape from their clutches and entered the Chamber and the Council re-started the day’s business. After going through the balance agenda, the next meeting was postponed to October 12.
