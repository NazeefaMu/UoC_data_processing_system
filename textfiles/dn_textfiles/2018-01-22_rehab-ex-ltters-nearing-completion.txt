Rehab of ex-LTTErs nearing completion

The rehabilitation process of ex-LTTE combatants is almost complete with just eight more left to complete their rehabilitation process, sources from the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation said.
Speaking to the Daily News, Deputy Commissioner General, Rehabilitation, Brigadier Darshana Liyanage said of the eight remaining at the Poonthottam Rehabilitation Centre in Vavuniya, one is expected to be reintegrated by the end of January, while another two rehabilitants will be reintegrated into society by February upon completion of their one-year rehabilitation process.
He noted that to date, around 12,182 ex-LTTE combatants had been rehabilitated and reintegrated into society through this programme. The ex-LTTE members who undergo this rehabilitation process receive vocational training in several courses including Plumbing, Carpentry, Computer, House Wiring, Masonry, Aluminum Fabrication and Welding.
During the one year of rehabilitation the participants also undergo Meditation, Aesthetics/Drama Therapy, Spiritual Development, Sports Activities, Leadership and Personal Development, Language Training (Sinhala, Tamil and English), Counseling and Mentorship among others.
Last year (2017) Rs.100 million was allocated to the Rehabilitation Bureau while this year Rs. 50 million has been allocated. In addition, Rs. 250 million was allocated to the Bureau of Rehabilitation as an extra allocation for the payment of salaries of the rehabilitants.
“The rehabilitants who have been integrated into society will be paid an additional Rs. 10,000 by the government when employment is found for them in addition to the allowance paid during employment training,” Brigadier Liyanage said.
He further noted that Rs.35 million worth of equipment, including water motors, bicycles, fishing nets and other equipment to supplement their livelihood will be distributed among those reintegrated into society, after the elections.
