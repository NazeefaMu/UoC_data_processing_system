Revealing the rebel

In many ways, the book titled as Problematic Rebel by Maurice Friedman is enlightening. The image of modern man that grows out of this book is, above all, a produce of the meeting of philosophy of literature and literature. Friedman had been engaged in the teaching profession and at the university level. He had been teaching on the areas of research into the image of man in modern thought initially at Lawrence College and The Rebel and the Exile in Literature at the New School for Social Research and the Image Man and Psychotherapy at the Washington School of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology.
A reader who has read the works of such creative writers as Herman Melville, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Franz Kafka and Albert Camus may find the compilation of literary and social interpretations quite though-provoking and penetrative. Perhaps the attempt on the part of Friedman could be regarded as a new innovative direction in the understanding of the human experience as embedded in modern creative expression.
The four writers come from four types and four cultural diversions.
The image of man as a rebel seems a serious concept, where the image refers to not purely the human existence, but an unseen struggle both physically and spiritually. Friedman’s is not a pure literary approach, concerned with tradition-bound literature as a goal in itself. But neither does he use literature as a mere illustration of readymade philosophical concepts and categories. Instead, an attempt has been made to interpret literature to discover what new understanding of man the literature he specifies gives us.
Thus, from a synoptic point of view it guards the wholeness of many types of fiction, drama, and poetry as most modern schools of literary theory do not. Friedman in his interpretation of the term and concept ‘problematic’ raises several issues as a pioneer. As a starting point, he takes the Biblical Rebel and the Greek Rebel and tries to trace the lineage of terms such as ‘average man’, ‘super man’, ‘insider’, ‘outsider’, ‘conformist’ and several others known widely and some rarely by schools of learning.
According to Friedman, the Hebrew Bible beings, if not with an act of rebellion, at least with an act of disobedience, that act whereby man became man. In eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.”
Furthermore he states:
“Adam and Even did not commit evil, since they did not know what evil was, but they disobeyed the injunction which protected them against this knowledge and through this disobedience left their existence as children within the Garden of Eden for the confusion and responsibility of the adult world.”
The reader is made to feel that initially Adam and Even had been innocents who turned to be rebels, who moved into experience, from timelessness into history. The researcher Friedman, boldly states that Adam and Eve though banished from paradise, this first exile does not mean that they were abandoned by the god who remains with them in history as in the garden.
Followed by the literary concept about the ‘Rebel’, he goes to works like Paradise Lost. Quite a number of examples from various creative sources spring up as background laid to interpret the works of the main creators in the subject. Moving on to the other category drawn from the Greek sources, he takes an example of Sophocles’ hero Oedipus who too is a rebel.
The example of the age-old Prometheus is treated as the development of the modern man in his struggle to exist. Then comes the interpretation into Doctor Faustus and Faust where an age old legend is selected as a stepping stone in the analysis of the mind of the modern man. Selecting Melville is interpreted and the work Moby Dick includes both explicitly and implicitly the Greek, Biblical and Renaissance images of man, similar in nature to Prometheus, Job in the Bible, and Doctor Faust in both the German and English versions. According to interpreter Friedman, Melville’s work Moby Dick is a metaphysical novel. It is in the problem of point of view that the metaphysical dimension of Moby Dick is found. This is not the mere picture of what reality is but man’s relation to that reality.
Friedman tries to interpret Captain Ahab, the hero of Melville’s Moby Dick as a godly ungodlike man. Like every hero, he says he is a mixture of that divine and demonic. In part three of the work, Friedman devotes space for the interpretation of several novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky. They include novels such as ‘Notes from the Underground’, ‘The Devil’, ‘Brothers Karamazov’ and ‘Crime and Punishment’.
The alienation of modern man triggers off as an image in most works Dostoevsky. He brings both his exiles and his rebels to the dead end of isolation and inauthentic existence.
This is related and specified as the alienation of the modern man. Wherever the man goes he is bound by chains, exclaims Karl Marx. Followed by the interpretations of Dostoevsky comes Franz Kafka. In this, author Friedman says that in every line of Kafka has written whether is finished stories, unfinished novels, diary notes; the central problem is the image of the man torn between the reality and the fantasy. A lengthy analysis follows in the interpretation of the selection of fantasy as a creative expression in order to perceive the rebellious nature in reality.
In conclusion, Friedman tries to pave the way for a new dimension of literary analysis where the man is shown not as a mere living being instead a rebel of a type, perhaps seen partly or unseen completely. Dr Maurice Friedman’s work comes to the literary scene as an innovative source book published as Phoenix book published by the University of Chicago Press.
