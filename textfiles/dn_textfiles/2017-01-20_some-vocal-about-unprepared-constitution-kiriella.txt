Some vocal about unprepared Constitution: Kiriella

Not a single clause of the new Constitution has been formulated, Higher Education and Highways Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said.
The minister said some are talking about the contents of a Constitution which has not yet been prepared.
The minister made these observations at a media briefing at the Highways and Higher Education Ministry yesterday. “It is useless to talk about a hypothetical constitution, which is at the committee stage,” the minister said.
Minister Kiriella said the process of formulating the new Constitution is at the committee stage.
The seven sub-committees appointed to look into seven sub-sections of the Constitution, have completed their reports, he said. The committee reports consist of the proposals and ideas and views of the people. The committee reports will be presented in Parliament for discussion. The committee reports are not the final draft of the new Constitution. The final draft will be prepared by Parliament based on the proposals of the seven commit reports. The debate for preparing the new Constitution will be held after converting Parliament as a constitutional assembly, minister Kiriella said.
The minister said certain persons are misleading the public about the new Constitution.
