Malinga issued six month suspended sentence and 50% fine

Uncapped Wanindu Hasaranga named in Sri Lanka ODI squad :
Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday slapped a 50 percent fine and a six-month suspended sentence on fast bowler Lasith Malinga for making comments to the media and thus violating his contract with SLC.
Malinga however will be available for selection for the ODIs against Zimbabwe which starts in Galle on June 30.
Malinga’s suspension and fine was the outcome of the Disciplinary Inquiry held against him with regard to the breach of his contract with SLC. He had made comments against the Minister of Sports after he (the Minister) had accused the national team players of being overweight and being unfit following their early exit from the Champions trophy in England.
The special inquiry panel comprising SLC secretary Mohan de Silva, SLC Chief Executive Officer Ashley de Silva and chairman Disciplinary Committee Asela Rekawa AAL, found Malinga guilty of breach of his contract after an inquiry held yesterday afternoon at SLC Headquarters. Malinga accepted the charges levelled against him and tendered a formal apology.
The finding were subsequently reported to a specially convened Executive Committee yesterday who imposed a sentence of a one-year suspension, suspended by six months (whereby the punishment would be imposed in the event of a similar infraction within the stipulated 6-month period) and a 50% fine of his next ODI match fee.
NEWCOMER HASARANGA
Meanwhile Sri Lanka selectors named uncapped Richmond College cricketer Wanindu Hasaranga in the squad of 13 picked for the first two ODIs against Zimbabwe in Galle.
“Wanindu is one of the best fielders in Sri Lanka right now and batting well and he is in form. He’s got the option of leg-spin bowling that’s why we picked him. We want to give chances to some youngsters with Angie (Angelo Mathews), Upul (Tharanga) and Lasith (Malinga) playing with senior players,” said Sri Lanka cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha.
Sri Lanka also recalled spinner Akila Dhananjaya and fast bowlers Dushmantha Chameera and Lahiru Madushanka.
However there was no place for Dinesh Chandimal and Thisara Perera.
“We selected the side for the first two ODIs and we are looking at different combinations, that is one of the reasons why we selected this side,” said Gurusinha. “We wanted to have some senior players in the team as well. With Danushka (Gunathilaka) in the runs and Upul (Tharanga) returning after suspension we wanted them to play that’s why Dinesh (Chandimal) was left out for the first two games. Chandimal is in our plans.”
