Marketing issue troubles minor export crop growers

Minor export crop growers in Matale are facing difficulties due to low price of export crops.
Over 10,000 acres in the wet zone of the district, have been utilised for minor export crop cultivation. Nearly 8,000 growers are engaged in the business.
The price of nutmeg per kilo has reduced to Rs.1,300 from Rs.1,950. The price of a kilo of pepper has reduced to Rs.900 from Rs.1,400.
Growers said they are unable to maintain cultivation due to this. The Government has taken steps to encourage growers for the cultivation. But, the authorities have been unable to provide market facilities, farmers said.
