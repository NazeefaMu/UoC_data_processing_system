Wild elephants rampage through Ampara villages

Wild elephants rampage through villages in the Ampara district regularly and villagers in the areas complain that they have to stay away from their houses at nights in fear of death in jumbo attacks.
They damage goods at houses and crops on farm land, they complain.
Malkampiddy in the Sammanthurai Divisional Secretariat Division were ruined almost entirely by the wild elephants.
The residents had informed about the issue to the Grama Niladharis and other officials but they have not taken any constructive step to control the invasion.
"Our children cannot engage in their studies in fear of elephants' attack," the residents lamented. They urge the authorities to set up an electric fence to prevent wild elephants from invading the villages.
