Red Bull Kart fight today and tomorrow

After two seasons of intense wheel-to-wheel action, Red Bull Kart Fight returns to sunny Sri Lanka today and tomorrow for an all-new, all-out race to find the island’s best amateur karter.
Karters will once again start their engines on the tropical tarmac in Mirigama and battle for a spot in the coveted national finals for this year’s edition of Red Bull Kart Fight. The King of the Circuit and this year’s National Champion will drive away with Rs. 200,000 in prize money. This will be followed by the second and third place winning Rs. 100,000 and Rs. 50,000 respectively.
