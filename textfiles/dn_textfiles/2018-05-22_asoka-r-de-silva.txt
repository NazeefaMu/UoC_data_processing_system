Asoka R. de Silva

He was one of the best leg spinners Sri Lanka had in the eighties; later on he became one of the pioneer umpires in the elite panel. He was none other than Asoka R de Silva, the guy with a perpetual grin on his face who never showed even a semblance of a frown during the one hour interview I had with him in his office at the noisy Sri Lanka Cricket Headquarters.
At present he is the Manager Umpires development and coaching and has been in this position from 2016. I must thank Mohan de Silva, the Vice President, Sri Lanka Cricket for facilitating this interview.
Although Asoka was a product of Galle he started schooling at Embilipitiya Maha Vidyalaya, this was mainly due to his mother being a teacher and was prone to transfers. He thanked his mother for the discipline and good mannerisms which he possessed.
Eventually Asoka ended up at Isipathana Vidyalaya and in his last year in 1971 he was their best bowler. After leaving school Asoka Joined Moratuwa Sports Club and played Sara cricket in the company of Pemlal Fernando, Wirantha Fernando, Hemal Mendis and Priyantha Jayasekera. Seeking further honing to his career he joined Nomads and came under the watchful eyes of Dr Sarath Seneviratne who was a brilliant schoolboy cricketer at S. Thomas’. Asoka mentioned that he learned the mental side of the game from the good doctor, this made him a well-rounded cricketer leading him to become the leading leg spin and top spin bowler in the country who was also no mug with the bat.
From 1976 to 1997 he joined NCC and captained that side in ’88/89 and bagged all the silver ware on offer at the time. Asoka became the best bowler in 1984 his forte was nagging accuracy as a result of this he bowled line and length, he was also adept in using the crease.
The other side of his career saw him join Department Of Small Industries and then National and Grindlays Bank and finally at Nawaloka Group. He said he was indebted to Jayantha Dharmadasa and Upali Dharmadasa who gave him all the encouragement to further his cricketing ambitions. During Asoka’s tenure there and under his captaincy Nawaloka won the Mercantile championships in 1984.
Asoka came out on top at the interview held to select the Manager Development and Coaching by beating Sena Nandiweera, Gamini Dissanayake and Ravindra Kottachchi. He was in the ICC elite panel of umpires from 2000 to 2011. His debut as an International umpire was in 1999 in a ODI Sri Lanka vs Australians in Galle. Asoka had 50 Tests and 12 ODI’s under his belt.
Other umpires whom he admired were David Shepherd, Steve Bucknor, Rudy Koetzen and Simon Taufel. Asoka also had a word of praise for our present elite panelist Kumar Dharmasena. Asoka noted that umpiring was much harder than as a player because they were under the scrutiny of 24 cameras going at 1000 frames per second in top matches, so one mistake by them would turn the match upside down. He also stressed the fact that top class umpires had less time to relax between matches since their schedule was much tighter. According to Asoka an umpire should be good in man management, team management and also teamwork since the on field umpire has to coordinate with his fellow umpire, TV Umpire and the 3rd and the 4th umpires as well as the Match Referee.
Asoka also indicated that when he tours as an umpire he feels like a total stranger in the sense, the surroundings, the people the grounds the spectators etc. As an umpire one has to be totally unbiased, cool calm and collected.
Umpires in general gets a snarl or two from pace bowlers when their appeals are turned down or be given wides or no balls when they think that they are within limits. Asoka recalled one such incident when Andrew Nell bounced repeatedly at Jacob Oram who was defending stoutly to save a Test match, he was batting with the last man in. Oram was hell bent on getting to the other end, but Nell was bowling absurdly wide and too high and Asoka had to reprimand him and Nell retaliated by snatching the cap from Asoka and came out with some choice Afrikaner filth which Asoka could not decipher fortunately and he was duly reported to the Match Referee Clive Lloyd and was reprimanded.
Asoka made it clear that the on field umpires and the third umpire are paid twice as much as a top class Test player and the 4th umpire is paid half of that amount.
