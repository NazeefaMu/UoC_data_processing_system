‘Request for Hybrid Court due to lack of trust in judicial system under former govt.’

Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samararaweera said the only reason for many people to request for a Hybrid Court was that they had lost the trust in the judicial system under the former government.
Minister Samaraweera was speaking in response to a question raised by a journalist that the majority of the people in North and East want Hybrid courts to be established.
“However, under the present government we have an independent and accountable judiciary in Sri Lanka. We will do justice to all the Tamils who supported us,”he said.
He further said that not all Tamils want Hybrid courts to be established. It is only the request of a few extremists.
When asked about the future plans of the government with regard to the two year extension by the UN, the Minister said at present, the government is working to implement the truth seeking mechanism.
"Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been consulting different experts. One of our priorities will be to get Cabinet approval for Truth seeking commission.We need to talk to all the leaders and work out a road map,"he said.
When was asked whether he emphasised on a referendum for a new Constitution in Geneva and whether the President and Prime Minister are of the same opinion, Minister Samaraweera said the mandate given to us by the people of this country on January 8, 2015 was to bring a new Constitution which will celebrate the diversity of our country.
“I personally believe that a referendum is a risk that we have to take,”he said.
He further said that it is not a risk as many people say and the President and the Prime Minister will want to keep to the promise given by the government to the people.
