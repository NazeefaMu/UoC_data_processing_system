Thirteen petitions filed against 20th Amendment

 
Thirteen petitions have been filed against the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in Parliament today. 
He announced that the Supreme Court has sent him copies of 13 petitions filed against the 20th Amendment to the constitution.
The 20th amendment to the Constitution provides provisions for holding elections for all provincial Councils on the same day. 
However this piece of legislation had been rejected by North Central, Southern and Northern provincial councils. 
Government has also suggested an Amendment to the legislation under which it had proposed a time frame of one year to hold the provincial Council election within a year.
