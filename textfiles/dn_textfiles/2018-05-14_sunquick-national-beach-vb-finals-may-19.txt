Sunquick National Beach VB finals on May 19

Sunquick the renowned fruit drink has once again come together with the Sri Lanka Volleyball Federation to conduct the annual Sunquick National Beach Volleyball Championship finals on May 19 at the newly built artificial beach volleyball courts at Sugathadasa Stadium.
The Ministry of Sports had built this artificial beach volleyball court during the time they modified and re-laid the playing track.
The championship is organized by the Sri Lanka Volleyball Federation (SLVF) and the Sri Lanka Beach Volleyball Association (SLBVA).
In the U21 category Sri Lanka Air Force (Ashen Rashmika and Kavindu Malinda) and Davisamara SC (Rohan Madushanka and Mihiranga Udayakumara) advanced to the finals. In the girls event Air Force became champions after beating Galigamuwa SC 2-1 in the finals concluded last week.
In the open women’s final Sri Lanka Navy (Sagarika Gunasinghe and Kashmir Tharuka) faces Sri Lanka Army (Chathurika Madusani and Tamara Kumari) and in the open men’s final Sri Lanka Air Force (Pubudu Ekanayake and Sujeewa Chinthaka) take on Sri Lanka Army (Indika Tyron and Jayan Sanuja).
The first stages matches were played on 31 March and 1 April at the Kudapaduwa Beach Park, Negombo.
Speaking at a press conference president of SLVF Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Minister of Power and Renewable Energy said, “As a federation we have to be proud of ourselves for conducting such a tournament and inaugurating the first ever artificial volleyball beach court at the Sugathadasa Stadium. As a federation our main aim is to support and uplift the game across Sri Lanka.”
“After we took over the association we worked according to our annual work plan proposal. We want to thank CW Mackie PLC for coming forward to support sports like volleyball,” the Minister said.
In 2006 Sunquick initiated the beach volleyball tournament which was conducted for two years and later revived by the brand after a brief interlude. The opening stage saw 112 teams participating in all categories.
