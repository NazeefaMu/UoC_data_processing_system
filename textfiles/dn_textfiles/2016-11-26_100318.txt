Havies swamp CH 48/5

Havelocks Sports Club went on the rampage, when they ran circles against the luckless CH and FC outfit scoring a massive 48 points (8 tries, 4 conversions) to 5 (1 try) victory in their first round Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club league rugby match played at Havelock Park yesterday.
The winners led 31-5 at lemons.
The entire Havies team got their act together from the word ‘go’ by scoring a total of eight superb tries, five in the first half and three in the second for which the sorry CH side had no answers.
They were a really lost unit throughout the entire game.
For the winning Havelock’s side the tries were scored by hooker Prasath Madusanka (two), full back Dulaj Perera (two), scrum half Vimukthi Rahula (two), prop forward Liston Flatney (one) and flanker Shenal Deelaka (one). Dulaj Perera slotted in four conversions.
For CH scrum half Andrew Benson scored the solitary try.
