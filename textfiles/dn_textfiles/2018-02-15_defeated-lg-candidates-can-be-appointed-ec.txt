Defeated LG candidates can be appointed - EC

“Elections Commission has declared that a candidate who was defeated at the LG polls can be appointed to the respective local body through the additional list. There are legal allocations for such cases and however, it has to be officially approved by the respective Secretary of that recognized political party.
However, persons whose names that are not in the proposed list that was given to the Election Commission earlier, cannot apply to be considered for the posts of councilors of local bodies under any circumstances, said a senior official of the Kurunegala District Deputy Elections Commissioner’s Office yesterday (14) when he was contacted by Daily News.
