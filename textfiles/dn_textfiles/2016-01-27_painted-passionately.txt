Painted passionately

The Artist Jayani Pinnawale says: "When I look back after so many years at painting. I get quite a satisfaction and contentment from my creation of Art. I feel proud and honored when critics on Art say that I have excelled in both painting and writing."
Jayani has always attempted to create an enchanting world through her painting which would bring happiness to the Art lovers. Her painting speaks of beauty of life, the serenity of environment, the unforgettable expressions of people, the lovable and graceful existence of animals and birds and the beauty of flowers.
Jayani's use of vivid colours and shadows enhance the depth and the natural image of the painting 'Blues and Blues' one of her new paintings. She has used mostly blue colour and without using green which she thinks is a good experience.
The whole painting including water, trees and bushes are painted only in blue.
In some paintings she uses only a few colours, sometimes two colours, sometimes two or three colours to complete the creation. The colours used in the background of painting 'In sorrow' brings out the feeling of sadness . 'Helplessness' is a painting of an elderly woman which was done during the Tsunami disaster.
When traveling to other countries she takes her time off to visit museums, and places that display painting.
Jayani's latest exhibition titled as 'Reflections in Color' will be held at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery from February 1 to 3 from 9.30 am to 7.30 pm.
