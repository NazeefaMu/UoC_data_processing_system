CH17 Loyalty inks deal with MyDeal.lk

In a bid to expand the retail merchant network and provide a wider choice of products with a multitude of great deals to its membership, CH17 has entered into a partnership with MyDeal.lk.
CH17 operates its Loyalty Schemes on an Open platform model where loyalty programs are managed for different cluster groups as well as for customised clientele.
CH17’s pioneering Loyalty Program Ransalu Privilege Cards exclusively for the employees and staff of factories and companies in the Apparel Sector enters its fourth year this month. This program has been well accepted by the employers as well as their staff.
“This is yet another way of rewarding the employees and their families, they enjoy concessionary prices on many daily consumer essentials such as groceries, clothing and footwear, household and hardware items etc., from a host of partner merchants” Jumar Preena, CEO of CH17 said.
Focused consumer groups are an ideal “hunting ground” for smart retailers.  Our strategic online partnership with Mydeal.lk, MyStore.lk and Myfare.lk has made the program more colorful and is definitely a value addition, he added.
Mehraj Sally Group Director and CMO of MyDeal.lk Group said “We are delighted to partner with CH17. Their diverse consumer groups who hold these Membership Cards will now enjoy an additional 5% discount over and above the daily deal prices. The new loyalty card planned will take these benefits to the SME Sector and we are happy to support this sector. ”
The exchange of Agreements took place at the Industry and Commerce Ministry Offices in the presence of Rishad Bathiudeen, Minister of Industry and Commerce and M. A. Thajudeen, Additional Secretary to the Ministry.
