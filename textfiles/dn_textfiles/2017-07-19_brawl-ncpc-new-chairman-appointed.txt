Brawl at the NCPC: New Chairman appointed

The North Central Provincial Council (NCPC) meeting ended in fisticuffs between government and Opposition members yesterday with a new Chairman from the United national Party (UNP) being appointed. D.M. Amaratunga was appointed as the Councils Chairman.
The issue erupted following the refusal to take up a no-confidence motion against Chairman T.M.R. Siripala.
The debate on the no confidence motion was in the day’s agenda, despite which government members raised privilege issues.
The Chairman requested government Chief Whip Kalyani Karliyadda to move the adjournment motion giving rise to pandemonium. Opposition members obstructed the removal of the mace and grappled with government members to take charge of the mace. During the melee, it fell on the ground and was damaged. Following the Chairman walking out, UNP member D.M. Amaratunga reconvened the meeting and took up the no confidence motion which was unanimously adopted by the members present. Thereafter the meeting was adjourned till 2 p.m yesterday.Thereafter 50 members in the UPFA group took the mace to be kept in the chairman’s room.
A special police team was deployed to provide security inside the council premises.
