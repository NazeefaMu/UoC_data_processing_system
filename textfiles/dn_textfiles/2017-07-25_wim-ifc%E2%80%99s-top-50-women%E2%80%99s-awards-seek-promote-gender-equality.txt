WIM, IFC’s Top 50 women’s awards seek to promote gender equality

Promoting gender equality among the women closest to you; your wife, your sister, your daughter, can lead to significant change in the landscape of a country. Sri Lanka especially needs this change, as the constraints restricting women’s participation in the labor force are behavioral and social in nature, according to Dr. Idah Z. Pswarayi-Riddihough, World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
Dr. Pswarayi-Riddihough was speaking at the recent ‘Top 50’ Professional and Career Women Awards 2017, where women business leaders, both corporate and small and medium entrepreneurs, as well as women in the public sector and civil society, were recognized for their achievements. The event was held at the Taj Samudra.
The awards were presented by Women In Management (WIM), in partnership with IFC, a member of the World Bank Group.
“This award is not just a personal achievement, it’s for the nation, for our future generations. I have been traveling for the last few years to many neighbouring countries as a guest speaker for Women in Business and I regret to say that only Sri Lankan women are uncomfortable receiving awards. Everywhere else, women are so competitive. They believe in themselves, and that they deserve to be recognized. They believe they can be the nation’s mentors. Sri Lanka’s women leaders too should endeavor to win awards, to motivate and mentor the next generation following them,” said Dr. Sulochana Segera, Founder of Women in Management.
Held for the seventh consecutive year, the ‘Top 50’ Professional and Career Women Awards 2017 were presented by WIM in partnership with IFC.
