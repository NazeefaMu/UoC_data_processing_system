Saudi-funded epilepsy hospital opened in Colombo today

 
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena opened a 242-bed epilepsy hospital, which is fully funded by the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), in Colombo, today.
The Rs.100 million ($26.7 million), 10-story hospital consists of a surgical theater, an intensive care unit, a high-dependency unit, 242-bed male and female wards, and an auditorium for capacity building for the country’s medical staff.
The SFD recently financed an additional Rs.48 million to buy all necessary equipment including a CT scanner, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment, physical therapy devices and medical furniture.
A four-member SFD delegation has left to Colombo to take part in the event, which will also be attended by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
The Saudi team comprises Fawzi Al-Saud, director general of operations; Abdulla Al-Shedokhi, adviser; Bandar Al-Otaibi, engineer from the technical department; and Meshal Al-Najashi, loan researcher at the legal department.
Sri Lankan Ambassador Azmi Thassim told Arab News that SFD's support helped fulfill a long-standing need of the island nation.
He recalled that the fund has been supporting Sri Lankan projects for more than three decades.
“We were able to complete major projects such as the Kinniya bridge with its assistance,” he added.
