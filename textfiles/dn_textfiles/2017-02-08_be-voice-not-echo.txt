Communication is one of the most important and reliable business skills, no matter what your industry is. Yet many of us have not been trained how to communicate with co-workers and clients. Every word repeated must have sense.
Equal attention
While communicating in an organization the first priority will be the people within the organization, it means the employees. The rankings start from the CEO and the Board of Directors, Senior Managers, Executives and Staff. The staff too will be split as minor staff and labourers. You will communicate with outsiders as well.
The most important people are the customers who visit your organization on business transactions. Then there are visitors who comes frequently or once in a way for meetings and other work. These are the types of people you communicate within your daily routine. Pay equal attention to all types of people you communicate with. Do not categorize. Create a positive attitude towards all.
Communicating effectively with all these types of people has to be dealt clearly and carefully. Keep in mind that all are not the same. They have their ways of presenting and speaking. Questioning and answering. As such you have to be eager how you communicate with these types of people. First listen to them while they speak. Make them feel that you respect them and are making every effort to full-fill their requirement.
Listening combines directly with communication. This is a skill which is extremely important in communication. When you listen carefully you can attend to the said task well. If your thoughts run-out when someone is speaking you will be lacking of information. Focus on what is said. Take other things out of your mind when someone is communicating with you verbally. The human mind is easily distracted by other thoughts, Try to put other thoughts out of mind and concentrate on the message that are being communicated
Facial expressions
Be a good listener while speaking to a person of any level or standard. Then be of assistance and support to them. Listening combined through facial expressions too has to be taken into consideration when communicating with all types of people. Sometimes you will be speaking to a person that you do not like speak or sight. Then what will be the situation? Do not be confused or puzzled. Take it easy. You must go ahead.
Everyone cannot be in line when it comes to vocabulary. Some are smart enough to add, adjust and make their way to fulfill their communication standards. As such to be effective in your communications use words that can be easily understood. Try to avoid jaw breaking words or words you think it is difficult for you to pronounce. If it takes place you can be misunderstood and there will be no sense of what you have communicated throughout. Explaining and explanations are of waste of your precious time. As such better to try-up with common and normally used words combined to a sentence.
Ensure that you are confident while you communicate. Do not be uncertain while you respond. Confidence is always mastered while you are communicating. You should be strong enough to communicate at a stretch without doubt. Avoid the words such as "um" or "‘ah".
Every word repeated must have sense. Word is the link of combination between the process or transaction of communication. It initiates response from the listener. “Word” though it represents only four letters, words are the symbolized power of communication, requiring us to be as highly reliant on how a person sounds and expresses themselves. You as a professional holding a responsible rank in your organization have to be very careful and more effective when you speak. Why should you be careful while communicating or speaking? As you must have a clear idea and you must be aware of what you are communicating or speaking about. Every word turned into a sentence becomes a speech and it is communication. It must have the required meaning. Be very polite and concerned when you speak to a person. It is professionalism. Do not nod or say ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ for everything which most of us think it is short and sweet. Your response in brief containing a few elegant words will create the required image to the person who speaks to you. This is applicable whether the person is live with you or he/she speaks to you over the phone.
Friendly voice
Another important fact to be careful is not become harsh or lose your temper. Patience is the most valued aspect while you speak. There may be times a person shout or snub you. Do not do the same. Be calm or try to be calm. It is difficult. But under certain circumstances you have to do it.
A word can mean a different thing when said in a different tone of voice. Make sure you use the appropriate tone of voice to communicate so that you won’t be misunderstood and discourage. Voice and expressions accompanied by you has to sparkle and shine while you speak or communicate. A passionate and a friendly tone of voice can make your seem more comfortable. It is an attraction! You will somewhat be recognized in the society the way you present your communication skills and ways. Elaborating communication further many of us most of the time listen halfheartedly to many people we meet, we prefer and like to pay attention to a friendly and a powerful voice than to a voice that is dull, monotone, frustrated and angry. Taking these emeralds to shine brighter it is your concern to focus more on your tone of voice and such can be attained with ease with just a little experimentation and practice.
This involves speaking clearly, naturally, with confidence, and without any nerves constricting your voice. The opposite would include shouting or screaming, speaking too quickly, mumbling, and sounding urgent or irritated. Another way to sound passion and power is the way of speaking from the heart.
