Consultant Gynaecologist debunks claims about “sterilization pill”

There is no “sterilization pill” invented in the world that could make a woman or man infertile by one intake, GMOA Vice President and Consultant Gynaecologist at the National Cancer Institute, Maharagama Dr. Sarada Kannangara said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said fear mongering over mixing sterilizing drugs with food has no scientific base and brushed aside the claims as a canard. At the same time he pointed out that there are much bigger issues people need to worry about, such as the food they consume when it comes to human fertility.
“Heavy metals such as Cadmium, Mercury etc., are risk factors for infertility. It has been researched that the continual exposure to such heavy metals can cause reproductive problems. It has been found out that, plastic water bottles (BPA) can cause infertility in males and if the bottles are exposed to the sun the risk is higher. Various food additives and substances added to artificial food, soft drinks and various types of sauce are also risk factors to infertility. Not only infertility, they can also carry abortion risks. These are serious matters people need to pay attention to and correct their food patterns,” he commented.
“Besides that, there is no ‘pill’ which could make you barren tomorrow by mixing with the food you take today,” he explained.
