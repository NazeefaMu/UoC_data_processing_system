Skillfully designed!

C Plus Design is an in-house powerhouse providing consultancy addressing all aspects of architectural design including planning, space programing, interior designing and project management, and are catered to by a team of architects, interior designers, civil engineers, MEP Consultants, quantity surveyors and project managers. Daily News speaks to Chinthaka Dayaratne the innovative leader in charge of C Plus Design on its commitment to design excellence.
“At C Plus we undertake the consultancy part of the architectural design. A customer will come with an idea and we will develop it. We have the entire resources available with us to fulfill their consultancy requirements. We have the professional body in-house to fulfill the clients’ requirements. C Plus is seven to eight years old and we have a staff that is very committed and dedicated,” said Dayaratne.
The goal of C Plus is doing elegant and simple designs. They feel that there has to be a simplicity and elegance to the design. That is their aim and philosophy.
“We basically design for the budget. This ensures that throughout the project there will be no hassle to anyone. We are with the client throughout the project. We have all the professionals in-house with us. In the field of consultancy you need to be creative. You need to be skillful to consult on the proper design. Soft skills are key to this field. You need to understand the client’s requirements. You need to be able to have architectural insight and find correct solutions. Being able to master time management and project managing is crucial to this area of architecture since time is of the paramount importance,” pointed out Dayaratne.
Dayaratne also said that in Consultancy you need to understand the behavior and lifestyle of the client and interpret it into the layout. A house and a home is different. A house is a structure. But to make it a home you have to add value to it.
“With limited time in Colombo you need to understand the internal dynamics of families. You need to understand the family’s weaknesses and strengths. How they also relate to each other is an important factor. You need to understand how people gather in spaces and how those spaces can be converted. You need to understand their habits and understand how they communicate with each other. But if you ask me what I always go for is spaces that are elegant and simple. So it is a challenge bringing all of this together, striking that perfect balance” explained Dayaratne.
Dayaratne was born to consult. From childhood he has always been creative and passionate.
“Being an architect is not an easy journey. You need patience, guts and skills. Patience is important because we are essentially dealing with human beings and you need to get onto the same page. You need to be able to finish the job while doing all the hard work. It takes a long time to succeed. Consultancy is an inborn talent combined with hard work. It can be developed through time working on the project,” stated Dayaratne.
Dayaratne pointed out that those in rural areas have no or little idea of architecture. He states that there are plenty of people in the field who in reality should not be in architecture. The architect has been trained and is qualified to do the job. But there are those in Vastu and Feng Shui. Basically is it not quite professional, he adds.
“What C Plus wants to do is to bring an element of professionalism into the field. However another problem we encounter is doing the project management in the country. This is where we normally get stuck. The professional labor is not available in the country. In the past there were carpenters, masons, laborers and painters who were thoroughly professional about their subject. But now they have diverted to other fields. So most of the people who can do the execution part are not in the country.
Our policy is that we will be there through the project from inception to the end. We do not leave the client in the lurch. After the design consultancy, the execution is done by a contractor. The contractor needs enough people to carry out the work. So because of lack of man power when it comes to project management we all get stuck,” explained Dayaratne.
With the younger generation coming into architecture the profession must be filled with properly qualified people.
“Trust is important to me in our field. This is because word of mouth is essential in our profession. You need to build up a good reputation. We must be firm that people who are not qualified should not be practicing in our field. I said before and must reiterate, most people do not realize the value and potential of architecture. We need to let the professionals handle the job. Architecture is a very logical subject and the architect is trained to think logically and analytically.
There are opportunities and scope in this field. It has potential depending from within – your mindset and how you want to move forward. No matter where you are in this world, the field of consultancy has potential,” said Dayaratne.
