Water cut in Kalutara district

A 15-hour water cut will be imposed in several areas in the Kalutara District from 8.30 am on November 27, owing to essential maintenance work of the Ceylon Electricity Board, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) said yesterday.
The areas that would be affected by the water disruption are Wadduwa, Waskaduwa, Pothupitiya, Kalutara, Katukurunga, Nagoda, Payagala, Pilaminawaththa, Bombuwala, Maggona, Beruwala, and surrounding areas.
The NWSDB requested the public to use water sparingly.
