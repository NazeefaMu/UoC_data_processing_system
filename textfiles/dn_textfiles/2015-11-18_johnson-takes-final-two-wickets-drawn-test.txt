Johnson takes final two wickets in drawn Test

Perth, Tuesday: Retiring Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson claimed the last two wickets as the second Test against New Zealand ended in a draw at the WACA Ground in Perth on Tuesday.
The home side declared at 385 for seven after lunch, leaving the Kiwis needing an unlikely 321 to win from 48 overs to level the series, at almost seven runs per over. A shower delayed play for about an hour and the Kiwis showed little appetite for the chase when they resumed in a match dominated by the bat on a lifeless pitch.
When stumps was called early with 20 overs left, the Kiwis were 104 for two, with Ross Taylor on 36 and Kane Williamson on 32.
Having won the first Test by 208 run at the Gabba, the result means Australia have retained the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy.
Australian captain Steve Smith said he would have liked to set a more attacking target for the Kiwis, but their good bowling on the final morning had put paid to that ambition.
"It would have been nice to have set about 360 off 65-70 overs," he said. "I thought they bowled really well again this morning so it was tough to get that far ahead in the game.
"The wicket was still really good and I didn't want to give them too much of a sniff."
Kiwi captain Brendon McCullum said the target was a "bridge too far" for his side.
“After Kane and Ross’s innings it would have felt pretty hollow to come out with at least a draw in this match," he said.
“The wicket was good, but there was still an element of vulnerability with those cracks especially if our lower order was exposed.”
