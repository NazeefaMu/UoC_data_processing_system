Strands  of hope

Compassion is infectious. One kind act inspires another. The more you give the more you receive. Such words held together a group of youth as they watched their lustrous locks go under the blades of a scissor and fall to the ground for a cause – cancer. For them, this one act, they felt, could inspire many to donate their tresses to make wigs for those who are undergoing chemotherapy that results in hair loss.
The Cancer Care Trust and Ramani Fernando Salons have come up with a project to aid cancer patients by providing them with a wig free of charge. The project which generated much enthusiasm was launched on July 20. Around 20 hair donors and volunteers from Cancer Care Trust stepping up to go for the chop for this worthy cause. The first wig of the campaign was offered to 13-year-old K Prashanthini from Pudalu Oya, Nuwara Eliya, who had undergone chemotherapy. She attended the event with her family.
This tale of locks and love is an offshoot of the ‘Indira’s Love’ project. The brainchild of Dr Lanka Dissanayake, the daughter of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, ‘Indira’s Love’ was named in memory of her sister, Indira Jayasuriya, who has passed away from breast cancer in November 2016. She had suffered from hair loss during the latter stages of her life. A wig had been made for her but she did not get a chance to use it. The family had later donated the wig to a child who had been undergoing treatment at the Maharagama Cancer Hospital. Losing her air has added to the trauma she had to undergo. The wig has consoled her a great deal. This experience has inspired the hair donation campaign.
“Our research showed that many cancer patients lose their hair due to the first dose of treatment. People, especially women, are concerned about their looks. It boosts their self confidence. We decided to donate wigs as a means of boosting their belief in themselves,” Dr Dissanayake said.
Though this is the first time that a project of this nature has been introduced in Sri Lanka it is a popular movement in countries abroad. Since there are no such campaigns in local soil some Sri Lankans tend to cut off their locks and send them to countries like the USA or UK so that wigs can be made for cancer patients.
“Wigs made of natural human hair are very costly. 500g of natural hair costs around Rs 70, 000. It takes around two lakhs to make a wig. However our wig maker, Lalith Dharmawardana, will be giving us the product at a concession rate of Rs 25, 000 each,” she said.
Ramani Fernando Salons is engaged in the campaign free of charge. A donor can walk into any of the 14 branches and get a free hair cut and blow dry. The cut hair will be donated for the cause and the donor will receive a certificate of appreciation on the day of the donation.
“The response for the campaign has been amazing. The campaign went viral a week before it was launched and ever since it took off we have had donors rushing into our salons vying to be a part of this worthy cause. We have cut 1225 heads of hair so far. Everyone from children to middle aged and the elderly and men with long locks have shown their enthusiasm towards project. The staff has been working tirelessly and with a lot of passion shampooing, conditioning and cutting off the hair and styling it to suit the donor. It is two hours of hard work but they have embraced the work with zeal,” CEO and founder of Ramani Fernando Salons, Ramani Fernando said.
Speaking to Daily News TnC founder of Cancer Care Trust Dr Samadhi Rajapaksha noted that donors from the entire community sans religion or ethnicity have flocked together to take part in the campaign.
“We have collected around 87 kilos of hair during the past two weeks. Those who do not have long hair to donate have inquired if they can help mandatorily.
“The media too has been very responsive. The campaign made us realize that people who are willing to take part in a good cause are always present,” he noted.
Lalith Dharmawardana is dubbed the only human hair wig manufacturer in Sri Lanka. He notes that being a part of this campaign is the highlight of his 42 years in the film industry as a hairdresser.
“We used to purchase wigs made with natural hair for films. I would visit Chennai, India, and sit down witn the wig makers till they made the wig according to my requirements. I gained this knowledge by observing their work,” Dharmawardana explained.
He adds that making a wig out of natural human hair is no walk in the park. One needs to match the cancer patient’s hair texture with that of the donor’s.
“You can proceed after this. Most of the wigs found in Sri Lanka are syntactic. It takes around 14 days to make a wig. I already have 11 people working under me but the response is such that we need more people to manufacture the wigs. To combat this issue we decided to train house maids to make wigs so that they can engage in wig making leisurely at home. We are currently training six of them,” he said adding that it usually takes around 300g to make a wig.
“There is a certain amount of wastage which cannot be avoided. We do not use ammonia on the product in any manner since cancer patients are allergic to it. We had to make the first wig within two days for the launch of the campaign. We have donated several wigs so far and it is heartening to see the response from the patients. They blessed us for our kindness. I am grateful to Dr Lanka Dissanayake, Dr. Samadhi Rajapaksha and his wife, Nisansala, and Ramani Fernando for laying their trust in me and engaging me in this worthy deed,” He added.
The hair donation campaign is ongoing. Anyone interested in donating hair, in sponsoring a wig or in need of a wig, can call the HopeLine-0112363211 of the Cancer Care Trust for further inquiries.

Pointers to keep in mind when donating your hair 
 u You must have at least 8 inches of hair. u There is no maximum length you can donate. u Before donation the hair has to be cleaned with no oil, hair spray, hair gel, mousse or any other material. So clean, shampoo and condition hair without any styling, hair spray or additional hair products one day prior to the cut. u The hair has to be dry before cutting for donation. u The hair has to be in a ponytail or braid. u Hair that is coloured or permed is acceptable. u Grey hair is acceptable. u Layered hair is acceptable if the shortest layer is eight inches. u Curly hair may be pulled straight to measure the minimum 8 inches.
 Prepare your hair for future donation
 u Use a conditioner after every wash to help keep hair moisturized and protected against damage. u Don’t use a brush on wet hair when you step out of the shower. Once hair is washed and conditioned, use a comb with smooth, wide-set teeth to gently detangle hair, working from tip to root. u Do not blow-dry soaking wet hair immediately. To expedite your blow-out process and help prevent thermal damage, towel wrap your hair for 10-15 minutes and remove excess water before using a blow- dryer. u Do not over brush hair as this can lead to breakage. Regular, gentle brushing promotes hair health and natural oil distribution. u Oil your hair frequently.
