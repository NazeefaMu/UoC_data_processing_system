Korean experts call on acting Fisheries Minister

A team of Korean experts engaged in a feasibility study to establish Sri Lanka’s three multi-purpose fisheries harbours called on Acting Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi at the ministry for discussions on the programme recently.
This is a sequel to Acting Minister Wedaarachchi’s recent tour of South Korea. The multi-purpose fisheries harbours will be set up at Udappuwa, Chalai, Madagal Delft and Tangalle, a ministry release said.
