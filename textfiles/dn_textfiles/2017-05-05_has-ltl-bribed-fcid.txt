Has LTL bribed FCID?

A doubt arises whether the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) is bribed by the Lanka Transformers Limited (LTL), Voice Against Corruption Movement Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe said.
He said the LTL could bribe the FCID to prevent the complaints lodged against the LTL about the large scale financial frauds from execution.
He was addressing the media after lodging a complaint with the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat against the LTL over the alleged financial frauds.
“Sixty three percent shares of the LTL is owned by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and dividends are yet to be received by the CEB from the profits earned by the LTL” Samarasinghe said.
He said the LTL higher-ups had been allegedly distributing the LTL profits amongst themselves. He requested to take measures to trace such efforts.
