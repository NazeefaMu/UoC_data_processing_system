ACMC lodges complaint with Police HQ

The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) members Deputy Minister Ameer Ali and Party Secretary S.Subairdeen lodged a complaint with the Colombo Police HQ on the alleged plot against its leader, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen yesterday.
He said despite details of a plot to assassinate Commerce and Industries Minister Rishad Bathiudeen being exposed, the authorities had failed to take any steps to address this issue, said ACMC Chairman and Fishery, Aquatic Resources Deputy Minister Ameer Ali.
The complaint states, “Reports on an alleged plot to assassinate the Leader of ACMC Rishad Bathiudeen by a Director of ‘Dushana Virodhi Balakaya’ Namal Kumara, former TID DIG Nalaka Silva and a resident in France, Thushara Peiris have been aired in the recent weeks by local TV channels, news media and web media. “A taped conversation between the Director of the ‘Dushana Virodhi Balakaya’ Namal Kumara and the resident in France Thushara Peiris, that was aired many times by the Channels mentions about the assassination of Minister Rishad Bathiudeen during a ceremony in Batticaloa.
“Also accusations have been made saying that the French resident Thushara Peiris has provided funding/financing to the Director of ‘Dushana Virodhi Balakaya’ Namal Kumara to assassinate Minister Rishad Bathiudeen and place the blame on it on the Tamil Community.”
