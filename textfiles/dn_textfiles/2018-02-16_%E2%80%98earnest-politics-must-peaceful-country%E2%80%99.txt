‘Earnest politics, a must for peaceful country’

Engaging in politics, in whatever capacity, is the same as paving a road to the underworld. Where politicians are concerned, except for a few individuals, all others are hypocrites and thieves. The number of honest politicians is insignificant, said Ruwanweli Chaithyaramadhikari Chief Sanghanayaka in Nuwarakalaviya Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera.
According to the results of the recent local government polls, it was reported that 26 Bikkhus have been voted into local government bodies. The Nayaka Thera said, personally, he was against any Bikkhu from getting involved in politics, even as an independent candidate. "Unending chaos will descend upon this country until a people-friendly, spiritually-advanced political stream replaces the present corrupt politics. The wise shall understand this situation."
"We should endow a fair and civilized country to future generations. Bikkhus currently engaging in politics should understand this and perform their duties according to the teachings of the Buddha," Hemarathana Nayaka Thera added.
