Du Plessis injures right shoulder – may miss fourth ODI

South African captain Faf du Plessis who injured his right shoulder while fielding during the third ODI against Sri Lanka at the Pallekele International Stadium on Sunday is currently receiving treatment according to Lerato Malekutu, media manager of the team.
Du Plessis had to leave the field midway during the Sri Lankan innings after attempting a catch at square leg offered by Thisara Perera in the tenth over and the captaincy duty was entrusted to wicket-keeper/batsman Quinton de Kock.
Du Plessis underwent surgery on his right shoulder late last year before the Indian series.
With South Africa already having secured the five-match series with a 3-0 lead there is a likelihood that they would not want to risk playing Du Plessis and may rest him for Wednesday’s fourth ODI – a night game which will be played at the same venue.
South Africa are also likely to give a match to some of the other players in the ODI squad who has not had an opportunity in the series like Junior Dala, Hienrich Klaasen and Keshav Maharaj.
