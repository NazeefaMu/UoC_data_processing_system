Schoolchildren affected by dengue increase by 20%

The Health Ministry yesterday said that there is a significant 20% rise in schoolchildren infected by the current dengue epidemic.
The Health Ministry requests all parents of schoolchildren to apply mosquito repellants on the skin of their children before sending them to the school or tuition classes. The Health Ministry said that the surge in the increase of schoolchildren infected by dengue is due to the dengue mosquitoes being active from 6.00 am and 9.00 am during the day.
A school cleaning programme has already been initiated from 11.00 am to 12.00 noon every day by the education Ministry and the Health Ministry.
