Fake creams worth Rs. 15.7 m found in Kolonnawa warehouse

Officers of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) commenced a probe into one of the largest cosmetics contraband stocks detected at a warehouse in Kolonnawa.
The CAA seized counterfeit cosmetics (mainly skin cream) worth around Rs 15.7 million which if released to the market could have posed a serious health risk for the consumers.
“These fake creams could have resulted in skin issues and injuries. CAA officers prevented it,” Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
The minister said: “I commend two young CAA investigation officers who completed this risky task.
“The raid at Kolonnawa warehouse was led by two CAA officials who were tipped off on the illicit operation which was carried out from the warehouse at Wennawatte, Wellampitiya.
The CAA teams had found the same cream in bulk were re-packaged into smaller retail packs of different Commercial Brands-“Golden Pearl”, “Pai Me” and “Goree (Made in Pakistan)”, among others.
Some packs of cream were also labeled “Seaweed Element-Whitening Anti-Spot Cream” in English and priced at Rs 650 each.
Some retail packs were advertised “7 Days Freckle removing” on the label as well.
At the warehouse, the CAA found sub-standard creams in bulk packs that were printed in Chinese characters.
There were no import documents or proof of country of origin.
The suspected individual in charge of the operation also failed to produce any documents showing the location of production of the cosmetics (locally or abroad), product registration certificates or even registration numbers (which is also not found in any labels).
The bulk creams were found in new large cardboard boxes, neatly stacked in shelves at the warehouse. In 2014, CAA netted 100,000 fake black henna packets in Grandpass, Colombo. The 100,000 packets were branded and printed showing a locally reputed brand name but the henna inside was switched with a substandard, adulterated dye powder. This stock was valued at Rs 13 million.
In November 2016, the CAA was informed of the use of adulterated and expired cosmetics in many salons around the country. CAA raided 107 beauty and hair salons in Kandy, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Matara, and Puttalam Districts and detected expired cosmetics in 67 salons.
In the wake of the latest detection, the CAA once again warned consumers to be cautious of fake cream products.
