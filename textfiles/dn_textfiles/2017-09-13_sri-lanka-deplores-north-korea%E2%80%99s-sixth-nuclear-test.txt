Sri Lanka deplores North Korea’s sixth nuclear test

Sri Lanka deplores the sixth nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) on September 3.
This act, which is in repeated violation of UN Security Council Resolutions, threatens peace and stability in the region and beyond, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Sri Lanka joins the international community in urging the DPRK to refrain from further action of this nature to comply with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and to resume dialogue, facilitating the peaceful resolution of issues which would be in the interest of peace and the wellbeing and prosperity of the people of DPRK and the region.
While welcoming the latest resolution adopted by the UN Security Council on September 11, the Government of Sri Lanka reiterates its commitment to abiding by its obligations with respect to the implementation of UN Security Council decisions.
