Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un make history
Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un shared warm words and a historic handshake on Tuesday (June 12) as they held an unprecedented Summit to confront a decades-old nuclear stand-off and enmity stretching back to the cold-war.
The two men clasped hands beneath the white-washed walls of an upscale hotel in neutral Singapore, before sitting down for a half-day of meetings with major ramifications for the region and the world.
The extraordinary encounter saw the leader of the world’s most powerful democracy shake hands with the third generation scion of a dynamic dictatorship, standing as equals in front of their nations’ flags.
The two men signed a joint statement at the Capella resort. The agreement reaffirms an earlier declaration signed between North and South Korea, and commits the north to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
We all have to learn a lesson from this meeting.
Our leaders should think about this incident. We are always fighting for power.
To develop our political party, to win the next general election, to win the next presidential election, to win the next provincial council election, to become a member of the parliament, to become a state minister, to become a deputy minister, to become a Cabinet minister, to become the prime minister.
We are always divided. Whatever government proposes, the opposition will object. If it is a proposal to increase the benefits of MPs all will agree and support. We don’t keep the country before other things. We always keep the country in the second or third place.
We have to learn from Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un how to take decisions for the benefit of their countries and the world.
They are real leaders. They do not keep on fighting. They are ready to forget the past and do something for the benefit of their countries.
