Sajith confirms PM offer

United National Party Deputy Leader and former Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa on Wednesday confirmed that President Maithripala Sirisena requested him to accept the Premiership.
“There was a request from President Sirisena to accept the Premiership under the former government but I did not do so as it is against my policy,” Premadasa said.
 Earlier, addressing a public rally near the Parliament Roundabout, the President disclosed that he had offered the Prime Minister’s post first to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and then to Premadasa, but both had declined the offer.
Premadasa stated this in reply to a question raised by a journalist at a press conference held at Temple Trees on Wednesday.
Premadasa said that they had discussions with President for the previous government to go ahead by rectifying their faults.
His wish was to see the President and the Prime Minister working together to make the Good Governance Government a success.
However he added he was not aware whether these efforts were successful or not as those were held at the leaders’ level.
