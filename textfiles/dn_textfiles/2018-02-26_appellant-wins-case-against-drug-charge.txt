Appellant wins case against drug charge

Galle High Court Judge Manjula Thilakaratne ruled that the Ahangama Police could not file action against a suspect for drug-related offences in a case involving illicit transport of liquor.
The judgement was delivered at the hearing of an appeal challenging an order given by the Galle Magistrate’s Court on April 28, 2017.
In this case, a resident of Koggala in Ahangama had been arrested by the Ahangama Police while he was allegedly transporting a load of beer in a three-wheeler from Ahangama town to Welhengoda without a valid permit. The incident took place on March 28, 2017.
Following the arrest, Ahangama Police produced the suspect before the Galle Magistrate under Article 46 of the Excise Ordinance. The respondent’s counsel, raising preliminary objections, told the Magistrate’s Court that the Police was not legally empowered to file action with regard to a drug-related offence, in this case. He cited the Ahangama Police and the Attorney General as respondents.
Attorney-at-law Thusitha Walagama looked after the interests of the appellant, while State Counsel K.T. Indika appeared for the Attorney General.
