`Launches new collection

BOSS joins forces with artist Jeremyville on a new collection and campaign for the holiday season. Sleek BOSS design collides with playful Jeremyville artwork in a limited-edition collection, featuring a cityscape inhabited by a unique cast of characters.
New York-based artist, product designer and author Jeremyville has garnered international and critical acclaim for his playful and thought-provoking imagery created in a distinctive, cartoon style. He has created one of his signature cityscapes exclusively for the BOSS holiday campaign.
The bustling metropolis is a city that doesn’t sleep – especially when there are gifts to be found and night after night of celebrations to attend. The four inhabitants represent a playful take on traditional holiday preparations. The lead characters include his now iconic bunny, and, to celebrate Chinese New Year, a pig.
These bold designs are printed in bright color on leather sandals, backpacks, document holders and phone cases. The HUGO BOSS logo and Jeremyville illustrations meet, as the cityscape is printed over a fully monogrammed Italian coated-canvas backpack.
In a more understated interpretation, the characters are printed into leather accessories, leaving a relief design. A grainy leather backpack showcases
the Jeremyville bunny, a sleek sneaker is detailed with a raised pig motif, and sartorial loafers feature an all-over embossed cityscape. Small accessories including phone cases and leather luggage tags also feature in the collection.
The individual characters come into their own as key charms and figurines. Available as single pieces, the figurines are also stackable, creating a new totem-like take on the Christmas tree.
The BOSS x Jeremyville Holiday Collection is now available at BOSS Store, Arcade Independence Square.
