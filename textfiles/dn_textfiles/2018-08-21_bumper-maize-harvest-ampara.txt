Bumper maize harvest in Ampara

Farmers in the Ampara area are reaping a bumper maize harvest at present. Maize is cultivated around the Maha Oya and sold in coastal areas of the Ampara district.
These seeds are sold by the Agriculture Department at subsidised rates with instructions and guidance provided to farmers.
In certain areas, farmers said that the profits derived from these crops are better than that derived from paddy cultivation which is subject to various pests and diseases. Meanwhile, villagers, especially farmers and housewives in Addalaichenai, Oluvil, Palamunai, Thiraikeni, Ashraff Nagar, Meelath Nagar and Alamkulam have to face the menace of monkeys attacking their cultivations and home gardens.
