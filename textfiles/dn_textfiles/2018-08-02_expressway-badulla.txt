Expressway to Badulla

According to RDA statistics, 80 percent of the construction of the Southern Expressway Extension project has been completed. The government expects to vest the Southern Expressway Extension (up to Mattala) with the public in early 2019.
The purpose of the Southern Expressway Extension is to link the Mattala airport and Hambantota harbour to Colombo city. As advantages of the Southern Expressway, the development indices (education, health, and agriculture) of the Southern Province and the Moneragala district will be improved.
The Southern Expressway Extension to Mattala would be a good development opportunity for the Hambantota, Moneragala and Badulla districts as well as for Embilipitiya and Sooriyawewa in the Sabaragamuwa Province. However, because of current road networks and transportation methods, the maximum benefits to the Badulla, Moneragala and Ampara districts are uncertain.
Hence the Uva - Ruhunu Linking Expressway would be a solution to get the maximum advantage out of the Southern Expressway for the Badulla, Moneragala, and Ampara districts.
The proposed expressway can be in sections, Mattala to Kudaoya via the existing Matara - Wellawaya (A1) highway and the four-lane expressway from Kudaoya to Nakkala -Moneragala via Buttala. Then Badulla can be accessed in less time via Badalkumbura and Passara towns. The Passara - Badulla road renovation is progressing. Vehicles to Moneragala and Ampara can turn toward Moneragala via Nakkala junction.
Even though the maximum advantage would be for the Badulla district, the proposed highway will be constructed entirely within the Moneragala district. Hence the feasibility of construction in Moneragala must be considered.
The length of the proposed expressway would be 40-55 km.
Selection of destination points
In this proposal, the destination points have been selected considering minimum environmental effects and existing geographical features. Kudaoya, Buttala and Nakkala are located less than 200 metres above MSL (mean sea level). Hence when considering the longitudinal profile along the proposed expressway axis, it is almost horizontal. To avoid the Yala National Park and other areas that elephant traverse, the best destination point is Kudaoya.
Yala National Park
For the Mattala to Kudaoya section, the existing Matara - Wellawaya road can be utilised. Or else, a new road can be developed for expressway vehicles, west of the existing A1 Road. The east corridor of the A1 Road shall not be developed because it is a boundary of the Yala National Park. Several points that elephants traverse are available between Kudaoya and Lunugamwehera for elephants to cross the Matara - Wellawaya (A1) road. Hence construction of a superway or expressway through the Yala National Park might be a disaster in the environmental sense. So the existing Matara - Wellawaya (A1) road can be used after engineering advancements.
Existing irrigation tanks
The Moneragala district is a major district enriched with a higher amount of functioning irrigation tanks. Moneragala, Wellawaya and Buttala are known for dairy farms, sugar production and agriculture. All the tanks are linked and interconnected. If a new road network is being developed, it will not negatively affect the existing lifestyle of the people or the irrigation system. Proper studies must be done at the feasibility study stage to protect the livelihood of the people in the region.
Availability of construction materials
Unlike in the case of the construction of the Southern Expressway, the construction materials (sand, soil, quarry products) are easily available in the Moneragala district. Hence the construction unit cost (cost per one km) of the Uva - Ruhunu Linking Expressway might be less than other expressways in Sri Lanka.
Development of Badulla - Passara road
Construction of an expressway to Badulla is a very costly option because of the geology and topography of the land. Hence, renovation of the Badulla - Passara road as an interchange or access road to the expressway would be the best solution to connect Badulla town to the proposed expressway.
In the pre-feasibility study stage, these factors should be considered: (1) engineering: selection of the expressway centre line, carriageway width and boundaries and the best destination locations minimising construction and other costs; (2) social: methods to minimise the damage to livelihood, available irrigation system, forest cover and animals.
[Benefits]
* Easy access to Badulla, Moneragala and Ampara from the Southern Expressway.
* Possibility of extension up to Ampara (at a later stage).
* Economic benefits of proximity to Hambantota harbour and Mattala airport for the Badulla, Moneragala and Ampara districts.
* Expedite the rate of development in education, health, and personal and social factors compared to the Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces.
* Development of the tourism and agriculture industries in the Uva and Eastern Provinces.
This is my concept and it is open for feasibility study to be modified, revised or changed according to technical, financial and social and environmental factors.
