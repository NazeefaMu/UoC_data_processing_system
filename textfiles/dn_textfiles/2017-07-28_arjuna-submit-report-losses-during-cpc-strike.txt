Arjuna to submit report on losses during CPC strike

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, observing that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has incurred huge losses and damages over the past few days, said he would furnish a report in that regard to the House shortly.
The minister was speaking at the Parliamentary debate on the Gazette Extraordinary issued by the President declaring supply and distribution of fuel as an essential public service.
“We issued the Gazette because we saw how the public have been inconvenienced due to the trade union action. The Government is grappling with issues such as the garbage disposal problem and dengue epidemic at the same time.
Had the oil crisis continued any longer, the day-to-day activities of the people could have been crippled. We are ready for discussions at any moment, and at the same time we are not hesitant to take swift action if the public is inconvenienced,” he said.
The Minister, reiterating that he is against “privatization”, however pointed out joint investment is necessary to develop certain sectors of the country.
“Keep aside your political motives when you are dealing with these matters. The petroleum strike could have been called off earlier than this, but some TU leaders acting as cat’s paw of certain rejected politicians did not allow that to happen,” the minister said.
“Hambantota oil tanks are not under the CPC, but under the Ports Authority. With joint investment into them we can yield optimal results. I tried to explain this to the TUs. Some political figures with no vote base tried to mess up my work. I do politics with the people. Doing ministerial duties is not like doing betting and gaming. When I was holding the Port and Shipping Ministry I intervened to get that agreement amended to our advantage ,” he stated.
