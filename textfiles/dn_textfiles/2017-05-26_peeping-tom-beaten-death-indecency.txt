Peeping Tom beaten to death for indecency

A 50-year-old man who had allegedly followed a woman going to the toilet and behaved in an indecent manner by raising his sarong, had died after getting a severe beating by an onlooker, according to a report from Paradeniya, Ambanpitiya.
The deceased was identified as Mohamed Anzar who had been brought up in a Sinhala home from his childhood. The onlooker, 19, of the same village who later surrendered to Kegalle Police has been arrested by police. He had said sudden provocation led him to assault the deceased for trying to outrage the modesty of a woman but he had never intended to kill him.
Police investigations are continuing.
