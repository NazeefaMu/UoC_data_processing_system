Mervyn Silva sets up 'Joint Opposition'


The controversial former Minister Mervyn Silva yesterday announced that he was starting a political group called the ‘Joint Opposition’ with himself as its leader.
Addressing the media in Colombo, Silva said that his will be the bona-fide joint opposition unlike the group in Parliament with the same name, which he described as something unnecessary like the appendix in the body.
“The so-called joint opposition in Parliament is like the appendix in our body. Surgical removal of the appendix causes no health issues,” he added.
Silva also displayed a banner bearing the name ‘Joint Opposition’ and a symbol and claimed that he had wide support both in political circles and from the public. Silva said he will show his group’s strength in the days to come.
Silva said he does not intend to defame the senior politicians in the so-called ‘Joint Opposition’ supporting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and added that however, he firmly believed that the group was not doing anything progressive.
He was of the opinion that the group identifying themselves as the ‘Joint Opposition’ cannot use the term as they were UPFA Parliamentarians.
Silva also claimed that he had extensive knowledge about the Rajapaksas and added that there was no one in the so-called joint opposition to match his mastery in that respect.
Meanwhile, Silva said former President Rajapaksa instructed him to visit the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation in 2008, where a brawl occurred.
Silva with his supporters stormed into the news room and attacked the news director of the Rupavahini Corporation. The attack backfired when the employees manhandled him and held him hostage. The incident drew widespread condemnation.
