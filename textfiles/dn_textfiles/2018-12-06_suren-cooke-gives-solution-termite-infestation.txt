Suren Cooke gives solution for termite infestation

Despite high rise buildings being constructed with seemingly large and impenetrable concrete and steel structures, termites have found their way in. Termites have adapted well and survived amidst Sri Lanka’s urbanisation.
Suren Cooke Agencies have identified common entry points for termites to ingress and forage, causing damage to high risebuildings, furniture and fittings.
Suren Cooke Agencies have been in the forefront of helping the community in effective Pest Management and are equipped with the latest technology. Our expertise developed through overseas training, participation at International research sessions and work experience has rendered us the leaders in providing pest solutions, especially against termites, including the use of Termite Detection Camers and X-Term Termite Eradication Systems, to rid termites.
In addition to Termite Detection and treatment, Suren Cooke Agencies also specialises in fumigation of stored products, export commodities, aircraft and ships, thermal fogging against Mosquitoes, using truck mounted and portable forggers.
