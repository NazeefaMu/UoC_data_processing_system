Trade standoff hits US and China stocks

Stocks slumped on global markets on Tuesday as investors began to fear that the China-US trade dispute could erupt into an all-out trade war.
In China, Shanghai stocks tumbled 3.78 percent to a two-year low of 2,907.82, while Shenzhen was down 5.31 percent.
The selloff spread to other Asian markets and to Europe. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index finished 2.76 percent lower. Stock markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt declined.
In the US, all the major indices fell as the Dow Industrials lost 287.26 points or 1.15 percent to finish at 24,700.21, the average’s worst day this month, which pushed it slightly negative for the year.
As they did on Monday, US industrial companies including heavy equipment maker Caterpillar and aerospace company Boeing – the biggest US exporter to China –declined on Tuesday, dropping more than 3 percent each on the New York Stock Exchange. (Chinadaily.com)
