Pico Sri Lanka joins with Vision Care Nethralokana Sathkara Project

Sri Lanka’s premier eye-care specialist Vision Care celebrated its 25th anniversary on February 5. The significant milestone which has been reached by the best eye-care provider in the country is further commemorated through a series of events and CSR activities.
One such magnanimous venture is the Vision Care Nethralokana Sathkara Project. The pioneering initiative saw the distribution of 25,000 spectacles to the deserving folk in various parts of the island at zero cost, restoring their sight and putting a smile on their faces.
Following the tests which were conducted by qualified Optometrists at Vision Care in the host cities, the applicant will receive either a reading or prescribed pair of spectacles at the awarding event.
The benevolent scheme was launched as mega events targeting the main cities of Galle, Kandy, Kurunegala, Jaffna and Colombo, with parallel programmes being held in the regional cities and branches around these main cities which strengthened the projects island-wide reach.
The project which spanned over three months will culminate in a mega event in Colombo to signify the conclusion of the project which will be held in June and July at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre (SLECC) in Colombo.
SLECC (Pico Sri Lanka), which is nestled in the heart of Colombo, which is considered the business hub of the island, was established over two decades ago with the sole purpose of hosting a wide range of events. With extensive experience and know-how, SLECC (Pico Sri Lanka) is considered the number one location for events of magnitude and exhibitions which could accommodate a large capacity of people. The management of SLECC (Pico Sri Lanka) was inspired to come on-board as the Venue Partner for the Colombo Mega Event after witnessing the philanthropic effort initiated by Vision Care.
Expressing his views about their significant initiative, Vision Care Chairman/ Chief Executive Officer, Dasantha Fonseka said, “The culmination of this debut venture of significant proportion will result in enhancing the vision and the lives of the truly destitute. This prerogative of Vision Care has resulted in the awareness and education of vision impairment and preventable blindness among the hoi polloi. It further complements the Government’s goal to eradicate avoidable blindness from Sri Lanka by 2020 through ‘Vision 2020.”
