GMOA warns of continuous strikes over SAITM

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) along with the people's barricade against SAITM will launch island wide continuous strikes within the next two weeks if the government delays offering a solution to the SAITM issue, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that so far the government offered six different sets of proposals to solve the SAITM issue and all of them had been formulated in order to save the fraudulent institution and not to ensure the safety and well-being of the people. This action by the relevant authorities should be completely changed in order to solve the issue in a people friendly manner.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the GMOA has already revealed to the country about the persons who are intentionally preventing solving the issue. They prevent the President and Prime Minister from solving the issue. The statement made by the President on SAITM during media heads' meeting held recently is highly questionable. Nobody knows why the Government does not consider the technical facts and solutions presented by the Deans of state Medical faculties.
Six hundred days have passed since the medical students started a fast and over 7,000 medical students missed lectures for eight months by now. Doctors passed out from SLMC approved foreign medical faculties are waiting to sit for the Act 16 Examination. SAITM students are trapped inside SAITM for eight years. Granting intern appointments will be delayed for a long time and there will be no new doctors for the country, he added.
