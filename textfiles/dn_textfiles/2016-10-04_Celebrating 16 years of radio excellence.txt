Celebrating 16 years of radio excellence

Shree FM, recently marked its 16th anniversary with the participation of several high profile artists as well as an energized audience of over 100 loyal listeners. The celebration had over 50 local singers taking part, backed up by Shane Sing and his group ‘Line One’ at this fantastic, gala musical showcase.
This was just one of the lineup of events organized by Shree FM in their week-long 16th anniversary extravaganza, which included many events that enthralled Shree FM’s listenership, and in turn gave back to the wider community with CSR activities and a religious observance.
Shree FM’s very special “Salli Wessa” draw on August 16 at the Concord Hotel in Dehiwala, chose 16 audience members, out of a total of 100 invited to attend, lucky enough to enter the Salli Wessa money machine, ultimately walking away with as much cash as they could hold on to. At the same time, a number of gift packs were also given out throughout the night, contributing overall to an all-encompassing, fun-filled, audience-engaging event.
The Grand Draw for loyal Shree FM listeners was made even more special due to the participation of EAP Holdings Chairman/Managing Director Mano Tittawella, EBC Broadcasting Chairman Dr. Dayanath Jayasuriya, and EBC Radio Chief Operating Officer Chalaka Gajabahu. The audience was also thrilled to witness popular singing sensation Lahiru Perera on the day, during which he helped to choose the lucky draw winners.
“Shree FM 100 and 100.2 has carved a place for itself in our loyal listener’s hearts. We have dedicated all of this week’s celebrations to all our listeners who have truly been our strength and made this possible. We are delighted to recognize them and reward them with not only the best, but also what they want the most”, Chalaka said in a release
