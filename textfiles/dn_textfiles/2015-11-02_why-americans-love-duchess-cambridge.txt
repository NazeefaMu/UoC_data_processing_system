Why Americans love the Duchess of Cambridge

Americans can’t imagine why anyone wouldn’t want a middle-class commoner — one of us, rather than one of them — for a queen, writes Erin Moore
The Duchess of Cambridge is now so happily ensconced in the heart of the British royal family, so beloved by practically everyone, that it is possible to forget how snobs once revelled in the knowledge that her mother had worked as a flight attendant.
Though Catherine and her solidly middle-class family had always appeared impeccable – her mother, in particular – Prince William’s aides had to dismiss rumours that the prince’s friends used to intone “Doors to manual” in Kate’s presence.
Class warfare supposedly died out years ago in the UK. Back in 1997, former Labour MP John Prescott (now Lord Prescott) famously declared: “We’re all middle class now.” But don’t you believe it.
As cultural commentator Peter York has said, although “everywhere has a class system, it’s our obsession, in the sense that race is the American obsession”.
A majority of both Americans and British people describe themselves as middle class. However, it doesn’t mean that Americans and the British are thinking the same way.
In America, the middle class is more an economic category than a state of mind, and membership is not predicated on as many complicated and specific class markers. Where Americans shop, what they buy, and how they entertain themselves are only mild predictors of whether they will identify as middle class.
The same is not true in the UK, where membership in the middle class is more dependent upon being the product of specific types of families and schools, and the shared tastes that one develops as a result.
The British middle class likes to make fun of itself, and comes in for a lot of mocking, both good-natured and otherwise, from other classes. Here, making fun of the middles is a national sport. Americans are far more serious — and sentimental — about theirs. Why? It all comes down to social mobility and self-consciousness. There is less social mobility in the UK, so the middle class is more stable and secure from generation to generation. It is seen by outsiders as quite privileged — and possibly more than a little bit smug. Because of this, its members are far less worried about losing their place in society than they are about drawing the enmity of other classes. The middle needs approval to enjoy the spoils of its position (Barbour jackets, cottages in the country, organic produce boxes, fancy cheeses, Range Rovers, Farrow & Ball’s 20 shades of white paint…), so they mustn’t ruin it for themselves by boasting or appearing to strive, but instead make themselves as charming and likeable as possible.
This is achieved through self-deprecation – jokes at one’s own expense. Sharp-eyed observers have noted that at one extreme, this self-deprecation can become boastful, as it shows one is so comfortable, so confident, that one can choose to appear less so. The delicate art of the humblebrag was made for the British middle class.
In America, where there is no proscription against hustle, and birth to a certain kind of family is no guarantee, people aspire very earnestly to join the middle class. Those on the inside actively fear falling out. This is a real possibility. According to a survey by Pew, the number of Americans self-identifying as lower class or lower middle class increased by 25 per cent between 2008 and 2012.
In Britain, because class is so much more than an income category, it usually takes more than one generation for a family to achieve true class mobility. A family might earn enough to place them in the middle, but lingering working-class accents and tastes can be a sign that their roots — and refusal to put on airs that would be seen through anyway — are a source of pride.
The desire of members of the English middle-class to appear less posh has even given rise to “mockney”— a fake Cockney accent used in the Home Counties to downplay true origins and borrow some working-class cred.
