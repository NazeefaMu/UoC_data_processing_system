Be wary of misinformation  campaign - Information Dept. DG

Government Information Department Director General Nalaka Kaluwewa releasing a statement yesterday asked that people be wary of a campaign to mislead the general public through false and inaccurate information, being spread on many media platforms.
“As several measures are being taken for the benefit and stability of Sri Lanka’s political and economic environment, it is important that the public act with ‘national unity’ in mind and understanding for the good of the nation,” he said.
The Director General explained that certain groups and organisations were trying to weaken national unity by spreading fake and misleading news via social media, websites, and other media to build certain opinions which are baseless.
“By spreading such false rumours, they are trying to create conflicting opinions, to cause political instability, and create tension in various places among the people”.
The government asks the people that they not believe news or information without any proof or confirmation from an official source.
“It is the responsibility of the Department of Government Information to provide the people with the government’s official news and we are continuously working to ensure that the people receive, verified information in a timely manner,” Kaluwewa further stated.
