Joes favourites over Maliyadeva today

High riding defending champions St.Joseph’s College Colombo will go out clear favorites against unpredictable Maliyadeva College in their Milo ‘A’ Division inter school President Trophy knock out rugby tournament first quarter final match to be played at Sugathadasa Stadium today at 4:15pm.
The Joes lads under the leadership of centre Sameesha Verangana and coaching of young champion coach Nilufer Ibrahim have an immaculate record in this year’s concluded league rugby tournament where they were crowned as runners up for the first time in their rugby history.
THeir cause has been severely bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable speedy three quarter line scoring try after try through their famous three quarter moves through Gamunu Chethiya, Dulanjana Piyatissa, K.D.Kavinda, Shan Akila and Thanuja Maduranga.
Also they have a reliable place kicker in fly half Santhush Algama and his contribution in this match with his kicking boot will be highly vital for a Josephian victory.
On the other hand Maliyadeva College possesses a good team with play maker cum captain L.Daulagala along with their entire three quarter line can play an outstanding game to bring victory to their school exactly like they did against much fancied Science College Mount Lavinia last time around.
Maliyadeva are coached by one of the veteran school coaches in Ananda ‘Castro’ Kasthuriarachchi this year and they are placed third in the Inter Schools ‘B’ Division Plate championship this year.
Meanwhile this will be also a do or die battle for Maliyadeva College and if they lose this battle to St. Joseph’s College today in this match, then it could be worse for them as their hopes of getting them self in to the semi finals will be mere dream and they will crash out of the tournament.
