No decision yet to form new party: Wimal

The Joint Opposition has not yet taken any decision to form a new party and if such a new party is formed it will only be headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, National Freedom Front (NFF) leader, Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said.
He made this observation addressing the media at the NFF Party Office yesterday. Responding to a question by a journalist whether the Joint Opposition has a plan to appoint Basil Rajapaksa as the National Organiser of the new party, MP Weerawansa said he will only be a member of the Party and there is no plan to appoint him as the National Organiser.
He added that the formation of a new party will be done following the “Hopper Theory” aappa niyaya at the right time.
