Many Lives, Many Masters in Sinhala

International bestseller Many Lives, Many Masters written by Dr Brian L Weiss is now available in Sinhala titled as Sasara Jeevithai Gandhabba Munivarui. Dr Weiss is a prominent psychiatrist and author of Through Time into Healing and Same Soul, Many Bodies which have been sold more than two million copes. Dr. Nimal Hettiaratchy, the translator of the Sinhalese version, maintains that the book opens doors to many who have never considered the validity of reincarnation. Currently Dr Weiss is Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Florida, and clinical Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry, at the University of Miami School of Medicine. He specializes in the study and treatment of depression and anxiety states, sleep disorders, substance abuse disorders, Alzheimer's Disease, and brain chemistry.
The Sinhala translation is published by the Sadeepa Publishers and scheduled to be launched on March 16 at the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress Hall, No. 7 Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo.
