The United National Party’s (UNP) victory is assured at the Addalaichenai Pradeshiya Sabha Local Government Elections to be held on February 10.
The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) political party supporters should be partners to the UNP's victory, said former Eastern Province Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister A.L.M.Nazeer.
Former Eastern Province Minister Nazeer was speaking at a Local Government Elections meeting in support of SLMC candidate A.S.M.Uvais at Iqrah Wards in Addalaichenai recently. The SLMC Central Committee
official J.A. Latheef presided.
We are now living a comfortable life with self-dignity and self-respect. Now there is no terrorism on our soil and normal day to day activities continue. In addition, a large number of development projects have been completed and more are in progress, he said.
He said the government had achieved several development goals which it planned after forming the good governance. Roads, bridges and other infrastructure facilities of all sectors too have been developed, in addition to solving educational and irrigation problems, while providing all other basic requirements.The SLMC Iqrah Ward's candidate and former Addalaichenai Pradeshiya Sabha Member A.S.M.Uvais would win with a massive majority of votes at the forthcoming Local Government Elections. Therefore, I appeal to the voters in the area to support the candidature of Uvais, Nazeer said.
