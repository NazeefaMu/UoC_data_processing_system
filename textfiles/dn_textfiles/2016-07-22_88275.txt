UNP members request from Prime Minister : Hold LG polls without delay

 
The UNP members had made a request from their leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe not to further delay holding the Local Government elections. They had requested him to take measures to hold the LG elections as soon as possible, may it be under the preferential voting system or the first-past-the-post system.
They made this request stating the UNP has a good chance of winning the municipal councils, urban councils and the pradeshiya sabhas under the present circumstances as its main rival party, the SLFP is embroiled in internal issues.
The UNP parliamentary group members, who met the Prime Minister at the Prime Minister’s office in the Second Floor of the Parliament complex yesterday, had pointed out to the Prime Minister that the method of holding the elections would not matter but that it should not be postponed further.
