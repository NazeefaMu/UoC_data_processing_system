Point of View
The Colombo Bourse wiped off the majority of last week's gains, falling 48.1 points as investors adopted a watchful stance amid global and domestic policy uncertainty. Rising short term yields also continued to dampen investor appetite for equities with rates across 3-12M Government securities rising between 1-16Bps over the week; rates across short-term treasury yields have risen between 20-42 Bps since the close of 2016. Despite hitting a 6-day Index low on Thursday, daily turnover hit a 3-week high of LKR 1.55Bn amid strong interest by Institutional and HNI investors; Crossings over the week consequently amounted to 67% of the week's total turnover. Thursday's crossings accounted for 43% of the week's total crossings and 29% of the week's total turnover amid interest in RCL (62% of the day's total crossings) and Hemas Holdings (23% of the day's crossings). Thursday's heavy HNI and Institutional activity helped push the week's daily average turnover levels to LKR 0.77 Bn, 16% higher than the 2017 YTD average of LKR 0.67Bn. Foreign flows to the Colombo Bourse meanwhile turned positive for the first time in 2017, with net inflows to equities rising to LKR 0.35Bn relative to net outflows of LKR 0.73Bn last week and net outflows of LKR 0.97Bn in the 1st week of 2017. Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain lackluster.

IMF Forecasts Stronger Pace of Global Growth
The IMF on Monday took a relatively positive stance on 2017-2018 global growth, adding that data over H2'16 suggests somewhat greater growth momentum in 2017 from a number of important economies. The Group noted that world output in 2017 and 2018 is likely to pick up from last year's lackluster pace, with global growth projected to rise to 3.4% 2017 and 3.6% in 2018 (cf. 3.1% in 2016).
Growth is expected to arise from improvements in some large emerging market (especially China) and low income economies that were particularly pressurized in 2016, along with better prospects in the US, Europe, and Japan.
The Group noted that its forecast is based on assumptions of i) a changing policy mix (near-term fiscal stimulus and a less gradual normalization of monetary policy) under the new US administration and its global spillovers and, ii) firming oil prices following the agreement among OPEC members and several other major producers to limit supply.
The IMF cautioned however, that there is a wider dispersion of risks to its short-term forecast, due to the uncertainty surrounding the policy stance of the incoming U.S. administration and its global ramifications1.
The Group also noted that unraveling consensus over cross-border economic integration, underlying vulnerabilities in some large emerging and Geopolitical risks remain key downside risks to Global growth.
