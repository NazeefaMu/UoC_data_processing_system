ODEL launches summer 2018 collection

If summer is the season to get out there and make a statement, ODEL’s exciting summer collection is designed to set its shoppers apart in their choice of clothing and accessories. Tribal prints, splotches of bold colour and ethnic designs distinguish ODEL’s ‘Summer 2018’ collection aptly named ‘Printastic.’ Inspired by anthropological prints from diverse cultures, this collection includesstripes, monochrome prints, and geometric prints among others.
The new collection unveiled on 3rdApril is fashioned from an assortment of textured material including chiffon, organza, georgette, poplin, crepe, cotton viscose, and transparent sheer fabric.
‘Printastic’ is inspired by world-renowned brands such asBalmain, Gucci, Valentino, Prada, Elie Saab, Jason Wu, Donatella Versace, and Alexander McQueen and features bright pops of colour such as blue, pink, green, orange, yellow, red, black and shades of neon.
“We think life is too short to wear boring clothes. Our Summer 2018 collection is bold and demands to be noticed, much like the season itself; it challenges people to step out of their inhibitions and be distinctive,” said Ms Desiree Karunaratne, Group Marketing Director of Softlogic Holdings which owns Sri Lanka’s favourite department store chain, ODEL.
The ‘Printastic’ summer collectionextends itself to fashion lines for men and kids which also feature tribal prints with a touch of modernity. Crafted with tassels, beads and jewel embellishments, the matching jewellery collection too reflects tribal elements and ethnic designs.
