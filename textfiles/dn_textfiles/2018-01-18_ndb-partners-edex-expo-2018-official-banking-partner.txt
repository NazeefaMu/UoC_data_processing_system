NDB partners with EDEX Expo 2018 as official banking partner

Education and knowledge play an important role in all fields and the future of the country depends on how well our students are given the opportunity to pursue their careers and education. It is with this in mind that the National Development Bank PLC partnered with EDEX Expo 2018 as the official banking partner.
Edex Expo 2018 will take place from January 19-21 at BMICH, Colombo and 26th and 27th January at the Kandy City Centre. Students are offered suitable career guidance, special student privileges and job opportunities during the exhibition and a footfall of more than 65,000 visitors are expected. NDB will provide various other financial solutions in addition to the products mentioned.
National Development Bank is one of the fastest growing financial organizations in Sri Lanka, with the strategic mission to be a dominant leader in the financial services sector.
NDB’s product offerings most especially those solely focusing on the empowerment of the youth and education will be available at the EDEX exhibition 2018.
Products such as NDB Educator loan which enables students to pursue their dream education and career aspirations without having to worry about finances will be available with special rates.
NDB Educator Loan is a unique loan facility that enables students to pursue their dream education and career aspirations without having to worry about finances.
Its unique feature is that the loan is disbursed in stages and the grace period is extended during the entire tenure of the degree/course; so that the students or their parents would have to pay a lower installment during the period of study and start repaying the entire loan installment after the agreed grace period, which is equivalent to the course tenure. NDB Educator aims to provide the student a method in which they can focus on their studies because the burden of a loan is less.
Furthermore, other products such as the Dream Maker loan, which is a personal loan which ranges from Rs. 100,000 upwards and is the simplest way to get a loan, will also be available at the exhibition. NDB understands the need for a quality education which requires funds otherwise not affordable, thus provides its customers with simple products of high quality and ease.
NDB offers students various student facilities where the student could obtain a nominal rate of 0.80% paid on monthly basis specifically for EDEX Expo with a maximum repayment period of 60 months. The entire course fee will be provided to the institute, in the meantime. Additionally, the annual fee and joining fee will also be waived off specifically for those who join through the fair.
Furthermore, NDB Credit Cards offer ease of payment to the institute, hassle free facility with no guarantors and the student has no stress on the payments to make to the institute.
NDB Good Life Credit Cards could be used at over 2Mn VISA ATMs across 200 countries and are accepted over 25 million merchant acceptance points around the globe.
The Bank concentrates on creating unrivaled, long-term shareholder value while contributing towards financial development of individuals and the nation by exploiting territorial open doors and delivering responsible financial propositions; with the 'best in industry' administration through an enlivened team of financial professionals.
