Luxury at Sigiriya Jungles

Sigiriya Jungles offers travellers a luxurious getaway in the heart of Sri Lanka’s Cultural Triangle. The infusion of local sights, sounds and flavours into the overall experience at the hotel, ensures that each guest experiences the epitome of Sri Lankan traditions and hospitality.
The hotel is located close to several significant cultural and historical attractions and hotspots and serves as the ideal base for guests who are eager to explore the country’s rich heritage.
The Sigiriya Rock Fortress
The legendary sky citadel of Sigiriya is located a short 15-minute drive away from the hotel. The majestic rock with its series of moats, ramparts and water gardens rises 200m above sea level and a pair of giant stone lion’s paws still remain at the entrance of the stairway, which leads to the rock’s summit.
The history of the rock is intertwined with a chilling story; the King at the time was walled-up alive by his son, Kashyapa who then fled in fear that his exiled brother would return and unleash his vengeance on him. Kashyapa built Sigiriya into a magnificent fortress to protect himself and it stands a reminder of the impressive urban planning skills and sophisticated knowledge of engineering, construction and irrigation that were prevalent in ancient Sri Lanka.
The rock is also famous for the frescoes of the Sigiriya maidens that adorn one of the old palace’s walls. The frescoes can be seen on the climb to the summit, which offers breath-taking views of the surrounding plains as well as manyintricate bathing pools and reservoirs.
Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa
After an early breakfast at the hotel, you can opt to embark on an excursion to explore the ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. Located half an hour away from the hotel, the city of Anuradhapura remains a sacred place with eight veneration sites that are known as “Atamasthana”.
The city once served as a monastic centre and several ruins can still be found there today. The nearby ancient city of Polonnaruwa also features large granite sculptures, massive tanks and irrigation systems that date back to the 11th and 13th century.
A quick stop in Mihintale
