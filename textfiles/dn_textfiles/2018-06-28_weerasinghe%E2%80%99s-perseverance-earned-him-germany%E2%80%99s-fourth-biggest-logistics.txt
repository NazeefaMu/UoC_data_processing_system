Weerasinghe’s perseverance earned him Germany’s fourth biggest logistics company

He always had a dream to study and work overseas but never imagined that his dream would lead him towards owning Germany’s fourth biggest logistics company Transline GmbH Transprote & Pakete.
Hailing from the deep South in Matara, Kapila Indika Weerasinghe’s long lasting lust turned into a reality when he got the opportunity to study in Russia. Accountancy was his much loved profession and after a two year stint in Russia he moved to Bonn, Germany to gain employment.
He was drone from place to place doing odd jobs in restaurants, bars, supermarkets and finally settled down in a delivery company as a delivery boy in 2002. Having learnt the subtle points of the profession he observed that he could earn more and decided to seek a ‘Sub Agency’ of this own courier company.

Leaning the fine art of the business he then quit the company and started his own logistics company and with the business expanding hired two more hands and also bought a van for speedy delivery. Many leading courier companies in Europe too recognized him and awarded several ‘Sub Agencies,’ mainly due to his on time delivery and competitive rates.
The company was expanding rapidly and he then moved to Dusseldorf and opened his first warehouse investing 50,000 Euro which was his life time savings.
After six years of opening his first Sub Agency with just three employees and one van he acquired , Transline GmbH Transprote & Pakete with ‘100 employees and a 80 vehicle fleet’ delivering over 6 ,000 parcels daily all over the world. The company also maintains and annual growth of 12.5% and today is ranked among the fourth largest logistic company in Germany.
Delivery van stolen
He said that he could expand more but finding staff is one of his major concerns. “Looking back I can say that I reinvested in my business at the right time and also took calculated risks which never failed.”
Recalling an unforgettable incident he said that one of his employees had left the delivery van with the engine running in Bonn and had gone to drop a parcel at a store when he returned after few minutes the van was stolen.
“More than the van what mattered was the loss of over of 400 parcels which were in it and had to pay compensation for it. Since the driver had left the engine running under German law I could not claim insure as well. I lost around 140, 000 Euro from this incident.”
Settled down in business and married to a Sri Lankan whom he met in Germany Weerasinghe wants to give something back to Sri Lanka.
Bail out City Finance
It was during this time that my brother in Sri Lanka told me about the defunct City Finance Corporation and how the depositors were finding it hard to survive as all their life savings were deposited in it. “I decided to bail out this company and decided to set aside Rs. 500 million for it.”
While I was planning the best model to bail out City Finance I was also introduced to K. Gamage Leelananda CEO, Lanka Credit and Business Ltd (LCBL) a leading lending institution in down South. This was Sothern Province’s only registered Finance company, which was doing a yeomen service to the SME sector. After several discussions I decided to join LCBL and acquire City Finance and merge it with LCBL.
“We met Central Bank (CBSL) officials 30 to 40 times and after discussions and negotiations got all approvals and acquired City Finance.”
Initially LCBL made a capital infusion of Rs. 565.0 million. LCBL also reached an agreement with CBSL to repay existing deposit liabilities and accrued interest up to March 2017 within two years in three tranches, 10% of deposits and interest liabilities were settled by end May, 45% of deposits and interest liabilities on or before 30th April 2019 and balance 45% on or before 30th April 2020. Interest for the existing deposit liabilities will be paid at 4% per annum on a monthly basis according to CBSL advice.
The LCBL has proposed to change the name of the company and it was rebranded as LCB Finance Limited after the merger of the two companies. “We are now looking to obtain listing in the Colombo Stock Exchanges on or before 31.03.2020.”
He said that Sri Lanka needs more exports and LCB Finance is keen to assist SME enterprisers in this direction.
Advice to youngsters
He said that looking back his success can be attributed to focusing in one line of business rather than diverting from it. One of the first things a youth should do when going overseas is getting thorough with the country’s native language and also have some local qualification in country where he or she is.”
When you are armed with this you must then save and think about a business avenue and then concentrate in it.
He also said that one must also reinvest at the proper time and most importantly study the competitors and new industry trends.
“Today I have competition from several small time online companies and to overcome this I also offer similar services. One must not think and rest that ‘I have now reached the peak in my business and I can rest now.”
