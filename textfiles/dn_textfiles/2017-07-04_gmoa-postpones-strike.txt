GMOA postpones strike

 
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) decided today to postpone the continuous strike scheduled to commence from tomorrow.
The strike is against legalizing the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.
Earlier today Colombo Archbishop Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith requested the GMOA to postpone the strike on behalf of the increasing number of dengue patients in the country.
