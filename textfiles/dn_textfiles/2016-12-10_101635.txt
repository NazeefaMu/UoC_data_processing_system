Seventy-three-year-old sits for ICT O/L paper

N.S. Karunawathi, 73, sat for the GCE O/L Information and Communication Technology paper yesterday. Karunawathi, a retired employee at the CWE and a resident of Nadugala, said she applied to sit for the paper to test her knowledge on ICT which was a subject introduced to the curriculum recently. At 73, Karunawathi is the oldest candidate to sit for the 2016 GCE O/L examination at the Ilma College Examination Centre and possibly the whole island. “I hope to sit for the Electronics and Hindi Language papers at next year's O/L,” she said.
