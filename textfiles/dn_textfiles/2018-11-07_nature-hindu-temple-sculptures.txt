Nature of Hindu temple sculptures

Idol worship is an important aspect in Hinduism and it is generally divided into three main categories: Saivaism, Vaishnavaism and Sakthiism. Saivaism implies that Lord Siva is governor God of Hinduism. Vaishnavaism is devoted to Lord Vishnu (The god of protection) and his nine Avatars. Sakthism considers Lok Mata, Goddess Sakthi as the main God. According to Sri Lankan temple architecture, designs, inner structural views and interior structural decorations almost reflect the Hindu temple architecture and structure of the South Indian states especially the Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.
The inside and outside of Hindu temples are decorated with typical Dravidian sculptures. Sri Lankan temple sculptures are divided into different categories. Some are stone made sculptures. Temple statues of Sri Lanka are made out of a variety of metals. Among them, most of the worshipping statues or idols are made out of Iyempon - made out of amalgamated five different valuable varieties of metals. Besides these Iyempon statues or idols, a considerable number of granite and sandstone sculptures are also available all over the island.
Exclusive metals
At archaeological sites, a variety of excavated Hindu temple statutes were found. They are made out of different exclusive metals, including bronze, copper, silver and gold. Temple worshipping sculptures and statues, another category is inner decorative temple sculptures and statues and they often found at the temple walls, temple pillars, temple towers decorative, inner and outer rooftops.
The Hindu temples are famous for the tower sculptures or statues. They represent numerous beautiful human dance postures of Apsaras (dancers of heaven) and Yalies (imaginary species with extinct lion-faced reptiles). Most of them represent various stories from Hindu Puranas or Ithihasas. The temple chariots (temple Ther / Ratha) are also decorated with beautiful wooden sculptures. From the shape and sculptures of the Raja Gopuram and the Vimanams of the temple, one could easily recognize the main deity of the temple. For instance, majestic temple towers of the Siva temples are generally decorated with magnificent sculptures related to Siva epics (Purana or Ithihasa stories. The towers of Lord Murugan (Skanda) temples are decorated with the sculptures or statues that represent the episodes of Skanda Puranam. The towers of Sri Vaishnava temples represent the holy epics of Lord Mahavishnu. Goddess Sri Kali or Sri Durga temple towers exhibit various holy plays of the Lok Mata.
All the Sri Lankan Hindu temple sculptures and statues resemble South Indian or Dravidian architecture. Often the creativity of the local sculptors represents their creations with the modifications based on regional influences.
Temple sculptures
In the past, the temple sculptures were made by using the kaolin or clay material. Later granite stones were used for making the temple sculptures and statues. The granite stones have very high resistance provided by fine-grained molecules which can withstand very harsh weather conditions.
Hindu temples which are found in the Dravidian States exhibit beautiful sculptures that adorn the pillars; Mandapams (halls), Vimanams tower over the Garpagraham (Sanctorum) adorn with sculptures and the Raja Gopurams temple main entrance towers (decorated with beautiful sculptures). These temple tower sculptures depict different stories related to the main presiding deity of the temple.
Other castle kind of structures including Mani Gopurams (castles for the holy bells), permanent structures of the movable holy carts, roof of the temple cart shed, the pillars of the temples and Theerthak Kerni (Holy water pond of the temple) and other permanent structures of the Holy temple garden are decorated with beautiful sculptures or statues. Most of the sculptures or statues exhibit various postures of dance and physical conflicts. The structures can be seen at many historical sites in Sri Lanka.
Minute details
To study the historical background of Hinduism via a specified timescale that prevailed in Sri Lanka can be done by studying the minute details based on the introduction and evolution of Bharat Natyam in Sri Lanka. On the basis of various casts of sculptures and statutes can spell out the influence of the governed regime of a particular geographical zone through a time scale. This will help to identify a particular regime which dominated a notified area through various eras. To understand these facts, one has to study the comparative cultural variations that occurred in the past. The above factors are essential elements to study the origins, modifications and transformations that occurred in the past.
In Hinduism, different dance postures signify various gods based on their roles in epics. Lord Nataraja’s 108 Karanas reveal different philosophical meanings of the “holy cosmic dance” of the Lord. Most of the figures interpret the messages through different dancing gestures - postures based on Natya Sastra. The messages are conveyed through Abhinaya (physical expressions) including the body positions, face positions, neck positions, foot positions, different glances and different hand gestures.
Various transitions
A primary in this regard revealed some interesting facts about the old Hindu temples, their art galleries and sculptures. All these spell out the information about the historical evolution and various transitions that took place in the Sri Lankan Hindu temples. The current study also analyses the comparative data of South Indian chapter. Sri Lankan temple decorative sculptures have very close affinities with South Indian temples especially with the Tamil Nadu temples such as Thillai Nataraja temple at Chidambaram, Madurai Meenakshi temple, Tanjai Bracatheeswara temple, Mahabalipuram sculptures and numerous temples at Kanchipuram and many temples at Andra, Karnataka, and Kerala also.
