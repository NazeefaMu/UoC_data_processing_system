Eastern province doctors to launch strike today

 
Doctors attached to state hospitals in the Eastern Province launched a token strike at 8.00 am today, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the Health Services Director General has already been informed about the issues which led doctors to launch this strike but gave no response.
Because of this, the doctors will plan to strike.
Aluthge continued by explaining that the strike is the result of unsolved problems related to the medical administration in the Eastern Province, including doctors' transfers, stationing of doctors, doctors' salary problems, etc.
