Among the twinkling stars

Heavy rains was no disturbance at all for the Lady of Victories Convent, Moratuwa, when they celebrated the 80th anniversary celebration of the Past Pupils' Association.





The Convent's present and past pupils gathered in blue and white dress that depicted their school colour. Everything, including the welcome drink, was blue.
That was a nice combination as compared to the blue skies above. It was as if Mother Mary fondly looked down to bless the convent named after her. The celebration was held at the Mount Lavinia Hotel.
Former Central Bank Assistant Governor Priyantha Fernando graced the occasion as the chief guest, while Highways and Investment Promotion Deputy Minister Eran Wickremeratne made a sudden appearance. Rev.Sisters, Esmi Rodrigo, Catheriene Perera and Sujeeva Nonis represented the Convent at the occasion.
Veteran musician Faizal Bongso made the evening colourful with the background music provided by Marians. Dushyanth Weeraman's dance troupe added an extraordinary flavor to the function. The evening commenced with an opening prayer. And then followed the dine and dance evening. They danced to their heart's content.
In between were lucky draws that offered the participants covetous prizes such as overseas trips. The draw prizes were segmented into categories such as Table Draw, Lucky Entrance Ticket Draw, best dancer, best dancing couple, best tap dancer, best baila dancing couple and best dressed lady.
Ann Dias emerged the Queen of the Night.
