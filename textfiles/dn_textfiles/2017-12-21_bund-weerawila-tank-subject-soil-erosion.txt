Bund of Weerawila tank subject to soil erosion

The bund of the Weerawila tank is subjected to soil erosion. The Wellawaya Hambantota road also runs along the Weerawila tank bun, and as such this road will also face destruction if the soil erosion continues.
The residents said that the vehicular traffic on this road will be negatively affected if the road is damaged because there is no alternative road to access Wellawaya, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, and Bandarawela.
