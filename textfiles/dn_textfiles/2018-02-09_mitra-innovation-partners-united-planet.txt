Seals strategic enterprise portal partnership
Mitra Innovation partners with United Planet

Mitra Innovation has partnered with United Planet, a pioneer in this area to promote and provide an enterprise portal called Intrexx, a cross-platform integrated development environment.
When Intrexx was first introduced to the market, it was the first product to enable companies of any size to implement an innovative portal “out of the box”. Over the years - and through working with partners - it has grown to become a full-service tool used to digitise workflows and streamline operations and communications for teams. Whether it’s for the creation of an intranet, extranet or social collaboration, Intrexx provides a straightforward and manageable access to an organisation’s data on one central platform. Mitra Innovation CEO Ashok Suppiah said, “We are very excited to start this journey with United Planet. As a company delivering systems integration and digital transformations on behalf of our clients, this partnership will allow us to cross a strategic section of our roadmap to help us bring about innovative processes for the companies and organisations we work with”. Intrexx features a flexible development platform to help people unite and collaborate on tasks. Intrexx provides both intranet services (for employees to access from anywhere), and extranet services (so that a company’s portal can be accessible for customers and partners alike). It also features application development features and functionalities.
Mirta Innovation Chief Technology Officer Sudaraka Jayashanka , said “We like the Intrexx platform because of its high level of flexibility and ability to integrate data. Data from external systems such as ERPs, CRMs or BI can be connected with ease because of Intrexx.
As we are on a journey to become the most preferred systems integration and digital transformation vendor in the marketplace, this partnership gives us an additional tool in our armoury. It’s a great partnership for us, Intrexx, and hopefully our clients.” he Freiburg based portal software provider has already serviced over 5,000 small and mid-sized enterprises worldwide, and is one of the leading solutions in the areas of intranet, extranet and digital workplaces.
It was also awarded the prize of Social Business Leader by the consulting firm Exerton Group for the time in a row in 2017.
