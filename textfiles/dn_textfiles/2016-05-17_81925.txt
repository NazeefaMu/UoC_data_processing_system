Lochte takes 200 IM crown at Charlotte meet

Washington, Monday: World record-holder and triple Olympic medalist Ryan Lochte won the 200-meter individual medley title Sunday at the US Pro Swim Series meet in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The 31-year-old American won in 1min 58.97 with countryman Conor Dwyer, a world and Olympic relay swim champion, second in 2:00.90 and Hungary’s Norbert Szabo third in 2:01.56.
Lochte, who won the 400 IM title on Friday, set the 200 IM world record of 1:54.00 at the 2011 World Championships in Shanghai. He took Olympic 200 IM silver in 2004 and 2012 and bronze in 2008 and is the reigning Olympic 400 IM champion. “It was a solid meet, especially for where I am right now in my training,’ Lochte said. “I’m still training kind of hard and I didn’t rest at all for this meet.” Lochte hopes to defend his 400 IM gold and take another shot on the 200 IM crown at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in August, but he must first qualify in the US team trials.
“With six more weeks, it’s time to tune up some things and get ready for trials,” Lochte said.
Three Canadians took titles -- Dominique Bouchard in the women’s 200 backstroke in 2:09.14, Penny Oleksiak in the women’s 100 free in 53.41 and Santo Condorelli in the men’s 100 free in 48.41.
Russian-born Serbian Arkady Vyatchanin won the men’s 200 back in 1:59.09.
American Leah Smith won the women’s 800 free in 8:27.79 for her third title of the meet, having earlier taken the 200 and 400 free.
