Icon stands alone

Dr Lester James Peries has everything in excess what his predecessors, contemporaries and successors almost lacked: covetous longevity, unrivalled celebrity status and many more. Dr Peries turned 97 in April, probably becoming the most-discussed cinema icon alive.
He has been the subject for over 20 publications that cover a wide range of his life and cinema. The latest to emerge was ‘Lester - Cinema and Sri Lanka’ by Ajith Galappatty to mark the longest living cinema icon’s birthday.
In Litchat, Galappatty attempts to spell out why Dr Peries deserves such a wide symposium.
Q: Dr Lester James Peries has dozens of books written on him and his cinema. Don’t you think that you have just made the pile heavy, with your addition
 Ajith Galappatty
A: I made use of about 24 books on Dr Peries. You can count mine as the 25th addition. Now, all these 24 books focus on him in different angles. It started in 1966, when Karunasena Jayalath penned a pamphlet-like critique on ‘Delovak Athara’. It reached pinnacle with Dr Tissa Abeysekara’s ‘Ahasin Polovata’ screenplay. But in my honest opinion, none of these books is a serious study of Dr Lester James Peries.
Q: Almost every author of the 24 books could claim some authority on Sri Lankan cinema. But you claim these books have not studied Lester properly. How do you justify that claim
A: A major portion of the books contain nuts and bolts about Lester’s 67-year cinema history. Some books report back what Lester expressed about his films and Sri Lankan cinema in general. Another is an anthology of newspaper articles on him. Another is a compilation. See, there is hardly any serious study. But I see them as a rich source that leads anyone to take up Lester as a serious study.
Q: It indicates that you are not hesitant to affirm your study of Lester as a serious one.
A: I was interested in cinema since schooldays. We know that many heroes emerged in Sri Lankan history of cinema. But for me, Lester is the one and only hero. He stands alone even today. So I focused my higher studies too on Lester and his cinema. Whenever I published my own critiques, I focused on aspects of Lester’s cinema as well. Even for my MSSc I chose Lester’s cinema. I dedicated 10 years to watch his films and read books written about them analytically.
Q: Do you see Lester as a hero
A: Yes. He is the one and only hero. Just take a look at the initial stages of our cinema, and you will realise why he is a hero. I am talking about the forties and fifties. That was the period when our local cinema artistes were very much under South Indian influence.
But Lester stood alone. He trod his own path. When Indian forces had our cinema in their grip, Lester studied in the west and fused that knowledge to our cinema in his own way. I see that as an act of heroism.
Q: Wasn’t there any other hero before or after Lester
A: There could be. We come across many heroes. But Lester is more heroic than all of them. For instance Sirisena Wimalaweera fought against the South Indian grip. He is a hero. B A W Jayamanna was carried away by South Indian filmmakers, but later he became an independent cinema artiste. So he is a hero. Then we meet Shanthi Kumar Seneviratne who stood alone. His story was chosen for a film by a South Indian producer. But Shanthi Kumar had gumption to demand that he should make that film. There are many more. But they can hardly get closer to Lester.
Q: I sense some idolatrous admiration in you for Lester.
A: Well, I am not a faithful devotee of Lester. I personally like only a few out of his all films. But I can say that the books written about him are authored by his devotees.
Q: Will you make clear why you see Lester as a hero
A: When Lester directed his first film ‘Rekhava’ in 1956, it was accepted as the first cinematic local film. That was because you can see a lot of cinematic features in ‘Rekhava’. Of course, there were films based on local culture and local flavour before Lester. But they lacked cinematic creativity. They were films based on local culture yet without any cinematic creativity.
That was a major setback during the pre-Lester era. This is one primary reason why I see Lester as a hero.
Q: If ‘Rekhava’ was made in 1956, Lester’s cinema life turns 60 this year. In a previous answer, you called it Lester’s 67-year cinema history.
A: Lester’s starting point is not Rekhava. He made a short film called ‘Soliloquy’. That was in 1949, while he was still in England. Based in England, Lester continued to make a few more short films. There is hardly any information available about these short films for a serious study. Apparently no one has bothered to take up a study on Lester’s creative life in England.
Information is scarce, though it does not mean that we should forget Lester’s initial stages. Those films must also be counted as Lester’s cinema history.
Q: You have dedicated a separate chapter for Lester’s 12-minute short film. Is it that significant
A: Certainly. Lester comes to Sri Lanka because of that short film. That was an amateur film, but an experimental one. That was awarded in England as the best experimental film.
