“It is inspiring to see the private sector leading the way on sustainability and recognizing institutions that have excelled in their efforts.
The UN system looks forward to engaging further on implementing and achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda to ensure that we leave no one behind,” UNs Resident Coordinator in SriLanka Una McCauley said. Adding to this, President of the Member Network Panel of ACCA Sri Lanka Adrian Perera, said that what the world needs is a true wholehearted action, not for short term profits. “These days Sri Lanka is facing energy, water and a food crises. While the solutions are at hand, we continue to take the easy path.
For example, Sri Lanka is blessed to be surrounded by the Indian ocean but still continues to import fish products from overseas. This is similar with our energy, food and water issues.” Speaking on behalf of the panel of judges, Franklyn Amerasinghe commended the reports that had made the grade, saying that each had succeeded in the primary judging criteria of the 3Cs of Completeness, Credibility and Communication and thus infused best practices in sustainability reporting which is imperative to operating a sustainable business.
The Awards Ceremony, now in its thirteenth year and each year works on a theme, this year highlighted ‘Sustainability and its many facets’, underlining six of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.
The fifteen awards presented across seven industry categories demonstrated a comprehensive coverage of the three fundamental pillars of sustainability, namely economic, social and environment and were selected from nearly sixty applicants.
