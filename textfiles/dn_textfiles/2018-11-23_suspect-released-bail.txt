Selling lands using fake deeds
Suspect released on bail

The Negombo Magistrate granted bail to a woman who had sold lands in Nalluruwa, Panadura, using fake deeds, recently.
Katunayake Police had arrested the suspect when she was preparing to leave the country. The arrest was made after the Special Crimes Investigation Unit of the Welaboda Police Station in Panadura had informed the Katunayake Police about the crime after receiving a tip-off.
The suspect had initially been produced before the Negombo Magistrate before she was brought to the Panadura Magistrate’s Court.
