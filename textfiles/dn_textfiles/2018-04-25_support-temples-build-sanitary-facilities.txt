Support for temples to build sanitary facilities

The Central Cultural Fund will fund temples which do not have proper sanitary facilities.
Based on the statement made by the Commissioner for Buddhist Affairs recently that there are temples which do not have proper sanitation facilities mainly in the remote areas, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam instructed officers of the Central Cultural Fund to allocate funds for such temples.
The Minister was addressing a gathering to offer appointment letters to 24 educationists, who passed the open competitive examination to be recruited as Grade 3 Educationists at the Education Ministry Auditorium, recently.
According to the Minister, the funds of the Central Cultural Fund can be utilised for the betterment of religious places countrywide at present, as a result of the moves taken by him to streamline the functions of the Fund. It was revealed that earlier, the Fund did not receive its revenue properly.
“With moves to streamline the Central Cultural Fund, its income increased and therefore, its funds can easily be utilised to uplift religious places,” the minister said.
