Speaker favoured over Minister Nimal Siripala as PM - Minister

Shedding light into negotiations between various factions in the government, Jathika Hela Urumaya Leader Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said discussions held with the President and a group of SLFP members had proposed the appointment of Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva as Prime Minister.
“However some may not support this and might join the UNP. However, a group of around 15 UNP members proposed the appointment of Karu Jayasuriya as the Prime Minister. This proposal was not rejected by anyone and the majority were in favour of such a move.
More importantly, the President too did not reject this proposal.
"We are all willing to continue with the Unity Government but changes need to be made?", he stressed.
Meanwhile, he noted that everyone should be humble enough to accept the victory of the Podu Jana Peramuna and accept them as the country’s opposition party.
