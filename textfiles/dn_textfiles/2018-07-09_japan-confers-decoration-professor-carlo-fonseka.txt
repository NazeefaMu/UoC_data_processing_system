Ambassador of Japan Kenichi Suganuma conferred “The Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon” upon Professor Carlo Fonseka, on behalf of His Majesty the Emperor, in recognition of Professor Fonseka’s significant contribution to the promotion of cultural exchange between Japan and Sri Lanka, at a special ceremony held on July 6, at the Ambassador’s residence in Colombo.
Professor Fonseka, one of the most famous medical doctors and a man of culture in Sri Lanka, was appointed as Co-Chairperson of the Committee of the Japan Sri Lanka Friendship Cultural Awards in 2010.
