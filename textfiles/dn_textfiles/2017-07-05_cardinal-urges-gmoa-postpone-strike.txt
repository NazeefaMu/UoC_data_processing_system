Cardinal urges GMOA to postpone strike

Colombo Archbishop His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith yesterday urged the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) not to go ahead with their planned strike beginning today, considering the seriousness of the current dengue outbreak.
Addressing a media briefing at the Bishop’s House in Colombo, the Archbishop of Colombo said the GMOA should give serious thought to calling off the planned trade union action in order to assist patients affected by dengue.
While noting that he had no intention of interfering with the trade union action planned by doctors to win their demands, the Archbishop said that however it was not an opportune moment to strike as there is a risk of a dengue epidemic spreading in the country.
He insisted that the GMOA should think about the plight of the innocent patients, suffering due to dengue and postpone the strike.
The GMOA on Monday announced that they had decided to engage in an indefinite strike against what they called as the government’s failure to resolve the SAITM issue.
Health authorities said the total number of dengue deaths has risen to 226 in the worst ever dengue outbreak in the country.
The total number of dengue cases recorded was 76, 077 from all parts of the country by June 30, Epidemiology Unit sources said.
The highest number of dengue patients,32,764 is from the Western Province with 11,181 reported from the Colombo district. The Colombo Municipal Council area recorded 3,014 dengue patients while the other parts of the district recorded 12,749 dengue patients.
