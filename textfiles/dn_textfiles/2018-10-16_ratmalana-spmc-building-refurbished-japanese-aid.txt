Ratmalana SPMC building refurbished with Japanese aid

The refurbished State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) building at Ratmalana was reopened under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Japanese Embassy Charge d’Affaires ad interim Toshihiro Kitamura on Friday.
The Japanese government provided 3,935 million Japanese Yen (approximately Rs.5,232 million) through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under the project ‘Improvement of Basic Social Services Targeting Emerging Regions’.
Increasing the production capacity of the SPMC is one of the three objectives of this project. The SPMC was first established in 1986 by the Japanese Government with a grant of 2.6 billion Japanese Yen.
Japan has upgraded the SPMC by providing the latest equipment, constructing a material storage building, and refurbishing a part of the SPMC building with the use of 1,240 million Japanese Yen.
With these improvements, the SPMC is now expected to double its annual production of tablets and capsules and to meet 70 percent of the national drug demand (an increase of 25 percent compared to 43.6 percent in 2011).
Under this project, the following has also been implemented:
l Refurbishment of four secondary hospitals in the Central, Sabaragamuwa, North Western and Eastern Provinces (facilities and essential equipment necessary for early detection, treatment and prevention of non-communicable diseases have been provided).
l Procurement of 86 ambulances (the Health Ministry has distributed the ambulances among base hospitals, divisional hospitals and district hospitals in the North Central, North Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Northern, Uva and Eastern Provinces).
