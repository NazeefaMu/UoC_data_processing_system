‘MR is attempting to destroy SLFP by supporting Pohottuwa’

The same thing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did at the 2010 presidential elections to rival candidate Sarath Fonseka, is being repeated today against President Maithripala Sirisena, for thwarting the Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s (SLFP’s) political power, said SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake at a local government election public meeting held recently at Horowpothana.
‘’Being a SLPFer himself, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, by insisting that people vote for Pohottuwa, has tarnished the image of the SLFP. It was the former president who once admired Sarath Fonseka, uttering that he was an efficient and brave war hero who led the war against terrorism to victory; but in 2010, seeking vengeance on Fonseka for contesting the presidential elections against him, Rajapaksa put him behind bars. With the blessings of the former president, a new political party was formed with the intention of retaliating against President Sirisena and curbing his political future,” Minister Dissanayake added.
The minister further said, “If Mahinda Rajapaksa truly loved the SLFP and its members who hoisted him to the position of the country’s president twice, would he urge SLFPers to be members of another political party? Although we loved Mahinda Rajapaksa, he seemed to hate us; the SLFPers. As such, voters, especially SLFP supporters, should not allow themselves to be hoodwinked or cheated by hippocratic and disappointing political leaders any further and should not to contribute to the fragmentation of the longstanding SLFP party.”
“Do not waste your franchise by voting for the JVP, for they don’t have the strength they boast about to convert villages into heaven. On the other hand, the SLFP, jointly with the UNP, formed the Good Governance Government to develop the country, having curbed bribery, corruption wastage of public funds, and nepotism, in a combined and integrated way. But since the UNP is alleged to have been involved in certain fraudulent activities, intelligent UNPers who are on a political dilemma, have no other alternative than to support the SLEP, and we invite such UNPers to join hand with us,” Minister Dissanayaka said.
