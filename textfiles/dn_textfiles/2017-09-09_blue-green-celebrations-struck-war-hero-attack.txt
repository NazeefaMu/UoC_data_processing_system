Blue-Green celebrations struck by a War Hero attack

While the two parties of the National Unity coalition are in a celebratory mood with the SLFP marking its 66th anniversary, and the UNP reaching its 71st anniversary this week and due to celebrate at Ratnapura tomorrow (10th), the War Hero protection pledge has raised new challenges to coalition politics, as government moves to third year.
President Maithripala Sirisena had cause for satisfaction at the success of the SLFP’s 66th anniversary celebration at Campbell Park, Colombo, last Sunday, with the question of party unity moving to background and the Rajapaksa challenge to SLFP leadership becoming increasingly unreal. Public statements by Mahinda Rajapaksa about blue brigades contesting future elections from the Sri Lanka Podujana Pakshaya (SLPP), and reports of a massive success in the SLPP’s membership drive, show the Lotus Bud planners are thinking away from the SLFP, and the new political realities emerging.
With a sizeable crowd from all parts of the country with SLFP’s grass roots membership and organisation abilities helped by government connections, President Sirisena emphasized the need for the SLFP to be strengthened as a democratic party and a wide political movement, recalling the initial slogans of its founder SWRD Bandaranaike – and its initial image as the party of the Sangha, Physicians, Teachers, Peasants and Workers – Sangha – Veda –Guru - Govi – Kamkaru – and emphasized the need for the party to also embrace scholars and intellectuals, with a patriotic commitment to democracy.
He was strong in defense of the SLFP’s current alignment with the UNP, especially in the context of those in the party who said they won’t or can’t participate in party activities as long as it was associated with the UNP. He emphasized that consensual government was in the larger national interest, and not narrow political interests and such an alignment had brought good relations with the international community and helped the economy.
He stressed the need to fight fraud, corruption and malpractice as well as attempts at dynastic rule, and that power given by the people should not be used by politicians for personal benefits and agendas, but only to benefit the people and the country.
Vision 2025
The celebratory mood of both parties was seen with the launch of Vision 2025, the eight year economic and social development plan, by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the BMICH last Tuesday. It is a major socio-political move that looks at the wider goals of the Unity Coalition formed in August 2015, and seeking realization of “The Empowered Sri Lanka” concept, seeking structural transformation of the country and society, in the context of the modern aspects of development changing societies worldwide.
Presented by the Unity Government, Vision 2025 is a major move by the UNP and the Western liberal thinking forces looking at new ways of changing Sri Lankan society, through major economic and technological transformations, to push back the old and seedy thinking that has dominated political attitudes and the methodology of progress.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe responding to queries from youth at the BMICH event was clear that youth need to be given new and constructive approaches to meet the needs of today and tomorrow. The government’s move is to improve the economy by creating one million jobs for youth, through a strategy already initiated. He emphasized the two main parties had to come together to implement important pro-national and people policies, and the need for political stability to bring good development in the country.
The Prime Minister was also emphatic the policies of Vision 2025 would transform Sri Lanka into a hub in the Indian Ocean with a knowledge based, highly competitive, social market economy.
The knowledge based economy must be the key aspect of Vision 2025, because Sri Lanka needs a major push to be a knowledge based and knowledge driven society, which will require the rapid advance of technological knowledge, moves into areas Artificial Intelligence, and importantly the wider knowledge of English, without keeping it confined to the better and richer schools.
Apart from its larger goal for development, such as the expectations held by the Mahaweli Diversion Project and earlier colonization projects in the Dry Zone areas by UNP governments, Vision 2025 is also a means to keep the unity coalition in place despite the rivalry between the SLFP and UNP; with the hope for those in government, from both parties, that economic progress of a larger magnitude in socially transformative means is the promise of the future.
War crimes challenge
The success of the SLFP anniversary celebration also brought new problems for the President and government, with the responses of the international community to statement by President Sirisena that he would not allow anyone in the world to do anything to Retd. Major Gen Jagath Jayasuriya, the former Army Commander or any of Sri Lanka’s military commanders or war heroes. The surge of the blue flags at Campbell Park would have moved the President to state this in the same speech that he said how the international community is having better understandings and relations with Sri Lanka, due to the reconciliation policies of the government. The President’s statement is important in local politics, in the context of Field Marshal and Minister Sarath Fonseka’s statement of readiness to give evidence against his successor as Army Commander.
The JO is already talking of a motion of No Confidence against Minister Sarath Fonseka. The call for his removal from the Cabinet have come from many quarters, including sections of the Buddhist clergy, and Wimal Weerawansa and Vasudeva Nanayakkara, too, showing the diversity of advantage in War Hero politics. The question that needs to be asked is who would bring charges against Maj. Gen Jagath Jayasuriya in Sri Lanka, and in what Sri Lankan court would it be. Sri Lanka has made it clear it will not accept the ‘jurisdiction' of any foreign court on these matters. It is necessary to have some sense of sanity in this debate of rage on the so-called threat to War Heroes, whether it is posed by foreign accusers or Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. Those now crying for Sarath Fonseka’s political blood have forgotten that it was he who did lead to War Heroes to militarily defeat the LTTE, just as Mahinda Rajapaksa gave the political lead.
The speed with which the foreign media picked up the story of President Sirisena speaking in defense of Maj. Gen Jagath Jayasuriya could well lead to a new avalanche of criticisms from foreign Human Rights and anti-War Crime organisations, as well as the UNHRC and other forces that will take up this issue. The agency story headlined “Sri Lankan leader will protect general accused of war crimes” -- was carried in the Washington Post, New York Times, Kansas City Star, West Plains Daily and many others newspapers in the USA, and commented on by major TV news services.
The time is certainly not the best for those who wish to boast of good international relations in the context of reconciliation and peace building.
Electoral system
Minister Faizer Mustapha has said it is proposed to hold parliamentary elections under a 60:40 ratio electoral system, introducing the same system to Provincial Councils, to ensure a consistent method at all elections. It is 60% for First Past the Post (FPP) and 40% under Proportional Representation (PR).
Having a single system for all elections is good, as we move away from the wholly undemocratic PR system we use under the 1978 Constitution. But the move for 60% on FPP, as it is, does not bring democracy to the electoral process. There are many examples, such as the UK government today, to show that FPP does not get the majority representation to Parliament or any other body.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, answering questions at the Vision 2025 launch, said when Mr. SWRD Bandaranaike won a two-thirds majority in 1956 his party polled only 48% votes, and, when the UNP under JR Jayewardene won a five-sixth majority in 1977, it also secured only 51 per cent of the votes. The Prime Minister spoke of the need for political stability to bring about progress.
The Government should certainly look at the French and similar methods, where FPP is not done in the non-democratic way we have done it, and countries such as the UK and India, still continue. It is better to think of having elections in two rounds, with anyone who polls more than 50% in round one being elected at once, and the two leading candidates who did not get 50% contesting in the next round, which will ensure one will definitely get more than 50%. That will be a true majority vote, unlike the FPP we know, which can elect a person who gets just 25%, when all other candidates share the majority of 75%. If elections could have been delayed for so long, a delay to ensure a better democratic process will not be opposed by anyone.
