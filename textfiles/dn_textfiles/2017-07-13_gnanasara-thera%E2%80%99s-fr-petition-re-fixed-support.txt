Gnanasara Thera’s FR petition re-fixed for support

The Supreme Court yesterday re-fixed for support, a Fundamental Rights petition filed by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera.
He sought a declaration that the order given by the Homagama Magistrate to keep him in remand custody is unlawful and a violation of his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution.
The petition will be taken up for support on October 9.
The Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasad Dep, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Anil Goonaratne.
In his petition, Gnanasara Thera maintained that the statement made by him when getting ready to leave Court on January 25, 2016 addressing complainant Sandhya Ekneligoda, can in no way amount to be a threat made to injure a person or her reputation, nor can it be said that the statement so made would cause alarm to a person.
The petitioner stated that on a complaint by Sandhya Ekneligoda on January 25, 2016 to Homagama Police, the first respondent, OIC Miscellaneous Complaints had arrested him and produced him before the Homagama Magistrate’s Court on January 26.
Gnanasara Thera stated that complainant Sandhya Ekneligoda after attending the Magistrate’s Court was getting ready to leave Court when he told her, “Thoge miniha LTTE karayek uu malane, tho hingakapiya”.
The petitioner stated that Police alleged that he had committed an offence under section 486 of the Penal Code.
He said upon being produced, the petitioner was remanded by the Magistrate until February 9. He was again remanded until February 10.
He stated that police further alleged that he had committed offences under section 8 (1) (a) of Assistance to Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act of No. 4 of 20. He said he was ordered to be further remanded until February 23.
The petitioner maintained that there was no justifiable reason for the Magistrate to make an order of remand with the statement so made in as much as such statement does not constitute an offence under section 483 of the Penal Code and section 8 (1) (a) of the Assistance to Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act.
The Attorney-at-Law who filed this petition on behalf of Gnanasara Thera moved Court that the petition be taken up for support on March 16, 17 or 18.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appeared for the Attorney General.
