Colombo's faulty lights: Whose fault?

Pedestrians and motorists, especially in the Colombo city limits, face many difficulties due to the malfunction of traffic lights. Traffic lights help the smooth flow of traffic as well as ensure the safety of road-users. However, people on the roads have to face constant risks due to the lack of proper traffic lights.
Accidents are reported on a daily basis, which are mainly caused by the absence or malfunction of traffic lights. When queried, authorities seem to evade this very important matter passing the blame on others. Negligence of authorities seems to be the main cause for such road problems.
Traffic lights, sporting red, yellow and green, could be seen at many intersections cautioning commuters. Colombo is the most densely populated and congested city in the country. Traffic lights or signal lights have been installed in most places to ease the traffic congestion and ensure the smooth flow of traffic. They are needed for both motorists and pedestrians alike. Unfortunately, traffic lights at some of the busiest junctions in Colombo are found to be malfunctioning. Malfunctioned colour lights have become a common sight in many parts of Colombo now.
An intersection is the point where vehicles from several roads meet. Vehicles reach an intersection from different directions. The purpose of signal lights is to minimize traffic congestion in a junction, allowing the traffic to flow as smoothly as possible and let pedestrians cross the road safely.
However, several commuters expressed their displeasure when asked about the colour lights. They do not work continuously. Therefore, pedestrians and drivers are not aware of its function, said R. Mahesh, a three-wheeler driver referring to the inactive colour lights near Maradana.
Pointing out that hundreds of people flock to Maradana as the railway station is also nearby, he said one could witness the hustle and bustle on the road during office hours. When the traffic lights do not function properly, drivers go high speed as the colour lights do not stop them. On the other hand, pedestrians, after learning that the lights do not work, try to jaywalk, Mahesh said.
"I have seen several occasions where pedestrians are scolded by drivers when they try to cross the road. It is a life threat to those people. Many rush across the road to catch the train," the three-wheeler driver added.
Road rules and regulations are meant to protect commuters. If people tend to take care of their own safety, what is the need for rules and regulations? pedestrians ask.
Pedestrians as well as drivers face numerous issues when traffic lights do not function continuously. Although people consider their safety, they tend to violate rules in places where the law is not executed properly. Therefore, road rules and regulations must be implemented under a proper system which leaves no room or easy way out for any violator.
The victims of the negligence of authorities are members of the public. When colour lights do not work, drivers speed up and pedestrians cross the roads knowing that colour lights are inactive.

"Several colour lights do not work continuously, especially the ones near pedestrian crossings," said Asma Ismail, a university student from Punchi Borella.
"One day, I was in a hurry to go to the university as I had exams. I went up to the pedestrian crossing and pressed the button. I waited for a few minutes but the colours did not change. Then a person in the boutique nearby told me that it does not work. I missed three buses waiting at the crossing. That is how the traffic lights in our country work," she claimed.
Asma added: "From then on, I first check whether the lights are working. If it does not work, crossing the road is a big challenge especially in the morning. Sometimes the lights function and sometimes not. Only a few drivers stop to let pedestrians cross. Most drivers fly like jets on the road."
When it comes to public issues, authorities tend to provide answers to evade the situation. Speaking to the Daily News, a few people alleged that the police are switching off the colour lights.
Responding to these allegations, Traffic Admin and Road Safety Director SSP Jayantha Senaviratne said lights are switched off after 10 pm at night as the traffic, pedestrians and vehicles are less during those hours.
Colour lights near pedestrian crossings are not switched off without a valid reason, he emphasized.
"It is the responsibility of the OIC of each area to look into malfunctioning colour lights and to inform about it to relevant authorities. When the department receives complaints regarding colour lights, we immediately respond to the problem," he added.
He had already identified several malfunctioning colour lights, maintained by the Colombo Municipal Council engineering services.
When the Daily News inquired Nihal Wickramaratne of the Colombo Municipal Council, engineer services, he said problems pertaining to colour lights are attended to immediately when complaints are received.
On the contrary, a pedestrian alleged that sometimes all colours - red, amber and green - function at the same time. He explained that this happens when rain water seeps in short circuiting the lighting system.
Wickramaratne responding to allegations said minor errors in colour lights can be solved within a day. But it takes more time to fix if there is a power failure.
Colour lights with a countdown system are more effective than the ones without. Pedestrians and drivers can see the countdown before making a move. This is safer compared to other colour lights, Wickramaratne added.
Tackling road safety issues have become a major challenge today as people have various opinions. Earlier, before the installation of colour lights, drivers and pedestrians functioned on instructions of the traffic police. The country expected to see an improvement in the flow of traffic following the installation of traffic signals. But in reality, traffic lights are not functioning properly and sometimes the traffic police have to be near the lights to control traffic. One wonders about the significant difference that traffic lights have made on the road to ensure safety.
"Sometimes the situation becomes worse when a policeman handles traffic at junctions which earlier had colour lights," alleged W. K. Sanath, a shopkeeper at Pettah.
Congestion increases especially in the morning when vehicles come to Colombo and in the evening when vehicles go out, he added.
Sanath pointed out that when traffic lights do not function continuously, pedestrians risk their lives and cross the road through moving traffic.
Sunith Bandara, a banker from Gampaha said some drivers drive recklessly which is worse when a traffic policeman is not present.
Traffic policemen are not deployed where traffic lights have been installed and traffic is controlled by the lights. However, this had become a failure as many traffic lights are not functioning, he claimed.
SSP Senaviratne speaking about the interference of the police with the traffic flow said: "According to the law, if there is a traffic policeman on the road, drivers and pedestrians should obey his instructions. In such a situation, traffic signals do not function."
He accepted that people face several problems due to malfunctioning lights. "The department is in the process of improving the system and there are problems with regard to the duration when colours change. That has to be adjusted," he said.
He also said that colour lights with a countdown are more effective.
According to transport experts, traffic signals are not meant to be manned by the police. Traffic signals can be programmed according to traffic patterns of the day and week.
In addition, the police, Road Development Authority or Colombo Municipal Council should make regular traffic counts at intersections and draw up a traffic plan to minimize waits and reduce congestion.
