A success story : BIA Runway Resurfacing Project

Airport and Aviation Services Limited embarked on a colossal task of resurfacing of the runway of Bandaranaike International Airport, the Sri Lanka’s Key international Airport, which served its service life.The most conducive dry weather patterns for the resurfacing works were considered based on the review of historical weather data at BIA maintained by the Meteorological Department. The contract for the “Overlaying Works” was awarded on September 1, 2016 to the Joint Venture of China National Aero Technology International Group (CATIC) and Shanghai New Era Airport Design.
Both these organisations were credited under of Civil Aviation Authority of China. The contract was to overlay the runway and construction of associated works on a ‘design and build’ basis. The cost of the entire project estimated was USD 50$mn. Under the major developments of the runway project the extent of work involved as follows.
Runway of BIA is upgraded to modified Code ‘F’ compliance, aerodrome Ground Lighting of the Runway and Taxiway system of BIA upgraded to CAT II as per ICAO, all of the new installation will be energy efficiency LED Light system, surface movement guidance system to the Runway and taxiway systems, new airfield light control and monitoring system, all Runway markings as per ACI new addition, and capacity of Runway system will be enhanced to meet next 20 year growth
Further, the runway width has been expanded by 15 meters, (7.5 meters from both side) enabling A380 aircraft to land successfully.
The Netherlands Airport Consultants (NACO), design and supervision consultant, was the design and supervision consultant of the runway when it was constructed and commissioned under the Phase 1 Development Project of Colombo International Airport in 1986.
The runway was closed for operations from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. considering comparatively low traffic volumes during the period as well as to minimise passenger inconvenience. Well proactive planning by the Design & Planning Division in close coordination with Air Traffic Control Division, Airport Management Division, Electrical Engineering Division and other relevant divisions of the Airport Aviation Services Limited, the Civil Aviation Authority, Srilankan Airline, AOC, Government Agencies among others. led to create a detailed spontaneous commercially feasible operation during the construction.The construction of the overlay works commenced on schedule on January 6, 2017. Daunting task of operations during this period was managed while ensuring correct level of security and safety within the airport premises with the least hassle to the passengers, airlines and cargo operations.
Seeing the national requirement, a remarkable service was comprehended by all stakeholders. The Customs, Immigration, Srilankan Airlines, AOC, Sri Lanka Air Force, Sri Lanka Police Katunayake/BIA, State Intelligence Service (SIS) , Criminal Investigation Department (CID), and the Foreign Employment Bureau. The exemplified combine collaboration of the agencies made it clear that the aviation industry of Sri Lanka had no barriers in accomplishing great feats. The collective work synergy is the result of the main runway being ready for 24 hour operation even before estimated date of April 5, 2017. The Overlay complete and BIA grandeur in order in facilitating all operations.
It is important to note an updated rescheduled staff roster duties facilitated all 16 immigration departure counters to be operational during the construction period whilst two Fast Track Immigration counters created passengers check-in within one hour from the departure. During the period of Runway closure, both inbound and out bound aircraft traffic movements were accommodated by Sri Lanka’s two other international airports. The Matala Rajapaksha International Airport (MRIA) and the Colombo Airport Ratmalana (RMA) were fully geared in facilitating connectivity of airlines during this period. All business jet aircraft movements during the closure were handled by the Colombo Airport, Ratmalana.
As the sole ground handler, SriLankan Airlines played a dedicated role on all ground handling operations by deploying their skilled ground handlers. Specialised equipment were utilised in all three international airports for the purpose.
The services of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation were also crucial in facilitating quick turn-around time in keeping with the scheduled departures. Work efficiency by their part led to crucial ground services being fulfilled on time.
The procedure for safety evaluation for closing and re-opening of the runway was carried out by the contractor. This procedure was also evaluated by the consultants and the AASL safety team and submitted to the DGCA for the approval. The Civil Aviation Authority closely monitored approval procedures are being followed upon and whether resurfacing standards are being met. All the procedures implemented during the construction are going to be the same in order to enhance the efficiency of the airport operations and this is one of the most successful projects in the region of this nature.
To ensure efficient security clearance process, the Sri Lanka Air Force was well organised by assigning adequate personnel for baggage screening in all screening points and by providing additional scanners to ensure that aircraft and passengers are fully screened with no breach of security.
Police Station Katunayake/BIA has done a very premeditated plan for handling all arriving and departing vehicles in order to avoid congestion at the entrance to the airport and long lanes of vehicles along the approach. All these were a success since the traffic plan was introduced within the airport premises and was tested two weeks prior to the Runway closure.
Both MRIA and RMA was very well utilised during the runway closure period to handle flights within their current capacities. The Colombo Airport, Ratmalana has been attracted by many smaller aircraft during this period and made arrangements for smooth passenger operations. In addition to that, facilities provided at the airport also attracted more commercial flights.
Availability of the Mattala International Airport (MRIA) round the clock for operations ensured airline to easily divert their flights to the MRIA as a destination and Terminating point. The MRIA was fully equipped to accommodate any airline that wished to operate there for connectivity and for technical stopovers during the period.
When the number of passenger movements at the BIA is concerned, it has been noticed that the difference of the reduction of passengers handled has been only 5.25 percent between January and February in 2016 and 2017. When the aircraft movements are concerned, it has been noticed that the difference of the reduction of aircraft handled in the same period this year and last year has been around 16.7 percent. Therefore, when considering the importance of the runway resurfacing and its expected future economic benefits for the country, this has not made a considerable negative impact to the country’s economy.
It has been noticed that the passengers sacrificed their precious time and had offered their fullest cooperation for the AASL to carry out all the processing activities most efficiently bearing all the temporary discomfort for the national priority. The AASL management is pleased to observe the enthusiasm of their staff and staff of other entities during the special operational period without any hesitation.
Airport Aviation Sri Lanka Limited Chairman Eng. Saman Ediriweera, Vice Chairman Ranjith De Silva, Executive Director Johanne Jayarathne and all the heads of the divisions were able to undertake this successful project under the guidelines and blessings of Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva and Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe.
