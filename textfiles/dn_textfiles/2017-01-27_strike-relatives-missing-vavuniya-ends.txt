Strike by relatives of missing in Vavuniya ends

The hunger strike by relatives of people who disappeared during the war in Vavuniya, ended yesterday following an assurance by Defence State Minster Ruwan Wijewardene that the government will take immediate measures to look into their grievances and demands.
Wijewardene visited Vavuniya yesterday to meet those involved in the hunger strike which began last Monday.
The people had protested against the lack of information on their relatives who have gone missing.
Wijewardene had reportedly promised the protesters that a meeting will be held on February 9 at Temple Trees with the participation of all the stake holders to find solutions to the strikers’ grievances.
