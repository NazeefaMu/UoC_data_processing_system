Support for fishermen to breed ‘Milk Fish’

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera instructed officials to take steps to encourage fishermen to breed Milk Fish (Vekkaya) to use as bait.
The fisher community has brought to the attention of the minister about the increase of price in imported fish bait (Ema) from China.
Most fishermen use some species of squid brought from China. Fishermen said they have to spend US$ 7 per kilo for squid. The Fisheries Ministry had selected 20 beneficiaries under the first stage to be granted Rs. 500,000 each for them to start breeding Milk Fish.
The minister had instructed the Ministry Secretary to submit a proposal on fish breeding to the Budget 2018.
In addition, it was decided to construct a hatchery for the fish breeding centre and start work this year.
