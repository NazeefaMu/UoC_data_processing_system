Christmas tale

It's that time of year again. December has come and with all the joys of Christmas. It is both a religious holiday and a worldwide cultural and commercial phenomenon. For two millennia, people all around the world have been observing it with traditions and practices that are both religious and secular in nature. But what is the real meaning of Christmas? Is it the gifts under the tree, the lights in the windows, the cards in the mail, dinners with family and friends or the shouts of "Merry Christmas"? Is this really Christmas? This is a walk down the road of history to have a look how Christmas originated and how it is celebrated today.
The story of Christmas
Jesus' birth, known as the nativity, is described in the New Testament of the Bible. Jesus was born to a woman called Mary who was engaged to Joseph, a carpenter. In Luke's account Mary was visited by an angel who brought the message that she would give birth to God's son.
According to tradition, Joseph and Mary travelled to Bethlehem shortly before Jesus' birth. Joseph had been ordered to take part in a census in his home town of Bethlehem. All Jewish people had to be counted so the Roman Emperor could determine how much money to collect from them in tax. Those who had moved away from their family homes, like Joseph, had to return to have their names entered in the Roman records.Joseph and Mary set off on the long journey from Nazareth along the valley of the River Jordan, past Jerusalem to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem the local inn was already full with people returning for the census. The innkeeper let them stay in a place below his house which was used as a stable for his animals. It was here that Mary gave birth to her son and laid him in a manger. There were in the same country shepherds watching and keeping the night watches over their flock. And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them and shared the good tidings that Jesus was born. Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and singing glory. '
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem. They bowed down and worshiped Jesus and presented him with gifts of gold, incense and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.
An ancient holiday
Before Christmas was celebrated, the middle of winter has long been a time of celebration around the world. Centuries before the arrival of Jesus, early Europeans celebrated light and birth in the darkest days of winter. Many people rejoiced during the winter solstice, when the worst of the winter was behind them and they could look forward to longer days and extended hours of sunlight.
In Scandinavia, the Norse celebrated Yule from December 21 and the winter solstice, through January. In recognition of the return of the sun, fathers and sons would bring home large logs, which they would set on fire. The people would feast until the log burned out, which could take as many as 12 days. The Norse believed that each spark from the fire represented a new pig or calf that would be born during the coming year.
The end of December was a perfect time for celebration in most areas of Europe. At that time of year, most cattle were slaughtered so they would not have to be fed during the winter. For many, it was the only time of year when they had a supply of fresh meat. In addition, most wine and beer made during the year was finally fermented and ready for drinking.
In Germany, people honoured the pagan god Oden during the mid-winter holiday. Germans were terrified of Oden, as they believed he made nocturnal flights through the sky to observe his people, and then decide who would prosper or perish. Because of his presence, many people chose to stay inside.
Saturnalia
In Rome, where winters were not as harsh as those in the far north, Saturnalia - a holiday in honour of Saturn, the god of agriculture was celebrated. Beginning in the week leading up to the winter solstice and continuing for a full month, Saturnalia was a riotous time, when food and drink were plentiful and the normal Roman social order was turned upside down. For a month, slaves would become masters. Peasants were in command of the city. Business and schools were closed so that everyone could join in the fun.
Also around the time of the winter solstice, Romans observed Juvenalia, a feast honouring the children of Rome. In addition, members of the upper classes often celebrated the birthday of Mithra, the god of the unconquerable sun, on December 25. It was believed that Mithra, an infant god, was born of a rock. For some Romans, Mithra’s birthday was the most sacred day of the year. In the early years of Christianity, Easter was the main holiday and the birth of Jesus was not celebrated. In the fourth century, church officials decided to institute the birth of Jesus as a holiday. Pope Julius I chose December 25. It is commonly believed that the church chose this date in an effort to adopt and absorb the traditions of the pagan Saturnalia festival. Christmas was first called the Feast of the Nativity and the custom spread to Egypt by 432 and to England by the end of the sixth century. By the end of the eighth century, the celebration of Christmas had spread all the way to Scandinavia. Today, in the Greek and Russian orthodox churches, Christmas is celebrated 13 days after December 25, which is also referred to as the Epiphany or Three Kings Day. This is the day it is believed that the three wise men finally found Jesus in the manger.
By holding Christmas at the same time as traditional winter solstice festivals, church leaders increased the chances that Christmas would be popularly embraced, but gave up the ability to dictate how it was celebrated. By the Middle Ages, Christianity had, for the most part, replaced pagan religion. On Christmas, believers attended church and then celebrated the feast in a carnival-like atmosphere similar to today’s Mardi Gras. Each year, a beggar or student would be crowned the “lord of misrule” and eager celebrants played the part of his subjects. The poor would go to the houses of the rich and demand their best food and drink. If owners failed to comply, their visitors would most likely terrorize them with mischief. Christmas became the time of year when the upper classes could repay their real or imagined “debt” to society by entertaining less fortunate citizens.
Christmas today
Christmas today has been “taken hostage” by dazzling materialism that puts God in the shadows and blinds the society to the needs of the hungry and the weary.
For many people, Christmas is a time of sorrow. They don't have the extra money to buy presents for their children, family, and friends. Many are saddened at Christmas time when they think of their loved ones who will not be able to come home for various reasons. Sumptuous dinners may be only a wish and not a reality for some. Those who lost a loved one recently may not tune in to sing a Christmas carol.
Yet, Christmas can be a season of great joy. It is a time of God showing His great love for us. It can be a time of healing and renewed strength. You see, Christmas is when we celebrate the birth of the Christ child. God sent His Son, Jesus, into the world to be born. His birth brought great joy to the world. Shepherds, wise men, and angels all shared in the excitement of knowing about this great event. They knew this was no ordinary baby. The prophets had told of His coming hundreds of years before.
At present we see placing too much emphasis on traditions such as Santa Claus, Rudolph and Frosty the Snowman. Shopkeepers just keep adding up these symbols on the Shelf. But we should not forget the real reason for the season. All Christmas symbols distract us from Jesus’ birth. It all amounts to too much tradition, and not enough cause for traditions.
However, each person cherishes Christmas memories in their own unique ways. Thus let us this Christmas be inspired by the delightful spirit of Christmas and spread it all around including the less fortunate.
