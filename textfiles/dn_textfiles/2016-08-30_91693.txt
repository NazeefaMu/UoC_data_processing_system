How to tame your dragon?

The Jungle Book’ set a new trend in Hollywood. More orphan in the wild tales began to make it to the screen following the international box office hit. ‘Pete’s Dragon’ is the latest to join the list. It seems to have been inspired not only by ‘The Jungle Book’ but by ‘How to Train Your Dragon’ as well.
In ‘Pete’s Dragon’ a young boy survives the car accident that kills his parents. He is almost eaten by wolves in the dark forest into which he’s wandered after the crash, and then is inexplicably rescued by a giant, furry dragon who becomes, for the next six years at least, his best friend and protector.
Pete begins calling the dragon ‘Elliot’ after the name of the dog in his favorite children’s book, and the pair live together in a cave while spending their days wandering around the forest, climbing trees and leaping off cliffs. But when loggers encroach on their lush paradise, Pete’s curiosity gets the best of him, and he’s ultimately discovered, captured, and brought back to civilization, despite the best efforts of the dragon to keep him out of harm’s way.
Haunting and opaque
Housed temporarily by a forest ranger, Grace, her fiancé, Jack, and his young daughter, Natalie, the scared and confused Pete learns what it means to be human. He discovers the meaning of belonging to a family as well. Then trouble follows when Gavin, Jack’s brother and co-manager of the logging operation that upends Pete and Elliot’s happy existence, catches sight of the dragon during Pete’s retrieval from the forest. He is determined to sedate and capture the creature. Predictably this becomes Pete’s new challenge: to protect his friend from danger. The tables are turned now that humans are more in control than mythical creatures.
The film’s opening sequence is both haunting and opaque. Disney has made a name in barbarizing fairytales and ‘Pete’s Dragon’ is no exception.
The opening sequence displays this when we too believe that Pete is about to be consumed by the dragon. However when the monster in the forest turns out to be a playful, fun-loving, and slightly dopey creature, fear leaves us and we develop a fondness for the beast.
Winning formula
Director David Lowery has certainly done his homework. He has presented us with a winning formula of a film.
His first feature movie, ‘Ain’t Them Bodies Saints’ too was heartwarming. However ‘Pete’s Dragon’ touches its audience in a different way than his maiden movie.
The music in ‘Pete’s Dragon’ is light and comforting. You get a feel good nature when you watch this film. This feeling lasts throughout the film. It is in the storyline. It is in the actors the director has chosen. It is in the music that accompanies the action. It is in the enthralling visuals too.
Bryce Dallas Howard, Robert Redford, Oakes Fegley, Oona Laurence, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban, and Isiah Whitlock Jr. make up the cast.
On the surface, ‘Pete’s Dragon’ is a children’s movie, but it has the wisdom of a tale with a morale message. It’s a story about friendship, growing up and moving on. Friends come and go – but the memories they leave behind never will. This is another jewel that Disney can add to its crown.
‘Pete’s Dragon’ is screening at Savoy cinema, Wellawaththa.
