Can De Mazenod win La Sallian Trophy this year?

The annual traditional cricket fixture between De Mazenod College and St. Benedict’s College will take place today and tomorrow at Kandana.
De Mazenod has not tasted victory since the two schools started to play for the La Sallian Trophy six years ago. St. Benedict’s won last in 2016 when De Mazenod hosted them at Kandana.
De Mazenod has played around 13 matches this season and registered a solitary outright victory against Gurukula while going down to St. Joseph’s and Mahinda.
St. Benedict’s who encountered fluctuating fortunes losing four matches and registering three outright victories this season will be eager to retain the trophy. They will rely on season’s consistent performers Mahesh Theekshana, Kaveesha Jayathilaka, wicketkeeper Shehan Fernando and paceman Prithvi Jegarajasingham, who has done well of late.
St. Benedict’s registered their three outright victories (Moratu Vidyalaya, Dharmasoka and Bandaranaike) in the tournament proper and came almost close to qualifying for the knockout tournament. Their defeats were against Wesley, Trinity, DSS and St. Thomas’, Matara.
De Mazenod meanwhile struggled during the season in the absence of Krishan Sanjula, who was with the Sri Lanka Under 19 team. They barely avoided relegation to the lower division after being placed eighth in Group ‘D’.
Skipper Mithila Geeth with his all-round abilities, Saliya Jude, Romal Fernando and Pasindu Rajamunindra are the players to watch for.
This year’s match is organised by De Mazenod College cricket wing under the direction of Rev. Bro. Pubudu Rajapaksa FSC, Deputy Principal and Coordinator of Sports. Test cricketer Dhammika Prasad, an Old Mazenodian is the livewire in organizing the game.
Chief Guest of this event is Very Rev. Br. Christy Croos FSC, the Provincial Visitor of the De La Salle Brothers.
Rev. Br. Henry Dissanayake FSC, Director - St. Benedict’s College, Rev. Br. Janaka Fonseka FSC, Director - De Mazenod College and Chaminda Vaas will grace this occasion as special guests.
