Celebrates 40 years of diplomatic ties:
KOICA to fund Kuliyapitiya technology college

To commemorate 40 years of diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and the Republic of Korea, the embassy’s development arm is highlighting the projects it has supported on the island.
At a press conference Friday, Gyongshik Chon, the Deputy Country Director of the Korea International Cooperation Agency, said that the organisation had spent more than $734 million USD on projects in Sri Lanka.
About a third of that money goes to educational initiatives, like establishing a National Teacher’s College for technology in Kuliyapitiya, he said.The college will open in 2020, and can serve 350 students a year.
KOICA has also donated high-tech laboratory equipment to the Criminal Investigations Department, established a tourism-sector training center in the Wattala area, and provided fellowship to Sri Lankan government officials to attend trainings in Korea.
Apart from grants, the Korea Eximbank, which opened a branch in Colombo two years ago, has been providing loans for the Sri Lankan government.
That money has gone to a $200 million US$ tunnel development project in Kandy, which Eximbank Chief Representative Sungsoo Jung said would be completed in 2025.
The bank has given out US$ $785 million in loans to 29 projects, to develop and “boost trade between Sri Lanka and Korea.”
