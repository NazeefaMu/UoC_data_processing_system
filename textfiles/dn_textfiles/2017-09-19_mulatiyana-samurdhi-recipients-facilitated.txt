Mulatiyana Samurdhi recipients facilitated

Many programmes have been initiated by the Government to uplift living standards of samurdhi beneficiaries in the Mulatiyana Divisional Secretariat Division. The programmes include constructing stalls, educating benificiaries about novel production and marketing strategies, providing green parks and 'diriya piyasa' housing units, counselling on drug prevention and usage, and managing domestic activities among others.
Rs. 257,000 was allocated for the programmes by the Government, Project Officer D. G. Thusitha said.
