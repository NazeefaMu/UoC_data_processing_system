Matara bare lands to be cultivated

The government has taken measures to cultivate bare paddy lands in the Matara district.
According to project officials, cultivation programmes are to be implemented at Divisional Secretariat Division level.
Thalalle Central and Thalalle North areas, Deeyagaha East and Weherahena areas are selected for the purpose.
Farmers are encouraged to use organic agricultural methods rather than artificial and chemical fertilizers as well as pesticides in cultivations. Accordingly, priority is extended to the cultivation of organic paddy, fruits, and vegetables.
Cultivation instructions, technical and organic agricultural know-how and quality planting material will also be provided to farmers as a further impetus.
The support of officials attached to Matara District Divisional Offices of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Development of Agrarian Services would be enlisted in this regard, project officials added.
