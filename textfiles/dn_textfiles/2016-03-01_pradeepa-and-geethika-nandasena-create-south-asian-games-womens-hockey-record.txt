Pradeepa and Geethika Nandasena create South Asian Games women's hockey record

 
Unknown to them and unknown to the hockey authorities two hockey playing sisters from the hill capital Pradeepa and Geethika Nandasena created a record which cannot be emulated at the 12th South Asian Games 2016 women's hockey championship played at Guwahati India this month.
They carved their names into the record books and this was the first time that a hockey championship for women was conducted and they became the first set of sisters to play in the championship and also for Sri Lanka in the South Asian Games.
The two sisters are products of Seetha Devi Balika Vidyalaya, Kandy, and they now represent the Sri Lanka Navy. They are so fair in complexion and reddish in the hot Sun that they could be mistaken for foreign girls. In fact this writer met Pradeepa for the first time when a girls team from the United Kingdom played in the hill capital. She was in her casuals and at the recorders table and I thought that she was a member of the visiting team and asked for the names of the goal scorers which she was unable to provide. More questions put an end to this embarrassment and said that she was from Sri Lanka. That was my first meeting.
Both sisters were coached by that veteran coach from the hill capital M A M Ashroff who was unlucky to miss the trip to Guwahati. He taught them the basics of how to handle the curved stick with aggression and skills from day one to the present. He is still their coach with the Sri Lanka Navy and no one could take this credit away from him.
The elder of the two sisters is Pradeepa Nilmini played for Seetha Devi Balika Vidyalaya at all age group levels starting off as a centre half and now plays as a right back. She captained her school in 2008 and also the Kandy Schools in 2008 and also the Central Province Schools at the National School Games.
Pradeepa was also a member of the Seetha Devi BV team which won many championship titles including the schools championship and the National School Games hockey championship for girls. She first played for Sri Lanka in 2009 at the Asian Games held in Thailand. Since then she has been an automatic choice to the national team.
In the year 2012 she played for the country at the Asian Games held in Singapore and also at the Asian Challengers Trophy held in Thailand in 2013 in which Sri Lanka became runners up. In the year 2010 representing the Central Province at the National Sports Festival she was adjudged the "Best Player of the Tournament" by the Ministry of Sports.
This was not the first time she had won the Best Players award as in 2009 at the Trinity Hockey sixes conducted by Trinity College she won this award for her school in the under 19 tournament for girls schools.
She has also represented the country at many international tournaments including the World League Championship. She has been playing for national champions Sri Lanka Navy since 2010.
The younger of the two Geethika Damayanthi two years younger to Pradeepa speaks little as if to say let my hockey stick do the talking. She occupies the berth of centre half often providing a challenge to her elder sister. She too played for her school at all age group levels and the senior team from 2005 to 2010, captaining the school in 2009 leading her alma mater to many championship titles including the National School Games and the Seetha Devi Sevens.
She played for the Kandy District Schools captaining it in 2009 and also the Central Province Schools and also ended up captaining it. She also played for the Sri Lanka Schools at the Junior Nationals and went on many tours abroad.
In 2012 she skippered the Sri Lanka Junior National team at Junior Asia Cup held in Singapore.
In 2012 representing the Central Province at the National Sports Festival organised by the Ministry of Sports she was adjudged the "Best Player of the Tournament, and spearheaded her team to the championship title.
Her other major tours have been to the Asian Challengers Trophy held in Singapore in 2013 and also to the Regional World Championship held in Thailand in 2012.
A very good player in spotting the weakness of the opponents and feeds the centre forwards and the flankers with neat passes to do the scoring. This is the story of the two proud sisters.
