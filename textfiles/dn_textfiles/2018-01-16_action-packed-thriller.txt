‘The Commuter’ is an action thriller film directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and written by Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi, and Ryan Engle. The film stars Liam Neeson, Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Jonathan Banks, Elizabeth McGovern and Sam Neill.

Michael (Liam Neeson), an insurance salesman is on his daily commute home in a multi-car commuter train heading out of Manhattan towards upstate New York, when it quickly turns out to become anything but routine. After being contacted by a mysterious stranger, Michael is forced to uncover the identity of a hidden passenger on his train before the last stop. As he works against the clock to solve the puzzle, he realizes a deadly plan is unfolding and is unwittingly caught up in a criminal conspiracy, one that carries life and death stakes for himself and his fellow passengers.
