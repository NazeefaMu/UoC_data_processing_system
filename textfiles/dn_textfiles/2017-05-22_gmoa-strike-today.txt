GMOA strike today

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will launch an islandwide 24 hour token strike today (Monday, 22nd) from 8.00 am to 8.00 am on the following day (Tuesday) on five demands, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the token strike will be launched because the government allegedly attacked, injured and arrested innocent students who protested against the fraudulent SAITM institution. The failure to arrest the person/persons responsible for the bomb attack on Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) is another reason for the strike.
According to Dr.Zoysa, the law has not been enforced on the culprits involved in the `shooting drama’ staged by the former SAITM CEO and this is the third reason for the strike. The fourth reason is the ‘programme’ implemented by the Government to repress of trade union leaders.
“The fifth reason for the strike is not investigating the complaints made by the GMOA to the Police and to the Bribery Commission in connection with permitting state hospitals to conduct clinical training for SAITM students,”Dr.Zoysa said.
“The Accident Service, maternity hospitals, children’s hospitals, the Cancer Hospital, Kidney Hospital and Dialysis Units and hospitals of Armed Forces will not be affected by the strike,”he added.
