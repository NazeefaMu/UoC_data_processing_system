UNP’s move to submit motion  in Parliament illegal - Counsel

The United National Party’s move to submit a motion seeking to halt financial allocations to the new Cabinet is unlawful, legal experts said.
Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana said the United National Party was set to submit a motion in Parliament on November 30 seeking to halt financial allocations to the new Cabinet, a move which he refers to as being unlawful.
“How can the UNP, which is the Opposition now, file a motion in Parliament,” he queried. “Only a MP from the ruling party has the right to file such motions”. He said adding that there was already a Finance Minister capable enough to make those decisions.
A vote is reported to be taken up today on the curtailment of expenditure for the Office of the Prime Minister. In addition to this, the UNP is also in the process of moving a motion on Friday to curtail all funds allocated to the new Cabinet.
“There is no provision for a member of the opposition to move such a motion in parliament. There is no clause in the standing orders which allows for such motions to be upheld,” he said. “How can Parliament convene when there is a Stay Order which demands that the status quo of parliament be stayed. They cannot even hold sittings.”
He added that judiciary and legislature are both on a collision course and will be in direct conflict with each other if Parliament continues to support such motions and proceedings.
