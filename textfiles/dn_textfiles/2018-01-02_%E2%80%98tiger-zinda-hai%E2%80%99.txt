‘Tiger Zinda Hai’

Tiger Zinda Hai, a film about two spies — one Indian and the other Pakistani — is largely a story about humanity, says its director Ali Abbas Zafar.
Even at the best of times, tackling a movie with Indian and Pakistani protagonists can be tricky. How did he handle it?
“[The film] is not political at all. The idea is that when there is a fight between right and wrong, what is at stake is humanity. And there’s nothing bigger than humanity,” Zafar said over phone from Mumbai.
Given the current times, there’s a question mark on the creative freedom of filmmakers in India, especially when it comes to sensitive topics.
“It’s a double-edged sword,” he said. “As a filmmaker and a creative person, I need to be sensitive to what is happening around me. I always personally think that no matter what happens, everything can be solved through dialogue. We should not take ourselves too seriously. At the end of it, it is a film... We work because of our conviction... at the same time it should not offend anyone.”
Tiger Zinda Hai is the sequel to the 2012 action film Ek Tha Tiger, which was directed by Kabir Khan. The film featured superstar Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif as Indian and Pakistani agents, and the two stars are back on screen after five years in the same roles. It was extensively shot in Abu Dhabi.
Working on the sequel, produced by Yash Raj Films, has been challenging for Zafar.
“But we are hopeful that the second part is going to live up to expectations. The story is the most important aspect of the film. Of course, Salman and Katrina are there. Both of them came on board after hearing the story, and they said that irrespective of whether it was a sequel or not, we had to do the film,” he said.
“Both of them are so comfortable with each other off-screen that as soon as a little bit padding from a scene or song happens, their chemistry blooms on camera.
I think that is an asset for a director because I don’t need to push for it too much.”
