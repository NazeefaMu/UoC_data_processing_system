First SAARC NCD Conference today

The first SAARC Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) Conference will be held at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo on March 31 and April 1, under the patronage of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the main objectives of the conference are to share country-wise experiences of NCDs, to decide on common areas of interest with regard to controlling NCDs in the SAARC region and to discuss and finalise the terms of reference for the SAARC annual meeting on NCDs.
NCD management interventions are essential for achieving a global target of a 25-percent relative reduction in the risk of premature mortality from NCDs by 2025 and a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of a one-third reduction in premature deaths from NCDs by 2030, he said.
NCDs disproportionately affect people living in low and middle-income countries, where more than three-quarters of global NCD deaths (31 million) occur. People of all age groups, regions and countries are affected by NCDs, but evidence had revealed that 15 million of all deaths attributed to NCDs are related to people between the ages of 30 and 69 years, he added.
