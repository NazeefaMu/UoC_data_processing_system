Sadeera steers Galle to final with brilliant century

SLC Super Provincial 50-over tournament:
Sadeera Samarawickrama one of the future bright stars hit a brilliant 120 off 104 balls to bring Galle a thumping 221-run win over Dambulla at the R Premadasa Stadium under lights yesterday and ensure a place in the final of the SLC Super Provincial 50-over tournament.
Dambulla will meet Colombo in the final to be played at the same venue on April 30.
Samarawickrama slammed 10 fours and two sixes to help Galle post an imposing score of 362-7 after winning the toss and batting first.
Dambulla were bundled out for a below par score of 141 off 31.3 overs.
Samarawickrama was involved in three half-century stands with Dimuth Karunaratne (22), Minod Bhanuka (25), and Sammu Ashan (53 off 54 balls, 2 fours, 3 sixes).
However the most entertaining batting of the innings came when Dasun Shanaka and Seekkuge Prasanna two big hitters of the cricket ball were in partnership.
The pair raced to 63 off 26 balls for the seventh wicket with Shanaka hitting an unbeaten 49 off 26 balls with 5 fours and 3 sixes and Prasanna 36 off 17 balls inclusive of 3 fours and 3 sixes.
It was poor batting by Dambulla that led to their downfall with only Ashan Priyanjan showing any kind of resistance completing an unbeaten half-century off 67 balls with four fours and two sixes.
Scores: Galle 362-7 in 50 overs (Sadeera Samarawickrama 120, Dimuth Karunaratne 22, Minod Bhanuka 25, Sammu Ashan 53, Dasun Shanaka 49 n.o., Seekkuge Prasanna 36, Asitha Fernando 4/62)
Dambulla 142 in 31.3 overs (Ashan Priyanjan 50 n.o., Kusal Mendis 23, Chaturanga de Silva 3/20, Dasun Shanaka 2/24, Akila Dhananjaya 2/23)
