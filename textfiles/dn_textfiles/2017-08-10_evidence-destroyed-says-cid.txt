Rathupaswala shooting:
Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officials investigating the Rathupaswala shooting incident in 2013, informed Gampaha Chief Magistrate D.A.Ruwanpathirana that all evidence in relation to the shooting incident have been destroyed.
CID Inspector Ranjith Munasinghe submitting a further report to court yesterday said eventhough the Western Province North DIG had entrusted then Gampaha ASP Munasinghe with the investigations into the incident, he had relegated the job to another Police Inspector and this had led to the destruction of evidence. Three persons were killed when army personnel opened fire at a peaceful protests of Rathupaswala residents demanding pure potable water in 2013.
Three suspects from Sri Lanka Army including Brigadier Deshapriya Gunawardena who was in charge of the army contingent that was deployed to quell the protest, were further remanded by Gampaha Chief Magistrate D. A. Ruwanpathirana till August 23.
