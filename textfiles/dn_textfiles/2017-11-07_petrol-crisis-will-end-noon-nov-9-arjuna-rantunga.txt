Petrol crisis will end by noon, Nov. 9: Arjuna Rantunga

 
The petrol issue would come to an end by noon, November 9 after the fuel shipment reaches Sri Lanka by 9 pm tomorrow, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Rantunga said today.
He said that it was predicted that the fuel ship would reach Sri Lanka by 11 pm tomorrow but it has been calculated by observing the position of the ship with satellite technology that the ship would reach the country 9 pm. 
"With the shipment reaching the harbour tomorrow the distribution would enable the consumers to get fuel by noon, the day after," said Minister Ranatunga.
Minister made this observation in response to the queries made by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena on the issue of the fuel crisis caused with the rejection of a shipment of substandard fuel. 
Queried of the quality of the fuel shipments being imported, Minister Ranatunga stated that he was sure of the quality of the fuel shipment as he had assigned two persons to get it inspected before being embarked.
