Civil Aviation Training Centre - SL conducts ICAO Training Instructor Course Part 2

The Civil Aviation Training Centre, Sri Lanka was the venue for the ICAO Training Instructor Course (TIC) Part 2 that was delivered from September 4-8. The course was delivered by Ismael Faraji, ICAO TRAINAIR PLUS Programme Expert, who is also a permanent faculty member of the Civil Aviation Technology College of Iran.
The course was conducted exclusively for 10 senior instructors of the CATC. With the successful conclusion of this course, the CATC Sri Lanka now has a senior faculty trained directly by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which would tremendously enhance its competitive edge.
The ICAO TIC has two parts. Part 1 which is an eLearning course comprises 30 hours of online learning. Part 2 is delivered in a classroom and is of one-week's duration. All 10 senior instructors of the CATC first completed Part 1 online to become eligible to follow part 2.
The CATC is run by Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd (AASL), the state- owned blue chip company that operates the island’s international airports and the Colombo airport.
AASL is also the Air Navigation Services Provider (ANSP) for the Colombo Flight Information Region, a vast oceanic air space of approximately 900,000 square kilometres extending mostly to the east of Sri Lanka.
The CATC was established in 1984 under a UNDP funded project implemented by the ICAO. At present the CATC conducts training in Air Traffic Control, Aeronautical Communications, Air Traffic Safety Electronics, Aeronautical Information Services, Airport Security, Airport Fire Services and Airport Management, all of which belong to the forte of Airport & Aviation Services.
It provides the company staff regular refresher training as well as career development training to enable them man critical airport operations and air navigation services. In addition to classroom training, the CATC also maintains a virtual training wing that provides eLearning for company employees.
The CATC is a full member of the TRAINAIR PLUS programme of the ICAO since 2014.
ICAO TRAINAIR PLUS is a global cooperative network of aviation training institutions delivering high quality training and sharing it amongst themselves. Presently there are only 57 aviation training institutions worldwide that enjoy this full accreditation. Fourteen of those are in the Asia Pacific Region and CATC Sri Lanka is proud to be one of them. It is also the only institution in Sri Lanka that enjoys this accreditation at present.
TRAINAIR PLUS members have to meet stringent requirements stipulated by the ICAO which covers instructional design, training delivery, training quality assurance, trainer quality assurance, record keeping and documentation. All members are thoroughly assessed initially by the ICAO and then reassessed once every three years.
CATC Sri Lanka successfully underwent its last reassessment in September 2015 and is gearing itself for its next reassessment in 2018.
Since gaining full membership in the TRAINAIR PLUS programme, CATC Sri Lanka is gradually emerging as a regional aviation training institution. Over the past few years, it has regularly provided training to a growing number of airport operational personnel from Maldives, Nepal and Nigeria while inquiries from many other countries are being processed.
The entire faculty of the CATC comprise qualified and trained personnel drawn from the company’s operations who have years of experience in their trades. The faculty is also supplemented by visiting resource personnel from the universities, airlines and other key players in the industry.
The Instructional Design Unit of the CATC has Course Developers trained by the ICAO and is equipped with facilities to develop training courses that deploy state-of-the-art delivery methods such as blended learning.
The CATC is also an institution registered with the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission of Sri Lanka for the provision of vocational training. In 2011, the CATC offered the first ever ‘Diploma programme in Aviation Studies’ to be conducted in Sri Lanka by a state organization.
This programme which has already been conducted five times and is in progress for the sixth cohort, is aimed at providing trained and qualified personnel for the junior and middle managerial positions in the local aviation industry and its allied industries and targets the large population of ‘A’ level qualified youngsters who are aspiring for avenues of tertiary education. The CATC also runs several non-aviation programmes for the local industry and general public.
Realizing the vast potential of the CATC as an effective aviation trainer, AASL has launched several projects for its further development.
Two flagship projects are underway for the replacement of the existing Air Traffic Control 2D simulator with a state of the art 3D simulator and to upgrade the Navigational Aids training facilities. Both projects are scheduled to be completed early next year.
The CATC also has a comprehensive information resource centre in civil aviation which has a large assortment of reference material pertaining to various aspects of the aviation industry as well as general reading material. The CATC plans to open this resource centre to the general public as well in the near future.
Speaking at the closing ceremony of the course held on September 8 at the CATC auditorium, AASL Vice Chairman Ranjith De Silva stated that the company is at a critical stage of development with several development projects in the pipeline and emphasized the importance of training the industry’s human resources in order to make these developments meaningful. The Executive Director AASL Johanne Jayaratne was also present.
“We plan to provide training in trades connected with airport operations to Sri Lankans so that they can take up employment overseas,” says Eng. Athula Seneviratne, the head of the CATC, explaining its institutional and national role. “As a TRAINAIR PLUS member we are entitled to borrow and deliver the courses developed by other members which are available in a library managed by the ICAO. At present there are nearly 100 courses in this growing library. We too have contributed two courses to it, the ‘Advanced Test and Measuring Techniques course’ and the ‘AIS/MAP Publication Specialist course’ both of which are in high demand. We plan to contribute two more courses next year. Our aim is to become the most sought after aviation training institution in the region.”
By having its own training centre, AASL makes a massive saving annually while substantial revenue is also earned by the offering of training to external clients, the greater part of it being foreign exchange.
