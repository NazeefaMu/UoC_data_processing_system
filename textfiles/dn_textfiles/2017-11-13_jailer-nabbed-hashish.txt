Jailer nabbed with hashish

A jailer carrying hashish into the Dumbara Bogambara Prison for sale among its inmates was arrested by prison security officers on November 10.
The security officers said they had kept the jailer under close observation as his close association with certain inmates caused suspicion. Accordingly, they examined the guard while he was entering the prison on November 10 and found 14.84 gm of hashish in his possession.
The suspect was handed over to the Prison Superintendent and then to Pallekelle police for further investigations. The 43-year-old jailer is a resident of Werallagama, Katugastota. He may have been carrying on the illicit trade for many months, police said.
