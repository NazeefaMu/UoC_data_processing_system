Female deputy principal, two teachers in bribery net

The deputy principal and two other teachers attached to a national school were arrested by the officers of the Bribery Commission yesterday for allegedly soliciting a Rs. 7,500 bribe to admit a student to the year six class.
This follows complaints by a group of parents alleging that school authorities were demanding Rs. 7,500 in respect of each student gaining admission to the year six class this year.
Acting on the complaint, bribery officials visited the school yesterday and caught the deputy principal red handed while she was accepting the money.
The deputy principal and two teachers were handed over Alawathugoda Police for further action.
