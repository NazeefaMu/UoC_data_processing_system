Number three spot up for grabs
New Zealand will be a watershed tour – chief selector

Sometime this week the national selectors will sit down to pick the squad for New Zealand and considering all what has gone before in the lead up to the tour it is not going to be an easy task. Sri Lanka are due to tour New Zealand next month.
Following the Cricket World Cup in February-March, Sri Lanka hosted Pakistan, India and West Indies at home and after losing to the two Asian teams they finally managed to turn defeat into victory by beating West Indies in the Tests and ODI series.
“Winning the series was a good thing it’s important for a team and it does a world of good for the confidence of a team,” said chairman of selectors Kapila Wijegunawardene.
“We should not make this West Indies win just a flash in the pan but build on it. After losing two back to back series to Pakistan and India we have turned the corner.
“There was more experimentation being carried out during the Pakistan and Indian series now we’ve kind of honed in on the combination barring maybe one or two adjustments. It’s very important for the team to build on this success going forward.
“There are still areas to be looked at the boys are still making fundamental mistakes which you can’t do at this level. What we are hoping is that they will build on this, have a very good series in New Zealand and go into the England tour next summer with a lot of confidence under their belt,” he said.
One of the key holes the four-member selection committee comprising Wijegunawardene, Amal Silva, Brendon Kuruppu and Hemantha Wickremaratne will be hoping to plug as quickly as they can is the vital number three position in the batting.
Following the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara who had held that position for more than a decade, the heir apparent was Lahiru Thirimanne who was groomed to occupy that spot, but unfortunately the left-hander has failed to deliver and the selectors were forced to drop him from the second Test against West Indies and try out 20-year-old Kusal Mendis.
“What we planned earlier is not quite working out the way we anticipated, we will be open to making a few experiments in that position to see who best needs to be slotted in there,” said Wijegunawardene.
“We are going through some of the performances from the ‘A’ team. When you are limited with the solution you have to take there is some element of risk which is being forced on you trying to identify the right player for the line-up,” he said.
Wijegunawardene named Udara Jayasundera, Kithuruwan Vithanage and Kusal Mendis as the players they have in mind for the spot.
“It’s a matter of getting his confidence back for Thirimanne. It can happen to every player now and again. He needs to work on his technical flaws and get his confidence back,” said Wijegunawardene.
“I am sure once he gets a couple of good scores under his belt he will be back on track. Right now he is not really fulfilling his role in that position.”
Whether Thirimanne can find a place in the side other than at number three, Wijegunawardene said, “We need to look at the other positions that we have lined-up in the last three series and see whether they are being fulfilled by the players occupying the slot. We need to look at it with an open mind, what role can be delegated to Thirimanne.”
Wijegunawardene said that he was not overly satisfied with the Lankan batting performances in the Tests and called for more improvement.
“Our batsmen should have been a lot more assertive and convincing with their batting performances. There are lots of areas to improve in the batting,” said Wijegunawardene.
“There were some fundamental mistakes being made, batsmen getting out to shots that should not have been played in certain situations, we need to address that. In the Test arena we need our batsmen playing themselves in and occupying the crease and playing the ball on merit. They also need to be a lot more selective in their shot making than what we see now,” he said.
Wijegunawardene said that the New Zealand tour could turn a new leaf on Sri Lanka’s cricket future.
“We feel New Zealand is going to be a watershed tour where the new combination has an opportunity to really turn a new leaf and start building for the next 3-4 years,” said Wijegunawardene.
“If you really play to your potential and be disciplined in your approach there is no reason why we can’t come off winning this series. I have a lot of confidence along with the rest of the selectors in the abilities of our cricketers.
“We got a very talented set of boys who are capable of reaching great heights if they are really disciplined in their approach which is what we are advocating the coach staff to focus on.”
