Ammo, gold quest ends in failure

Vavuniya Police and the STF drew a blank when they excavated the Thachchinakulam cemetery in Puliyankulama, Vavuniya on Wednesday following information that the LTTE had buried arms, ammunition and gold in the cemetery. The excavations were carried out after obtaining a Court order after information that some unidentified persons were digging up the cemetery at night for gold and arms said to have been buried by the LTTE.
