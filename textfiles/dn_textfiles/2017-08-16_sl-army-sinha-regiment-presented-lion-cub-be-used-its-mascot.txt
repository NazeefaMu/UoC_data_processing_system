SL Army Sinha Regiment presented with lion cub to be used as its mascot

"The entire nation's honour is due to the valiant war heroes who sacrificed their lives to defeat terrorism completely in 2009 after a 30 year war," said Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G Jayasena, addressing the gathering at a ceremony held at the Dehiwala Zoological Gardens to mark the handing over of a lion cub to the Sri Lanka Army Sinha Regiment to be used as its mascot recently.
The lion cub was officially handed over by the Deputy Minister to Sinha Regiment Commander Major General Boniface Perera.
Deputy Minister Jayasena said the people could today move about without fear due to the great self sacrifice made by the war heroes to defeat the cruel terrorists.
Nearly 3,862 men belonging to the Sinha Regiment alone had sacrificed their lives in the war against terrorism.
A lion cub was presented to the regiment in the past too to be used as its mascot. Since that cub was now too old and feeble, the new club was presented to the Regiment on request to be trained as its mascot.
She said Minister Gamini Jayawickreme Perera had asked her to convey his best wishes to the event as he was unable to attend the ceremony due to an urgent official engagement.
Although the lion cub was handed over to the Regiment, its health and food would be monitored by the Zoological Department.
Director General of the Department of Zoological Gardens Dhammika Malsinghe and Assistant Director Anoma Priyadarshanee were also present on the occasion.
The lion club presented to the Regiment was one among the four cubs born to a German lioness by Chinese lion ‘Sula’ at the Hambantota Safari Park.
