Rare welcomes Glenfiddich’s global brand ambassador

Rare at Residence by Uga Escapes, welcomed Glenfiddich’s global brand ambassador, Struan Grant Ralph for an exclusive wine dinner with 30 other selected guests.
The event was dedicated to the introduction of Glenfiddich’s premier range of single malt whisky, renowned as the best in the world, where the dinner featured a lively whisky tasting session, conducted by their brand ambassador himself.
Struan Grant Ralph, spent time creating some of his signature cocktails at the Rare bar which was one of the highlights of the evening.
