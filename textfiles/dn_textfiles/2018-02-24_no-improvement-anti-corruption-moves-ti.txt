No improvement in anti-corruption moves: TI

Sri Lanka has made no significant improvement in its perceived levels of public sector corruption, according to Transparency International’s 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranking of 180 countries released yesterday.
While the country has moved up 4 places, from 95th to 91st, its CPI score has only risen by two points, from 36 to 38, which Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) says represents a slow rate of progress.
“A close analysis of Sri Lanka’s positioning in the CPI from 2012 to 2017 shows that despite institutional strengthening of anti-corruption agencies following the 19th Amendment, consistent failure in implementation has led to very limited progress,” said TISL Executive Director Asoke Obeyesekere at a press conference held Thursday for this year’s CSI launch.
“For any change in score to be considered significant, it requires typically a change of 6 points. That is a global measure. But [this year] we have seen a two point increase,” he added.
Sri Lanka has failed to show such progress in its CPI score for each of the past five years.
“Citizens still face corruption when trying to avail of essential public services, ranging from waste collection to school enrollment. Therefore, the limited change in the perception of public sector corruption reflects the limited change experienced by people in their everyday encounters with the state.”
The index uses a point scale of zero to 100, where zero is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean. This year, explained Obeyesekere, more than two-thirds of countries scored below 50. Sri Lanka, with a score of 38, fell below the international average of 43, and below the Asia-Pacific regional average of 44.
Compared to other SAARC member countries, Sri Lanka ranks third, following Bhutan with a score of 67 and India with a score of 40.
