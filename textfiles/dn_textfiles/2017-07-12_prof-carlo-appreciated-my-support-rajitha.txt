Prof. Carlo appreciated my support: Rajitha

Prof. Carlo Fonseka called and thanked me for the support given to him while he was holding the position of Sri Lanka Medical Council President, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated.
Minister Senaratne said earlier Prof. Fonseka told him that he will not do anything to harm the 40-year long friendship between them.
The minister expressed these views when he met a group of journalists at the Health Ministry yesterday.
Minister Senaratne also stated that the behaviour of Government Medical Officers’ Association tarnish the image of the profession. The SAITM started in 2006 but they did not protest against it during that time because of the fear of the previous regime. They never discussed matters with the Health Ministry.
Corrupted people in the previous regime try to portray clean people as corrupt due to the fear of going through a Court process under State Property Act which does not grant bail for suspects.
They speak about an act of corruption connecting the President and an Australian company. The government is in the process of taking action against all corrupt culprits in the previous regime, the minister stated.
