Tamil prisoners on hunger strike

The three prisoners at the Anuradhapura prison will continue their hunger strike for 30 days demanding the adjudication of their cases without any further delay. The National Movement for the Release of Political Prisoners (NMRPP) conducted a protest to release these prisoners who had been transferred from the Vavuniya prison to Anuradhapura prison on October 22 by the Supreme Court.
Convener of NMRPP, Father M. Saththiwel told the Daily News that the matter on prisoners should be solved politically. “We want to know the reason for delaying of the process. Relevant authorities have failed to take necessary steps to solve the problem within the 9 years after the war ended. The government cannot take the matter lightly,” he said.
Madiarasan Sulakshan, Darshan Ganesh and R. Thirawarul are Tamil prisoners who are held at the Anuradhapura prison. A discussion to ascertain their present status was conducted by NMRPP yesterday at ‘Gurumedura’.
