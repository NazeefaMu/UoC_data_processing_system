Sri Lanka, Seychelles join to fight drug menace

 
Seychelles President Danny Faure praised President Maithripala Sirisena’s campaign against illegal drug trade and said his country would extend the fullest cooperation to Sri Lanka’s endeavour to stop drugs and narcotics smuggling.
He gave this assurance when he called on President Sirisena at the President’s Official Residence on Monday. The two leaders discussed a range of bilateral relations, especially about close cooperation in tourism, fisheries and agriculture.
President Faure said Seychelles too is facing the menace of drug smuggling and said the two countries could share intelligence on drug smuggling in their joint fight against drugs.
President Sirisena, referring to the powerful drug cartels said many political leaders fear to talk against the drug mafia and said he was glad that President Faure fearlessly speaks against drug smugglers. “I consider you as a dear friend with a common cause,” President Sirisena said.
President Faure commented, “I am strongly with you in our common fight against the drug menace.” He thanked Sri Lanka for providing high professionals to Seychelles and said, “Our students learn from Sri Lankan teachers, your doctors look after our health and your legal experts provide us excellent judiciary services.” He said former Attorney General of Seychelles, Anthony Fernando is a Sri Lankan and he is now a respected judge.
“Now we do not go to Europe for legal expertise, we come to Sri Lanka,” the Seychelles President said.
President Faure invited President Sirisena to be the chief guest at the function to be held in October 2018 to mark 30 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Seychelles Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture, Michael Benstrong, Presidential secretary Aude Labaleine, Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Esala Weerakoon and Seychelles Ambassador David Pierre also participated in the discussion.
