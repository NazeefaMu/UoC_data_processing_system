Stars to descend on the stage

The stage is set to host the 34th Sarasaviya Film Awards. The gala event which will see some of the cinema greats being felicitated for their contributions to uplift the cinema industry will be held at the BMICH on August 3.
This year Cargills has joined hands with the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited to make the starry night a reality. The joint venture itself turns a new page in history as it is the first time that two main organizations of this nature have joined together to bring about an awards festival of such nature. Furthermore, this year’s awards ceremony will be dedicated to globally acclaimed Sri Lankan filmmaker and the Father of Sri Lankan Cinema the Late Dr Lester James Peries. This also marks the first time in Sri Lankan history that a film festival will be dedicated to an individual.
Films screened in 2016 and 2017 will compete at the event in 32 categories. Awards will be presented separately for both years. A special jury award will be handed over to a filmmaker who has made his or her debut to filmmaking by obtaining the Public Performance Board Certificate but not screened in cinemas during the period. The most popular film award will be handed over to the film which the most number of spectators have viewed. Two Rana Thisara Lifetime Achievement Awards and the Ranapala Bodhinagoda Memorial Award for film criticism will also be presented. An award titled the Dr Lester James Peries award will be included in the awards list.
Film songs rerecorded to suit the stage will be performed by artistes. The event will be choreographed by Channa Wijewardena. Ranga Dassanayake will handle the music.
The oldest running film awards ceremony in Sri Lanka the Sarasaviya Film Awards is presented by ANCL’s weekly cinema tabloid Sarasaviya. It is the longest surviving film weekly in the country and has garnered many cinema buffs.
Sarasaviya, the name which derives from the goddess of knowledge, music, arts, wisdom and learning, Saraswathi, has always been strongly rooted with the arts field in the country. It is the longest-running arts-related Sinhala weekly in the country and is the only Sinhala magazine which is dedicated to the local cinema, television, stage drama, music and other forms of arts.
The first Sarasaviya Film Awards was launched in 1964 at the Asoka Cinema Hall, Colombo. This occurred 17 years after the first film was screened. Another significant fact in connection with the Sarasaviya Awards is that Dr Lester James Peries’ ‘Gamperaliya’ won the Best Film and Best Director awards and then went on to bag the Golden Peacock at the International Film Festival of India.
There is a belief among all those in connection with the film industry that one’s cinematic journey is not complete if they have not gotten a Sarasaviya Film Award.
Throughout the years as each festival took to the stage, the Sarasaviya Film Awards moulded its own unique identity. Since then many greats have carried home the statuette. Their movie career would not have been complete without having a Sarasaviya Award on their awards shelf. It is not only the jury awards that they strive for. Fans get to play their part by selecting their favourites to gift them with the Most Popular Actor and Actress awards. The Sarasaviya Film Awards has often been referred to as Sinhala cinema’s equivalent to The Oscars.
Many significant Indian stars have graced the past Sarasaviya Film Awards. Sunil Dutt and Nutan were the chief guests at the Sarasaviya Film Awards in 1966. Meena Kumari graced the occasion in 1968. Mani Ratnam was present at the event in 2003. Throughout the years many awards ceremonies which ooze of glamour and glitz have joined the scene. However, the Sarasaviya Film Awards managed to keep apart from the rest especially because it honours the best among the best.
Considered as one of the oldest movie production companies in the island, Ceylon Theaters will be screening films for free to commemorate the Sarasaviya cinema week which will be held from July 24 to 28 at the Regal cinema, Colombo. The unedited version of Dr Peries’ ‘Delovak Athara’ will be screened at the Regal cinema, Kandy, on July 21 at 4.30 pm as a part of the event lineup.
