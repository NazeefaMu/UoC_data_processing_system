Entrepreneur-development workshop

There is a tremendous demand for ayurvedic products in the World Market today and we should grab that opportunity, without letting it go. Steps should be taken export ayurvedic products in bulk to attract the international buyers, said Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage.
He said so at an entrepreneur-development workshop held at the Ministry premises on August 3rd. The participants at the workshop included undergraduates following the indigenous medicine university course at the Colombo University and those who follow the same course at the Wickramarchchi Ayurvedic Institute in Gampaha.
The workshop was conducted with the participation of the Primary Industries Ministry Secretary Bandula Wickremaarachchi, Prof. D.N. Weeerasinghe, Dr. Kumuduni Gunaseker and Senior Assistant Secretary to the Ministry Chathuri Nakandala.
Minister Gamage speaking further, informed the participants that there was US $ 120 billion market for ayurvedic products in the World Market and underscored the importance of increasing the qualitative ayurvedic products in the country. He invited the future Ayurvedic doctors to be conscious of this great demand the world is making and depending on our response, we would be in a position to earn much-needed foreign exchange.
Disclosing what plans his Ministry has, to coop-up with the world-wide great demand for ayurvedic product with quality, Minister Gamage said that soon, steps would be taken to create awareness among the polity, what benefits ayurvedic medicine contribute for healthy living and said he plans to have a specific area allocated in every village to give preference to grow plants with medicinal benefit to healthy living and his Ministry would readily provide all assistance necessary, to successfully move with the new venture.
“It is rather unfortunate and our sad experience that practically all await to get government jobs. But there is great opportunity at hand and a healthy environment is there to come out and run a business of one’s own. I encourage those keen to grab the opportunity to step into the business world without wasting time looking for State-jobs. The workshop ended with a discussion followed by the key note address.
