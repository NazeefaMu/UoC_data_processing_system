Sir John, Queen Elizabeth, ‘Royal Astrologer’ & KDU:
Soothsayer spot on

In that short period of premiership -October 1953 to April 1956; following the resignation of honourable statesman Dudley Senanayake as PM, whose government mishandled the Hartal ’53 killing nine rioters, Sir John Kothalawala was very much in the news. He planned a grand welcome to the Queen who was expected to visit with the Duke of Edinburgh.
Princess Elizabeth undertook a tour of British colonies on a long-planned international tour that covered Africa, Australia and New Zealand and Ceylon in February 1952.
The royal party was to visit us a month later, when one Sellaheva, a fairly well-known soothsayer declared that the Princess would never make it on the scheduled period according to the planetary positions that prevailed, a prediction that received wide publicity. Whilst enjoying a short break in Kenya en-route with Prince Philip the princess’ husband, her father, the 56-year-old King George VI had fallen ill.
The royal pair was relaxing at a game-viewing lodge in Nairobi. They spent the night surrounded by undomesticated animals. It was there that the princess became Queen after George VI passed away in his sleep. Her Majesty could not make her scheduled visit as she had to return home due to the sudden death of father proving Sellaheva’s forecast true. Sellahewa styled himself as ‘royal astrologer’, became a highly respected astrologer overnight. His services were sought by top politicians and rich businessmen for auspicious times and horoscope reading. Even before Princess was crowned in St Paul’s Cathedral, our locals crowned Sellaheva as the undisputed ‘King of Stars’.
The Princess, now a Queen, in a rescheduled itinerary visited us in April 1954. The visit was a huge success. During her visit, PM Sir John advised Queen Elizabeth to appoint his friend Sir Oliver Goonetilleke as Governor-General in succession to Lord Soulbury. A conference of South-East Asian Heads of State was held in Colombo immediately after the royal visit.
This meeting was to lead to larger meetings at Bandung where Sir John was much in the news. During his premiership, in December 1955, we gained permanent membership of the United Nations Organisation. Scribes of the day named the PM, ‘Hero of Bandung’, for his great role at the summit.
A confident Prime Minister Sir John consulted Sellahewa and moved for an early dissolution in February 1956 although Parliament could have continued until 1957. Sellaheva rushed to predict a landslide victory for Sir John’s UNP at the general election which was fixed for April 1956. Bandaranaike had other ideas, ‘Sinhala only in 24 hours’. It became a great misfortune for the UNP—when the party led by Kothalawala, the ‘Hero of Bandung’ was reduced to just eight seats. SWRD Bandaranaike’s coalition with Philip and Dahanayake won a landslide; SWRD became the Prime Minister, while the ‘Royal Astrologer’ went missing for some time.
Queen’s Sigiriya climb
The famous anecdote that was doing rounds six decades ago was when the Queens skirt went up in the breeze as she climbed up the Sigiriya staircase constructed for the occasion.
Sir John who was just behind the royal couple had screamed at the press cameramen “Click your cameras, you devils”. The photographer himself narrated the story in the Sunday Observer years ago. According to him, the real Sinhala words spoken by carefree and jovial Sir John were down to earth.
“Ganin Yakko -------- Ganin”.
The SRI series registration
In his time, he was a favourite object for ridicule by cartoonists like Collettes and G S Fernando; and it was famously said that he giggled loudest when the joke was on him, a most admirable characteristic especially for those in the public eye.
The new SLFP regime after the 1956 victory in a surge of nationalistic passion commenced the Sri series for registration of vehicles instead of English letters. Sir John in a skilful trick had the coveted numbers 1 Sri 1 for his brand new Cadillac. This was followed by 2 Sri 2, 3 Sri 3 …. For his cars and it was a fair amusement for the cartoonist. In One of Collette’s cartoons, Sir John was in ceremonial attire getting into his limousine whilst his political opponent was shown to be pensively reflecting on the sight standing on the street. The cartoon carried the diction “Only A Cad ‘Lac that way”.
During the battle for the general election in 1956, the contender in a paddy - growing area invited the Prime Minister to chair a meeting. Sir John, never discriminate on race, caste, creed or religion during his carrier, and was brave enough never talk about it. At the meeting, he was somewhat intoxicated. The production of delicious kitul hakuru was a cottage industry in this village. The government, a month ago had increased the price of sugar. During question time, a bold youngster yelled: “Hamuduruwane, why have you increased the price of sugar?” Sir John staggered straight and shouted: “Ayi, yako, umbata hakuru thiyenne! -Why, devil, you have jaggery!”
Once he had invited the entire guild of cartoonists to bring some of the originals of their work at his Kandawala Bungalow, Ratmalana and entertained them with scotch and his usual egg hoppers. A selected few cartoons he got preserved in frames and hung them in his spacious office room.
That was the jovial and good spirit of Sir John Kotalawela.
Retirement
Sir John, after his first and only set back, decided to wish goodbye to politics and party leadership, spend his time mostly on his farm in Kent, England. In 1979 he donated his residence and the 48-acre Kandawala estate to the government for establishing a National Defence Academy. He served in the Volunteer Force joining the Ceylon Infantry in 1923 rising to be a Colonel. He was posthumously made Hon General by President JR Jayewardene. John Kothalawala was knighted in June 1948 and made a Privy Councillor in 1955.
He was back in Sri Lanka in the latter part of his life and following his death on October 2, 1980, the Defense Academy was opened. It was raised to university status and is presently the ‘General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University’ [KDU] to which the present government has decided to absorb SAITM private medical students successfully ending a long dispute–undoubtedly, a fitting tribute to the fearless third Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.
