Kiwi Vatuvai on medical leave over pill scandal

Wellington, Tuesday: New Zealand Warriors winger Manu Vatuvai was placed on medical leave Tuesday amid a prescription drug abuse scandal rocking the Auckland-based club.
The veteran is the most senior of a group of players from the club who allegedly took a cocktail of sleeping pills and energy drinks while on a night out last week.
Six players were subsequently dropped from last week's Warriors game in Australia' National Rugby League and from international Test matches taking place this weekend.
Warriors managing director Jim Doyle said Vatuvai, 30, was placed on medical leave after consultations with doctors. "Following medical advice received today, Manu is now on leave," he said in a brief statement.
"We would ask that everyone respects his and his family’s right to privacy at this time."
