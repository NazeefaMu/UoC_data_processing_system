There's more to it than meets the eye

There's more to playing Under 19 cricket at international level than playing first eleven cricket at school. That was the hard truth that emerged from Sri Lanka's performance at the recently concluded ICC Under 19 World Cup held in Bangladesh. Sri Lanka finished fourth in the overall standings losing to India in the semi-finals and then to Bangladesh in the play-off for third place.

"The batting was the main thing we were not getting that extra 30-40 runs. The players are not converting scores of 20-30 to another level. Other than Charith (Asalanka) nobody could go to the 60-70 mark then automatically what happens is the partnerships we are looking at is not happening," said Sri Lanka under 19 coach Roger Wijesuriya assessing the team's performance at the Under 19 World Cup.
"We were getting only 30-40 partnerships and at times the situation was so nice for them that they needed only to occupy the crease to get the required total. Pacing out an innings is something they will learn with experience.
"The way I see it is there are two things, one is the pressure and the other the risk factor. For e.g. Charith Asalanka handling the pressure is very good but he takes the risks too early, then he realized it and kept on batting. There are two kinds of players - one lot is they don't know how to take the pressure and take the score to another level, the other is the risk situation that they are taking too early," he said.
Overall Wijesuriya said that he was not happy with the performance of the team because they were well prepared for the tournament.
"We had a very good balanced side and the boys were very clear with the plans and what we wanted to achieve. They knew what was expected of them in all three departments but once you come to the middle neither can the coach or anybody do it for them," said Wijesuriya.
"I am really happy with my bowling and fielding the bowlers stuck to their plans. If we had totals of 240-250 the wickets would be very much easy to take because the batting side has to go for it. You take the Bangladesh match we had a golden opportunity to score about 240, if we had that total the bowlers would have got the chance to take the wickets, it would have made their job easy," he said.
"With Avishka's (Gunawardene) assistance everything was very nicely planned in the batting but at the end of the day Avishka can't go to the middle and do it for them. The players must realize that it is their responsibility to do it in the middle they must learn to adapt to the situation and pace out the innings accordingly. It's a learning process for everybody and it won't come overnight. The more exposure they get playing matches they'll learn."
Wijesuriya said the difference between the Indian and Bangladesh sides in comparison to Sri Lanka was that their players had got great exposure to playing cricket at a higher level.
"The majority of the Indian cricketers play in the Ranji trophy so there exposure to bigger cricket is very much high," explained Wijesuriya. "You take Bangladesh before the under 19 World Cup they had played something like 30-50 matches whereas our players had not played even 15 matches. The Bangladeshis they camp together and if you see the facilities they've got we can't even get closer to them. The ground facilities and centres everything is fantastic.

"In Sri Lanka if an international team tours the country we play about 20-25 players and at the end of the day nobody gets the best exposure. This World Cup we went with 15 players but only 13 played that is how we should play a series at home against international teams," he said.
Wijesuriya said the shortcomings at under 19 level had nothing to do with the schools.
"The schools are producing the cricketers. Schools can't do anything more than that. It is our duty from Sri Lanka Cricket to get the players to train more with our district coaches and play district, provincial or zonal matches and in under 23 tournaments to give them the exposure and maturity," said Wijesuriya. "There's no point blaming the school associations because they have done their duty. It's our duty from SLC to fine tune them and get them to higher level.
"Last year we didn't play an under 17 two-day and under 19 three-day tournament as scheduled. These are tournament that must be played as scheduled. Every year we should have a proper calendar going then the selectors have an easy task to pick the best. It's an ongoing process. At the same time for inbound and outbound tours we must try to see whether we can give one or two boys to play in the Sri Lanka 'A' team. "We have to identify about 15 to 20 players and get them to play at a higher level with senior cricketers so that they get the exposure and learn. That is how we can make that extra mile. These are ways where we can improve these boys. They need exposure at higher level than they get at school," Wijesuriya said.
From the 15-member squad that took part at the U19 World Cup only two players Chamindu Mendis and Jehan Daniel will be eligible to play at the next U19 World Cup which will be held in 2018 in New Zealand. However Wijesuriya stated that the majority of the players could still play under 19 cricket for another year and they would figure quite prominently in the two upcoming series scheduled for June-July against South Africa and a tour to England in July-August.
