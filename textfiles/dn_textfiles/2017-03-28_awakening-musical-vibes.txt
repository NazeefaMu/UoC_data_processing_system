Awakening musical vibes

It is obvious that everybody cannot become a singer or a musician. However indulgence in music and listening to good music nurtures the saint within people. It has been researched and found out that music can be used as a therapy to reduce stress and anxiety.
Music in its broader perspective bestows good values such as compassion and empathy within persons who indulges in it. Thus music teachers could be treated as a rare breed of humans who induce warmth to this world. Pradeep Bogahawatte, a music teacher with a strong background values enhancing appreciative skills of his pupils apart from making them professionals. Bogahawatte’s pupils of ‘Crescendo Institute of Music’ will unleash their talents at Crescendo Night 2017 to be held at S de S Jayasinghe Hall, Dehiwala on April 8 at 6 pm.
Q: Could you elaborate on your journey towards becoming a fully fledged musician?
A: When I was a student at Isipathana College my mentors in music were Lakshman Wijesekera and Ananda Wijesiri. Dhananjaya Somasiri and Mahendra Pasqual, who are now top musicians, were my classmates.
My favourite instruments were the flute and guitar. While schooling I used to play flute for recordings of professional artistes. Lakshman Wijesekera gave me the opportunity to learn music at Kala Bhumi, Nugegoda and there I met veteran musician Rohana Weerasinghe. He offered me the chance to play instruments in his recordings. I got the opportunity to work with Mahinda Bandara, Ananda Perera of Siha Shakthi fame, D D Gunasena and Jagath Wickramasinghe at recordings. That was a great learning process.
Q: How did you become a music teacher?

 Experienced music teacher Pradeep Bogahawatte
A: I sharpened my talents by working with Maestro Khemadasa, Sarath Dassanayake and H M Jayawardene. While working as a music practitioner I formed the music band, Zenith.
I have composed music for songs of Milton Mallawarachchi and Ranil. I worked at the Kotelawala Defense Academy for 17 years and in that period contributed immensely towards musical events of the three forces. Simultaneously I worked at Kala Bhumi as a music teacher for 18 years.
Further I worked as a teacher at Vishadha Deepika Pryadharshini’s and Keerthi Pasqual’s music academies for seven years as a voice trainer and keyboardist.
Q: You now have your own music academy called ‘Crescendo Institute of Music’. Why did you decide to go solo?
A: I wanted to teach my students for long hours and my academy facilitates that. I pay individual attention to students who have diverse talents.
I induce academic knowledge to them in a subtle manner. All my students who sat for Visharada exam have got through.
Even actors have become my students saying that they acquire peace of mind by learning music. I teach singing, music while enhancing appreciative skills of students.
I am one hundred percent satisfied now with my teaching methodology since it serves the broader purpose of grooming sensible individuals.
Q: Every year you showcase talents of your students
A. Yes. Annually we do this concert. The seventh consecutive one will be held on April 8 this year.
Students who participate in my ‘Music therapy’ workshop team up every year to do this concert. We showcase many innovations in this event which is a novel experience for audience.
Q: What are your views on local music sphere in the present context?
A. Music has become a lucrative profession but now it is in the hands of media stations. More than creations, money is playing a major role in the music field. Music videos are playing havoc in the sphere.
Q. Students of your academy too will fall prey to this mafia once they get into the field?
A. No. The main thing I teach them is the universal value in music and its scope.
Anyone in the present context can record a song, do a music video and become popular overnight. But music has a broader meaning. You cannot become an artiste overnight. I am very strict in my method of teaching and my students are well disciplined to adhere to that.
Rukantha Goonetilleke is a trend setter. He cancels his voicing sessions in studios if he is not in the right mood to sing on a particular day. He does that because he respects the profession.
