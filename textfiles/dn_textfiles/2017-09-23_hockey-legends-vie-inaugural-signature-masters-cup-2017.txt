Hockey legends vie for inaugural Signature Masters Cup 2017

Sri Lanka’s living hockey legends will take part in their first ever Masters tournament today in the inaugural nine-a-side league at the Astro Turf hockey complex, Colombo 7.
Organised by Sri Lanka Masters National Hockey Association, the one-day “Signature” Masters Hockey League will feature over 100 legends, some playing for the first time since they retired in the 1980s.
The former national caps, who had represented in various international tournaments including Asia Cup hockey games since early 1980s have gathered to render their service to the sport, in which Sri Lanka’s standards in the international arena has somewhat deteriorated gradually.
The teams are led by veterans including four ex-national captains in eighties and nineties.
