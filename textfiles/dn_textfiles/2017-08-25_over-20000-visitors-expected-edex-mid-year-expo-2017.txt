Addressing media, EDEX Chairman Mahinda Galagedera said the exhibition will highlight the importance of receiving higher education by school children, school leavers and university students.
He said EDEX from its inception in 2004 helped thousands of Sri Lankan youth to receive higher education and training in various fields.
Galadegera further said three exhibitions are held in Colombo and Kandy every year and the objective of holding these exhibitions is to create the awareness of Sri Lankan youth about existing local and international educational courses and thereafter how to find employment.
He said the EDEX Expo also encourages local youth to be entrepreneurs who could create employment to job seekers.
“The forthcoming Mid-Year Expo will live up to its reputation to be a comprehensive platform offering choices, options in realizing opportunities in school to work transition, entrepreneurship and sustainability.”
Chairman Galagedera further said the exhibition will help participants to select academic, vocational, technical and professional courses and postgraduate programmes, which will be offered by both local and foreign educational institutions.

He said during the exhibition period interactive seminars in Accountancy, Finance, HR and Management will be conducted for the benefit of students
