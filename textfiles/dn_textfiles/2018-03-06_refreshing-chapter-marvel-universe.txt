Black Panther
Refreshing chapter  to the  Marvel  universe

Marvel starts 2018 with a refreshing chapter as it introduces its first black superhero in the form of the Black Panther. Penned by writer and director Ryan Coogler ‘Black Panther’ has the inevitable task of matching up the hype created by ‘The Avengers – Infinity War’ which is to follow later this year.
With such a mammoth task before him Coogler tries and succeeds beautifully in proving his mettle as a filmmaker. A list of fascinating character sketches – each of them embodying their own unique traits, eye catching and creative visuals, gripping action and an engaging storyline is what ‘Black Panther’ boasts of.
Though ‘Black Panther’ follows the typical storyline of saving the world from evil, it is more centered around the theme of identity and maturity. T'Challa returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears, T'Challa's mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk.
A significant feature of ‘Black Panther’ is that though the protagonist takes time to retian his full strength, the female characters of the production stand out for their strength and bravery. Two such characters – Shuri, T’Challa’s sister and Nakia as T’Challa’s love interest and undercover spy stand out. Letitia Wright makes a memorable Shuri and Lupita Nyong’o is marvelous as Nakia. Danai Gurira as Okoye, the head of the all female special force of Wakanda, too is superb. All these characters are aimed to inspire and empower women.
The music too with its foot tapping drum beats and infectious melodies add a different spin to the Marvel production. Breaking away from the Marvel mould, this unusual production embodies a lot of heart and is engrossing and through provoking.
Though Chadwick Boseman has played the character of the Black Panther for a limited screen time in 2016’s ‘Captain America: Civil’ war, he carries his role with vigor and ease in the 2018 movie. It is amazing how Marvel seem to find just the right actors to fit their characters and this is wonderfully portrayed in ‘Black Panther’.
‘Black Panther’ is screening at Savoy 3D cinema, Majestic Cineplex, Liberty by Scope Cinemas and Liberty Lite cinema.
