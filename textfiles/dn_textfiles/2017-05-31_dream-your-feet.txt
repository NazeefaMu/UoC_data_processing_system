Dream on your feet

Clive Barnes in his unique contribution to Thrift Books discusses Ballet as a combined operation of the arts - dancing, music, scenic design, and frequently drama, all have their roles to play. Of these contributory arts dancing is the most amazing counterpart. A kind of ballet can survive without, say, but the idea of a ballet without dancing is unthinkable. Apparently the members of the audience will draw their attention on its performers, the dancers much as the violinist playing a concerts than in the concerto itself.
However the important person concerned in forming the dances is the dance-arranger or the choreographer. The choreographer's task is in some ways comparable to that of a director of a film. And like directors, choreographers frequently receive part of the credit that should more properly belong to their artistic collaborators. Nonetheless the lion's share should go to its choreographer.
The question of what makes for classical mime, one accosts in the older ballet may be of immediate significance. This is a rather stilted though charming, sign-language, earlier adapted from the more naturalistic mime of the Italian tradition.
When the war ended in 1945 the national ballet was in a dangerous predicament. It had certainly survived, it is true. What is more it had achieved a degree of public recognition and critical esteem far beyond what had been given to it in its earlier days. But unfortunately, the position was had to believe. Artistically through no fault of its own. British ballet seemed to be on the decline. The first few months following the end of the war must have been a critical time for British ballet.
