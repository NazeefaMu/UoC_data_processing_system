Ginganga, Nilwala water diverted to Hambantota

 
The Weeraketiya irrigation engineer K.N.S.Kumara said that Gin ganga and Nilwala ganga will be diverted to Hambantota as a solution to the acute shortage of water in Hambantota district.
He said that about seventy percent of the feasibility report regarding this project is complete.
The Irrigation Engineer said that the project was due to be implemented several years ago. 
But as a result of protests carried out by several quarters and irrigation workers' union's in Matara District, it was delayed.
