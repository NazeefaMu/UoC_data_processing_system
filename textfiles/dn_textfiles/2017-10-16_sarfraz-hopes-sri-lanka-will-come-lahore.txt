Sarfraz hopes Sri Lanka will come to Lahore

ABU DHABI, Sunday:<U+0B9A> With an air of uncertainty hanging on whether Sri Lanka’s cricketers would want to travel to Lahore to play the third T20 international of their current tour of UAE, Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed made an appeal for the Lankan cricketers to come.
“As such there are no issues. I hope their team should come, I don’t know what the latest is but their player Thisara (Perera) came and played with the World XI,” said Sarfraz at the media press conference yesterday.
Sri Lanka Cricket is expected to meet today and take a final decision on whether the team should go after the players had given a signed letter expressing their concerns at going to Lahore.
There are only two survivors in the current team (Suranga Lakmal and Chamara Kapugedera) that underwent that ordeal in 2009 when gunmen fired at the Sri Lanka team bus when it was arriving at the venue to play second Test at Lahore.
Since that incident no international team has toured Pakistan until quite recently when a World XI comprising cricketers from Test playing nations played a three-match T20I series against Pakistan in Lahore under tight security without any incident.
Cricket manager of the team Asanka Gurusinha said that the Sri Lanka support staff had spoken to the Pakistan support staff and have been assured top security as given to the World XI team and that they were prepared to go.
“Anyway a final decision is left with Sri Lanka Cricket,” he said. – ST
