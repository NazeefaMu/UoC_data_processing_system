Shattered hopes?

IVF clinics are using 'highly misleading' success rates to advertise their services, experts warn. A new study has found that many centres are cherry-picking their results to provide a false sense of hope to couples.
Many are using their pregnancy rates to attract those desperate for children - despite this not being the figure of importance.
Scientists are now arguing that an outright advertising ban should be considered if clinics don't show a true break down of their actual birth rates.
A new study has found that many IVF clinics are cherry-picking their results to provide a false sense of hope to couples
University of Manchester researchers found that success rates are published on 67 per cent of IVF clinic websites.
Study author Jack Wilkinson said: 'Clinics can cherry-pick their results from a dizzying array of options.
'The concern is that clinics can always construct figures that show their own performance in the best possible light while making competitors look bad.
'This is not helpful to patients, who may struggle to understand differences in what each clinic reports and may be misled into making comparisons on the basis of incomparable results.
'Even if clinics are acting in good faith, the current system does not produce clear or reliable information for the people that need it.
'Just as advertising of prescription drugs to patients is not permitted, a ban on advertising IVF should be considered if there is no binding standard of reporting.'
As over half of all IVF in the UK is privately funded, clinics can compete for patients through advertising.
Success rates can often tempt couples to pick one clinic ahead of another - but the published results may not ring completely true.
Although direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs is banned in the UK, there are no such restrictions on IVF.
The researchers discovered 53 clinics were reporting success rates out of a toal of 79 investigated.
But in these said centres, pregnancy rates were reported more frequently than birth rates.
Only 51 per cent reported actual live birth statistics - the item of importance to patients.
They also discovered that clinics were reporting their pregnancy rates in 33 different ways, potentially confusing couples.
Some 72 per cent presented results without specifying the sample size, while a quarter didn't mention the age of patients.
Writing in the journal BMJ Open, Mr Wilkinson added: 'IVF is expensive and likely to fail though couples may not get that impression when visiting these IVF clinic websites.
'There is a strong incentive to selectively report success rates in a way that exaggerates performance. A lack of binding guidance means that clinics are free to do this.' -Daily Mail 
IS IVF WORTH IT?
* Thousands of women in Britain are having IVF unnecessarily, an infertility expert claimed last week, when they are able to have a child naturally.
* Almost half of couples labelled infertile after trying unsuccessfully for a baby for a year will, studies show, fall pregnant in the next two years if they just keep trying.
* But many panic and pay thousands of pounds for IVF, a British Fertility Society conference heard, because they believe they have a medical problem and need treatment.
