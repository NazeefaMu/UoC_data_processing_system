Belluna to invest dollar millions more in Lanka

Belluna Co. Ltd, Japan will make more multi million dollar investments in Sri Lanka especially in the South, Kandy and the Eastern coast, Belluna Co. Ltd Japan President and CEO, Kiyoshi Yasuno said.
In an exclusive interview with Daily News Business Yasuno said they need more infrastructure improvement in Sri Lanka especially in the transportation sector.
“You see it takes over six hours to go to the East and if there is a highway or a luxury train we are ready to invest.”
He said similarly they are also very keen to invest in Kandy which is a wonderful location. But we will hold our investment plans till the highway is completed.”
Beyond Tokyo, the company’s investments in real estate span the rest of the globe from Myanmar to the USA, including projects in Hollywood, Los Angeles, and now, Sri Lanka.
He said today Sri Lanka’s investments are almost equally to investments made in USA. “Our focus is strongly on emerging markets and we consider Sri Lanka as a destination with great potential.”
He said they have been investing in Sri Lanka since 2014 and it was peace that inspired them for it. “This is a major plus point for your country.”
Together with Asia Capital they are building a 50 villa ultra-luxurious resort in Galle, for which the foundation was laid in October 2016. This is a US$ 18 million investment. In addition, the ‘447 Luna Tower’ project,a 190 unit exclusive apartment complex is being built at Union Place.
“We will also invest US$ 350 million for the Lake House Mixed Development Project (which is in the planning stages) for which they already invested Rs. 4 billion to acquire the land from Urban Development Authority.”
‘The Westin Maldives Miriandhoo Resort’, a 70-key luxury property focusing on wellness tourism will open next year and the investment there is US$ 55 million.
Our latest investment is for the US$ 54 million (over Sri Lankan Rupees 8.2 billion), four-star hotel project on Marine Drive in Colombo 3, further strengthening the partnership between the two companies. “We know that the positive tourism trend in Sri Lanka would continue and will make investments in the future as well making Belluna Co the biggest Japanese investor for Sri Lanka.”
