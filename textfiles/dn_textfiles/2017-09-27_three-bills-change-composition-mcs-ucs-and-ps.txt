Three Bills to change composition of MCs, UCs and PS

Three Bills to change the composition of members in Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas, were presented before Parliament yesterday.
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha presented the Municipal Councils (Amendment) Bill, Urban Councils (Amendment) Bill and the Pradeshiya Sabha (Amendment) Bill on behalf of the government.
The three Bills seek to amend Chapter 252 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, Chapter 255 of the Urban Councils Ordinance and the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987.
The three Bills are envisaged to give effect to new sections which state that each Municipal Council, Urban Council and Pradeshiya Sabha will have forty percent of members as specified by the Minister in an order published in the gazette based on the Orders published in the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance (chapter 262).
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the three Bills would be taken up for debate in the House on a later date.
