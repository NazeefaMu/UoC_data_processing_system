Clifford cup quarterfinals: CR-Air Force will be evenly poised

A closely fought out battle can be expected between two high riding teams in Air Force SC and CR & FC when they lock horns in their Dialog ‘A’ division inter-club Clifford Cup knockout quarterfinals rugby match at Racecourse grounds, Reid Avenue at 4.15 pm today.
CR red shirts by which the Ceylonese Rugby and Football club is branded among the rugby loving fraternity in Sri Lanka and going by how the two teams fared this season, the Airmen have a definite chance of coming on top and this factor makes the event a thrilling tussle.
The young Air Force outfit at present are playing very well under the watchful eyes of their dedicated and committed head coach Leonard De Zilwa and captained by experienced club player Gayantha Iddamalgoda. They will know that losing this game could mean somewhat of a setback for them in the knockout tournament to achieve glory, hence they will come out with their best outfit and will come out with all guns blazing to topple the CR & FC and earn a place in the semi-final.
CR & FC will have a definite advantage when it comes to the two hookers where in-form Supun Warnakulasooriya will strike it very much faster and will be the man to watch in the loose play than Air Force hooker Lahiru Udayanga.
Meanwhile the red are packed with some outstanding national players, but they should get their act together if they are to pull off a win against the formidable Airmen. To achieve that the several national players who are in their ranks have to give off their best today.
