South Africa cricketers face prospect of fines, jail time

The South African cricketers who were caught attempting to fix matches in the 2015-16 domestic Twenty20 tournament are currently in the sights of the country’s National Prosecuting Authority, and are facing the prospect of fines and possible jail time.
Cricbuzz has learnt that the case is in the hands of a state prosecutor, who has gained ammunition from the original whistle-blower in the case.
It has also been established that another player who was involved in the scandal, former South Africa fast bowler Lonwabo Tsotsobe, has failed to pay his legal bills and has regularly ignored the allegations that Cricket South Africa’s Anti-Corruption Unit have made against him.
The Anti-Corruption Unit have been investigating the events leading up to the 2015-16 Ram Slam Twenty20 tournament since November 2015. In that time, six players have been banned for their part in the saga. While former South Africa international Gulam Bodi was hit with a 20-year ban after admitting to serving as an intermediary between fixers and players, Thami Tsolekile (12 years), Pumelela Matshikwe (10), Ethy Mbhalati (10), Jean Symes (7) and Alviro Petersen (2) have subsequently admitted their part in the affair and received bans.
Of the six, Petersen’s case was the most intriguing after he claimed to have been the whistle-blower. However, Cricbuzz has learnt that two players from the Dolphins franchise, batsman Vaughn van Jaarsveld and fast bowler Craig Alexander, were in fact responsible for alerting CSA to the scheme. In a statement following his ban, Petersen admitted that he had participated in meetings with fixers and failed to immediately report them as he was obliged to. It is understood that van Jaarsveld and Alexander did not make the same mistake. The involvement of van Jaarsveld and Alexander is significant because both would serve as credible witnesses, unlike the players who have already been banned.
Any charges against the players in South Africa would be based on the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act of 2004, which has a section dedicated to offences relating to sporting events and another relating to gambling. Players who plead guilty to the charges against them would likely appear collectively, but those who claim innocence would appear individually.
