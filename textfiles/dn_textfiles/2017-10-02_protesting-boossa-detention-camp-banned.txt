Protesting at Boossa detention camp banned

Galle Chief Magistrate A. Nishantha Peiris on Friday issued an injunction prohibiting holding protests around the Boossa detention camp in Galle and entering its main access and sub ways. The order specifically cited Ven. Akmeemana Dayarathna Thera of Sinhala Jathika Balamuluwa, its members and vehicles.
The order was issued subsequent to the submissions made by the Galle Rathgama Police OIC over a protest planned against the Rohingya refugees, who were being provided protection at the camp.
On Tuesday, a group protested outside a safe house where 31 refugees were provided safety. They were rescued by the Sri Lankan Navy in Sri Lankan waters in April this year. Many of them were women and children.
Following the incident, they were transferred to the Boossa detention camp on court order.
The camp was provided with special security with 350 police personnel and anti-riot squads, the OIC said.
