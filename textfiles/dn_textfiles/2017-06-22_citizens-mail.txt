RIGHT CONDUCT FOR BUDDHIST MONKS
A Buddhist monk is expected to observe a certain code of conduct in order to overcome his desire for the objects of the world and end his suffering.
To continue the three-fold practice of sila (morality), prajna (wisdom), and samadi (tranquility) on the Eightfold Path and overcome all types of craving, he has to exercise a great restraint on his thoughts, desires and behaviour.
According to the tenets of early Buddhism, every monk who declared allegiance to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sanga was expected to follow the Eightfold Path and observe a certain code of conduct as specified in the teachings of the Buddha.
The early Buddhist monks were mostly wanderers and mendicants, who were inspired by the teachings and the personality of the Buddha himself. They travelled from village to village and rested only during the rainy season in special dwelling places known as aramas and viharas.
But today we can see Buddhist monks taking part in various violent demonstrations. Some Buddhist monks are involved in politics. Some are involved in various business activities. Some are addressing political meetings. Some are trade union leaders. Some are having millions and millions in their bank accounts. Some are having several luxury vehicles.
We very kindly request these monks not to involve in these wrong behaviour and conduct. The whole world is watching. They are doing a very serious damage to Buddhism.
We very kindly request the Buddhist monks to follow the path recommended by Lord Buddha.
The world is respecting the Buddhist monks because of their simple, calm, quiet, peaceful, kind and compassionate behaviour.
