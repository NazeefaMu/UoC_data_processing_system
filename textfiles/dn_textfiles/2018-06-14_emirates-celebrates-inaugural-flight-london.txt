Emirates celebrates inaugural flight to London

London Stansted has just become the seventh airport in the UK to which Emirates operates. This brings the number of daily flights to ten, between Dubai and three different London airports, with Stansted joining Gatwick and Heathrow.
The aircraft deployed on the route is Emirates’ new three-class Boeing 777-300ER, featuring its state-of-the-art, fully-enclosed private suites in First Class, and refreshed Business and Economy Class cabins. With floor to ceiling sliding doors and sleek design features, the new First-Class suites take luxury to the next level.
To celebrate the airline’s arrival to the airport, Emirates and Stansted airport held a launch event for local dignitaries and stakeholders, hosted by Hubert Frach, Emirates Divisional Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations West, and Richard Jewsbury, Divisional Vice President, UK, alongside Stansted Airport’s CEO, Ken O’Toole.
“We decided to add London Stansted to our network because we saw an opportunity to directly connect the local community with some of the world’s most popular leisure and business destinations. Previously, London’s north east, and the wider 7.5 million people that live within Stansted’s catchment areas had to travel into the city, or further, to access airports with global reach. Now, this daily flight to Dubai connects passengers seamlessly to Emirates points across the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australasia,” said Frach.
Ken O’Toole, London Stansted’s CEO said, “Today is a truly significant moment in the history of London Stansted and we are delighted that our millions of passengers, based in London and the East of England, will see huge benefits from the direct connectivity between the airport and Emirates hub in Dubai and its vast array of onward connections.
The new gateway is the seventh UK airport that Emirates operates out of in the UK; with Edinburgh to follow in October.
Other locations include London Heathrow, London Gatwick, Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester and Glasgow.
