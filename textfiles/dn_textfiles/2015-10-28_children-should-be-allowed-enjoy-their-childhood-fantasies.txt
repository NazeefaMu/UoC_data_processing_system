'Children should be allowed to enjoy their childhood fantasies'

A ceremony was held at the Old Galle Hotel to award 200 students who were successful at the Grade V Scholarship Examination, while Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilleke was the chief guest.
Addressing students and parents present at the ceremony, Minister Gayantha Karunathilleke said that children during their tender years are almost forced to compete unlike in the past decades through various examinations they face. They are in the game or the competition to go up the ladder because their parents are in fact in the race or the competition to see their children win the race. This is a tragedy for the children of today, who have lost their childhood, a period of time where they should live their lives in happy surroundings, play games and enjoy life. While it is true that they should concentrate on their studies, their education or studies should not prevent them from enjoying their childhood fantasies. The responsibility of the parents is to provide their children the opportunity to live as children, not barring their freedom, the Minister added. The Minister also went onto say that as a responsible Government, it has planned out a system of education that should be imparted to children.
