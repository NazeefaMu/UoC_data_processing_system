Sri Lankan Navy apprehends five Tamil Nadu fishermen

While the 60-days ban on fishing this year by mechanised boats and trawlers along the Eastern coast continues, fishermen on their daily fishing with country-craft (Naattu Padagu), ran into trouble in the early hours of Monday.
As many as five fishermen who put out to sea this morning on their country-craft from Thangachimadam in Rameswaram island, were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy on charges of crossing the International maritime boundary line.
Reports reaching here said the five fishermen were fishing in the Gulf of Mannar area between Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar when they were taken into custody by the Island-Navy patrol boat and taken to Mannar in Northern Sri Lanka for interrogation.
Ansari, a fisherman said this development has come as yet another shock to the Rameswaram fishermen.
