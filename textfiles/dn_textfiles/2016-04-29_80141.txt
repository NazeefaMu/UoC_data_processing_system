Rugby inspired me to be what I am today - Rohantha Peiris

 
 To Rohantha Peiris, rugby is not just a game - it's a passion and a passionate pastime in his life. As the Managing Director, Ace Cargo (Pvt) Ltd, he still cherishes the lessons he learnt as an outstanding rugby captain for his alma mater Royal College.
Perhaps, sports would have been the very reason for his gaining an employment opportunity in one of Sri Lanka's major blue chip companies - Aitken Spence Group.
Talking to the ‘Daily News’, Peiris who will be the chief guest at the first leg of the Bradby Shield encounter between Royal and Trinity at Royal
Sports Complex on Saturday recalled how an illustrious sports career could help build one's character.
“I believe in teamwork. This is one major lesson that my favourite game - rugby has taught me throughout years,” said Peiris.
“Sports helped me to infuse qualities such as leadership, sharing work, character building, delegating work, determination and having faith in my team mates,” he said.
Like in many others, school time was the best era of Peiris’ life. “I owe everything to my school; actually it is not just a school, but an institution where students’ characters were nurtured with dignity and honesty.”
Speaking further Peiris said, “After winning the Bradby Shield in 1975 by a record 61 points to 6 (both legs) in 1976 we unfortunately lost it in 1977.
This loss gave me mental agony which I had to go through. It made me determined to somehow bring back the Bradby in 1978 under my captaincy.”
Royal had great Bradby years like 1975, 1976, 1978, 1984, 1988, 1998, 2002, 2009, 2011 and 2015 but Peiris chose 1978 as the pick of it.
“All are great years of our college rugby and great teams but I personally believe it’s undoubtedly the 1978 team that stands out the very best from the rest, not because I was the captain but due to the fact that we played with only four coloursmen and 11 fresher’s,” recalled Peiris.
“Eventually I had to follow Robert Aldrich famous Hollywood film; “The Dirty Dozen” pick and choose theory to select my best players in 1978 for the matches to remain as unbeaten champions.
“My best moment in school rugby was when under my captaincy in 1978 we regained the Bradby by winning the Kandy leg 8-4 after the Colombo leg had ended in a nil-all draw. We also went to Thailand and ended runners-up to Vajiravudh College in the championship and todate no other Sri Lankan school has managed to equal this feat.
“Further from that 1978 Royal team, 12 players played club rugby, four captained their respective clubs and seven players went on to represent the Sri Lankan national team which stands as a record todate,” Peiris said. Turning his attention on Royal’s highest try scorer and specialist of the rolling maul Supun Warnakulasuriya, Peiris commented, “Fantastic player no other words to tell. He has a spectacular high spirit in him and I have no second thoughts that he will go onto represent the Sri Lankan national team in the very near future.”
Peiris had the unique feat of representing triple champions Havelock Sports Club in the knockout tournament in 1976 while still a schoolboy.
After leaving school in 1978, Peiris continued to play club rugby for CR & FC, where he earned a reputation as a much sought-after ruggerite. He played club rugby for eight consecutive years before finally hanging up his boots in 1985 after captaining CR.
Going down memory lane Peiris spoke highly of his co-centre at CR & FC and ex-Thomian captain Christopher Jordash.
“Jody” was a true and humble gentleman on and off the field, a superb unprecedented player who at a glance knew all our moves,” said Peiris.
“When I run with the ball he knew my moves to support and when he ran with the ball I knew his moves and supported him all the way. With our combination we scored many tries for CR.”
When Peiris was reminded of how he made use of a then largely unknown lineout rule to take a quick throw-in being the centre three quarter and left everyone foxed and engineered a win for his team in the inaugural R.Premadasa trophy knockout tournament final in 1984 when his team was trailing CH&FC, he replied, “Yes, you have to know the rules and along with the thinking power in a split second you should know when to use them.”
Peiris also went onto represent the Sri Lankan national team in both the sevens and fifteens and said his best moment in the playing field was in 1984 when Sri Lanka won the Hong Kong “Bowl” championship under inspirational captaincy of Hisham Abdeen, which todate remains as Sri Lanka’s best performance at the Hong Kong Sevens tournament.
In conclusion Peiris said, “My father and mother have been my major inspiration for who I am today, hence I am eternally grateful to both of them”.
