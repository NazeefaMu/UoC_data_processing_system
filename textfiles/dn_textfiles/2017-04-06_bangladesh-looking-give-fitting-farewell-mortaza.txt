Bangladesh looking to give fitting farewell to Mortaza

 A national captain who disliked T20 cricket:
Bangladesh who lost the first T20 International to Sri Lanka on Tuesday will be looking to turn things around in the second game at the R Premadasa Stadium today and give their retiring captain from T20 cricket Mashrafe Mortaza a fitting farewell.
If Bangladesh can do that they will level the two-match series one-all and leave the shores of Sri Lanka with their heads held high having drawn all three series with the hosts – Tests, ODIs and T20Is.
Prior to the start of the Tuesday’s match Mortaza, the 33-year-old captain who has led his country in 27 T20 Internationals announced that he would retire from the shortest format at the end of the series.
“The decision I took is because I think if you look at our fast bowlers like Rubel Hossain is not in the side. He got seven wickets in the last two T20 matches. It hurts me to see that he is not playing for me,” said Mortaza.
“It is always tough to hang up your jersey. But I thought that if I look behind me, someone like Rubel is missing. He should have been in the first XI, but he is missing out because of me. Since he is performing better than me, he should be in the team. This is the time to grow our youngsters, those who can play T20s and become prepared for the bigger stages like Tests and ODIs,” he said.
At a time when T20 cricket is the norm and every cricketer is trying to cash in on it for the riches it offers, Mortaza is one rare character who dislikes this format although he represented his country in 53 T20 internationals over a 11-year period.
“I never enjoyed that format when T20 started. I played five World Cups but I never enjoyed it maybe because of my injuries,” said Mortaza.
“This format is quick and sharp so you don’t get enough chances to warm up your body, especially my legs which hurt a lot. I still kept going because the cricket board was respecting me as a captain. I still enjoy ODIs, but I never really enjoyed T20s.
“But when the cricket board made me a captain, I wanted to build this team. I don’t know how much I was able to. It is a huge honour to be the captain of Bangladesh’s T20 captain. I don’t think I can ask for anything more. Perhaps it was a sudden decision. But I didn’t think anything too big behind this. I didn’t think too much about it. I felt that I didn’t want to play T20s,” he said.
“I am not thinking about [quitting ODIs] at this moment. I don’t plan many things, but this was a tough decision. A lot of people are involved in such a decision, like my family, friends, teammates and the media. It was the same – taking it today or two days later. If I am fit, I will keep playing ODIs and next time when I decide to retire, I will tell everyone and then leave.”
Sri Lanka has won the two bilateral T20I series played between the two countries in 2013 (1-0) and 2014 (2-0). Overall Bangladesh has just a solitary win and five losses in six matches.
