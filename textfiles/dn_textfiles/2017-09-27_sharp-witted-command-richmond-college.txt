Sharp-witted command : Richmond College

Head Prefect of Richmond Ishan Eriyagolla has an ability to win over people. Maybe it is because of his simple style of leadership or his thoroughness in the art of administration. Perfect Prefects features Eriyagolla, who shows potential due to his sensibility, discipline and practicality.
“Being a Head Prefect at Richmond is a privilege and an honour. But with such power comes great responsibility. There is no specific time slot when it comes to his duties. Whenever he is called upon to perform his duties he must be available. With so many activities to attend to, he needs to manage his time and prioritise. In a leading school like Richmond, when it comes to management and shouldering your responsibilities you need to keep all your wits about you! You need to be very quick on the uptake,” said Eriyagolla.
Good stead
The administration is the key word here. The administrative skills a Head Prefect learns at school level will hold him in good stead when he leaves the portals of Richmond.
“A Head Prefect becomes accustomed to the structure. He becomes accustomed to hierarchy. He knows what it means to be ‘in command’. He can adjust to any position assigned to him. This is also where his intelligence comes into play. He needs to be sharp-witted. He needs to recognize opportunities that come to him. There is no time to be scared when things get rough! The opportunity is there for the taking!” said Eriyagolla
The more steel the country produces the more efficient will be the administration of the country. If you start at the bottom then no one can hoodwink you. The Head Prefect is familiar with the trend of thought in any office at each level, having acquired insight at school. Because he knows how to get the results he wants.
As mentioned before, he possesses thoroughness when it comes to administration. This is a facet of life that he has refined over the years.
Good finesse
“I have a group of dedicated prefects under me. I have been in their position. Because of this, I know their ways. So I feel that a good Head Prefect needs finesse. That is the most important quality I think anyone should have. Not only a Head Prefect. Also, he should have very good organizational skills,” added Eriyagolla
When facing a problem you need to be a collected and poised. Being poised is the main thing. Because you cannot prevent problems coming to you. You may be a Head Prefect or anyone in society but you cannot prevent difficulties coming to you. You can only work on your response.
“You need to understand the situation and then you need to look at it from all angles. You also need to reason– ‘Why has something like this happened?’ You need to investigate. You need to comprehend the situation. Then you need to make the best possible decision considering all views. Then you will be fair to all parties involved. A Head Prefect is an arbitrator,” said Eriyagolla
Never doubt yourself. Believe in the power of your judgment. A person who underestimates himself or herself is just wasting time. You need to believe in yourself. Self-doubt is the greatest hindrance. With doubt comes insecurity.
Remembered in history
“A leader I feel should be charismatic, he needs to be a man of the people. This is not limited to politics. Even at the office level, he needs to be respected. And in this respect, history will be the final judge. Even I, one day want to be a leader who will be remembered through history. You need to be self-possessed because people can sense these things about you. If you are confident about yourself, it does not matter what language you speak, people will be confident around you,” explained Eriyagolla.
Eriyagolla feels that we have been gifted with religion not to argue and quarrel amongst ourselves. We have been given religion not to divide ourselves and fight each other. We have been gifted by religion so we can learn from each other, discover more about the life that we live and realize what we have in common with each other. Discover more about the life that we live and unite.
“Not everyone can become a leader. He needs to have some inborn capabilities. Before becoming a leader he needs to have trained under a leader. He needs to be able to interact with all people in all stations of society, but never forget who he is and what values he stands up for. He needs to understand the frailties in society. Not everyone can come up with correct solutions. That is something I need to stress on. If he cannot do that, then there is a problem,” pointed out Eriyagolla
Pressure is a constant issue we have to deal with. Pressure can take its toll on a person. It is not easy to deal with. I think we need to be organized here. Then step by step we execute each and every part of the plan.
“Again do not doubt yourself. You need to be 100 percent. 100 percent secure. Then you can really lead,” said Eriyagolla.
He is a scholarship student and his parents have been a huge source of strength to him.
“They have also guided me in a big way. So I want to enter university and concentrate on media. I have played Cricket and have learned teamwork. You learn to work as a team. This has helped me develop my leadership skills. You learn to be receptive to the opinions of others. It is a journey. You learn to back your teammates. In Swimming, I learned coordination and the importance of physical health. As a leader, it is so important that you encourage and inspire those under you. Otherwise, they may get discouraged,” summed up Eriyagolla.
