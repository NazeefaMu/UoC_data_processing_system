Renowned speaker-trainer Tim Wade to inspire local marketers

Following its unprecedented success of organising two colossal events this year, SLIM will host yet another major event, in collaboration with international motivational coach, Tim Wade. SLIM will present Tim Wade for the first time in Sri Lanka for an workshop titled, ‘Enhancing Performance through paradigm shift’ on December 6 and 7.
Australian born Tim Wade is a science graduate of the University of Queensland having majored in Psychology. He is a past President of Singapore’s National Professional Speaking Association where he created and developed their Speakers Academy curriculum to teach people to become professional presenters.
He is known for delivering entertainingly dynamic, energetic, engaging and interactive presentations, with relevance couched in humor that connects with audiences and delivers results. Tim is a business speaker who has worked in corporate fields and has faced, and solved many issues prevalent in the business and marketing sectors. He has managed corporate departments and divisions of between three and 400 staff in different organizations in Asia and Australia, and has experienced many of the changes most organizations experience during their various business cycles whether in junior roles as a front-line service staff member, team leader, or when he was in senior roles such as National Manager for Operations, or Vice President of the International Group of a $2.2 billion revenue company evaluating suitable mergers and acquisitions.
His claim to fame has been his success in helping business leaders and their staff to motivate change to create positive business results.
He has also designed, managed, coached and implemented the changes, as he has been there in the thick of it and speaks from actual experience, which is the reason so many clients have engaged him to design programs that successfully reach out to people and help them embrace positive changes while being inspired to deliver positive results.
SLIM is committed to impart global knowledge and experience and therefore we continue the process of featuring exceptional global personalities for the benefit of the business fraternity of Sri Lanka.
