Home Lands Holdings to  support building shelters  for all, ‘Semata Sevana’

“Semata Sevana”(Shelters for all), is a housing program organized by the Housing and Construction Ministry. It is a collective initiative that both private and public sector partnered in giving a roof to those who are in need of a shelter. The program is organized under the guidance of Housing and Construction Minister, Sajith Premadasa.
As one of their greatest effort in giving back to the society, the Home Lands group has made a donation of 75 lakhs in order to build flagship villages in rural Sri Lanka under the “Semata Sevana” Program.
The project mainly focuses on constructing houses under the “Sevana Sarana Foster Parents Housing Program” of the “Semata Sevana”. It is expected that 72 lakhs of the donation will be invested in building “Senpathi Therapuththabhayagama” model village. The rest of the 03 lakhs is expected to be invested in the proposed “Sandunmithgama” model village.
In addition to this partnership, Green Valley Residential Complex is another attempt where the Home Lands Group under the guidance of Chairman, Nalin Herath joined hand with Housing and Construction Ministry for the development of booming Real Estate Industry in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the partnership with “Semata Sevana” housing program has been a step forward for a strengthen relationship for the future housing industry in Sri Lanka.
With the invitation of Condominium Management Authority, Home Lands Holdings officially handed over the contribution to Housing and Construction Minister, Sajith Premadasa on December 20, 2016 at the Housing and Construction Ministry.
