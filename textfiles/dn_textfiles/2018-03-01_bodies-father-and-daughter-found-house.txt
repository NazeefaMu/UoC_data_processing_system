Bodies of father and daughter found in house

The bodies of a 41-year-old father and his 3 ½ year old daughter were found inside a house in Vimana Road, Homagama yesterday.
According to the Police Media Spokesman’s office, the reason for their deaths had not been established by last evening, while the bodies of the deceased were lying at the Homagama hospital pending a postmortem examination.
However, unconfirmed reports suggested that the father had allegedly poisoned his daughter and later consumed poison himself. The daughter is said to have been suffering from an ailment and the father is said to have been in a state of depression over it.
At the time of the incident, the man’s wife and older daughter were both away from home.
