The clear path away from hybrid courts

President Maithripala Sirisena’s announcement that the Government would not prosecute War Heroes who fought for the Motherland, takes a major issue out of the consensual resolution 30/1 of October 2015, for the implementing of which Sri Lanka obtained a two year roll over in Geneva recently.
The President’s statement, at the presenting of ‘Virasara’ beneficial cards to War Heroes at the Defence Services School in Kurunegala, also takes much of the sting away from criticism of opposition forces, mainly from Sinhala extremist groups, the Joint Opposition, and a large number of persons from intellectuals, academics to politicians, who have taken to Sinhala nationalism, as it takes away the very cause of the concept of hybrid courts, that has been the major criticism of the government over the Geneva resolution.
The statement that War Heroes would not be prosecuted came very much in line with President Sirisena’s recent statements of opposition to hybrid courts, that would have foreign judges, sitting in judgement on cases involving issues of Human Rights, mainly relating to the final stages of the war to defeat LTTE terrorism.
Sri Lanka’s assurance to the UNHRC in Geneva of making the reconciliation process in the country a success, moving towards a progressive and united society, and taking the Sri Lankan nation to new heights in socio-economic development, will now have to be implemented without any prosecution of military personnel for alleged war crimes in the country, which was a key aspect of the Geneva Resolution.
The President’s statement will certainly need to be studied in the context of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein’s, reiteration of the need for foreign judges and other legal personnel to be available for probes into any alleged war crimes in the country – both by the State forces and the LTTE - in the final stages of the war with the terrorist LTTE.
Issues to resolve
There is no doubt this decision would lead to disagreements with the UNHRC, with Geneva resolution 30/1 of October 2015 having the hybrid courts as a principal clause in it. Sri Lanka will now have to show definite attention to the other aspects of the resolution, with more emphasis on the issue of Missing Persons, the proposed Task Force on Reconciliation, as well as issues such as the resettlement of persons in the North and East displaced during the war, and the return of land in the former war affected areas still being held by the Security Forces.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe did pave the way for the major attitudinal change that will come following President Sirisena’s latest statement, by stating that hybrid courts were not practicable due to political changes, the new policies of governance, and the need for a constitutional amendment.
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera also sought to clear the path to this new situation, with his statements that the Geneva resolutions were not binding on Sri Lanka, that they required constitutional changes, and also stating that this is not the most appropriate time for such amendments to the Constitution.
President Sirisena did mention at the Kurunegala event that there was unprecedented goodwill for Sri Lanka among the international community today, and there were many questions as to how this goodwill could be directed for benefits to the country.
There will certainly be a need for very active diplomacy to maintain the good relations that Sri Lanka has built with the international community since January 2015, and not let the new decision of protection for War Heroes be considered as a move against Human Rights, or the rejection of the international principles on Human Rights.
If the call is for greater diplomacy with the new decision on War Heroes and Human Rights, in dealing with the international community, this also calls for new thinking on internal politics and governance, because it will certainly lead to major objections and protests by the Tamil community and its elected political leaders.
TNA and the political parties that form it will not be ready to accept the President’s declared policy on dealing with War Heroes, on issues that relate to Human Rights.
The “Unity Government” facing its own divisions, will certainly have to face considerable opposition from the Tamil community and Tamil political forces in the new situation.
The ability to largely silence the Sinhala opposition on the issue of War Heroes will certainly open a new area of criticism and opposition to the government from the Tamil community, leading to serious changes from the political attitudes of January 2015.
This will be a major challenge to the government as it completes the mid-term in office and moves to the uncharted areas of approaching elections in Local Government and Provincial Councils, as well as move towards the next Presidential Election and General Election.
Away from War Heroism
Those who had increasing concerns about the probes now being carried out into those crimes involving the assassination and attacks on media personnel – Lasantha Wickrematunge and Prageeth Eknaligoda who were killed, and others who escaped killing, and that of sportsman Wasim Thajudeen, could have some relief with the President’s statement, also at the Defence Ministry event at Kurunegala, that he was unable to protect those who are found guilty of acts not connected to national security, and were guilty of killing media personnel or sportsmen.
There has been much concern in recent weeks about the progress of these investigations, which are being conducted with a clear commitment by the investigative bodies, but appears to be delayed due to lack of cooperation from security forces institutions to which most of the suspects in these cases have been attached to.
There is also the new concern about these investigations, with the major political rivalries that some of these probes are leading to, especially the differences between Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and former Secretary of Defence Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, on the alleged role of the Army personnel, from those at the very high level downwards, with these alleged crimes.
Although the President mentioned the killing of media personnel and sportsmen, there is also the matter of civilians who have been kidnapped and later killed by security forces personnel that have nothing to do with the war with the LTTE; and investigations showing a very clear commitment to crime, with no relation to the tasks of War Heroes.
Those standing out in these probes are from the Sri Lanka Navy, and there has been much concern that key persons in the Navy, from very high ranks in the past, could be interested in protecting these suspects.
There is the hope that the President’s statement on no refuge to those who kill media personnel and sportsmen, will also extend to these civilians who were the victims of uniformed crime that has nothing to do with the fight with the LTTE.
Fasting Heroics
The man who was once known as the symbol of the political “farce of fast” has now been shifted to the National Hospital Colombo, to be treated as he continues his fast in opposition to being held in remand custody, when indicted for an offence involving nearly Rs 90 million of public funds, as well as the misuse of official transport on an unimaginable scale of corruption and fraud.
The JO and Mahinda Rajapaksa are making every effort to make this a ‘fast’ of national political importance. There is a great deal of theatrics in the entire exercise, from the admission of Weerawansa’s daughter, who was also apparently fasting in sympathy with the father, to the Lady Ridgeway Children’s’ Hospital. (Is she a child enough to be treated in the Children’s’ Hospital is an interesting question).
There are the leading JO members such as Dinesh Gunawardena and Vasudeva Nanayakkara who are championing the cause of the “Fast Performer”, with diverse positions that have little reality to what is actually taking place.
It was stated earlier that Weerawansa was fasting because his stay in remand custody prevents him from serving the people as a Member of Parliament.
The fact that he was permitted to attend the sittings of Parliament, which is the best way of serving his people, has been totally ignored. Vasudeva Nanayakkara now states that this "hunger strike” was launched not urging the government to release him, but to protest against the burning issues in the country, namely the sale of state assets to foreigners, the rising cost of living and indirect taxes.
It seems wholly unfair that all those members in the JO decided to use this one member to demonstrate protests against the burning issues in the country.
Could not all of them launch a staggered fast, with more theatricals? This farce is now straining the National Hospital. When is it likely to be taken up as Contempt of Court, which it very much seems to be?
