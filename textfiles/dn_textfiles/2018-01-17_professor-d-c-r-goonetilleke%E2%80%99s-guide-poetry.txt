Professor D C R A Goonetilleke’s Guide to Poetry

Building on the foundation laid by Guide to Literary Criticism, this book takes literary education a stage further: it concentrates on poetry (originally written in English and in English translation). It is meant to train the reader to get to grips with the range and variety of experience as well as the range and variety of forms and styles displayed in poetry from the age of Elizabeth I to that of Elizabeth II and by poets from diverse regions – Britain, America, Europe, Africa, West Indies, India and Sri Lanka.
It illuminates the processes of poetic change, with distinguishable period characteristics as well as regional differences as poetry spreads globally and its practitioners become more varied. The examples are taken mainly from poems/extracts prescribed in examination syllabuses, especially for the G.C.E. Ordinary Level as well as Advanced Level, and also for university examinations.
Guide to Poetry is essential reading for success-oriented students. It is also addressed to teachers as a means of enabling them to guide the students.
It will also prove rewarding to readers and writers of literature in English, Sinhala and Tamil, and, indeed, to all those interested in the use of words – by sensitizing responses to language and by widening horizons.
