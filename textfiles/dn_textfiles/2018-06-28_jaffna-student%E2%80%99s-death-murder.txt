Jaffna student’s death, a murder

The postmortem examination conducted on the body of the 6-year-old Jaffna student who’s body was found in a well, revealed that the child had been strangled and murdered.
The Police Media Spokesman’s Office told the Daily News that a 22-year-old suspect, a drug addict had been arrested in connection with the murder.
However, the postmortem examination had ruled out rape, but the police said that the suspect had tried to sexually abuse the child but had strangled her in the process.
According to Police, the suspect had convinced the child to go with him promising to show her doves while she was returning from school at around 1.00 pm on June 25.
The dead child is the youngest in the family with two older brothers and an older sister. The older sister is a Year Five student in the same school and she usually comes home around 1.30 pm. The girl’s parents work as laborers and they return home after 2.30 pm. On the day of the incident, the older sister had notified the mother at around 2.30 pm that her younger sister had not returned home from school. The villagers had notified the Police and upon searching the area, the child’s school bag and other items were found. The child’s body was later recovered from a nearby well at around 3.30 pm on the same day in the Jaffna Sulipuram area.
She was a Year One student of the Kattupulam Tamil mixed school.
However, the villagers had given a letter to the AG’s office the next morning complaining that the Police had failed to investigate the matter and to arrest those involved. But the Police, denying these allegations noted that the suspect was arrested within 24 hours of the incident.
The funeral of the murdered 6-year-old Sivaneshwaran Regina was held on Tuesday at the Jaffna, Sulipuram, Thruwedinilai Cemetary amid a large gathering of villagers and family members.
