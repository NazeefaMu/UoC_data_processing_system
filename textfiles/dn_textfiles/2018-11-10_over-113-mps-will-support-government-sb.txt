Over 113 MPs will support government - SB

Highways and Road Development Minister S. B. Dissanayake said he is confident securing the support of over 113 MPs before Parliament reconvenes on November 14.
He was addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department yesterday after assuming duties as the Chief Government Whip.
The minister, observing that they already have the support of 104 MPs, said the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress led by Rauf Hakeem and All Ceylon Makkal Congress led by Rishad Bathiudeen will support them.
“Though MP Manusha Nanayakkara joined the UNP, we will win him back. We are in talks with him. The UNP has the support of only 98 MPs. We could easily get the support of another three UNP MPs, but we held back because there was opposition from our party. We believe that the JVP and the TNA will not vote in favour of the UNP,” he said.
The Minister said there is no law to say that a vote to prove Parliamentary majority is compulsory when Parliament reconvenes. “If Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is so keen on knowing who commands the majority, we can line up our MPs near the Speaker’s Office in Parliament. However, we will not let him flout the Standing Orders and Parliamentary traditions in the main chamber on November 14,” he said.
He said the UPFA would create a broad alliance to contest future elections.
He said the Parliamentary Elections would come only after September 2020 an d the Provincial Council Elections and Presidential Elections would precede the General Elections.
The Minister said the forming of new Government with Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister was a fulfillment of the people’s aspirations as visible on February 10 Local Government polls. He said the country has no constitutional crisis.
