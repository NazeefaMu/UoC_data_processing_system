A’pura facing drinking water shortage

The Anuradhapura district will experience a drinking water shortage within two weeks.
Drinking water is distributed in five Divisional Secretariat Divisions by using bowsers on the instructions of Anuradhapura District Secretary R.M. Wanninayake.
Meanwhile, Water Supply and Drainage Board Assistant General Manager S.C Ratnayake told the Daily News that there would be sufficient drinking water supply to the Anuradhapura city and the suburbs, including the sacred city during the Poson season.
He said although water levels are decreasing at Nuwarawewa and Basawakkulama tank, Poson devotees will not face a water shortage.
The water level of the Nuwarawewa tank is 9,200 acre feet out of 36,050 acre feet capacity. The present water level of the Basawakkulama tank is 250 acre feet out of 1,910 acre feet capacity. The water level of Tisawewa is 1,000 acre feet out of 3,500 acre feet capacity. Ratnayake said steps will be taken to get additional Mahaweli water to Nuwarawewa, Tissawewa and Thuruwila tanks to ensure uninterrupted water supply. District Secretary Wanninayake said if the drought continues, it has been planned to implement alternative water supply systems such as construction of 500 tube wells.
