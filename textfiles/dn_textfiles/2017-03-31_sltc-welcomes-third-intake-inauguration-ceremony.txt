SLTC welcomes third intake at inauguration ceremony

The Sri Lanka Technological Campus (SLTC) held an inauguration ceremony earlier this week (March 27) to welcome new students.
The third intake of students were officially welcomed and congratulated by SLTC President Ranjith G Rubasinghe, chief guest Prof. Lakshman Watawala, SLT Chairman Kumarasingha Sirisena, Higher Education and Highways Ministry Additional Secretary,N.K.G.K Nammawatta, and members of the SLTC faculty, and staff.
Rubasinghe said SLTC is not a campus where students just come to learn, but a place where they would leave as good, decent human beings.
"Our campus is different. We do not only impart knowledge, but it has become an extension of who we are and what we will become. Our students are not enrolled just for classroom knowledge but to become all-rounders: in academics as well as learning life skills that will make them decent human beings," he said.
The SLTC is the only corporate-powered residential campus, located at the former SLT Satellite Earth Station at Padukka. Students live onsite and experience cohesiveness and camaraderie while enjoying the cultural and scholarly resources of a research university in a landscaped 36-acre property.
The campus also officially opened a new hostel to accommodate female students from the new intake. The hostel provides all the basic facilities, including laundry services, access to a cafeteria, library, study halls, ATM machines and a brand new auditorium.
"We also believe that 'small is great' and therefore limit our intakes to ensure unanimity among our students," Rubasinghe said. "Our academic faculty is experienced and highly regarded with over decades of experience in their related fields and engage our students through exciting and modern teaching methods: Outcome Based Education and Problem Based Education. We also offer our students extra curricular activities that go beyond classroom study," he emphasized.
The SLTC has impressive affiliations with several world-renowned colleges. Lancaster University, ranked as one of UK's Top 10, Deakin University, Australia's fastest growing research university, Trinity College Dublin, the highest ranked university to engage with a Sri Lankan institute, Texas Tech University, USA's premier research university, and Georgia Institute of Technology, ranked 19 in the world for Engineering.
The SLTC also follows the Washington and Sydney Accords, which are multi-lateral agreements between bodies responsible for accreditation or recognition of tertiary-level engineering qualifications within their jurisdictions that have chosen to work collectively to assist the mobility of professional engineers.
In 2016, the SLTC was awarded ISO 9001:2008 certification for Quality Management System.
Also speaking at the event, Vidyajothi Prof KKYW Perera reiterated that a research-based campus is the ideal scenario for a good education. And together with the faculty, students must endeavour to make this Campus a world-class institution.
President of the Student Interactive Society, Mr. Akeel Mohamed (a past student of D S Senanayake College) said, "It is up to each and every student to go beyond classroom study and be a brand ambassador of this great Campus". Mohamed was the first student to enroll at the SLTC when it commenced operations in 2015.
Prof. Lakshman Watawala said that colleges like these are important for the future of Sri Lanka where students are assured of a good, affordable education, the country saves on foreign exchange, the output of skilled future leaders, and the appreciation of local educators. "These students are the future of this nation. Once they graduate, they will have entrepreneurial skills along with their educational qualifications to enable them to serve this nation."
The SLTC was set up by Sri Lanka Telecom with the motive of realizing Sri Lanka's vision of becoming the knowledge hub in Asia.
The Campus helps address the increasing demand of students who opt for a path in Engineering and Technology. Furthermore, the SLTC will bring in the much-needed hands-on corporate requirement thus transforming students into all-rounded graduates.
SLT Chairman Kumarasingha Sirisena told the graduating class of 2021 to be prepared for a world that is technologically advanced. "In 2021, Sri Lanka will be in the crux of a technological revolution: a smart world.
"During this time, the nation is going to be looking for great engineers like you. This is the time for your dream to come true, so study hard and be prepared to face a successful future."
