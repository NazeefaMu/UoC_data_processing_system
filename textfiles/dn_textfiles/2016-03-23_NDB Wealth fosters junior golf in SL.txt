NDB Wealth fosters junior golf in SL

 
Expert financial planner NDB Wealth has come forward to support the Sri Lanka Golf Union (SLGU) in promoting junior golf, with a sponsorship for the 2016 National Junior Golf Rankings. This initiative fosters young golf talent in the country, based on their performance at certain designated tournaments including the two regional junior opens. The qualifying rounds that have been earmarked for the junior golf ranking includes the Rukmini Kodagoda match play championship and the three rounds of the Sri Lanka Junior Open.
Of the designated rounds in each tournament, a minimum of five rounds will have to be carded in order to be eligible for national rankings. This will enable the SLGU to identify the talent pool by their performance over a calendar year, to be considered for national representation. National rankings for juniors will be awarded in four categories; Gold age group 15 - 17, Silver age group 12 – 14, Bronze age group 10 – 11 and Copper age group 9 and below.
Importantly, NDB Wealth’s sponsorship will offer both the equipment and training programs for young golfers, enabling their talent to be nurtured further.
NDB Wealth CEO Prabodha Samarasekera said, “NDB Wealth is a long-time supporter of Sri Lankan junior golf, a sport that teaches commitment, planning, foresight, calculation and ambition, which are also the hallmarks of exemplary financial planning. We believe that fostering the potential of junior golf in Sri Lanka is likely to pay dividends going forward, potentially helping to build our national champions for tomorrow. We thank the SLGU for giving us opportunity to support this very important task. “We are happy to bring on board NDB Wealth as a sponsor of national golf in Sri Lanka, and look forward to enhancing the relationship in the long term,” Sri Lanka Golf Union representative Niloo Jayatilake said.
