Police seek help to identify body

Officers attached to the Traffic Branch of Maradana Police seek public help to identify the body of a hit-and-run victim.
According to the police, the victim was a man in his early sixties and fair in complexion. The victim was run over by a speeding three wheeler while he was trying to cross the road on October 9 in Maradana. The accident was recorded in a CCTV camera installed in a shop nearby. According to CCTV footage, the driver of the three wheeler had fled soon after the accident.
Maradana Police said it had been difficult to identify the three wheeler, due to unclear number plates in the CCTV footage. The victim was admitted to the National Hospital of Colombo by a student of the University of Colombo, who came to the site of the accident. The victim had succumbed to his injuries after being treated while unconscious at the National Hospital of Colombo. As the victim was unconscious until his death, the police were not able to obtain a statement from the victim. The body still lies at the mortuary of the National Hospital.
The OIC of the Traffic Branch at Maradana Police said any information related to the victim or the three wheeler can be given to the direct phone number of Maradana Police (0112-692748) or the mobile number of the Officer-in-Charge of the Traffic Branch (071-8036733) or the police constable attached to the traffic branch of Maradana Police (071-4200366).
