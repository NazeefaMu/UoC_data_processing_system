Pakistani arrested with 1 kg of heroin

A Pakistani national who tried to smuggle 1 kilogrammes of heroin worth Rs. 10 million into the country was arrested by officers of the Customs Narcotic Control Unit at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) yesterday.
The Pakistani national who came to Colombo from Karachi via Dubai was nabbed by Customs officers when he was trying to pass through the green channel at the BIA, Deputy Director of Customs at the BIA Parakrama Basnayake said.
According to Basnayake, the heroin had been well hidden in the passenger’s shoe heel to avoid detection.
Basnayake said officers had initially searched the Pakistani’s luggage on suspicion but had failed to find any illegal substances.
Later, the officers had detected that the passenger’s shoes were unusually heavy and a thorough inspection had revealed the heroin hidden inside, Basnayake added. The suspect is to be produced in Court.
