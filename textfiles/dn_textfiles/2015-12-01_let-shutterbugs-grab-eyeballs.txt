Let shutterbugs grab eyeballs!

It was a day when the shutterbugs arose. It was a day when the shutterbugs were celebrated. The ceremonial inauguration and presentation of awards of the PSSL 60th International Competition and exhibition of Photography was recently held by the Photographic Society of Sri Lanka attended by all the king's men!
"This keenly contested international competition of photography is one of the longest running events in the world. Our society was formed a long time ago with 60 enthusiasts. It was formed in 1906. Now the society has a website and a Facebook page with 23,000 members. The society, for most of its history, has a studio and one dark room. The first exhibition was held in 1907 with 150 frames hung. We have survived and progressed over the years. We are gathered here to celebrate the opening of the 60th International Competition of Photography," said Chairman of the Exhibition Organizing Committee, Romesh de Silva.
There were 180 photos hanging in the gallery. All the pictures in the gallery were those of the winners. They are called 'accepted photographs'. They have earned the highest number of points. And amongst them were medal winners. Most are international with only nine Sri Lankans winning medals. There were 42 countries in the competition and out of them people from 38 countries were selected/ accepted as winners. There were 178 international contestants who submitted and 179 Sri Lankans who submitted. There were 357 contestants. About 3000 images were submitted. As a rule, one contestant can submit a maximum of 12 photos.
"I have been in the Royal College Photographic Club, I was at one time a proud owner of a Kodak. Then my father brought me a Polaroid. My elder brother Shan had an eight millimeter movie camera and also a projector. These were the best technology in the 1960's. Now it has all changed with the technology. Today there is the mobile telephone which has made a photographer out of everyone. And then there is the iPad which everyone uses and which consumes most of the time today, when you go for functions. The whole game has changed. I wonder what new technological innovations will be possible in the next 10 or 15 years. It is a market for innovation. It also gives us more opportunities. This auditorium is named after one of our greatest photographers - Lionel Wendt," said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who graced the occasion as Chief Guest.
The Prime Minister went on to say that the government is keen on the development of photography and the development of talent which has been neglected in the last decade or two. "To make it short and sweet we will see how we can help all of you photographers gathered here. In time to come we will see more Sri Lankan photographers gaining world acceptance," he concluded.
