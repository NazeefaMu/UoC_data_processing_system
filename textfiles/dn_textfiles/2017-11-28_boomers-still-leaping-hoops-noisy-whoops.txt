Boomers still leaping the hoops with noisy whoops!

Last week’s column dealt with what was known as the “Baby Boomer” generation. The focus was largely on the childhood of people born between the end of World War II - the 1945 and the late 1960s period - during which the populations and economies of certain nations were set to recover and boom.
Yes, life was a lot simpler for everyone in those spacious times when everyone looked out for everyone else. Children were born into families where having many siblings was common. It was understood that it was part of the responsibility of older children to take care of the younger ones. Women were increasingly attending hospital to give birth, but home births with the assistance of local midwives were still widespread.
For us Boomer's, who were part of this island nation’s biggest generation, childhood from our perspective was a magical era. Some of us ageing Boomers spent the last few weeks enjoying a magic carpet ride back in time to when kids and the ice cream truck ran freely through the neighbourhood and milk and the newspaper were carefully delivered to your doorstep.
In general, monetary wealth may have been rare but there was a certain financial equality among friends and neighbours. People were resourceful and 'made do'. A bank account in those days was widely regarded as a status symbol, particularly for those who did not seem quite sure on which rung of the social ladder they stood. Anyone who was someone did very little in the sphere of banking although they made it a point to complain to everyone that they were being numbed with numerals while trying balance their balances. Many homes in those days used to have large, iron safes, where the family heirlooms were deposited along with fat wads of cash neatly folded according to their denominations. Those safes were pretty safe by any standard and were pretty effective against both burglars and in-house sleight-of-hand artistes.
Chemical reaction
It could probably have been my imagination, or possibly some sort of chemical reaction with the salt of the earth, which had something to do with the fact that those local coins shone brighter than ever. Blame it on inflation, recession or whatever the analysts may propound to explain the present financial malaise, but today’s coins which look beggared in comparison are fiscally impoverished to boot. The old coins retained their value in the very metal in which they were minted, providing a natural hedge against inflation. They had a distinct glitter about them and went a long way in helping satisfy the indulgences of sweet-toothed rapscallions.
And talk about the tempting arrays of sweets displayed in giant glass bottles available at every street corner ‘kadey,’ costing only a few cents a handful. Even during the time of the local ‘seenibola’ industrial revolution who could ever forget the tangerine flavoured orange-yellow ‘narang-beek,’ the jaw-cracking ‘bultos,’ black bull’s-eye peppermints, or the tiny cummin-stuffed ‘mee-betty’ candy, named disgustingly after rat droppings. Do you remember the local ‘Candy Cigarettes’ with a red end to simulate a burning fag. There we were, trying to look glamorous, posing with a truly nasty-tasting ‘smoke’ lolly dangling off the corner of our lips. Makes my eyes cross just to remember it. Over the years, we’ve seen a lot of things come and go such as hula-hoops, vinyl records, Hawaiian shirts, poodle skirts and stiff buckram dresses.
General amusement
At most parties there were many damsels in this dress and they hardly looked in any form of distress. Children always found ways to amuse themselves and were inventive too. Nothing went to waste that could be used to create games and toys and general amusement. Matches, corks, quills, pebbles, straw, flowers, rags, clock spinners, rope and wood - with imagination and a little skill - could create all sorts of playthings. Twigs and branches in the right hands provided catapults, whistles, pop-guns and spinning sticks.
The latter were used to spin tops carved from a wooden thread-spool. A piece of rope could create a simple swing and a hillside could become a slide. A wheel or used tyre was a toy as imagination is the mother of invention.
Remember playing ‘Hora Police’ or Cops and Robbers without the societal baggage that it carries now? We used to play with fake guns and real bows and arrows. Do kids still do that? Can they run amok through yards and across streets pretending to shoot other children? There was no moralising on guns or killing — it was just good fun. After all, the police were the good guys. That's all we knew back then.
We were given air guns for our tenth birthdays. No one lost an eye or was maimed or killed. We rode bikes or walked to a friend’s house and knocked on the door or just yelled for them. Most boomers were inquisitive, experimental and courageous. I must admit we risked our limbs and lives in death defying stunts, such as indulging in the odd roof-top jumping as well. We would gallop across an expanse of concrete slab some 20 feet high and propel ourselves perilously onto the branches of a convenient mango tree. The tender branches bent but were able to sustain our weight. And oh yes, who can forget how we swung on a rope tied to the branches of a 60 foot custard apple tree yelling our heads off in true Tarzan fashion as we swung more than 40 feet high and leapt onto the branches of another giant tree.
The yelling was triggered by both fear and exhilaration as we flew through the air with the greatest of ease. Yes, we were all wild and free youth with such a spirit for life. Now to make the swinging adventure more authentically Tarzan-like we wore swimming trunks.
One of the funniest incidents of the tree trapeze act occurred when a friend named Ferna swung smartly and made a perfect leap to the tree opposite. While dangling on the branch his loose trunks slithered down his legs and fell to the ground.
To add to his embarrassment a bevy of neighbourhood girls were part of the audience tittering fit to die as they watched the genuine ape man unclothed in all his natural glory!
Somehow we survived it all and are now comfortably entrenched in the millennium, striving to remain a vital force in the world and vigorously continuing down the winding road on our protracted, strange trip. We aren’t slowing down anytime soon. Some of us are still raising grandkids.
We are still active boomers who don’t really worry about having enough ‘moolah’ to take us from here to the stairway to heaven. We love everything from reading and writing to running the most daring gauntlets. And we still get a kick taking an occasional whirl with our Hula-Hoops. Yes even as toddlers we made bathtubs into whirlpools.
No siree, there was never hope of taming the Boomer tornados.
