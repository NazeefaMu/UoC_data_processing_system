Maritime Search and Rescue Seminar held on board Akebono

Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) ship Akebono (DD-108) made a goodwill visit to Sri Lanka from April 9 to 10. It was on the way to the Gulf of Aden, to participate in an anti-piracy operation. During the visit, a Maritime Search and Rescue seminar for the Sri Lankan military, was held aboard the ship as a capacity building assistance (CBA) in the security and defence sector.
This was the first time that a CBA was conducted in the Indian Ocean Region by the Self-Defense Force.
The aim of the seminar was not only to strengthen the Sri Lankan military’s capability in maritime search and rescue through sharing the JMSDF’s knowledge, but also to reconfirm the importance of values such as the Safety, Openness and Transparency in the maritime domain, which is the foundation for regional and world peace and prosperity. Japan attaches importance to the maintenance of stability, based on the rule of law in the Indian Ocean region, which is a strategic area connecting Asia and Africa.
The Japanese government would continue defence cooperation with Sri Lanka through activities such as CBA, the JMSDF ship’s goodwill visit, people-to-people exchange and consultations in order to promote maritime security in the region.
