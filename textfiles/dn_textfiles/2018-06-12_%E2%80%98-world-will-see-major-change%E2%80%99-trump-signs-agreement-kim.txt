‘The world will see a major change’: Trump signs agreement with Kim

 
US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have signed what they both characterised as a historic deal following the first-ever meeting between the two leaders, held in Singapore.
 
Trump told the expectant media the pair had a “great relationship” and a “great time” together, without giving away any detail on their agreement.
 
The document was signed at Singapore’s Capella hotel after a working lunch aimed at discussing ways to end the nuclear standoff on the Korean peninsula.
