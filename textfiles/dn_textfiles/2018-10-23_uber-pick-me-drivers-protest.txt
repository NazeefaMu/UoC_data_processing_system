Uber, Pick Me drivers protest

Taxi drivers driving for app-based ride hailing firms of Uber and Pick Me yesterday staged a protest outside the office of Uber in Colombo against unfair commission rates charged by the companies.
Drivers holding placards protested before the Uber office in Colombo 7. A Facebook group called ‘Uber drivers/partners Sri Lanka’ had organized the protest with posts alleging that the company ‘exploited the drivers with their 25 percent commissions’.
“We are against this app mafia. They are bleeding the drivers dry. We ask the government to step in to protect taxi drivers and regulate these companies”, said one post.
The protesters also complained that increasing fuel prices and various promotions run by Uber to compete with others taxi hailing services have cut into the driver’s profits but Uber has offered no reprieve.
The protest which grew in size, called for all Pick Me and Uber drivers to stop working yesterday and one Uber driver who was seen to be working was seen to be harassed by the crowd. An Uber representative speaking to Daily News in the meantime said, “We regret the disruption caused to our rider and driver-partner community, due to a small group of individuals. We remain committed to serving the city and ensuring that our driver partners continue to access a stable income, while giving riders a convenient, reliable option to get around Colombo”.
A representative of Pick Me in the meantime said the protest was ‘fake news’, they only charged ‘10 percent in commissions’ and that they would be speaking to the drivers with regard to their issues.
Uber has had protests launched against it around the world in the last few years from Greece to London with taxi drivers in unison calling out the company for unfair competition, unfair commission rates and lack of safety.
This year alone taxi drivers in Australia, Spain, Greece and Brussels shut off their apps in protest against the company’s unfair employment practices.
