Citizens' Mail

The West Indians
I remember that tour when the Indians led by Contractor came to the Caribbean.
During the first Test a fast moving bouncer bowled by Griffith hit Contractor on the head cracking his skull. He returned to India where he died.
I was watching the second Test where Mendis and Chandimal were facing a battery of fast bowlers each hurling a barrage of bouncers. They were batting from the crease and visibly uncomfortable.
The dynamics of a fast moving projectile can be changed if the batsman bats about two to three feet outside the crease turning an in swinging and out swinging Yorker into a juicy half volley. The wicket keeper will inform the bowler who will change his run-up. Then return to the crease. Otherwise you will be hoisted with your own petard.
