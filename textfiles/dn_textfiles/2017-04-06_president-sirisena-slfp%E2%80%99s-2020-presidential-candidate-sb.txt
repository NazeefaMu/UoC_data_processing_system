President Sirisena, SLFP’s 2020 Presidential candidate: SB

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Presidential candidate for the 2020 Presidential Election is Maithripala Sirisena.
The SLFP has already nominated President Maithripala Sirisena as its Presidential candidate and hopes that he would agree to the request of the party members and the supporters, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
Addressing a press conference at his Ministry Office at Sethsiripaya, Battaramulla yesterday, the Minister said that President Sirisena had never made a promise to the people that he will not contest the 2020 Presidential Election.
Minister Dissanayake said he likes to get the same Cabinet Ministry whenever a Cabinet reshuffle takes place. `
“This Ministry was established by myself in the past which ebnabled me to implement my own programmes. I accept the fact that there are minor issues,”he said.
Minister Dissanayake pointed out that it is the duty of the President to change the Cabinet ministries if there are any issues, complaints, shortcomings etc.
“The President will do it after holding discussions with the Prime Minister,” he said.
