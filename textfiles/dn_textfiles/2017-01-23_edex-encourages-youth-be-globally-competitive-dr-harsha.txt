EDEX encourages  youth to  be globally competitive - Dr. Harsha

The regaining of the GSP+ facility by Sri Lanka will immensely help our exporters to get back the duty free access to the European market and this will also help our youth to become globally competitive in the years to come, acting Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
The Minister made these remarks at the EDEX Expo-2017 Exhibition opening ceremony at BMICH.
A large number of present and past Royalists and astudents from other schools attended the opening ceremony to visit local and foreign education stalls and the job fair, conducted by Sri Lankan private sector organizations. Japanese Ambassador in Sri Lanka Sugunuma, Principal Royal College B.A. Abeyratna and EDEX Chairman Mahinda Galagedara, RCL, Secretary Athula Munasinghe were also present.
The Minister visited almost all exhibition stalls and inquired about available educational courses.
Speaking further, an old Royalist Dr. Harsha de Silva highlighted the main objective of holding the EDEX exhibition is to encourage our youth to be Globally competitive in higher education, skills, employment and entrepreneurship.
He said to fulfill this obligation our education curriculum has been designed to direct young men and women towards achieving that ultimate goal.“Therefore, today our youth will have to learn to make them globally competitive in the years to come,”he said.
Talking about the Government’s objective of building a knowledge based highly competitive social market economy in the country, Dr de Silva said,” if all of us work together we can easily achieve this goal.”
The Minister also valued the setting up of an entrepreneurship zone at the EDEX Exhibition site as it motivates young school children to be entrepreneurs one day.
Recalling his memory , Dr. de Silva said he had come to know that the head of the largest private university in Japan ‘The Asian Pacific University’ is one Monto Cassim, another old Royalist who was in the school during the time of present Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.
He said this is also a fine example to our youth who too want to be globally competitive.
Minister de Silva also opened the EDEX Job fair Zone and visited several Sri Lanka’s key private sector organization stalls to inquire about available jobs in their institutions.
While at the job fair he also paid special attention towards the EDEX magazine which is published by Royal College Union to provide information about available local and foreign higher educational courses and existing employment opportunities in local institutions.
The articles in the magazine also encourage young men and women how to be globally competitive and to become entrepreneurs. Chairman, EDEX Mahinda Galagedara highlighted the objective of conducting the EDEX Exhibition and said it helps students to go from school to work transition.
He said the representatives of institutions at the job fair are expected to offer over 2,500 jobs to Lankan youth after making on the spot interviews.
