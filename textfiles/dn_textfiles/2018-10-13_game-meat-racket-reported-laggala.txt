Game meat racket reported in Laggala

Several businessmen in Laggala allegedly sell game meat to tourists.
Sources said they sell game meat to special buyers and outsiders through agents. Tourists and locals can buy cooked game meat from many restaurants and lodges in Laggala, the sources said.
Deer, sambar, wild boar, porcupine and others in the Moragahakanda forest reserves are killed by poachers and meat is brought to Laggala. Residents in the area said some politicians assist these errant traders.
Laggala OIC IP U. M. J. W. K. Amarasinghe said nobody had informed them of an errant business. He said he would investigate the issue.
