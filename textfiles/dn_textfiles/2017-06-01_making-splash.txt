Making a splash!

 The process of becoming a champion diver does not happen overnight. It takes a good amount of time and effort. It is a natural progression which starts with learning the basics and then plunges onto the more complicated flips and twists.
Dulanjan Fernando took Sri Lankan diving to the international level when he was adjudged the Champion Diver at the Seventh Singapore National Diving Championships that was held in Singapore in 2016. He won three silver medals in the Group A boys category in the Springboard one-meter and three-meter and Platform events.
He is among the top eight divers at the Asian Championship. The talented youth, a grade 12 student of Royal College, Colombo, won a silver medal and a bronze medal at the South Asian Aquatic Championship last year.
“I started off my tryst with water sports by taking up swimming. When I started coming to the pool for swimming lessons I saw some of the other students practicing their diving skills. This enthralled me and I too wanted to try out the sport. So I took to diving when I was in grade four. Since then I haven’t looked back. It has become a passion as well as a challenge,” Dulanjan said.
The sport of diving is fairly simple. It is one of the original ‘extreme sports’ and gives a great adrenaline rush to anyone who engages in it. If you can swim, like heights and are utterly fearless, then diving might be the sport for you. The main objectives are consistency and trying to score the highest number of points you can per dive. It has traditionally been an individual sport, but both men’s and women’s synchronised diving was introduced to the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
Having mastered the skills of swimming and diving, Dulanjan wanted to try his luck at water polo as well. He became involved in water polo when he was in grade nine.
“My uncle, Mahinda Liyanage, encouraged me a lot. He is a water polo and aquatic coach. I was a bit scared to take on diving at first because I feared the deep end but he put my fears to rest. He is someone whom I really look up to. He was the Royal College water polo captain and diving captain in 1989. He is also a national swimmer. There is even a trophy titled the Mahinda Liyanage Challenge Trophy, named after him for the under 15 championship in water polo where Royal College plays against S. Thomas’ College,” Dulanjan said adding that he is into gymnastics too. He has started off gymnastics in grade three and this had come in handy when he took up diving.
One of the most important skills in diving is the ability to master your takeoff from the board. A good takeoff will provide you with the height, control, and speed you need to perform your best. Focusing on this can be a great strategy to improve your diving.
“Hard work counts a lot. You cannot cool your heels and expect good results. We do not have many facilities like Dryland Training to really pursue this sector. I practice three to four days for two or three hours per week,” Dulanjan expressed.
All competitive diving is done from springboards set at 1m and 3m above the surface of the water. The height of the platforms varies according to the diving technique. You get five meters, 7.5 meters and 10 meters high platforms. The divers need to do six dives each from 1m, 3m and platform. You are expected to do nine or ten dives from each at school tournaments.
Queried on what is the toughest out of all the sports he engages in and Dulanjan replies that diving is the most challenging out of the lot.
“It is a bit risky to perform and you need to get your somersaults right. There are five different types of somersaults: Forward, Backward, Reverse, Inward and Twisting. The Armstand is used exclusively in platform diving and is a combination of the somersaults and twists. The body can adapt to four positions in the air during a dive: Tuck, Pike, Straight and Free. I started off with the jumps and now I do three and a half somersaults forward. I do the same number backwards as well. I manage two and a half inwards,” Dulanjan noted adding that Olympians do four and a half somersaults forward or three and a half somersaults in the pike position.
Dulanjan’s first national tournament was the National Aquatic Championships in 2013. He won two bronze medals at the event. His first international tournament was the Asian Age Group Championships which was held in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2015. He clinched sixth place from platform at the event. He has also represented Sri Lanka at the Asian Championships in Tokyo, Japan, and the South Asian Aquatic Championships which was held in Sri Lanka.
Recalling his experience at the Singapore National Diving Championships Dulanjan said that there were only around six or seven divers who had qualified for the finals. Around 99 diving participants have taken part in the championships representing nine countries. He noted that taking part in the Asian Championships is memorable for him because he has met many well known divers who have represented their countries at the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games.
Dulanjan’s father, Alex Fernando, is into accounting and is employed abroad. His mother, Sumitra Liyanage, is a housewife. He has a sister named Eshana.
“A lot of children took up diving but they stopped their lessons half way. I too had the feeling that I would not be able to succeed whenever I took on a new dive. However experience has taught me that this is a lie. These thoughts motivate me now and I put in my best efforts each time I hit the pool. It takes the desire to get better and the willingness to put in that extra effort to improve your skills,” he concluded with a smile.
