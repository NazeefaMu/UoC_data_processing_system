Insurance for schoolchildren from next term

An insurance scheme worth Rs. 200,000 each will be granted to schoolchildren from the next school term, Treasury sources said.
The government in its budget proposals for the financial year 2017 proposed an insurance policy for the schoolchildren numbering about 4.5 million in the country. The proposal was one of around 325 proposals in the budget.
