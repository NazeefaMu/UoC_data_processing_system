Norwegian assistance to map country’s marine resources

Norwegian State Secretary for Development Cooperation, Jens Frolich Holte, concluded a three-day visit to Sri Lanka last Saturday (23).
Discussions focused on shared interests and common challenges of sustainable use of the oceans and management of marine litter, ongoing cooperation in the fisheries sector, marine spatial planning, progress in peace building and reconciliation, and economic development, including promotion of two-way tourism, between the two countries.
State Secretary Holte's visit to Sri Lanka took place in the context of following up on agreed areas of cooperation during bilateral discussions that took place between President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg in Colombo in August 2016.
The visit coincided with the arrival of the Norwegian Marine Research Vessel Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, one of the most advanced research vessels in the world (owned by NORAD and jointly operatedby the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR) and the University of Bergen (UIB)).
The vessel will undertake a 26 day research journey around Sri Lanka and help map marine resources. Assistance to survey Sri Lanka's fish resources and marine eco-system using the research vessel including technical assistance to develop a national fisheries policy framework are important elements of Sri Lanka - Norway cooperation in the fisheries sector.
