Six yards of elegance

I am a teacher with 50 years’ experience and while living in Sri Lanka worked in an educational establishment. At times I acquiesced to the expectation that female teachers wear a saree to work. These are my observations and opinions.
The fabrics of sarees are beautiful and allow for artistic expression. The historical development of styles is both part of the culture and an indicator of the cultural adherence of the women of Sri Lanka. It is therefore very important to the nationhood of the country. I often used an admiring statement as a starter to conversation and as a way of developing a personal relationship with colleagues. Some would describe this as gossip or informal chatting and while there was no forethought or planning to talk about their saree, it is the most obvious thing to notice on meeting a woman.
As I came to know better the women I was talking to daily, conversations about the wearing of a saree became more forthright. Not all of their comments were positive. Consideration of both their comments and my own experience are included herewith.
I felt unsafe and in danger of tripping over large amounts of fabric in a saree. I was admonished by colleagues to “be careful” as I left the office while wearing a saree. We teachers are entrusted to the care and safety of our students. Over the many years of teaching in schools I have often had to move very fast to prevent hurt, outrage or damage to self or property. There is no way I could do this safely in a saree. In addition, fashion opines that high heeled shoes be worn with a saree. This compounded my feelings of discomfort and threat to safety. Further hazards to safety are the multiple flights of stairs to be climbed in many schools and other education establishments of Sri Lanka and the uneven walking surfaces of nearly everywhere I walked in their grounds. I chose days I would not be walking far to wear a saree.
I am old, overweight and of European descent. A bare midriff, nearly bare back and a low neckline is neither dignified, in my opinion, nor comfortable. I heard stories from my colleagues and students of being groped while travelling on crowded public transport. Men who choose not to control their behaviour obviously see the bare skin as an invitation. I chose to wear a saree rather than an osari because the osari design wraps even more tightly and covers less of the upper body.
From an educational perspective, positive relationships with students are of extreme importance to successful teaching/learning. I have noted over the years that the teachers who stay at their desks or move very little in the classroom are less successful then those who move around the room and engage face to face with individual students.
My point is that the additional width to the body when wearing a saree makes moving between desks in a crowded classroom extremely difficult.
I was dressed by others each time I wore a saree. It took nearly half an hour each time. If my clothing is a pair of slacks or a skirt and a blouse, I can bathe, dress and pack my lunch in half an hour. Other customs, habits or expectations make women of Sri Lanka time poor. Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines ‘hobble’ as, “to fasten together the legs (of an animal, such as a horse) to prevent straying”. This came to mind on two occasions. The first was when I was climbing a mountain path with some women friends and I walked much more quickly than them. Their comments included, “we are not used to walking so fast” and “you take bigger steps than us”. Anatomically we are the same and they were wearing leggings or jeans. Something had caused them to habitually use smaller steps. The other occasion was when walking between classroom and office, with friends, along a path that sloped uphill. They expressed an opinion about my not moving like they expected people of my age to move. Only on reflection did I realise that my clothing, in comparison to theirs, made this possible.
Through history and in many different countries, styles of clothing have subjugated women. The lotus slippers in China had women bind their feet. Foreman (2015) comments, “As the practice of foot binding makes brutally clear, social forces in China subjugated women.” Following the invention of the bicycle it also became clear that women’s clothing of the times did not suit the pastime or mode of transport of riding a bicycle. Bifurcated garments such as bloomers or knickerbockers were chosen by adventurous women as being safer and more suitable than the multi-layered, long, voluminous and heavy skirts that were current fashion. The furore this caused began in approximately 1895 and continued well into the next century. Dr J.B. Hawthorne, pastor, (in Cripps) denounced from the pulpit, those of the New Women’s Movement who wore bloomers or split skirts with knickerbockers, as being “born of infidelity”. These are strong words for an ephemeral notion like fashion. Unless, there was an ulterior motive such as subjugation within the words. In the same era, the Board of Trustees of College Point Seminary banned women teachers from riding bicycles to and from school because “Cycling…[was] conducive to the creation of immoral thoughts” (Neejer C., 2011).
In the 1960s I listened to final advice before finishing my training and beginning teaching. We were told by the Women’s Warden to always wear skirts and stockings to our classrooms. The price of stockings in comparison to our meagre wages (already proportionally less than the wage received by men teachers) was exorbitant and they needed constant replacement because they snared and ‘ran’ so easily. It was the era of the miniskirt so there was nothing demure or dignified about the constant tug at the hem for modesty. This length of skirt definitely limited being ‘closer to the learning environment’ discussed earlier. Rather than lengthen my skirts, I chose to ignore the advice received and I wore slacks.
These comments range widely but as an addition to the current discussion on the wearing of a saree in the classrooms of Sri Lanka, it is hoped they provide an indication of the scope of points to be considered unemotionally in the debate.
