JO claims Rs. 1.5 m collected on day 1

Pindapatha to pay off Weeratunga, Pelpita Court fines:
The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday claimed to have collected close to Rs. 1.5 million in their first day of the ‘Pindapatha’ programme launched by the Buddhist monks in Colombo.
The monks engaged in the practice to collect money to pay the fine of former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga and former Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Anusha Pelpita. JO Member and UPFA MP Gamini Lokuge speaking to the Daily News, said that over 350 Buddhist monks participated in the programme. The next programme is to be held next Sunday at Kiribathgoda.
Lokuge said they had appealed the Court order on the ‘Sil’ cloth case and that the people should help collect money to pay their total fine of Rs. 100 million as a service to these government officers.
