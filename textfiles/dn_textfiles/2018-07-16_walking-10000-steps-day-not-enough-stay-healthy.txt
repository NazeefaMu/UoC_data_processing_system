Walking 10,000 steps a day is not enough to stay healthy

Just walking 10,000 steps a day is not enough to make you strong and improve your balance, the Daily Mail reported.
Health officials urge adults to take up strength-bearing exercises. They especially recommend it during women who are pregnant or going through menopause, as well as senior citizens.
Tai chi, cricket, weights training or ballroom dancing are some of the recommended activities by Public Health England (PHE).
To stay healthy, you should be doing some form of moderate activity150 minutes a week and do strength training twice, the report revealed.
"Alongside aerobic exercise such as brisk walking, all adults should be aiming to do strengthening and balancing activities twice per week," Dr Alison Tedstone, head of diet, obesity and physical activity at PHE, told the Daily Mail.
Adding, "On average we're all living longer and this mixture of physical activities will help us stay well in our youth and remain independent as we age."
