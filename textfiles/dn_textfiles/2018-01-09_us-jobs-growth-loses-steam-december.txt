US jobs growth loses  steam in December

US employers added fewer jobs than expected in December, capping a year of slowing jobs growth.
Non-farm payrolls rose by 148,000 last month, amid losses in the retail sector, the Labor Department said. But the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, the lowest it has been since 2000.
Analysts say the tightening labour market, which makes it harder to hire, is driving a broader slowdown in job creation.
The US has experienced years of economic expansion, which has boosted economic growth above 3% in recent quarters and produced annual job gains exceeding 2 million for the past seven years. The gains are making inroads among parts of the workforce that have been slower to benefit from the economic recovery.
Among black workers, for example, the unemployment rate fell to 6.8% last month - the lowest since at least 1972, when Labor Department data starts.
Nationally, the unemployment rate has hovered at 4.1% since October, a rate not seen since 2000.
