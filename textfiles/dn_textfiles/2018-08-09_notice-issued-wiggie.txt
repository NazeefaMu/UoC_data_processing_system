CONTEMPT OF COURT:
NOTICE ISSUED ON WIGGIE

The Court of Appeal yesterday issued summons on Northern Province Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran and three others to appear in Court on September 7.
This is over a complaint that they have intentionally acted in contempt of the Court of Appeal order.
The Court of Appeal made this order following a complaint made by B.Denishwaran alleging that Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and three others have willfully acted in Contempt of the Court of Appeal order since they had prevented him from acting as a Minister of the Northern Provincial Council.
The Court of Appeal had earlier issued an Interim Order, preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to remove B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Minister of Fisheries and Transport in the province.
Denishwaran stated that the first Respondent, Wigneswaran has, by his conduct and statements, acted in contumacious and willful disobedience of the order of the Court of Appeal and thus committed an act of contempt against the authority and dignity of the Court of Appeal.
The petitioner cited Chief Minister Wigneswaran, K.Sarveswaran and K.Sivanesan as respondents.
The Court of Appeal on June 29 issued an Interim Order preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran to expel B.Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the province.
Denishwaran had challenged Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran in the Court of Appeal, complaining that the Chief Minister had no power to appoint or remove any Provincial Council minister. Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran had also filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal’s Interim Order to prevent Wigneswaran’s decision to remove B.Denishwaran from functioning as the Minister of Fisheries and Transport in the province.
