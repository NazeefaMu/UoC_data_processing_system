Tamim century boosts Bangladesh in warm-up game

 Bangladesh buoyed by a superb century from opener Tamim Iqbal made the most of their two-day practice match against a Sri Lanka President’s XI at the De Soysa Stadium Moratuwa yesterday.
Tamim smashed seven sixes and nine fours before retiring out for a well compiled 136 scored off 182 balls.
Mominul Haque (73), Mahmadullah (43) and Liton Das (57 n.o.) were the others to make useful runs as Bangladesh invited to bat first ended the first day at 391-7.
