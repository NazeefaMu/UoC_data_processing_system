The 41st Mobitel Sunday Observer Schoolboy Cricketer contest was launched on Friday with the participation of the chairman of Lake House Wasanthapriya Ramanayake and Mobitel Telecom’s operational head Nalin Perera.
This year the event reaches a new phase with the entry of schoolgirls to vie for awards along with the boys for awards ranging from best bowler, batter and fielder to the most outstanding players in addition to group and team awards as in past years. The usual coupon where readers can vote for the Most Popular players will be run in due course in the Daily News, Sunday Observer, Thinakaran, Dinamina and Tharuni newspapers.
Schoolgirls received some awards last year but this year there will be more awards on offer.
The Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association and the Association of Cricket Umpire’s and Scorers will also be involved in the event.
