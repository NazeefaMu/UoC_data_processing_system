Minister pandering to SAITM: GMOA

Three ministers were pandering on behalf of SAITM during the television programme telecast yesterday. The Health Minister lied during the programme, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary, Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said everything presented during the television programme was just information that is not based on any facts and figures.The truth is that the Colombo Medical Faculty is in the 2000th place in world rankings while SAITM is in 14,000th place according to statistics.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the three ministers presented different facts during the television programme and lied to the judiciary by presenting inaccurate, distorted facts. They clearly stood for SAITM and not for State Medical Faculties. "In addition, now they have taken over the official duties of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and are making decisions that should be made by the SLMC based on technical facts," he said.
The GMOA will never stop its struggle against SAITM until the Government takes it over and declares it as public property. What the Government should do now is to implement the set of proposals presented to the Government a month ago by the GMOA, Deans of all State Medical Faculties of Sri Lanka and the <U+200B>Faculty of Medicine Teachers' Associations (FMTAs), he added.
