LG polls result, a sound warning - Arjuna

The Local Government election results is a sound warning to the Unity Government to march forward during the balance two years after correcting its mistakes and shortcomings, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
He was speaking to the media after presiding over a discussion held with petroleum distributing agents in the Northern Province recently.
Minister Ranatunga said people gave a mandate to President Maithripala Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to eschew party differences and form a Unity Government and resolve burning issues in the country.
“We have governed the country now for three years. The Local Government election results is a warning given at the correct time for us to correct mistakes and move forward for the rest of the term while creating awareness among the people but the services we have already rendered,” he said.
Minister Ranatunga said both the President and the Prime Minister should join hands to take the country forward without ignoring the request made by the people.
“What the country needed today was natural politics other than party politics. This agenda of natural politics adhered by the Government had enabled the country to gain international acclaim and confidence”, he added.
“A major part of the pledges given by the Government still remained unfulfilled. They have overlooked the pledge given to catch corrupt and fraudulent people and punish them. What ought to be done now was to fulfil those pledges to rid the country of corrupt politicians and their cohorts”, Minister Ranatunga said.
He said the Government should beware of drug and casino racketeers and Bookie owners who were using money to win over Parliamentarians in order to stifle the Government’s forward march. He was confident that the President and the Prime Minister would step into resolve outstanding issues and take the Unity Government forward.
