Donald Trump to be inaugurated as 45th US President today

Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States today.
The ceremony is scheduled to start at 11:30 a.m.(Washington time) with a musical prelude beforehand. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will then participate in the traditional inaugural parade, which is scheduled. Besides Trump, his family and the Obamas, several living ex-Presidents will be in attendance. Jimmy Carter was the first to say he will attend, and so will George W. Bush. Former Vice President Dick Cheney also said he will be there. Both former President Bill Clinton and 2016 Presidential election nominee Hillary Clinton are also slated to attend. A George H. W. Bush spokesman said he will not be there, citing health concerns.
Donald Trump encouraged his supporters to set an “all time record” for attendance, but planners are expecting about 800,000 people, well below President Obama’s first inaugural.
Tom Barrack, the chair of the inaugural committee also told reporters that there will be a “soft sensuality” for the inauguration with a “much more poetic cadence.” The ceremony opens with the call to order from Sen. Roy Blunt, followed by readings and invocations and music from the Missouri State University chorale. Mike Pence will then take the Vice Presidential oath of office, administered by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir performs, and then Donald Trump takes the Presidential oath of office, administered by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.
Trump will give his inaugural address, followed by more readings and a benediction and close with the national anthem.
