CCS organises blood donation campaign themed ‘Give the gift of life’

A blood donation camp under theme ‘Give the gift of life’, organized by the Rotaract Club of the College of Chemical Sciences (CCS) and the Rotaract Club of Katugastota Region, was held recently, with the collaboration of the blood bank of the Peradeniya hospital.
Volunteers, including youth, were present at St. Anthony’s Cathedral in Kandy to be a part of the camp. The project was chaired by Rtr. Haneen Packeerally and Rtr. Buwaneka Wijetunge.
The helpful and friendly team of nurses, doctor and public health inspector ensured volunteers were screened and were physically fit to donate. According to the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) of Sri Lanka, an individual is deemed eligible to donate blood if he/she is between 18 and 60 years of age, free from serious ailments and should have a minimum haemoglobin level of 12g/dL . Regular donors should allow a four month lapse between consecutive donations.
Members of both clubs distributed leaflets across Kandy to spread the word prior to the project. In addition, the Rotaract Club of CCS distributed registration forms for their eye donation project “Be the light’’, a collaborative effort with the Sri Lankan eye donation society.
The project was a success, with the combined effort of the presidents, Rtr. Dilendra Nilupuli Wijesekara and Rtr Usama Liyaudeen and their hardworking boards. Our heartfelt gratitude is extended to all volunteers for selflessly ‘giving the gift of life’ to those in need. We also thank the members of the Rotaract Club of Kandy for their presence.
