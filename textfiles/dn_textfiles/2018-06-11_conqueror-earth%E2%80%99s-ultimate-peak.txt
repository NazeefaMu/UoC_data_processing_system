Conqueror of Earth’s ultimate peak

Johann Peries became a Conqueror on the morning of May 22, 2018. But he is no conqueror of the sword. He is the conqueror of Mount Everest - a merciless, unforgiving yet beautiful creation of nature, 8,848m in height.
In doing so he has become a conqueror of people’s hearts. Everest is no respecter of person. It can crush the will of anyone who attempts to climb it. It has claimed the lives of many who have aspired to conquer it. Climbing this force of nature requires courage, strength and will power.
Everest can break your spirit, make you despair and it will not allow itself to be conquered easily. This is the glory of all those who have climbed Everest. Yet there is an indescribable beauty to it, which Johann calls the ‘Calling of the Mountain’. In climbing Mount Everest he has brought glory to his motherland.
Johann has now returned to Sri Lanka safe and sound and was at Hilton last week to talk about his experience.
This was Johann’s second attempt at scaling Mount Everest. The first time was heartbreaking. His partner Jayanthi Kuru Utumpala managed to scale Mount Everest, but Johann was forced to turn back at 8,400 meters, a mere 448 meters short of reaching the summit due to technical difficulties with his equipment, with his oxygen tank failing.
Jayanthi Kuru Utumpala went on to complete the climb, becoming the first Sri Lankan to scale Mount Everest bringing glory to her motherland.
Johann Peries recalled the difficulties that were associated with his remarkable feat.
“I must say it is nice to be back, as much as it was nice going up. I would really like to thank everyone who has been a part of this journey since 2016. One of the biggest tasks we had to undertake was making people aware of what we were trying to do. At the beginning there was a lot of doubt and ambiguity. But we did not give up because it was our dream,” said Peries.
Peries recalled those days when he and Jayanthi Kuru Utumpala did their research. They were a team and Jayanthi was a great source of strength. It started out with only the two of them and then it just grew. Friends gathered around them to support them.
“Initially it was very challenging for us to find sponsors. Getting them to believe in us and our dream and getting them to understand what we were trying to do was indeed a very difficult task. Finally we were able to find people who did believe in us. There were also those who still believed in my second attempt. I remember how devastating it was for me coming so close to my goal during the first climb,” explained Peries.
However Peries possessed a fire within himself that burnt bright. Going again was irresistible. You can’t understand this passion unless you have it yourself. Why does one go back if it is so dangerous?
“I had almost forgotten how difficult it was when I attempted a second climb. The excitement of the whole thing was so much. There were some paths I really could not remember! I thought to myself did we ever climb this? How did we do it? It is so difficult! But this time by God’s grace I managed to do it. It was an amazing journey and I want to thank the media first who have supported us from the very beginning. Again I want to thank the sponsors, for believing in me and doing this for the second time. And I want to thank the public, because it was a public climb,” pointed out Peries.
The public gave him the strength and courage joining in. For the second time Peries did not have Jayanthi Kuru Utumpala and was a huge loss to him throughout. There were times when he looked for her and suddenly realized that she was not there! But though she was not there physically, she was there in spirit. They even packed Peries stuff before he left for Everest.
“When I got to the 400 meter point, I stopped for a while, spending two minutes there. I looked around and realized where I was. I took it all in very carefully and enjoyed every single step from there onwards. I did not find it hard in that sense. I knew I was going to make it. It was an amazing journey to take those last few steps. Finally when I got to the top, my Sherpa told me – ‘this is it, you are at the summit!. I knew I was there! But someone had to tell me! This is it, there is nothing beyond this! You are at the top of the world! What I saw from up there was unbelievable! There was never a day like that in years. It was such a clear day. I was even able to take off my goggles. It was such a beautiful day! Not a single cloud in the sky! I could see from where I was to eternity! I cannot express it in words!,” explained Peries.
Ayubo Life is the Health Wing of Hemas Group. They were Johann’s single largest sponsor. AIA insurance were the second largest followed by Wijeya Group and Vision Care.
“Thank you for giving us the opportunity to be a part of that. You are such an inspiration to all of us. I use that word with such meaning and deep felt thoughts. For those of you who don’t know about our involvement, we actually introduced a virtual challenge and launched it on the day Johann made the trip to Everest. And on the same day he left the country – April 3, 2018 we launched a virtual challenge which was ‘Climbing Everest With Johann’. Johann, many thousands of people walked with you. You have changed the lives of many people. There were people who have never walked in their lives. There were people who thought they could never get physically active. There were many people who wrote to us saying – this inspirational man changed my life!” said Chief Executive Officer of Ayubo Life, Chamila Ariyananda.
Ariyananda also pointed out that Peries did not merely raise a flag. He changed Sri Lankan lives with his meaningful journey which can be termed as fantastic.
AIA Chief Marketing Officer Nikhil Advanipointed out that Peries stands for what AIA stands for – achieving dreams.
“It is no easy task climbing Everest. Johann your second attempt made it more valuable and special. You did not give up on your dreams.
That is what AIA stands for. We make Sri Lankan dreams and AIA is behind them. Johann we have been behind you every step of the way. It has been a fascinating and a little scary journey judging by your pics and videos. I am sure you must be feeling elated after your climb. Thanks for allowing us to be your sponsors and thanks for never giving up on you dreams,” said Advani.
Chief Executive Officer of Seals, Rtd. Major Ruvan Ranatunga,called it an amazing journey with so many people placing their faith and trust in Peries.
“It is no simple task climbing Everest twice. If there is one lesson children can learn from this, it is that if you are determined and committed you can pursue and accomplish your dreams.
There is always hope. You are a role model to young people. At your first climb you could have gone on but you would have died because of insufficient oxygen. But you decided to turn back and start from scratch. You are a true inspiration,” said Ranatunga.
