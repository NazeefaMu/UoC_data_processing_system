‘Mahinda Rajapaksa’s return will remove economic burdens’

Since Mahinda Rajapaksa saved the country from terrorism while ushering in massive development, his advent to save the people from their heart-burning problems is a welcome move, Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said.
He was addressing a meeting at Erewala Pannipitiya under the ‘Eliya’ programme recently, to create public awareness of the project.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said the former Wickremesinghe government did not take action to grant relief to the people or usher in development projects. They only took legal action and remanded war heroes who dedicated their lives to end a 30-year war. The Rajapaksa government did not wage war against the Tamils.
It waged war against a terrorist outfit. It was Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa who, as the President, saved innocent Tamils from harassment. As President, Prime Minister Rajapaksa launched massive development schemes and improved infrastructure facilities to lighten the cost of living burden of the people.
People started to detest the former Wickremesinghe government because it heaped a massive cost of living burden on them. People getting incited against the Wickremesinghe government was a natural outcome when its leadership was not people-oriented.
Ven. Medagoda Abeytissa Thera presided over the meeting.
Parliamentarian Gamini Lokuge, Major Gen. Kamal Gunaratne, lecturer Madhavi Herath and consultant Dr. (Mrs.) Seetha Aramabewela were also present on the occasion.
