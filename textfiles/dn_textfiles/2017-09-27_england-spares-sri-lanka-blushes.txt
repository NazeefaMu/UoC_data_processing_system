England spares Sri Lanka the blushes

So after all Sri Lanka had to be greatly indebted to England for securing them an automatic qualification for the 2019 Cricket World Cup which will be staged in England. That news alone must have been like manna from heaven to the current cricket administration that has been battered from all quarters following the disastrous performance of the national team.
West Indies who were eight points adrift of Sri Lanka in the ICC ODI rankings needed to win against Ireland in the one-off ODI and also beat England at least by a margin of 4-0 to oust Sri Lanka from eighth spot – only the top eight ranked teams qualified automatically.
However a washout by bad weather in their game against Ireland and a comprehensive seven-wicket defeat in the first ODI against England meant that West Indies lost their chance of overhauling Sri Lanka in the rankings. They will now have to come through a qualifying round that will take place in March 2018 at either Zimbabwe, UAE or jointly Ireland and Scotland. West Indies will compete with teams like Zimbabwe, and newly elected full members Ireland and Afghanistan and associate member countries Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Scotland, Hong Kong, Kenya and Nepal, where the top two teams will qualify for the ten-team World Cup.
Only once has Sri Lanka the 1996 World Cup winners and two-time World Cup finalists in 2007 and 2011 had to qualify for a place to play in the World Cup. That happened way back in 1979 when they were still an associate member of the ICC and fighting tooth and nail to be admitted as a full member.
In the inaugural World Cup in 1975 Sri Lanka along with East Africa were invited to participate but four years later to be fair by other associate nations as well the ICC hosted an ICC (International Cricket Conference) trophy tournament ahead of the 1979 World Cup where the two finalists would qualify for the World Cup. Both tournaments were held in England.
Sri Lanka not only came through that tournament with flying colours defeating Canada in the final but also became the first associate member country to defeat a full member when they beat India in a World Cup group match played at Old Trafford, Manchester.
The Sri Lanka team captained by Anura Tennekoon gave a good account of themselves in the ICC trophy tournament beating USA (by 6 wickets), Holland (by 45 runs), conceding a walkover to Israel and an abandoned match against Wales.
In the semi-finals they beat Denmark by 208 runs and in the finals played at Worcester, Canada by 60 runs to become the first holders of the ICC trophy. Both Sri Lanka and Canada qualified to play in the 1979 World Cup and the former distinguished themselves by going onto beat India in the World Cup as well. However in both those matches Tennekoon was injured and it was vice-captain Bandula Warnapura who led the team.
Although it was England and Australia – the founder members of the ICC who opposed Sri Lanka’s elevation to Test status for a number of years using their two-votes each to veto every attempt from the seventies it was these two countries that supported Sri Lanka after they finally became a full member.
England played the inaugural Test against Sri Lanka in February 1982 and it was largely the report filed by Cameron Battersby the Australian team manager of the 1981 tour to Sri Lanka that went a long way towards the country achieving Test status notwithstanding the outstanding speech made by the then president of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board the late Gamini Dissanayake at the ICC meeting at Lord’s in 1981.
In the initial stages of Test cricket Sri Lanka banked on England for support to sustain them in the coaching of coaches and to assist the national team that was trying to find its feet at the top level.
Australia more than England have helped Sri Lanka cricket in many ways by way of providing some outstanding cricket coaches and physios for the national team as well as from the biomechanics side of things.
Now that Sri Lanka has cleared a major hurdle and qualified for the 2019 World Cup it is upto the administration to ensure the players and the support staff gets every bit of support they need towards winning another World Cup. The national selectors too have a responsible role to play in picking the right combination so that no area is left unattended.
