Shops demolished for lack of planning

A group of people in Anuradhapura have expressed their displeasure at the demolition of 16 shops at a pola, even before they were opened.
They said that the shops were constructed at a cost of Rs.20 million and have even been provided with electricity. These buildings have been demolished under the directions of the Anuradhapura Mayor H.P. Somadasa.
Anuradhapura JVP Urban Councilor Asela Wijesinghe said that these buildings were constructed during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. But they were demolished under the instructions of the mayor who is from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, since they had not been constructed with a suitable plan.
“This is people’s money,” Wijesinghe said. “Recently many such buildings were demolished. Mayor Somadasa said in a telephone interview that these buildings were constructed with funds directed by then minister Basil Rajapaksa. He said that MP Semasinghe constructed these buildings for publicity. “Later it was pointed out that they were not suitable for selling fish,” the Mayor said. “So they are being demolished.”
