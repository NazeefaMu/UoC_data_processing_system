‘Good Governance ushered in era of freedom’

During the past regime, people lived in fear while nodding to the misdeeds of politicians and their henchmen. But after the good governance government was established, people could enjoy their freedom sans barriers, Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing a steering committee meeting of the Dambulla electorate held at the Dambulla main bus stand’s trade complex auditorium. Dambulla, Galewela and Pallepola Divisional Secretariat members participated.
Dissanayaka said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was established by late Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike on solid policies. Therefore, no person could destroy the party. Since its inception, numerous issues had emerged, and though the obstructions vanished, all dissidents rejoined the party as they knew that they had no future. “Therefore, those who were levelling various allegations to our party, will return to us again in the near future,” he said.
He said the Rajapaksa regime had wasted public funds to distribute sarees, clocks and other items among people during the last Presidential Election, with the intention of deceiving their voters.
