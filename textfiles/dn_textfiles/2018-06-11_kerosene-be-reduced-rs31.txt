Kerosene to be reduced by Rs.31

The price of kerosene will be reduced by Rs. 31 per litre from Tuesday midnight. The new price from Wednesday will be Rs. 70 per litre, Fisheries, Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economy State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
Wedararachchi said the proposal to reduce the price of kerosene will be tabled after Cabinet approval on Tuesday (June 12) morning and once it was approved the price reduction will take effect from Tuesday midnight. The Finance Ministry has agreed to carry out this proposal.
“The government has taken this decision considering the difficulties encountered by the poor and the fisheries community as a result of the price,” he said. 
However, the Consumer Affairs Authority, Police and the STF would be deployed to track down people engaged in various rackets misusing the price reduction and legal action taken against them. He said the government would also look for the possibility of further reducing the price of kerosene in the near future.
