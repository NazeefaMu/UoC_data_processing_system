UNP will not bring no-confidence motion against Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe: Kiriella

 
The United National Party (UNP) does not intend to bring a no-confidence motion against Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Addressing the media at a function held at the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy yesterday to mark the 40th anniversary of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's political career he said the UNP Working Committee would discuss the matter at length at its meeting on August 17. 
“It is accepted that neither Members of Parliament or the ordinary people can intervene in a case that is heard in the court but everyone have the right to comment on the shortcomings of the administration of justice,” he said.
He said that while the files on fraud and corruption conducted by the previous government had been handed over to the Attorney Generals’ Department more than a year ago, there was a planned programme to delay the court hearings regarding those cases.
“The people of the country have given the jurisdiction to the courts and to the Attorney Generals’ Department through Parliament, and these people are what the reason for delaying the cases is,” the Minister said.
