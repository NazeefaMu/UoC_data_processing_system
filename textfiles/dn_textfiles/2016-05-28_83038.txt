LC, ACF condemn appointments of Palpita and Ranawaka

The Left Circle (LC) along with the Anti Corruption Front (ACF) activists strongly deplored the appointment of Anusha Palpita and R.A.A.K. Ranawaka as additional secretaries to ministries by the government.
Former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission Director General Anusha Palpita has been allegedly appointed an “additional secretary” to the Home Affairs Ministry, when he was facing charges of allegedly misappropriating over Rs. 600 million for the distribution of “Sil Redi” on the eve of the last Presidential election.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena on May 26 rejected the so called appointment of former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission Director General Anusha Palpita as an Additional Secretary of the Home Affairs Ministry calling it a “media appointment.
But the LC and the ACF pointed out that the appointment had been made with the sole intention of providing a shield for Palpita against the law. They said, through the appointment, the ministry and the minister had not only displayed their shamelessness, but also their disregard for Administrative
and Financial Regulations to ‘rescue the thieves.’
“We are aware that there is a group operating inside the UNP to protect corrupters and Vajira Abeywardena seems to be the pioneer of the group. It is degrading to witness a responsible minister pretending to be unaware of what is taking place,” he said.
They pointed out that there are nearly 2,500 government servants who have faced interdiction due to alleged corruptions, but the same law was not applied on top government officials.
Abeywardena said government appointments are initiated through the Public Service Commission(PSC) and that he had not received any appointment letter pertaining to Palpita’s appointment, during a press conference held on May 26.
However, the LC and ACF challenged the minister that they are ready to produce the appointment letter handed over to Palpita.
“We wish to inform the minister that we are ready to produce the appointment letter and we also wish to ask the minister whether he is ready to take up the challenge.
We strongly ask the minister to resign from his post with immediate effect,” the LC said.
Putting an end to bribery and corruption and punishing those engaged in serious financial crimes during the previous regime, were the top election promises of the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) government.
The civil society that ensured the UNFGG victory, was keen on implementing a proper mechanism to prevent corruption as an election victory and a change of regime were not adequate to end the culture of corruption in Sri Lanka.
“However, the present government has appointed several people to top government positions, including some cabinet ministers who were also accused of financial corruptions during the previous regime.
This would only result in the public turning against the government,” Ulapane Sumangala Thero said.
