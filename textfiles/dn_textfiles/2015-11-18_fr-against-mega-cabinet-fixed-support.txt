FR against Mega Cabinet fixed for support

A Fundamental Rights petition filed by a lawyer challenging President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to increase the number of Cabinet ministers from 30 to 48 was yesterday fixed for support on March 15 next year by the Supreme Court.
This petition filed by Attorney-at-Law Aruna Laksiri has cited President Sirisena and the Attorney General as respondents. When this petition came up before Supreme Court Justices Eva Wanasundara, Upali Aberatne and Anil Goonaratne, the petitioner informed Court that he filed in Court several documents to support with the case.
However, the Attorney General appearing for the respondents had told Court that the respondents would raise preliminary objections against this petition.
The petitioner has stated that, according to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, a National Government should comprise the party that has obtained the highest number of seats and the other parties and independent groups in Parliament. The petitioner maintains that the present government could not be described as a National Government merely because a couple of parties have entered into an agreement to form a government, and, therefore, it is a gross violation of the Article 46.1 (a) of the Constitution.
The petitioner is seeking interim relief preventing the president from appointing more than 30 ministers.
Deputy Solicitor General Indika Demuni de Silva with Dr. Awanthi Perera appeared for the first and second respondents.
