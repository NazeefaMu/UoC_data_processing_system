JETWING COLOMBO SEVEN PRESENTS HIGH COFFEE MORNING

Coffee, fashion and networking are three important things that could make a woman feel like a queen. After a hectic week it might feel like the weekend ended so fast that you didn’t have enough time to relax and unwind or catch up with your friends. Ladies can do all of that and more at Jetwing Colombo Seven Coffee Morning on March 31. From 9 to 12 pm the Barnes Room will be buzzing with strong coffee, delicious finger food and exciting activities. You will also have the opportunity to interact with successful women such as chief guest Managing Director Jetwing Travels Shiromal Cooray , Dharshi Cooray - wife of Hiran Cooray, Jetwing Chairman, veteran beautician - Pastor Wendy Fernando and like-minded individuals.
The culinary experts at Jetwing Colombo Seven have designed a special menu that is bound to be a feast for the eyes. Treats such as baked eggs with mushroom and gruyere, delicious baked onion walnut frittatas, melt-in-your mouth coffee cream éclairs or extra tangy berry cream muffins will satisfy all your cravings. Cleanse your palettes with a hot cup of tea while taking down tips from Sothys on dos and don’ts for naturally beautiful skin followed by a fashion show by Golden Needle later on in the day. Tickets are priced at Rs. 2500/= and will also include many giveaways.
You can extend your day of relaxation by visiting the revamped spa offering a luxurious selection of treatments. The pampering programs range from deep reaching, mind melting full body treatments to simple yet fascinatingly effective express treatments or beauty therapies. Ever Glow beauty packages made with fresh vegetables and other locally sourced natural ingredients will also be available after a successful launch last year.
Jetwing Colombo Seven is hosting the Coffee Morning in partnership with Illy Coffee, Il Gelato, Link Natural Products, Sothys, Golden Needle and Kiss FM. -PW
