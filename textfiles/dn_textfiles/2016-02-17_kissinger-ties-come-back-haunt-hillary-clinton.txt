Kissinger ties come back to haunt Hillary Clinton

US: When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, she relied on Henry A. Kissinger’s counsel. He would send her “astute observations about foreign leaders” and “written reports on his travels”.
She would joke with him that smartphones would have made his covert Cold War trip to Beijing impossible.
The two diplomats had a cordial, warm and respectful relationship, based on writings about their interactions during Ms. Clinton’s tenure at the State Department.
“Kissinger is a friend, and I relied on his counsel when I served as Secretary of State,” Ms. Clinton wrote in The Washington Post, in a positive review of his book World Order.
The friendship came back to haunt her in the Democratic presidential debate on Thursday night, when Senator Bernie Sanders pointedly questioned Ms. Clinton’s foreign policy judgment, saying President Richard M. Nixon’s secretary of state had enabled genocide in Cambodia under Pol Pot. “I’m proud to say Henry Kissinger is not my friend,” Sanders said.
For Clinton, Kissinger, now 92, was part of “a fascinating club” of former secretaries of state she turned to when she arrived at Foggy Bottom, writing in her 2014 memoir Hard Choices that these diplomats “transcend partisan differences.”
She specifically praised Mr. Kissinger’s diplomatic achievements in China, where he helped Nixon normalise diplomatic relations with the Communist leadership in a visit to Beijing in 1972.
