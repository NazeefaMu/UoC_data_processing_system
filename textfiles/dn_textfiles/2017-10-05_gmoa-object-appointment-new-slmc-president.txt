GMOA object to appointment of new SLMC President

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to the President and the Prime Minister expressing its objection on the appointment of Prof. Colvin Goonaratne as the new President of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing media during a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said that Prof. Goonaratne is well known for his pro-SAITM stand and his appointment is not acceptable to the majority of SLMC registrants and organisations representing them. He is also involved in the pharmaceutical industry as an advisor.
According to Dr. Aluthge, Prof. Goonaratne was the only SLMC member who voted against appealing against the Appeal Court Judgment given, ordering the SLMC to register a SAITM medical student. There was a meeting at the SLMC which was headed by then SLMC President Carlo Fonseka to decide what to do in connection with the judgement. Only Prof. Goonaratne wanted to register the SAITM student at the SLMC and all the others in the SLMC opposed it. That is how an appeal was made at the Supreme Court by the SLMC against the Court of Appeal judgement. Now the court case is ongoing.
The GMOA has received information that the Health Minister made the appointment after discussing it with the SAITM owner. While the Judiciary and the SLMC is trying their best to safeguard the peoples' right to life and safety, the Health Minister tactically acted to defeat those efforts, he added.
