End of a poignant chapter

The courtroom on the third floor of the Jaffna High Court was filled to capacity—and then some. Media personnel, attorneys-at-law, and friends and family of both the victim and the accused packed inside the humid room for a verdict all had been waiting to hear since 2015.
Tensions were high throughout the nearly three hours leading up to the reading of the judges’ decision. Details of the gang-rape and murder of the eighteen-year-old woman were explicated in depth, with no gruesome or gory specific spared. At one point, Vidya’s mother, wearing a white and green sari, had to be escorted out after breaking down in tears and nearly passing out.
And when the decisions were announced—the first and seventh accused released, and the other seven accused sentenced to death—the reactions across the room were varied. The prosecution looked satisfied, while Defence Counselor Mahinda Jayawardena shook his head in disappointment.
Pockets of the room wore ecstatic expressions on their faces, specifically those who had come in search of justice for Vidya. Her mother, afterward, said she felt justice had been served. Then, as fast as all had gathered in the room that morning, almost everyone filed back out. Yet a few remained, tears streaming down their faces—the mothers, sisters, and wives of the accused, inconsolable, all who felt that it was injustice, not justice, which had been served.
What happened to Vidya?
Sivaloganathan Vidya was born on November 25, 1996, at the government hospital in Mankulam. Her family was displaced from Pungudutivu in 1990 due to the civil war and ended up in the Mallavi region in Vanni. In 2010 they were relocated to their native village in Pungudutivu. During the time of her demise, she was studying at Pungudutivu Maha Vidyalayam, for her GCE Advanced Level.
According to her mother, Sarawathi, Vidya went to school at 7.30 am on May 13, 2015. As she failed to return home even at 3 pm, her brother Nishanthan went to school looking for her and where he was told she never arrived. At around 6 pm, Vidya’s family reported her missing to the nearest police station at Kurkattuwan but they directed the family to take the case to the Kayts police station.
On May 14, 2015 at 5 am, her brother Nishanthan began searching for his sister. And finally he found his sister brutally murdered. Nishanthan called the police in Kayts at around 7 am and police arrived at 10 am who determined she had also been the victim of a gang rape. Meanwhile on the same day, protests were held in Kilinochchi, Batticaloa, Vavuniya, Trincomalee, Mullaitivu and Jaffna urging the police to take immediate action. Three suspects were arrested on that day.
Vidya’s funeral was held on May 15, 2015, drawing large crowds. Then on May 18, 2015 five more suspects were arrested, including Swiss Kumar, who was arrested in Colombo. It is alleged a government minister helped in his attempt to escape. Swiss Kumar was alleged to have filmed the gang rape.
All eight suspects were brought to Jaffna Courts on May 20, 2015. There was a huge protest staged in front of the Jaffna High Court and protestors demanded that suspects be handed over to them. Hartals were observed in northern Sri Lanka as a protest against the murder on the following day (21). And several senior police officers involved in the investigation were subsequently transferred and the case was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department. The Kayts police were criticised for allegedly delaying the prosecution.
At the request of the Attorney General, three High Court judges were appointed on May 23, 2017 and on June 28, 2017 the Trial-at-Bar began. Nine suspects were indicted on 41 counts including abduction, gang rape, murder and being members of an unlawful assembly.
The Trial-at-Bar headed by Vavuniya High Court Judge Balendren Sashi Mahendran included Jaffna High Court Judge Illancheliyan Manicckavasagar and Trincomalee High Court Judge Annalingam Premashankar.
The much-awaited final verdict
The much-awaited verdict on the abduction, rape and murder of Vidya was given on Wednesday (September 27). Seven of the accused, including Mahalingam Shashikumar alias Swiss Kumar, were convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Sivaloganathan Vidya of Punguduthivu in 2015 by the Trial-at-Bar of the Jaffna High Court yesterday.
At the trial, each of the accused was referred to by a number, one through nine. Poobalasingham Indrakumar alias Sinnappa (1st accused), Poobalasingham Jeyakumar alias Ravi (2nd accused), Poobalasingham Navakumar alias Sendil (3rd accused), Mahalingam Shashidaren alias Shashi (4th accused), Pillainandan Chandrakasan alias Chandra (5th accused), Shivaderan Kushange alias Periyathamby (6th accused), Palani Rubasingham Kuganathan alias Nishanthan (7th accused), Jeyadaran Kokilan alias Kannan(7th accused) and Mahalingam Shashikumar alias Swiss Kumar (8th accused) were accused of abduction, rape and murder of Sivaloganathan Vidya in Punguduthivu in 2015.
The first and the seventh accused, Poobalasingham Indrakumar alias Sinnappa and Palani Rubasingham Kuganathan alias Nishanthan, were released due to lack of adequate evidence to prove their involvement in the murder.
The other seven were sentenced to death.
In addition, the second, third, fifth, sixth and eighth accused were sentenced to 30 years rigorous imprisonment (RI), with a fine of Rs 40,000 each. They were also ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.1 million each to the mother of the victim. The court also ordered to extend their prison term by four months if they fail to pay the fine. These convicts will also have to serve another two years if they fail to pay the compensation.
And the fourth and the ninth accused were sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, each with a fine of Rs 70,000. They were also ordered the payment of Rs 1 million each in compensation to Vidya’s parents. Failing to pay the fine, the accused will be further remanded for four months and if they fail to pay the compensation, they will be remanded for another two years.
Judge Illancheliyan further said that MP Vijeyakala Mahenshwaren had gone to the Jaffna police station at 11 pm on May 17 and waited at the station for two hours for the police to release Swiss Kumar when he was arrested. Illancheliyan added that Swiss Kumar was the one main suspect who was alleged to have laid out the whole plan.
He pointed out that MP Maheshwaren’s involvement in the case was the first step taken by Swiss Kumar to escape from the police custody and added that no legal action was taken against Swiss Kumar at that time.
Judge Illancheliyan claimed that the former Inspector of Police in Kayts who prosecuted had delayed the case, and as a result the CID found it hard to find adequate evidence against the accused. Meanwhile, the CID came in for high praise for their efforts in investigating the case speedily and efficiently.
He commended the CID officers present in Court, IP Nishantha Silva, ASP Sisira Tissera and their team, for their efforts in probing the murder of the rape and murder of the schoolgirl in Jaffna.
Observations of Judge Sashi Mahendren and Judge Ilenchelian
Judge Illancheliyan, delivering the verdict, emphasised that neither the army nor navy was involved in the abduction, rape or murder of Vidya, as alleged by accused and the defence counsel.
“If the navy or army was involved there should be evidence in that connection, but we have got nothing. The CID could only find evidence that was connected to the seven accused and that clearly shows that they carried out the rape and murder,” the Judge said.
Judge Mahendren said that one former suspect, Uthayasooriyan Surashkaran, turned into the case’s eyewitness and produced many important details with regard to the crime.
According to Surashkaran, four of the accused, specifically Ravi, Sendil, Chandra and Periyathambi, each raped Vidya for nearly 10 minutes, videotaped it, and forced a wooden plank inside her mouth to quiet her. Illancheliyan also disclosed Vidya’s state when she was finally found by her family: arms tied behind her head with her hair tie, legs each tied to a tree, and underwear gagging her mouth. He reminded the courtroom of the brutal rape, and that Vidya was strangled to death by her school uniform tie.
Judge Illancheliyan further said that Swiss Kumar had entered into an agreement with a Swiss mafia to create a sex tape involving a girl.
He said that one of the prisoners who was imprisoned alongside Swiss Kumar, Mohamed Irfan, told the court that Swiss Kumar had inquired about retrieving a video that was deleted and about creating a sex tape. According to Illancheliyan, Kumar had also told Irfan that he was willing to give Rs 200 Million to IP Nishantha Silva CID who was handling the case to deter him from prosecuting. However, according to Illancheliyan, when Kumar was questioned later, he tried to change the story. Illancheliyan insisted that there is clear evidence to prove that Irfan's narration is true.
While speaking, Illancheliyan called Swiss Kumar “the hero” of the story as he laid out the accused’s whole plan.
Judge Illancheliyan continued by saying that after the body was found on May 14, three of the accused, Swiss Kumar, Shashi and Kannan, had left to Colombo and had purposefully turned to all the CCTV cameras in an attempt to register their faces as means of an alibi.
He observed that in all the camera footage, it was very clear that it was plan of the accused to prove that they were not in Jaffna during the crime. Yet he said that the CID could not find any footage of them on May 13, the day on which Vidya was murdered, and added that they had also participated in her funeral to avoid suspicion.
Piece by piece, the judges went through all the evidence to prove the involvement of the seven accused who ended up being convicted for the abduction, gang-rape, and murder of Vidya.
Still, Judge Illancheliyan pointed out the difficulties in using DNA as evidence in this case. He explained that the prosecutors took too long to test it and as a result the evidence turned inconclusive.
Defence Counsel Mahinda Jayawardena, speaking to the Daily News after the verdict was given, said he will appeal the judgement in the Supreme Court, emphasising that he does not see this as the final judgement.
Vidya's loved ones satisfied
Vidya's mother, Sarawathy, her family, and friends thanked all the people who fought for justice in Vidya's case.
Holding back tears, Sarawathy said that she was complacent about the verdict and that she finally felt as justice was served for the murder of her daughter.
Vidya's friend N Rahulan said that he was very happy about the verdict and added that he hoped a similar incident should never happen to any girl in future.
“We miss her a lot. I pray that her soul rest in peace,” he said.
Another friend of Vidya, Thavarasa Thamsika, said that all who knew Vidya were terrified and heartbroken when they first heard what happened to her two years ago. Still, she tried to look at the positive.
“We see this verdict as a victory for all women.” 
Convicts in denial mode
Meanwhile, the accused denied all the charges against them. When they were given a final chance to say something after the verdict was given, the accused said that they were not involved in the abduction, rape or murder of Vidya.
Poobalasingham Jeyakumar, alias Ravi, said he did not do anything.
“I have been falsely allegedly accused by the CID for committing the murder. I have three children and a family. I never did this,” he said.
Poobalasingham Navakumar, alias Sendil, said that he has no connection to this rape and murder.
“Why should I do it? I don't have or did not have any motif to do such a crime. I am speaking the truth, the CID had twisted the story for some reason,” he said.
Mahalingam Shashidaren, alias Shashi, said that he was in Colombo on May 13, 2015, but his boss and friends in Colombo are reluctant to back this statement up.
“My mother died after I got arrested. I have a family too and I did not do this,” he said.
Pillainandan Chandrakasan, alias Chandra, said that he has two children and requested the judge to release him.
“I never committed this crime. The CID had created tall stories against us. Neither we nor Vidya got justice in this case. Only Vidya's mother spoke truth in the court all the others were threatened by the CID to collect evidence against us,” he said.
Shivaderan Kushange, alias Periyathamby, said he has five sisters and that did not even look at Vidya before she was murdered.
“I was not involved in committing the murder as well. I am innocent. The real criminals who committed the crime are out. God will take care of everything,” he said.
Jeyadaran Kokilan alias Kannan said he was in Colombo when the murder happened.
“The charges put on me are false. I have not got anything else to say other than the truth that I was not involved,” he said. Mahalingam Shashikumar, alias Swiss Kumar, said none of the accused was part of the crime, even though he himself was alleged to have planned the whole thing. “I did not do it. The CID has changed the story and now trying to put the blame on us.” he said.
