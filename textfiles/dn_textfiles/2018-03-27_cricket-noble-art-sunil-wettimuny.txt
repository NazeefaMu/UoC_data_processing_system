Cricket the noble art by Sunil Wettimuny

Perhaps the three of the greatest players ever to play at one time in Sri Lanka were S.S. Jayawickrema, F.C. de Saram and M Sathasivam. They would have been prominent in any company, in any age, against any opposition. They were batsmen of the classic mould, orthodox for the main part of their makeup but so possessed of genius that each would on occasion do the ‘unusual.’ A visible mark of their popularity and entertainment value was the huge crowds that used to throng the grounds at Victoria Park, Maitland Crescent or any other venue when these three were “on show.” stated Sunil Wettimuny in his book “Cricket The Noble Art.” Sunil was also my team mate at Ananda in 1966.
A great pity that the above mentioned trio, were born too soon to participate in Test cricket, but that cannot detract from the ‘class’ they achieved and exhibited. Test cricket was poorer for that fact recalled Sunil who in fact was not far behind these greats in class and elegance when it came to batting.
‘Sargo’ Jayawickrema was said to be a shrewd captain, he led his team by example as well as precept. They said no bowler could contain him, his footwork and judgement being of the highest class. Chats with him revealed his modesty and retiring disposition. He was also generous in praise of the youngsters and he had high hopes for their future and that of Sri Lanka, reminisced Sunil.
Jayawickrema’s modesty and unselfishness can, perhaps be illuminated by one single act: he once declared his innings closed when his own score stood at 199! Once he scored 133 for Ceylon versus India after being felled, hit on the head, by a thunder bolt from Mohammed Nizar, in the first over, at Brabourne Stadium, Bombay. It showed the man’s courage and determination, noted Sunil.
They said Sathasivam was all grace and elegance. He improvised like the true artist. He favoured the ‘late cut’ and was well known for it. His double century (215) for the Ceylon Cricket Association against South India in 1947 at Chepauk Stadium is still a talking point. Some of India’s more prominent bowlers were in action. He treated them with scorn, born of pre-knowledge of what he would do!
It is a sad fact that he did not pay due attention to his physical fitness. Many were the stories told of his escapades, late nights and heavy drinking on the eve of a match. He would often follow up such revels with a century, dazzling in its brilliance. Not an example to emulate! ” Satha” to his friends, also captained Ceylon in 1948, lived the part of a gay cavalier on the cricket field.
Then there was F.C. de Saram who was awarded his blue at Oxford and also represented the University at Tennis and Golf. This old Ceylon captain was a man dedicated to the task of improving cricket in the country. He had a forthright character, was no respecter of persons, and called a spade a spade. His sincerity about the game was unquestionable.
At Oxford in 1934, he was the first player in England to score a century against the devastating leg spinner then, C.V. Grimmett. English papers rightfully headlined “de Saram shows how to face Grimmett”.
Sunil mentioned that he was able to benefit considerably from having known him and talked cricket with him. His constructive criticism at the nets was a tremendous education to him. He was unconventional in language, which reminded him of an occasion when he got out close to the wicket- bat and pad on a wet track. He came upto him and said “you should have known better how to hold a ‘dead bat’ like my ‘dead…..!’
This grand old man was a great captain of Sri Lanka who planned his moves as a General did his battles. Inside that rough exterior was a man of sound common sense steeped in cricket knowledge. Ceylon’s great ambassador in the 1920’s was Dr C.H. Gunasekera who played for Cambridge and later for Middlesex with Sir Pelham Warner. Middlesex won the county championship that year - 1921.
He was said to have an amazingly quick assessment of a batsman’s weakness. But fielding was his undoubted forte.
He was well known throughout the length and breadth of cricketing England as the India Rubber Man. He was caricatured in the Daily Express, all arms and legs stretched telescopically in all directions, grabbing a ball in flight. It’s a matter of regret that he did not meet him often. He could have learnt much from him, concluded Sunil.
