JVP Leader urges Speaker to take over investigation

Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake while thanking President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing a Presidential Commission to investigate into the Central Bank bond issue yesterday urged the Speaker to take this decisive matter to his hand and directly order to proceed on to take legal action against the perpetrators.
He was of the view that the Speaeker should intervene to supervise this process.
“It is proved beyond doubt that Perpetual Treasuries has earned undue profits from the bond issue.The loss of the day of the bond issue on February 27, 2015 alone is Rs 1,674 million,”Dissanayake said. ‘Perpetual Treasuries Limited had recorded an excessive profit of over Rs.13 billion during the 21 months from January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016,”he said.
He was moving an adjournment motion in Parliament yesterday on the COPE report on the Central Bank Treasury Bonds investigation. He said the Perpetual Treasuries had purchased bonds worth of Rs.227 billion during the 14 months from February 28, 2015 to May 31, 2016. Out of that Rs.141 billion worth bonds had been purchased directly while Rs.86 billion worth bonds had been purchased through other institutions such as state banks.
He pointed out 95 percent of those bonds had been sold back to the Employees Provident Fund (EFP) at the secondary market. He said according to a monetary board report that came out last November, the EPF had suffered a loss of Rs 14.9 billion during the above mentioned 14 months.
“The assets of Perpetual Treasuries grew by 1853 percent during the last two years while the asset growth of other primary dealers had been only 31 percent. The number of staff of this company is only 14. It is proved beyond doubt that this company has earned undue profits from the bond scam. The loss of the day of the bond scam on February 27, 2015 alone is Rs 1,674 million. Yet, the Government led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is hesitant to take any action against the culprits involved in this scam” he stated.
MP Dissanayake urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take this decisive matter to his hand and directly order to proceed on to take legal action against the perpetrators while supervising the process. The MP, thanking the President for appointing a Presidential Commission in this regard, questioned why that action was delayed for two long years.
