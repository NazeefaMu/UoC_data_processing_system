Podi Team champs at Red Bull Tuk It

Podi Team from the Sabaragamuwa Province took on a more strategic and calculated path through the rally and emerged champions of the Red Bull Tuk It 2017. 720 participants in 240 tuk-tuks set out at the dead of night from the start point of Thalduwa Kelani Valley sports ground on April 8 to compete across two provinces, covering 20 cities, 190 kilometres and 15 challenges in a bid to reach Nuwara Eliya on the April 9.
The rally, which lasted 21 hours, tested all teams equally as they battled fatigue, emotions, challenges and most of all the terrain of Sri Lanka which proved it is one to be reckoned with.
Podi Team remained calm and followed route instructions presisely to gain the most points. Completing 90 percent of the task through the rally, Podi Team pulled to the top of the pack and from the final checkpoint at the Ambewela New Zealand Farm to Nuwara Eliya saw them pick up pace as they saw their finish line.
Team Eksath Threerodha Ratha Sangamaya came in second whilst Team Ambalangoda secured the third place. Team Pink Lions from Maharagama was awarded the prize for most creative tuk-tuk.
“We are so excited to win. The tasks and the route of Red Bull Tuk It was very challenging for us both physically and mentally including the fact that the race started at midnight which is an added difficulty. However, the whole team played their part well, from the navigators who sat in the back to the driver and all of us knew we wanted a podium finish whatever the difficulty is.
It took us a long time to get to the first task and we were a bit nervous about making mistakes during the challenges but we just kept pushing and I guess it turned out well for us.
Overall, I think this was a really good result and a great rally for us to take part in especially the Kithulgala stage. This had to be our favourite portion of the competition. We are definitely looking forward to taking part next year and defending our title,” said Podi Team, winners of Red Bull Tuk It 2017.
Red Bull Tuk It is a rally style challenge that utilizes Sri Lanka’s most used form of transportation — the tuk-tuk. The course is not necessarily physical, but by accomplishing tasks, which are a combination of active adventure, getting to grips with tasks of local traditions and then the ultimate satisfaction of reaching the end brings the essence of what the project is about. The course this year consisted of 3 stages, 15 challenges and 12 checkpoints from Avisawella to Nuwara Eliya.
