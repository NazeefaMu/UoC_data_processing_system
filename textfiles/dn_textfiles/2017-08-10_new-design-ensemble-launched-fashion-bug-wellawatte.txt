New design ensemble launched at Fashion Bug Wellawatte

Four trendy fashionable collections for ladies were launched by Fashion Bug at their latest outlet in Wellawatte recently.
The brands which were showcased were; Nellrose, Aya, Amani and Miss-Me, by talented local designers who are making their mark in the fashion industry.
The launch was attended by local celebrities Sachini Ayendra and Shehani Kahandawala, both who have set their own trends in fashion, along with many other celebrities, key Fashion Bug clientele, media and well-wishers.
Commenting on the venture, Director of Fashion Bug, Shabier Subian said, “Fashion Bug has always insisted on uplifting the local fashion industry, and it is this objective that drives us towards such endeavours.”
The Wellawatte branch is Fashion Bug’s newest entrant. Conveniently located in the hub of Colombo 6.
The debut brand Nellrose offers unique designs to fashionable ladies. Inspired by stylish ladies being comfortable and confident in Nellrose clothes, only a limited number of pieces are manufactured from each design because ladies desire to be exceptional.
The brand Aya represents the woman by its name itself, and encompasses modern, casual, trendy, hip and work wear. The pieces are cut to perfection and made with the highest quality of fabric to dress women and help them meet their daily needs while expressing themselves through their own fashion statements.
Amani is a brand synonymous with Fashion Bug and one of the most valued brands by its customers. The colourful designs are made to suit customer needs taking to account the latest trends and seasonality. The range also caters to the plus size woman, who generally has a limited range to choose from, thus making the customer feel that she has everything she needs in her wardrobe.
Miss-Me carries a stunning array of ladies’ jeans, offering style, comfort and a perfect fit.
Aya clothing will be available exclusively at the Wellawatte showroom, while customers can purchase Nellrose designs at the Fashion Bug outlets in Wellawatte, Katubedda, Maharagama and Wattala. Amani and Miss-me are available at all Fashion Bug stores.
