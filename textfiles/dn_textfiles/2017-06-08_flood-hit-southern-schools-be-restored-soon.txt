Flood hit Southern schools to be restored soon

Schools damaged in the floods in the Southern Province will be rebuilt soon to create an environment suitable for students to resume their educational activities, Southern Provincial Council Education Minister Chandima Rasaputra said.
He was addressing the media during an inspection tour of the Mapalagama MMV which was damaged by floods recently.
Rasaputra said almost four fifths of the schools in the Matara and Galle districts suffered flood damage.
Mapalagama Vidyalaya, Habarakada Janapada Kanishta Vidyalaya and Hiniduma Mallika Maha Vidyalaya which suffered extensive damage will be restored soon. Rasaputra said as politicians they did not want to mix politics with educational activities. Together with supervisory MP Vithanachchi and JVP member Nalin Hewage, he would deploy special teams to clean up and repair the Mapalagama MMV.
He said three sets of school uniforms, school books and bags would be provided for students under the national programme.
