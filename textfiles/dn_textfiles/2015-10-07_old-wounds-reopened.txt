Old wounds reopened

Fresh from its success at the sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva in thwarting a resolution that would be inimical to Sri Lanka's interests, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have demonstrated that, whatever the differences of opinion within their political parties, they have the capacity to work together in times of crisis.
Nevertheless, a national government between the two major political parties, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is a political experiment that has never been attempted before in this country and is a tenuous concept at best in the local political climate. That is because, apart from the higher echelons of leadership in the two parties, there are sharp political biases towards one's own party at the expense of the rival party, even at Cabinet ministerial level.
These appear to be coming to the fore in the aftermath of the UNHRC sessions, with sections of the SLFP voicing their discontent at the passage of the resolution in Geneva and Sri Lanka's decision to be a co-sponsor to it. If these opinions gather momentum, they could provide a significant challenge to the authority President wields over the SLFP once again.
Central Committee
The party's official position vis-à-vis the resolution is yet to be enunciated. In what appeared to be a strategy aimed at prevarication, the party's highest decision making body, the Central Committee, last week appointed a committee to study the resolution and make recommendations as to the party's stance on it. It is significant that a resolution fully endorsed by President Sirisena who publicly claimed credit for it and for 'saving former President Mahinda Rajapaksa from the electric chair', was not being unanimously endorsed by his own party.
Meanwhile, SLFP stalwarts have been having their say. As expected, former President Rajapaksa - who assiduously adopted a confrontational approach towards the UNHRC during his tenure which resulted in several resolutions against Sri Lanka being sponsored by the United States and being adopted by the UNHRC - as expected condemned the decision to support this year's resolution in Geneva.
Perhaps more significantly, former Leader of the Opposition and now Minister of Transport Nimal Siripala de Silva was to voice his discontent stating that the implementation of the resolution would be very problematic under the present Constitution of the country. It is well known that Silva was once approached to be the opposition's common candidate against Rajapaksa but he was not courageous enough to take the plunge. Then, finding himself as Leader of the Opposition during the short lived government from January to August he nursed prime ministerial ambitions because the SLFP had a majority in the Parliament at that time. Now relegated to the Ministry of Transport, Silva is licking his political wounds and would be keen to steal the limelight.
Rajapaksa loyalists
President Sirisena is only too aware of the difficulties he faced with the SLFP in the lead up to the general election. Parliamentarians were openly defying him and the General Secretaries of the SLFP and the United Peoples' Freedom Alliance (UPFA), Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Susil Premajayantha were, towards the latter stages of the campaign, blatantly siding with Rajapaksa and promoting him as a prime ministerial candidate, should the SLFP emerge victorious at the poll. That was not to be and now Rajapaksa loyalists have been forced to eat humble pie as the President packed the National List with those who stood by him, at the expense of Rajapaksa nominees who were hoping to enjoy a free ride to the legislature.
Therefore, there is still much discontent within the SLFP and the wounds of political rivalry between the two factions haven't healed completely. Waiting in the wings to exploit this situation are the smaller parties of the UPFA, most notably the National Freedom Front (NFF) and the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) led by Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila, a duo who are not shy to express their nationalist sentiments, if they believe it would be politically advantageous to them.
The SLFP-or the UPFA- would face its next major challenge at the Local Government elections. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is on record saying that these polls, long overdue, will be held shortly. They are also likely to be held on the first past the post system, as recommended by the parliamentary committee headed by Dinesh Gunewardena which reached this conclusion several years ago. This would pit the UNP directly against the SLFP- and would test the popularity of the SLFP. It would also be a challenge for the President because Local Government bodies particularly have been packed with grassroots level Rajapaksa loyalists over the past decade.
Sections of the party are meanwhile, trying to ingratiate themselves with the President. Their strategies could however boomerang on the President. When the President returned to the country after addressing the United Nations General Assembly in New York, he was accorded a hero's welcome at the Katunayake airport. On hand to welcome him were mostly SLFP ministers, the only exceptions being John Ameratunge and Champika Ranawaka. The airport was filled with people waving the national flag, although there was hardly a reason for such a spontaneous eruption of patriotism.
What is evident is that the SLFP appears to be keen on reclaiming the spotlight from the UNP which holds most of the key ministries that influence government policy. The party feels that although being part and parcel of a national government, they will be compelled to live in the larger shadow of the UNP right until the next election which could be disastrous for the SLFP.
SLFP stalwarts
However, their attempt to extricate themselves from that did not yield dividends as social media- which played a crucial role in President Sirisena's election last January - pounced on the fact that the arrival ceremony smacked of a tamasha that cost millions of rupees and was reminiscent of the Rajapaksa era. In trying to boost their own images in the eyes of the President, SLFP stalwarts may have unwittingly cost the President some damage in the popularity stakes. The President, already suffering from embarrassment at the inclusion of his son in the official delegation to the UN, could have done without such a distraction.
Tuesday's arrest of former Minister Janaka Bandara Tennekoon on charges dating back to 1999 will also stir the SLFP pot. Tennekoon, it will be recalled was expected to be among the first to defect from the Rajapaksa camp and almost did so, crying in Parliament while making what appeared to be a cross-over speech.
However, he then remained with the Rajapaksa camp and maintained a high profile, even worshipping Rajapaksa publicly as if to ask for forgiveness for his indiscretions.
When President Sirisena made that famous address to the nation categorically stating that he did not endorse Rajapaksa running for Parliament or the Premiership, Tennekoon was one of the first to voice disapproval. Whether Tuesday's arrest is just desserts for that or whether it is in keeping with good governance tenet of non-interference with the duties of the law enforcement authorities and the judiciary will be a matter of intense speculation within the SLFP in the days to come.
With the hullabaloo in Geneva over - at least for the time being- Sri Lankan politics is reverting to its usual shape: familiar rivalry between the SLFP and the UNP. President Maithripala Sirisena has the unenviable task of dealing with this, and being a leader to one party while also leading a government dominated by the other party.
