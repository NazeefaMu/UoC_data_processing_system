100 boats for disaster rescue operations

 
Proposal to allocate funds to produce 100 boats specially designed by the Sri Lankan Navy to be utilized for disaster rescue operations received the green light by Cabinet this week.  
Disaster Management Minister, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa asked that the approval be given to the Navy to produce the boats which then can be located near areas where there is high potential for floods.
The boat is said to be able to carry around 10 people and it can be used at night for search and rescue operations at night. It is equipped with life jackets, electrical lanterns, solar power, first aid kits and communication equipment.
Boats became a much sort after resource during the floods this year when the government found itself struggling to rescue those stranded by floods due to the shortage of boats. The boats are also essential in delivering essential items to those affected by the floods.
