Mythical, magical and  mesmerizing...the warriors are back in style!

Sri islanders rugby, despite its dramatic turnovers. and ugly post match issues soon had the focus back after our brief postponed fixtures post negotiations.
Naturally our resident...experts were last seen hugging a statue at Hatton railway station and singing ...swing low sweet chariot...to their hearts content and plenty of misty eyed faithful hoping the pendulum settled in their favour.
As predicted despite much economics and a general sense of calm. The Singer school season, certainly turned upside down...but thankfully able to deliver the league for the rest to enjoy.
2018 has so far been perhaps the biggest ever impact among players, family and spectators.
The game must go on ....even if we disagree about its rules ...we must protect the kids, from the inevitable.
We cannot imagine the mindset of those who deliberately aim to disrupt.
Thankfully sanity and common sense prevailed...and we were back to our great code.
Assuming assurances ok and the last two critical weekends are ready for kickoff...
What a pleasant thought, what a grand turnaround for the schools.
Royal ran out to simply breeze past a bewildered Patana. Completely outplayed and given the treatment for 65mins last Saturday. Reid Avenue stepping up their fluidity and scoring at leisure.
I am hopeful that the green machine will pull things back by the knockouts?
Top performance from the defending league champions...and little to interrupt their precision this season.
At CR, it was the mighty Joe-Pete and plenty on the line ...least of all...the Martis v Nilufer factor...
All speculation and pundit/experts, claims to be settled on the day in the middle...70 minutes of pressure, pleasure, presumption and pain.
A trophy at stake and an epic confrontation about to unfold...
Plenty of rhetoric to fuel the passion reserves, and resilient fervour on both sides?
I did mention the nature of this Josephian team...and their latent ability to pressure play anyone, irrespective of skills, stats and reputations.
Peters were certainly up for it and looking for a likely opportunity to dismantle the Joe’s upfront etc ....
What Peter’s hadn’t anticipated or considered was how they handled 50mins with 14 players and resolutely defended their 10-5 scoreline right through.
Many are still fuddled and question the wisdom of not taking their penalty kicks? Was that part of their game strategy...presumably expecting to have the 15 v 14 players equation, to their running game advantage?
But on the day ...in the middle, it was a stonewall Joseph’s defence that gave them the big W ...and a famous victory against the odds and despite only 14 on the park.....much relief for the red card offender, after his early shower…
History will record the facts ...St Joseph’s beat St Peter’s 10/5...on 2nd June 2018.
On that same note…Royal v Peter’s for the league cup and also on Saturday 9th Joes v Patana for the runner-up slot
Currently it’s Royal 46, Joe’s 42, Peter’s 41....focus should be on the match, and playing well to their plan ...not trying for league positions....fair?
On global rugby ...what a clinical London 7s tour by Fiji ...who simply ran rings around everyone they played, and complete proof what a remarkable team and depth they carry in this HSBC World Series 2018.
The final v the Boks minus Cecil Africa meant South Africa were only a single barrel finisher...and a runner short.
Fiji too much power and form from the breakdowns ...closed the African machine off and denied them good ball with some mind altering defense all across the park.
The 21point victory a delightful testament to the team skills and try scoring appetite that make their 21/17 win such a grand whisper for the final series weekend in glamorous Paris.
Definitely worth a trip if you can clock the time and discipline the mind?
Finally with the club 7s second leg in a fortnight...Kandy who won the 1st Racecourse leg are pulling out while CR will step up a side.
On that note…thank you for all those genuine rugby hearts who asked about our famous 7s win in Fiji, beating Uruguay in that Bowl final.
The team including current WPRFU president Nazeem Mohammed, as approved for travel by the Minister of Sport, Bimal Perera - CH, Asoka Jayasena - Police, Nazeem Mohammed - CH, Sudath Sampath – Police, Hilmy Saheed - Havelocks, Jude Pillai – CH, Chan Perera (C) - CH. Graham Raux - Havelocks, Azad Junkeer - CH, Alex Nishanta – Havelocks, Coach - Tony Amit, Manager - Udekka Tennekoon.
What a grand result to beat Uruguay by 2 tries, coming from behind in the 2nd half ...and certainly my proudest moment in national colours ...special history for me as skipper of my last international series and perhaps our islands most significant away win so far.
The quality of skill talent and stamina…quite a passport and experience to step up as required.
Blessings to all Sri Rugby islanders and courage to face the world’s best.
Bula bula the mind for more!
