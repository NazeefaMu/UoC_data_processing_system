‘New insurance regulations pose challenges to companies’

Matthew Maguire, Partner Two of NMG Consulting said that recent changes in the Sri Lankan regulatory landscape have resulted in companies having to think more strategically about their underlying business, and the consequences from a risk based perspective.
Speaking at the NMG Consulting networking reception for its clients at the Colombo Swimming Club to celebrate its 25th anniversary, he said that this has led to a “step change” in the ways companies approach their business.
Maguire said that while the motor business continues to dominate the industry, the results for the industry will depend upon the experience of this class. With the ongoing regulatory changes following the “Full Implementation” of RBC, companies are more closely scrutinising their return on capital and how they want to participate in the industry. This is already apparent following the M&A activity seen over the last two years.”
