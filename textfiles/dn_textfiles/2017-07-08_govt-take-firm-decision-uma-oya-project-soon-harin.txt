Govt. to take firm decision on Uma Oya project soon: Harin

The Government would soon take a firm decision on the Uma Oya multi-purpose project on the directives of international experts scheduled to visit the country by next month, said Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando.
The minister said so while addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday. He said that though the project had commenced during the last regime, it was the responsibility of the present government to bring an acceptable solution for the issues of the project, since the people of several areas Uva, have been affected by the project.
With the recommendations of the experts, the decision on whether to stop the project or to introduce measures to minimize the damage would be taken by the Government. He added that the affected people of the Uma Oya project have already been compensated. Accordingly, 2,400 affected families have been compensated with Rs 500 million. Besides, a sum of Rs 352 million have been allocated for a drinking water project for the affected people.
However, the Minister admitted that there were certain defects in the compensation process. Minister Fernando said that when the present government came to power, over 48 per cent of the project had been completed. “Both the President and Prime Minister on a common stance to solve the issue as it is a burning problem to the people of Uva,” he said. He said the President had appointed a Cabinet Sub Committee to look into the matter.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation would also be carried out to inquire into the misconducts of the project.
The investigation would draw attention on tender frauds, fake environmental impact report etc. “The Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry has announced a temporary suspension of the drilling operations taking place in the Uma Oya Project for ten days, until a solution was found for the water leakage that had taken place,” he said.
Under this move, the project was temporarily suspended and all drilling machines would be withdrawn from the lower level of the tunnel within ten days. The suspension came after President Sirisena called those involved in the Uma Oya Project for a meeting to attempt find a solution to the situation that had arisen in the area surrounding the project. During the meeting, the decision on the temporary closure of the project was taken as an initial step to control the situation. Minister Fernando said the he was happy with the decision in a way. But if the drilling was suspended and the drilling machinery were to be removed, it would not be restarted in years, he said.
The Minister added that during the meeting held with the President, he had ordered for a sum of Rs.300 million be allocated to the Badulla District Secretary's office to provide relief to the people of the area after initiating an estimate done on the damage caused as a result of the project.
He further added that certain people were trying to receive political gains through this project. “During discussions the representatives of the affected people had with the president, no one requested him to stop the project, but these very people say entirely different versions after going to Badulla,” the Minister said.
