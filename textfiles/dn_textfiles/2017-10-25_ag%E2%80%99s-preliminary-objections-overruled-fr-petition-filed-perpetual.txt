AG’s preliminary objections overruled; FR petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries fixed for support

The Supreme Court yesterday decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Attorney General regarding the Fundamental Rights petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) and fixed the petition for support on November 2.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke appearing on behalf the Attorney General raised preliminary objections against the Fundamental Rights petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) that challenged the Central Bank's decision to suspend Perpetual Treasuries Limited from carrying out business and other activities as a Primary Dealer.
The Attorney General informed court that the petitioner cannot invoke Supreme Court's Fundamental Rights jurisdiction in terms of Article 14(1) (g) of the constitution since the petitioner is not a Sri Lankan citizen. The Attorney General further moved court that the petition be dismissed in limine taking into consideration the allegations levelled against the petitioner over a controversial bond issue.
In its petition, the PTL alleged that the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka had made this order without having carried out any proper inquiry into the affairs of PTL. The petitioner is seeking an interim order to suspend the Monetary Board decision. The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on July 06, acting in terms of the Regulations made under the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance, had decided to suspend Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) from carrying on the business and activities of a Primary Dealer for a period of six months with effect from July 06, 2017. President's Counsel Gamini Marapana with Navin Marapana appeared for the PTL. Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke appeared for the Attorney General.
