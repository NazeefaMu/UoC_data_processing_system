Sarvodaya Shramadana Sangamaya against plans to amend Voluntary Social Services Act

The Sarvodaya Shramadana Sangamaya had objected to plans to amend the Voluntary Social Services Act No.31 of 1980 describing it as as “Another attempt to weaken the supremacy of the people.”
The new amendment enables the government to have complete control over Death–Donation Societies and Mutual–aid societies in villages. The statement further states that the existing laws are sufficient to control these institutions and the enactment of more laws will simply take away the existing freedom of Voluntary Social Service Organisations.
“This type of new institutions will only benefit the henchmen of politicians whose expenses will be paid from public funds. “We request the government to spend that time and money to strengthen clean and good governance in other institutions before trying to take control of voluntary organisations,” the statement said.
