Some of the benefits that can accrue to an organization from Certified HR Auditors are; obtaining feedback on the contribution of the HR function towards achieving the organization's strategic business objectives, assessing the current quality of HR practices, policies, delivery and preparedness for the future, developing audit competencies for future utilization, knowledge and understanding to align the HR function with business goals, developing the organization's HR score card, setting guidelines for re-establishing HR performance standards and identifying areas for change and improvement with specific recommendations.
