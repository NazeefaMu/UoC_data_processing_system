Sixth annual Capital Markets Conference to feature discussions on Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies

Following successful events held in the past five years, UTO EduConsult together with KPMG as Knowledge Partner and Adl Capital as key event partner will organise the 6th Annual Capital Markets Conference on March 21, 2018 at the Ramada, Colombo.
In a year that witnessed several significant events that could have a profound impact on the Capital Markets, the year 2017 was surely a “Transformative” one.
The Inland Revenue Act, the Foreign Exchange Act as well as the SEC Act were indeed the most significant changes to regulations that have elicited intense discussion at many a forum. The use of Cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, has witnessed unprecedented interest, whilst discussions revolving round the use of Blockchain Technology, Fintech and Digital Disruption have also featured very prominently.
The past year has also seen a spate of acquisitions, especially among some of the more prominent listed entities.
The M&A activity has straddled many sectors and have not been limited to any specific industries. There was also a flurry of Private Equity deals, which may suggest a renewed interest in what was a somewhat nascent sector.
It is expected to feature several distinguished personnel from areas that impact the capital market industry in Sri Lanka and would also feature speakers from overseas. This event has fast become an integral feature of the calendar of events pertaining to the financial sector, encapsulating the various sectors of the Capital Markets industry at a single forum.
The conference comprises a format that mainly encompasses panel discussions, interspersed with presentations covering contemporary areas of interest, such as the new Acts, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.
The panellist would also deliberate on some of the key changes in the Regulatory landscape, Digital Transformation and the heightened interest in the area of Socially Responsible Investing.
For the first time, a breakout session will be held, albeit on an “Invitation only” basis, on a topic titled “Public Utility on Blockchain – Blockchain for Banks”.
This will be hosted by an international organisation, FORUS Global Digital Exchange of South Africa and will feature Sonny Fisher, Founder / CEO, Dr Ghefari Dulapandan, Chief Investment Officer Firstcoin & Board Member, Andras Szekely, IT Director of Firstcoin.
