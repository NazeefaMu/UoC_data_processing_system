Shut down of TNL transmission:
TRCSL reasons at odds with Network’s head

There are disparities between the information provided by the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) notification as to why measures were taken to stop the transmission operations of a repeater tower at Polgahawela and seize their equipment and the reasons given by the head of Telshan Networks Limited (TNL) Shan Wickremesinghe and a comprehensive investigation will be held into the incident,said Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
He said this in Parliament yesterday in response to a question raised by JVP–MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the current status with regard to the order to shut down the TNL repeater tower in Polgahawela.
Issuing a statement yesterday, the TRC Director General P.R.S.P. Jayathilake stated that the TV transmission operated by Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd is presently licensed for 9 locations throughout the country namely Colombo, Nuwara Eliya (Mt. Oliphant), Karagahatenna, Piliyandala, Awissawella, Badulla, Gongala, Hantana and Ratnapaura. However, although they had obtained the license for the above nine locations, the licence for the Polgahawela repeater tower had not been obtained.
The TRCSL said it has informed Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd to shut down this illegal transmission on April 27, 2016. But, TNL had ignored the notice of the TRC and therefore, the TRC said they had been compelled to take action against TNL based on the above grounds, and emphasized that there was no hidden agenda behind this action, the statement said.
However, TNL is also expected to take legal action against the move, on the basis that they had been charged unfairly.
