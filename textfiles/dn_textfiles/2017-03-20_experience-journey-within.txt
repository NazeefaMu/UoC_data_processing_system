Experience the Journey Within

Singapore’s Parkway Cancer Centre (PCC) recently organized a special media programme to emphasize the importance of attending to cancer patients’ holistic needs while treating them physically. CanHOPE patient care event titled ‘Experience the Journey within’ was held to familiarize the regional journalists with what patients may experience during treatment and how to cope with the treatment process.
Founded in 2006, Singapore’s PCC which is known for its holistic approach in healing, touching and caring for patients, is one of the largest and leading private cancer centres in the country. CanHOPE is a non-profit cancer counselling and support service initiated by PCC.
CanHOPE works closely with the medical doctors, nursing staff, counsellors and other associated health professionals, offering a vast range of resources and information about cancer, while helping patients and their caregivers to make effective, informed decisions in their treatment journey.
The panel
The services provided by CanHOPE are cancer counselling, rehabilitation, educational programmes and nutrition (Nutrition screening, individual dietary counselling, nutrition workshops, Cooking classes and resource development.) Through CanHOPE, PCC strives to inspire hope in their patients and their loved ones by helping them better cope with cancer.
PCC Vice President Yeo Kim Seck in his welcome address explained the importance of the centre as a comprehensive and integrated one providing the best premiere cancer care.
Just like the conductor directs the entire Orchestra, the PCC guides the patient throughout the treatment process which starts with a cancer diagnosis.
The PCC is one that provides all required treatment whether it is chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery.
He noted that it is of utmost importance to pay vital attention to cancer not only because it is the leading cause of death worldwide, but also because suffering from the disease is a devastating, emotional and painful journey for patients and his/her family/loved ones.
The other speakers were Nurse Manager PCC Tay Sok Har, Counsellor Dominica Chua, Manager, Allied Health Fahma Sunarja, Senior Palliative Care Nurse Zhang Liting, Senior Executive, Services Operations Dianah Awaludin, Senior Counselor Paula Rusly and Senior Dietician Gerard Wong.
Cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment do not merely affect the physical condition, but evoke a wide range of feelings that most people are not accustomed to deal with, the panel noted.
Manager, Allied Health Fahma Sunarja in her speech ‘nutritional Guide during cancer treatment’ explained the goals of Canhope’s nutritional care. “The centre with its early nutritional assessment identifies those at risk. It provides aggressive nutrition support in the form of oral nutrition intake and nutrition supplementation and methods to prevent nutritional deficiencies,” she said.
The centre is highly concerned about the food intake of the patients during the entire treatment process. As the nutritionist noted patients are educated on topics such as food safety.
“They should avoid raw foods such as sashmi, med-rare beef etc), avoid adding spices, codiments after cooking, runny eggs, shellfish ( cockles, clams), raw vegetables, food peels, salad dressing when eating out and most importantly ready- to- eat food that has been prepared many hours ahead,” she added.
Art Therapy
Art therapy too is used to expedite the healing process. Senior Counsellor Paula Rusly, defined this therapy as a form of psychotherapy that can be helpful to people who are struggling with difficult and challenging situations such as cancer diagnosis.
She explained how this method is used by patients of various ages undergoing treatment at the PCC to express their emotions. The patients do not need to have any previous experience or expertise in art in order to join in or benefit from an art therapy session.
Senior dietician Gerard Wong noted there is a strong link between being overweight or obese and be at an increased risk of 11 cancers such as liver, advanced prostrate, ovarian, gallbladder , kidney, colorectal (bowel), oesophageal, postmenopausal breast, pancreatic, endometrial (womb)and stomach (cardia.)
He further noted that 1.9 billion adults worldwide are overweight or obese and this exceeds the population of China. Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, he noted.
The PCC being always optimistic wants everybody affected by cancer to hope for the best without getting discouraged. As PCC Marketing Manager Max Tan finally reassured the PCC team works hard as ever to deliver holistic cancer care in a safe and soothing environment, well aided by the latest technologies and proven innovative therapies to achieve optimal clinical outcomes for its patients.
