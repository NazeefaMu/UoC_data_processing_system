Appreciations

Pesi Pestonjee: The last true gentleman
Living out the Churchillian dictum ‘Never give up’ was the affable P.N. Pestonjee, affectionately referred to as Pesi, always remembered by his grandchildren as their ‘Papa’ and fondly as their ‘Pups’.
Many people would describe Pesi as a soft-spoken, disciplined and knowledgeable gentleman. It was certainly these qualities that made him ever so popular with his friends and the many others that came to know him. To us, his grandchildren, he will always be remembered for his loud, hearty laughter, his sharp sense of style, immaculate dress sense, no-nonsense attitude to education and learning, his smile of sunshine and his heart of solid gold. While he only got to meet two of his great grandchildren, his family that remains will endeavour to pass on the essence of his legendary qualities to our next generations.
Because of his humble nature, not many realise the extent of Peshotan’s achievements and contributions which have helped promote and enhance his beloved homeland of Sri Lanka. A keen sportsman from a young age, he excelled at cricket and tennis while attending secondary school at Royal College in the 1940s. However, table tennis was his true passion and it was the sport at which he excelled. He went on to win the TT National Doubles’ Championships with Naro Udeshi on two separate occasions at the ages of 14 and 16. He worked assiduously to promote table tennis at the YMCA and across the island, and was even President of the SLTTA at one time.
He also took it upon himself to help a number of family members, employees and friends over the years. Most notable is his contribution to the MRI Scanner Fund for the General Hospital in Colombo, set up by the notable Neurosurgeon Dr. Colvin Samarasinghe. Peshotan was the first donor to the Fund despite many other affluent individuals laughing at Dr. Samarasinghe’s request. Such generosity was only one example of the character of this man who, due to life circumstances, was not even able to finish secondary school.
We have been made better by his example and we will continue to improve ourselves because of the legend he leaves behind. Now the room will no longer echo with his laughter, since he has moved on into the mists of ever after. A golden heart stopped beating, hardworking hands at rest. God broke our hearts to prove to us, He only takes the best.

Dr. Richard Pathirana : Politician who stood for party growth
Leaders who commit to lead with resolute vision, fortified with a firm humanistic mission, have lasting impact on their followers, teams and organisations. Dr. Richard Pathirana, former Galle District Parliamentarian and minister, lives eternally in the hearts and minds of the people of Sri Lanka, as he was one such politician dedicated and committed towards the service of the masses.
He was a gallant political leader who rightly accomplished the task of serving people as assigned by his destiny.
Born at Kapuhempala, a charming hamlet in the Akmeemana electorate in Galle and after a remarkable educational service as a devoted teacher and an efficient principal, he entered active politics after 1977. Subsequently, he held the portfolios of Education and Higher Education Minister from 1994 to 2000 and State Administration, Home Affairs and Administrative Reforms Minister from 2000-2001 in former President Chandrika Kumaranatunga’s government.
His long and outstanding political journey was not a smooth and relaxed one, for he had to face numerous obstacles from various conservative and regressive elements who did not wish to see the rise of a promising new political leader in the region. However, Richard Pathirana who had been a revolutionary trade unionist and a mature civil activist could resist all such impediments triumphantly and reach the height of political domain.
As politician junior to him, the most vital lesson I learnt from him was his unmoved loyalty and faithfulness towards the party and its leadership. During the times of political storms that lashed over the Sri Lanka Freedom Party from time to time, Richard Pathirana at all times stood with the party and its leadership.
The devastating defeat of the SLFP at the 1977 election was a violent political tsunami that swept the party. The number of Parliamentary seats that the party secured in 1971 was reduced to a mere eight slots in 1977.
Following the defeat, disloyal factions of the party attempted to destroy it. A number of party leaders amazingly including Madam Bandaranaike’s son, Anura Bandaranaike and party secretary Maitripala Senanayake demanded the removal of Sirimavo Bandaranaike from the post of party president.
In that power struggle between the son and the mother, Richard Pathirana with no hesitation joined the group who claimed the continuation of Mrs. Bandaranaike as party chairperson and fought sturdily in defence of the party leader. In that political game, the then SLFP chief organiser of the Akmeemana electorate, Senapala Samarasekara also supported the Anura faction. Despite the opposition of the chief organiser to Mrs. Bandaranaike, Richard Pathirana remained loyal to the party leadership.
During the past, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party faced various political problems which were very similar to the contemporary challenges of the party.
As the party experiences today, during the period of the United Front government, a group of 14 led by Anura Bandaranaike and Maitripala Senanayake left the ruling coalition and joined the opposition. Such development of discord in the party circles paved the way for painful defeat in 1977. Nevertheless, the majority of grateful party men loyal to the party, joined hands with the party leadership, amidst many hardships. Dr. Riachard Pathirana was a forerunner in such tussles.
Owing to his commitment in active politics, he was subject to political victimisation as a militant trade unionist. However, no one could stop Richard Pathirana in his revolutionary move.
Riachard Pathirana played a leading role in the 1980 General Strike which was the first working class struggle against the 1977 J.R. Jayewardene regime. Following that futile general strike Richard Pathirana was transferred to a number of schools as political punishment. But he was discouraged in his fight or retreated in his rebellious march.
As the then SLFP chief organizer, he joined the Anura-Maitri faction. The party leadership decided to appoint him as the successor to the then organiser Senapala Samarasekara.
It was not an easy task for Richard to reorganise the party cardres which had been separated into several groups. As a mature and experienced politician, Dr. Richard Pathiran could reunite all alienated factions under one banner.
He was a rare kind of politician who loved and cared for his followers greatly. Without enjoying the luxuries and perks of Cabinet portfolios, he constantly toured throughout every nook and corner of his electorate and of the entire Galle district as well.
He maintained an extreme faith and trust in his people and in turn people were also grateful and sincere to him. The people’s great love and trust was well manifested in every election he faced until his demise.
He attributed all his election victories as remarkable triumphs of the people of Galle. He did his best for the development of the region and for the uplift of public living standards. His fervent ambition was to do the utmost to solve the unemployment problem of youth in the province. He provided infrastructure facilities for every village of the area in the best possible way.
