CIMA Corporate  Partners 2018 unveiled

The CIMA Corporate Partners for 2018 was unveiled at the Atrium, Cinnamon Grand Hotel with the theme, helping people and businesses to succeed. Mentoring future leaders in an innovative manner in the realm of management accounting is the core object of the association.
This 11th edition of the event which was attended by c-suite leaders of the 22 top companies also had CIMA Sri Lanka representatives of the Global Council and the Association MESANA Regional Board attending the event.
CIMA Corporate Partners program is a highly sought after accreditation due to the plethora of benefits on offer for the partner organizations such as the free training and development opportunities as well as the exclusive invitations for CIMA network events.
Speaking at the event, MESANA Regional Board Vice Chairman Chandrin Fernando said the Corporate Partners program makes emphasis on strategic relationships between CIMA and the leading Sri Lankan companies.
“In the modern world, things change rapidly and dynamically and businesses are no exception.
In our profession too most of the activities that involved people are now taken over by technology and robotics thus the job itself has changed.
Yet we need human talent to manage organizations. The CIMA Corporate partners group’s intent is to nurture such dynamic people. I am happy to see the regional representation in today’s event that endorses CIMA’s move towards the global level”, he said.
Asia Pacific Regional Vice President Venkkat Ramanan said, “Every profession currently is going through rapid change driven by technology. The Association of International Professional Accountants was set up in 2017 with the intent of keeping the finance profession alive despite whatever turbulent that exists in the environment. The association now has a membership of two thirds of a million having great influence and presence globally”.
He added, “The objective of the association is to keep consistently and continuously focusing upon the breath and the depth of the finance function and to ensure that it is being able to respond to those changes in the sphere. The future of Finance is already here but it is unevenly distributed.
"Some companies have implemented change in future of finance direction but some have not thought of it yet. The association is geared to provide right competencies for the companies and finance personnel to rub shoulders with the changing environment.”
