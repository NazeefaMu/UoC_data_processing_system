A World where parental love and acceptance prevails: NCPA Chairperson

World Children's Day 2017 message:
“A World where parental love and acceptance prevails” is the theme for Children’s Day this year. In a day and age where children suffer violence and cruelty and degrading treatment at the hands of adults, it is vital that we spread the message of love and kindness and non-violence among all sections of society, especially the children. It is the obligation and the duty of the entire community to rid our society of all manifestations of violence. It is essential that there is sensitization of the need for good parenting skills and guidance is given to new parents in this regard.
A good parent is not a prefect parent but someone who strives to act and make decisions in the “best interests of the child.”
Children too, should be empowered to be alert of possible dangers in their homes and outside and how they could protect themselves.
Neighbours and other members too could get assistance where they feel that there is a child urgently in need of protection and care, by calling on the 24 hours toll-free Child Line 1929.
I highly appreciate the support of media organizations in highlighting the need to promote and protect the rights of children, according to a NCPA release.
