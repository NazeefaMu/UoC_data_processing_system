Commercial Bank heralds Christmas cheer with carols

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon commemorated the festive season with its annual, trilingual carol service, themed ‘Miracle in a manger’ this year. A 35-member choir accompanied by eight musicians, also staff of Bank, entertained guests at the Bishop’s College Auditorium recently. The Choir was trained and conducted this year by Shehan Wijemanne, a veteran musician. The popular local artiste Janaka Palapathwala was the guest performer.
Rev. Fr. Freely Muthukudaarachchi, the Rector of St. Aloysious’ Seminary, Colombo, graced the service and delivered the Christmas message. The event was attended by Commercial Bank’s Chairman, Mr. Dharma Dheerasinghe, members of the corporate and senior management, and by a large gathering of staff members, ex staff members, and their families.Pictured here is the Bank’s choir at the carol service.
