More teachers for NCP schools

About 487 Sinhala and Tamil medium graduates will be recruited to the North Central Province teacher service.
The graduates specialised in Languages, Science, Mathematics and Information Technology, will receive their appointment letters from Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne Bandara on September 25.
Meanwhile, 10 persons holding Bachelor of Education degrees and eight graduates worked as Development Officers were appointed as teachers recently as a remedial measure to minimise the dearth of teachers in the province.
