Lakshina pilots Peterites to victory

 The captain of St Peter’s College, Sri Lanka Schools under 19 player, Most Popular Schoolboy cricketer 2015 and runner up in 2016 Lakshina Rodrigo scored a scintillating chanceless 138 runs and guided his alma mater to beat St Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa by an inning and ten runs in their inter school first eleven cricket match worked off at Bambalapitiya.
His knock consisted of fourteen hits to the rope and two over it and occupied the crease for 209 minutes and faced 148 balls and also associated in a fourth wicket partnership of 231 runs with Shalith Fernando who missed a well deserved century by six runs. So far Lakshina has collected 690 runs with a century.
St Peter’s – 289/6 dec (Shalith Fernando 94, Lakshina Rodrigo 138, Asher Warnakulasuriya 2/36, Vinuja Ranasinghe 2/78)
St Sebastians’s – 79 (Shevan Perera 5/20, Santush Gunatilleke 4/31) and 200 (Nimesh Bandara 59, Navanidu Fernando 22, Tharusha Fernando 44, Ashen Warnakulasuriya 33, Sachin Silva 3/67, Mohomed Ameen 3/37, Chatura Obeysekera 3/34)
