Sri Lankan born Australian author guest speaker at Asia Pacific Writers

Indonesia's fabled Paradise Island, Bali, which attracts thousands of tourists seems never out of the lime light. But a few days ago Bali had a scare. This was due to the fear that a volcano would erupt. It did cause a degree of panic. The Bali Airport too was closed. Fortunately the volcano did not erupt and the Airport re-opened and thousands of visitors relieved.
Back in October Bali was once again in the news. But this was on account of a happier event. The Asia Pacific writers and translators conference (APWT) was held for the 10th time in Bali from October 22 to 24. And it attracted the cream of literary figures, specifically with in the vast Asia Pacific region and also the rest of the world.
APWT according to the organizers is now one of Asia's longest running and most unique literary networking events.
Sri Lankan literary circles should be pleased that a rising novelist born in this country, Rajith Savanadasa was a guest speaker at the conference.
Rajith, whose debut novel, ‘Ruins’, was subject to critical international acclaim was named one of the Sydney Herald Young novelists of 2017, delivered the keynote address on the second day of the conference.
APTW this year brought together nearly 200 participants from around the world. The conference title was ‘Global-local sharing stories with the world'.
The organizers say that throughout the history of APWT, one of the main aims was to open-up a dialogue between international participants and local writers and cultural producers. With this objective an extra effort was made to achieve local engagement through Indonesian participation this year.
The organization paid a special tribute to the support and assistance extended by individuals and allied institutions in the region.
The October programme laid special emphasis on indigenous, narratives. Up front in this connection was the effort of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia-ASEAN Council.
This enabled indigenous writer in Australia to be featured in Bali, who shared their stories with the audiences.
Among the eleven such writers was Rajith Savanadasa who lives in Melbourne.
Several Australian Universities gave active support to the project. Among them were the University of New South Wales, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia National University of Technology, RMIT University and Griffith University, all of which contributed financially towards the organization.
The Australian Council for the arts and the Department of Foreign Affairs too supported the event financially.
The event was envisioned by Jean carmens. She also nurtured it over the years. Dr Sanaz Fotonhnhi was it's Director this year and the organization management committee included another of Sri Lankan origin, the well known writer Nury Vittachi who is Hong Kong based.
