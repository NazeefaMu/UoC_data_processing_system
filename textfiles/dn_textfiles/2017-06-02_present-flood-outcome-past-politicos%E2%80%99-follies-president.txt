Present flood is outcome of past politicos’ follies: President

The destruction and sufferings caused by floods and landslides in the country every year could have been permanently stopped by now if we were able to implement a scientific flood prevention project planned decades ago by American experts with the support of our local irrigation engineers, President Maitripala Sirisena said.
“The respective governments in the past had failed to implement the above mentioned massive flood prevention scheme. Hence, all previous governments that failed to implement such an expedient national plan and politicians who obstructed such a prized development plan are responsible for the present day flood calamity faced by the country,”the President observed.
The President was speaking at a meeting of regional political leaders and state officials at the special Galle District Coordinating Meeting held at the Galle District Secretariat Auditorium yesterday. President Sirisena who affirmed his government’s firm resolution, dedication and commitment to find a permanent solution to this complex issue of regular flood chaos assured to take swift measures to initiate the once neglected project in consultation with experts in the field for the benefit of the country and people.
Galle District Secretary S.T. Kodikara had convened the meeting to discuss and coordinate urgent matters concerning the post flood disaster management activities of the district on instructions from Co-chairs Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva, Minister Chandima Weerakkodi and Galle District Parliamentarian Wijepala Hettiarachchi. “An American team of irrigation experts prepared a comprehensive flood control project in 1968 in respect of the Ratnapura, Kalutara and Galle districts which are the most flood-prone.However, this very methodical and guaranteed scheme could not be implemented owing to the objections of various petty minded politicians,” President Sirisena said.
“We need to arrive at resolute decisions over the issue and plan and implement viable schemes to end the protracted problem. Many of the completely or partly destroyed households are constructed on restricted or reserved lands. Many of such lands are constantly prone to natural disasters such as floods and landslides. At every instance they are destroyed in extreme weather conditions, the government spends massive amounts of money to reconstruct and repair them. For the last few decades we have been repeating the same rehabilitation work,” the President said. “We should end the recurrence of the wasteful reconstruction work after every flood. Instead, we should implement scientific plans to end issues concerning floods throughout the country. For this we have to educate the public with the help of the respective political leadership of such areas. We are going to stop the reconstruction of residencies at restricted and reserved locations, specially identified as risk prone areas. For this national obligation all politicians, should extend their fullest support shunning all differences,” Preisdnet Sirisena said.
“I very sincerely request all political and community leaders to help our state officials to find suitablelocations for resettlement of flood displaced persons. We should find new lands for those people who are living in disaster prone areas. The respective government officials can select locations on government own lands. If needed the government is ready to acquire private lands for the purpose. The main requirement in this regard is to educate the public correctly on the dangers of living on unsafe lands,” the President said.
President Sirisena also requested all concerned parties to coordinate with government agencies in initiating flood relief and welfare programmes.
All requirement regarding flood relief and welfare activities should be channeled through the respective District Secretaries of the corresponding regions. The Disaster Management Ministry is ready to supply any requirements which are channeled through the correct state officials.
