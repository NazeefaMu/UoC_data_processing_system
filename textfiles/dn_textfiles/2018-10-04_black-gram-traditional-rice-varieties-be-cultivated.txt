Black gram, traditional rice  varieties to be cultivated

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed officials to take necessary measures to cultivate black gram 16,000 acres of land and traditional rice varieties on 550 acres of land for the 2018 Maha Season.
Accordingly, the Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Agrarian Development and Agriculture Department, had already allocated 16,000 acres of land in the Vavuniya and Kilinochchi districts for the cultivation of black gram and 550 acres of barren paddy lands in Vavuniya district have been allocated to cultivate high quality traditional paddy varieties.
This programme will commence tomorrow (5) under the patronage of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera at the Vavuniya Municipal Council Hall.
The Ministry has also decided to establish two zones of peanuts, chillies and mango cultivation in Jaffna and it will commence operations in Ganeshapuram on the October 6.
Although peanuts and black gram are cultivated in Sri Lanka, local production is not sufficient to meet the demand and peanuts and black gram are currently imported from India.
The country spent Rs. 689 million in 2017 for peanut imports.
“Many traditional paddy varieties such as Muthu Samba, Manikkam samba, Kurulu Thuda, Suwadel, Kalu Heenati, Ma Vee, Pachchaperumal Rathdel, Madathawalu, Hetada Vee which are rich in nutrients, are on the decline and there is a great demand for rice prepared form these paddy varieties,”the Minister said.
Considering the demand, the Ministry will take measures to grow traditional paddy varieties in 550 acres of fallow paddy lands in Vavuniya during the Maha season.
