Goodbye dark lips!

Sugar Scrub:
This natural scrub works as an excellent lips exfoliant. Whereas the sugar helps in getting rid of unwanted dead skin cells present on your lips, the butter helps to improve the color and enhance gloss on your lips. Make a thick paste by mixing three spoons of sugar powder with two spoons of butter. Use this mixture as a scrub over your lips. Try this natural beauty tip two to three times a week to get lighter lips.
 
Homemade Natural Scrub for lips:
Make a thick turmeric paste by mixing milk with turmeric powder. Wet your lips with water and first scrub off your lips gently with a soft tooth brush.
A soft tooth brush is a very good exfoliator for your lips. Apply a bit of the turmeric paste on all over your lips and let it remain there for not more than 2-3 minutes. Exfoliate your lips again gently with the soft tooth brush.
You should do it lightly for 2-3 minutes, so that you do not scrape off healthy cells.
Pat dry your lips and apply lip balm of your choice. It's better to use homemade lip balm. Continue reading below for homemade lip balm recipe.
