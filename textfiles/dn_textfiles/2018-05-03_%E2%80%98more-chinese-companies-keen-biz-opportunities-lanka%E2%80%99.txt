‘More Chinese companies keen on biz opportunities in Lanka’

More new Chinese companies are looking for opportunities to do more business with Sri Lanka, said Standard Chartered Bank CEO, Jim McCabe.
Speaking at Shangri-La Hotel Colombo recently, he said that the China-led Belt and Road initiative and Sri Lanka being involved in it is one reason for this eagerness.
Asked if Sri Lankan political situation was also been discussed by potential investors, he said that they do question but Chinese investors don’t shun away. He said that there was keen investor interest especially in the Hambantota port and the investment zone which runs through a larger area. “We forecast that there will be a lot of new investment for this zone.”
The CEO also said the proposed economic zone in Horana by Rotana Thailand too is being talked about by investors and they were also keen about the PPP model especially for the proposed Colombo Kandy highway and extension of the Southern highway to Hambantota.
He also identified Colombo International Container Terminal, the Port City as other areas that would woo investors.
Head of Banking Standard Chartered Bank (China) Sam Xu said that the Standard Chartered Bank has already been involved in more than 50 deals in 2017, worth more than $10 billion, across a range of products and services. He said that that was increasing with around half of them been in Africa, a quarter in South Asia including Sri Lanka and the remainder from across the rest of the Belt and Road footprint. “Standard Chartered has the strength to enable our clients to take advantage of the benefits presented by this initiative and we are well positioned to support Sri Lanka to expand its economic relationship with China.”
Xu said that Belt and Road will also bring more cooperation opportunities for Sri Lanka and China. The Belt and Road initiative was proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 to create an economic cooperation strategy, involving billions of dollars of trade and investment, as well as policy coordination across dozens of countries in Asia and beyond.
He said that today China is one of the Bank’s biggest clients followed by Japan, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia when it comes to banking with Sri Lanka.
