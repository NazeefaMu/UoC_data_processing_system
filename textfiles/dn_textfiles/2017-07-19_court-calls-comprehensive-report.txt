Court calls for comprehensive report

Misappropriating Rs. 12 million public funds:
The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday ordered the CID to file a comprehensive investigation report in Courts on October 31 regarding former Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne and five others for allegedly misappropriating Rs.12 million of public funds allocated for the Negombo Lagoon Development Project.The Chief Magistrate made this order following a complaint by defence counsel alleging that the CID had failed to initiate a comprehensive investigation into the incident.
Six suspects including former Fisheries Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, his son-in-law Upul Chaminda Kumarasinghe and four other officials at Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) had been arrested by the CID for the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 12 million belonging to CFHC during the last Presidential election. They are currently out on bail.
In this case, the CID had named six individuals including Gunaratne as the suspects following the instructions of Attorney General. The Special Presidential Investigation Commission had recommended that the Attorney General’s advice be sought to institute legal action against the persons responsible for the alleged financial frauds. Senior Counsel Lal Kularatne appeared for the suspects.
