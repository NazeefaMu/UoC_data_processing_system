Elephants affected by haphazard garbage dumping

While environmentalists are engaged in strenuous efforts to save the dwindling wild elephant population in the country, the haphazard dumping of garbage has in more ways than one, added to the diminishing population.
Also this has contributed to the escalation of the human – elephant conflict with both sides suffering increasing casualties in recent times.
The haphazard dumping of garbage by the Kantala Pradeshiya Sabha near the 9th mile post in the Kantale – Serunuwara road is a prime example for the above. The huge garbage mountain which is in close proximity to the road is attracting elephants in their numbers these days, as food has run out in the jungles due to the prolonged drought.
The people in the area complain that the garbage mountain which was a health hazard, has now become a danger to their lives in another form, wild elephant attacks.
People in the area urge the Pradeshiya Sabha to stop dumping garbage in the area and find a suitable location elsewhere, considering the adverse impact it has posed to their lives.
