The Power of Paper

I haven’t counted them, but it could be that there are about 5,000 printed pages waiting to be read in the form of books, precariously stacked on the shelf in my bedroom. Even as I type this I see ‘Ulysses’ frowning at me for being ignored for so long, Daphne du Maurier’s ‘Frenchman’s Creek’ tries to seduce me to read her again for the hundredth time, while beyond in the far corner rests the ‘Brother’s Karamazov’ wondering why I could not read their story to the end. Now that the book fair is on, I know more books will join this mountain. I know I won’t disappoint them. I hope to consume them all, some day, in the future.
I also know it would be a lot easier to manage them if I just downloaded all of them to my Kindle. But then, they will disappear from my room, and I can’t imagine how lonely life would be without my roommates and their demanding, alluring, forbidding looks.
But, as Josh Catone points out in his article, ‘Why Printed Books will Never Die,’ the writing appears to be on the wall: E-books are slowly subsuming the printed format as the preferred vehicle on which people read books. A recent study found that the percentage of children who have read an e-book has nearly doubled since 2010 to almost half of all kids aged 9 to 17, while the number who say they’ll continue to read books in print instead of electronically declined from 66% to 58%.
For those of us who prefer their books printed in ink on paper, and who would be making our way to the book fair this week (if we haven’t done so already) that sounds depressing. But perhaps there is reason to hope that e-books and print books could have a bright future together, because for all the great things e-books accomplish — convenience, selection, portability, multimedia — there are still some fundamental qualities they will simply never possess.
Author Joe Queenan, in an article in the ‘Wall Street Journal’ argues that e-books are great for people who care only about the contents, have vision problems or other physical limitations or who are ashamed of what they are reading.
He declares, rather harshly, for people who truly love books, print is the only medium that will satisfy. “People who need to possess the physical copy of a book, not merely an electronic version, believe that the objects themselves are sacred,” he writes. “Some people may find this attitude baffling, arguing that books are merely objects that take up space.
This is true, but so are Prague and your kids and the Sistine Chapel.”
Web entrepreneur, designer and novelist Jack Cheng, offers another view, (as given in Catone’s article). “I feel like with e-books, you often just get a meal on the same white plate as all the other meals,” he muses. “But a nice hardcover is like having a place setting, having dinnerware selected to suit the food. The story is still the main thing you’re there for, but the choices around it — the paper stock, the way the book is typeset, the selection of fonts — they add their own subtle flavors to the experience of that story.” Printed books also possess the quality of scarcity, which means that your copy is unique on some level. For readers who truly love a particular book, an electronic facsimile is not an adequate replacement for owning a physical copy.
“There are books that I need bound and sitting on my shelf. I need a copy of Fahrenheit 451. That book is important to me,” says author Rob Hart. “Digital technology is funny — you own an e-book, but you don’t ... You’re paying for the right to access data.”
Cheng has also felt the draw of books as collectible objects. “Personally I’ve gone out and purchased hardcovers of books I first read on my Kindle because I wanted them in a more tangible form,” he explains. “Having a hardcover on my shelf is like having a print by one of my favorite artists on the wall.”
So, it is a mistake to assume that the e-book replacing the printed book is similar to the case of the MP3 replacing the CD, or the CD replacing the cassette. E-books are not simply a better format replacing an inferior one; they offer a wholly different experience.
This is obviously why in a surprising flip of the traditional publishing cycle, Random House printed hardcover versions of E.L. James’ bestselling ‘50 Shades of Grey’ trilogy, even though electronic and mass market paperback editions have sold 65 million copies. And Amazon has opened its first bookshop. And the BMICH is brimming right now with old fashioned book stores. Why? Reader demand. You just can’t collect an e-book.
To quote Queenan again: “Books as physical objects matter to me, because they evoke the past. A Métro ticket falls out of a book I bought 40 years ago, and I am transported back to the Rue Saint-Jacques on Sept. 12, 1972, where I am waiting for someone named Annie LeCombe. A telephone message from a friend who died too young falls out of a book, and I find myself back in the Chateau Marmont on a balmy September day in 1995. A note I scribbled to myself in “Homage to Catalonia” in 1973 when I was in Granada reminds me to learn Spanish, which I have not yet done, and to go back to Granada.”
Maybe it’s just that simple. Virtual books, like virtual holidays and virtual relationships are not real. A book on the other hand, is beauty. A book is a shelf, a wall, a home, a friend.
