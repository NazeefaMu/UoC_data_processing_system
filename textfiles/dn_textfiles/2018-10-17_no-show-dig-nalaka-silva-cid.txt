No show by DIG Nalaka Silva at CID

Former Terrorist Investigations Division (TID) chief DIG Nalaka Silva failed to report to the CID to record a statement yesterday, CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekera told the Daily News.
However, he had notified the CID through a private lawyer stating his inability to attend due to personal reasons and had requested another date, Abeyesekera said.
The CID had notified DIG Nalaka Silva to report to the CID Headquarters yesterday morning at 9.00 am to record a statement regarding the assassination plot against the President and the former Defence Secretary and the two LMG rifles that were taken out of the Central Armoury for two days as well as the missing sniper rifle.
This is the first instance that Nalaka Silva was summoned to the CID with regard to the investigations into the voice recordings of a plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa through underworld criminal Makandure Madush who is evading arrest. This plot was revealed to the media by Anti-Corruption Front Working Director Namal Kumara.
The investigations regarding this revelation were initially handed over to the Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU), but were later handed over to the CID on the orders of IGP Pujith Jayasundara.
