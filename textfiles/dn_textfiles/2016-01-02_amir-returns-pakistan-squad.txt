Amir returns to Pakistan squad

 
LAHORE, PAKISTAN: Paceman Mohammad Amir was set to make his return to the Pakistan team after being selected on Friday for an upcoming series in New Zealand, months after completing a five-year spot-fixing ban.
His inclusion in the Twenty20 and one-day international squads remains contingent on him being issued a visa by Wellington -- a potential hurdle given Amir's criminal conviction for his role in arranging deliberate no-balls during Pakistan's tour of England in 2010.
The scandal, which also involved his captain Salman Butt and fellow bowler Mohammad Asif, was broken by an undercover reporter of the now defunct British tabloid News of the World.
