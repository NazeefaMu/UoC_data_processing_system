BBDO demonstrated its top class creative capabilities by winning the 'South Asia Creative Agency of the Year 2015' award at the Campaign Asia-Pacific Agency of the Year awards held in Mumbai on Monday. BBDO India Chairman and Chief Creative Officer Josy Paul was named South Asia Creative of the Year 2015, BBDO Pakistan won 'Pakistan Creative Agency of the Year 2015 - Gold' and BBDO Lanka contributed with the 'Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year 2015 - Bronze' award.
BBDO Lanka was also awarded the Agency of the Year award at its Effie Awards Sri Lanka debut in February this year.
BBDO Lanka MD Santosh Menon said "We feel proud to be a member of such a winning creative agency network. And we feel great to have been able to contribute to this big win in South Asia.
As a young agency in Sri Lanka we feel thrilled to be able to reach such great heights in such a short period of our agency life." Senior Account Director Chanithi Gunasekera added, "It has been a very active and eventful year for us here at BBDO Lanka and we could not have won this award without our clients who gave us the opportunity to do the work. We would like to thank each of our clients for the opportunity to work on their businesses, without whom this award would not be a reality."
