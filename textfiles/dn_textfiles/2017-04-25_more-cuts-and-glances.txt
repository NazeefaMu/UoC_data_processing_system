More on Cuts and Glances

This article was also written based on the book “Australian Cricket Anecdotes” by Gideon Haig, I hope the readers will bear with the strong words used at times which is typical of the Aussies.
THE ILLITERATE
Carrying on from last week’s article;
Left to do the fast bowling duties on his own, Dennis Lillee bowled at his best. In fifteen first class matches in 1976-77, he took 93 wickets. Against Pakistan he employed as stimulus the eccentric pronouncements of their manager Shuja-ud-din, who had branded the Australian players as ‘illiterate’.
Dennis was sufficiently put out to have a go at Shuja the next time they met----Shuja walked up and in his most pleasant tone enquired after Dennis’ health. There were quite a few people in the room at the time and I reckon that each one was holding his breath. So when Denis’s reply came, it was all the more impressive because of the background of silence. Putting on his most vacant stare, Dennis emitted something that could only be described as a guttural grunt.
Looking somewhat bemused, the Colonel repeated his question.’ How are you Dennis alright?’ At which Dennis repeated his grunt, only louder and deeper than before.
Obviously alarmed at this unexpected reaction, the Colonel hastily stepped back a pace and in a slightly more timid voice ventured to inquire if Dennis wasn’t feeling well. ’How the hell should I know?’ growled Dennis, put on his most intimidatory scowl. ‘I‘m bloody illiterate aren’t I?’

ACCIDENTS IN ADELAIDE
Terry Jenner sustained an unusual injury when WA (Western Australia) met SA (South Australia) at the Adelaide Oval for their first Sheffield Shield match of the 1976-77 seasons: he pulled out of his delivery stride during a spell of 4-73, and wiped from his mouth the deposit just left there by a passing gull.
The players who were rolling on the ground in their mirth as T.J cleaned up, almost missed a rare moment of humility from their leggie. ‘Quite appropriate I suppose,’ he said pointing to his mouth. ‘There has been quite a lot of the same coming out over the years’

THOMMO
Hall of Fame inductee Jeff Thomson had the Allan Border Medal crowd in stitches with a memorable speech.
“Thomson started his speech with: “I admire these guys who play now, they’ve got to work their arses off and play so much cricket – I mean all the stuff they’ve got to put up with, all the press all media and everything like that.
“We flew under the radar. I played football in the off-season, I did that so I could get away from cricket we didn’t have to do it 12 months of the year... we wonder why they all break down, why wouldn’t they break down?”
In typical Thommo style, the 65-year-old had the crowd in tears with some ribald jokes that demand viewing of the speech in full to properly appreciate.
Thomson paid tribute to fellow inductee Grout – the pair hails from the same Brisbane club Toombul, albeit in different eras and roles.
Thomson then thanked his (presumably long-suffering) wife and children.
“For me it’s all about the kids and my wife down there, all the sh*t she’s had to put up with for 40 years, I mean she didn’t get all the trips you girls get down here now,” he quipped.
“Mate, we had to sneak them in on planes, they used to stay in some sh*t hole down the road … I’m serious now! The guys will tell you, all the blokes, no wonder half of them are divorced.
“The reason you’re here, what I’m happy about is all the parents and my parents – my old man is dead but my mum is still alive, she’s 97 … thank Christ, sh*t I hope I don’t last that long … not the way I drink.
“I’m going to run out of money very shortly, especially tonight.
“It’s all those people that help you as a kid, you know the ones that don’t come in this room tonight, the ones that do all the sh*t when you’re a kid taking you to the games.
“They’re never the recognized ones … but they’re the ones that ring you up and say well done, so yeah, it’s for those people.
“So thank you.” – Internet
