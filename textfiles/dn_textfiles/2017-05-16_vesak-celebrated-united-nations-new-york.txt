Vesak celebrated at United Nations, New York

The Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in New York organised this year’s Day of Vesak at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on May 10. It was held in accordance with the UN General Assembly resolution 54/115 recognising the day of Vesak internationally as the most significant day for the Buddhists all over the world.
Ambassador Rohan Perera, Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Co-Chair of the event to mark the Vesak Day at the UN Headquarters, addressing the General Assembly, observed that the message of peace and compassion, taught by the Buddha is valid and relevant in the present day world, more than ever.
“The Buddha’s teachings are relevant because they provide us an ideal framework to view and analyse the reality of the world we live in, and to find solutions to our problems by looking at that reality with a right view, “ Ambassador Perera said.
“In our dealings at the United Nations, and in politics among nations in the present day, right view is a must. If we are to apply the Buddha’s teachings on the right view to our dealings, root causes of mutual distrust, hatred, and tensions could be eliminated, saving millions of lives and easing human suffering. As United Nations, this is the message that we must seek to propagate,” he said.
The celebrations commenced on May 10 with a mid-day dana offered to 53 Buddhist monks representing Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mongolia and Japan, at the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Rohan Perera, his Thai counterpart Ambassador Virachai Plasai, and Permanent Representatives of Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Cambodia, and Laos along with senior diplomats from Buddhist countries attended the ceremony and offered dana to the Maha Sangha.
