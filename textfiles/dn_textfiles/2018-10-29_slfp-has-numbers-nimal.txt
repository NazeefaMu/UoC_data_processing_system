SLFP has the numbers - Nimal

The Senior Vice President of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and SLFP MP Nimal Siripala De Silva yesterday said the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) led by the SLFP has the majority number of seats in Parliament.
During a press conference held at the SLFP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the decision made by President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka is completely legal and the decision can only be challenged in Parliament.
According to MP De Silva, the UPFA led by the SLFP will form a wide alliance with all other political parties to solve the burning issues of the people and build the country.
Parliament will never be closed forever and it will be summoned. Then the issue of the majority will be solved.
He requested the public to maintain peace and harmony, respect human rights etc.” We are trying to bring a better government than the former Government. Some think that lighting fire crackers will solve everything but there are a lot of problems in the country to solve,” he said.
