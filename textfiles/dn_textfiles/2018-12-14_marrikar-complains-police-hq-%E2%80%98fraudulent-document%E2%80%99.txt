Marrikar complains to Police HQ on ‘fraudulent document’

UNP Parliamentarian S.M.Marikkar said that he lodged a complaint with Police headquarters yesterday against the fraudulent document which has been circulating and is said to have been signed between the United National Party (UNP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). A copy of such a fraudulent document is now circulating in social media.
He said that it is entirely a fraudulent document since no agreement has been signed between the UNP and the TNA. Following the vote of Confidence, passed in the parliament to prove UNP leader Ranil Wickremasinghe commands the confidence of Parliament to function as Prime Minister, he said that certain SLFP and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna members are leveling allegations that the TNA voted in favour of the UNP as there is an agreement between the two parties, he said.
According to Marikkar the TNA voted in favour of the UNP unconditionally.
“However certain politicians are leveling baseless allegations that the TNA is supporting the UNP in accordance with an agreement signed between the UNP and the TNA. A draft of a fraudulent agreement is circulating in the social media now. Therefore I lodged a complaint with the police seeking an investigation into it” he added.
He further said that it has been decided to take tough action against those responsible persons, who are behind this fraudulent document once the UNP comes to power.
“Once we come to power, we will implement the law of the country properly against those persons,unlike the last time” he said.
Parliamentarian Harshana Rajakaruna addressing the media said that it is the duty of the President to act in accordance with the constitution and appoint Ranil Wickremasinghe the Prime Minister again.
“The majority of the UNP in Parliament has been proved many times . Therefore President should listen to the voice of the majority” he said. He urged Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa to resign from the Prime Minister post respecting the constitution as he hasn’t the majority in Parliament.
He added that a constitution cannot be framed secretly. It should be passed in Parliament and it should be passed by a referendum. Therefore,it is a big lie that the UNP is trying to offer federalism through implementing a new constitution.
“There is no way to implement a new constitution secretly since it should be passed in Parliament and at a referendum. Therefore it is a baseless allegation that the UNP is ready to grant federal status through a new constitution” he said.
