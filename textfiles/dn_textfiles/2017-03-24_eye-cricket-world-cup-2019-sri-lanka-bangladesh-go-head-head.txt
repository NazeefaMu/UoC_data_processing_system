With an eye on Cricket World Cup 2019: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh go head to head

Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will lock horns in a three-match ODI series starting in Dambulla on Saturday with either side sweeping the series not only consolidating its position on the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings but also strengthening its chances of qualifying automatically for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.
Sixth-ranked Sri Lanka is on 98 points, while seventh-ranked Bangladesh is on 91 points – seven points behind.
A 3-0 win for Sri Lanka will help it gain two points and rise to 100, while Bangladesh will slip behind Pakistan on 88 points.
However, if the series result is reversed, then Bangladesh, which will aim to carry its P.Sara Stadium momentum into the ODI series, will join Sri Lanka on 96 points and be ranked in sixth place when the points are calculated beyond the decimal point.
West Indies and Pakistan will square-off in a four-match Twenty20 International series in Bridgetown on Sunday, but will be keeping a close eye on the ODI series in Sri Lanka as both are also in the danger zone. Pakistan is eighth on 89 points, while the West Indies is ninth on 84 points. The two sides will face each other in a three-match ODI series from 7-11 April in what could potentially also have a huge impact in qualification terms.
England and the seven other top teams on 30 September 2017 will qualify directly for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 with the remaining four teams getting a second chance through a 10-team ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifying tournament in 2018.
The annual MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings update will be carried out on 1 May 2017 in which results from 2013-14 will be dropped, while results from 2015-16 will be reduced to a weighting of 50 per cent.
