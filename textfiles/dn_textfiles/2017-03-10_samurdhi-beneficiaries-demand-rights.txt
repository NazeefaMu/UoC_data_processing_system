Samurdhi beneficiaries demand for rights

A protest was staged by Samurdhi beneficiaries and development officers of the Matale district at the Dambulla clock tower junction demanding for their rights.
They claim that around 28,000 Samurdhi development officers have not been absorbed into the Divineguma Department so far. However, around 1,000 have been absorbed.
Those absorbed are enjoying all benefits including allowances and other benefits while the majority of Samurdhi officers are deprived of their rights.
"We are facing great injustice and the government should solve this problem," they said.
They allege that the government will reduce the number of Samurdhi beneficiaries by 10 percent yearly and has taken steps to recover Rs.2,500 from each Samurdhi beneficiary which was given by the previous regime to develop their houses.
This amount is due to be deducted from their monthly Samurdhi allowance, they allege. “This should stop with immediate effect,” said the protestors.
