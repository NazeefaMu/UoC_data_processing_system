THOSE WERE  THE epic DAYS

The revised and expanded edition of THOSE WERE THE DAYS by Dr. P.G. Punchihewa can help us understand ourselves, our world and even the shattered universe as it stands today. The powerful philosophy of life consistently reminding all takes us to an emotional world around us. He shows us how little stories especially written for children and some for adults, can make the world change. You will enjoy exploring their hidden wisdom and the seriousness found in simple words.
Linguist is the sentiment based upon the affinity of the language seeking expression in terms of power writing, While it equates any language with culture to one's own country irrespective of an intense feel and devotion and love for one's nation, a writer gets trapped in its web. Keeping in view of the psychology and needs of the young, Dr. Punchihewa finds joy in addressing them.
Natural tendency
We are the heirs of a rich and traditional civilization and one of the oldest being ranked third, have been constantly enriched by intermingling ideas stemming from our roots. As we nurture the intellect of our nation, the natural tendency is mostly evident in children and to explore such emotional desire, the writer steps in.
And one such writer is Dr. Punchihewa who awakens the sense of beauty of the past in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka when those were the days and years he encountered in Those Were the Days. However, the book is not all about children's stories and extended to Fiction, Translations, Plays, Travel, and Research. He has also published three of his works in Indonesia in Graded Reading Series called THE BUGGY CART, THE SCARECROW THAT WALKED and COCONUT.
While writing he was mindful of the changing face of Sri Lanka such as the new school of progress and the graphically presented colourful education system. Around this scenario, he gradually built up a stupendous writing career. The impact of resurgent nationalism preceded only to be followed by re-orientation of the young scholar for whom he wrote fables and stories. He has authentically presented such mini sagas after careful examination. A clear example in The Mahi Series surrounding fireflies friends and lastly MAHI. PANCHA BECOMES KING. Yet, the lack of consensus on objectives among writers of his era, trailed behind the other developing countries who were fearlessly loyal to their culture and heritage such as India and Japan where children's literature flourished. It was a handful of juvenile writers like Dr. Punchihewa who fought such a system. He had an eye for a good story that he translated into children's drama and story.
Unusual experiences
During the intervening years Sri Lanka saw an upheaval in Sinhala literature as well as poetry with varied eclectic and exciting range of in repertoire. The hesitant publisher started examining the potential that lay within the folds of such book both for children and adults. Dr. Punchihewa found himself falling in line with this awakening.
Those were the Days is full of unusual experiences he may have come across in his writing career and stood the test of time to become one of Sri Lanka's brilliant writers. Illustrations in caricature by Lalith Senanayake add clout to its contents which he has dedicated to his wife, the beautiful Anoma who by no means an inspiration to his works. THOSE WERE THE DAYS is a fine token as a gift for any occasion and can rest upon a coffee table.
Prolific writer
The author of THOSE WERE THE DAYS needs no introduction to the Lanka reader who at one time or the other has read all or some of his books. He is a prolific writer cutting across many medium for his chosen subject and they turn out to be spectacular and spell-binding and in 2008 the best translation THE SHATTERED EARTH based on his own novel, in Sinhala, GANA BOL POLOWA.
Apart from being a high-profile Buddhist scholar and philosopher, Dr. Punchihewa is much respected member of the Administrative Service of Sri Lanka and looked upon with respect for his honesty, integrity and dedication to his country and the nation at large and stands as a shining example to corrupt officers of the day that we come across all the time. Ten officers of his calibre can pull out Sri Lanka from its dire state to the road of recovery.
After serving almost forty years in senior positions of our country along with an intergovernmental organization in Indonesia as its Executive Director and consultant to the UNDP, he was fortunate in building up close relationships with many highly placed personalities comprising of different socio cultural backgrounds that stood in good shape for him as he waded through his commitments.
A diminutive soft spoken educationist, he obtained his Doctorate in Philosophy and sociology from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. Earlier an honours graduate from the University of Peradeniya and a fellow from the University of Reading, UK.
