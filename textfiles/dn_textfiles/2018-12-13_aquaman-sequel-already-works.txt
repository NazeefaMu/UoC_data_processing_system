'AQuaman' sequel already  in the works?

Aquaman has yet to ride his wave into the theaters for Christmas and he is already in line for a sequel. The Hollywood Reporter connected with Amber Heard, the star of the film, and from the story it is safe to assume that he will reprise his role for a sequel.
The release this year comes alongside the spinoff of the ‘Transformers’ series in ‘Bumblebee’, a solo origin film and the reboot of a ‘Mary Poppins’ movie. ‘Aquaman’ is predicted to drown both of those efforts at the box office.
The new film will be the first solo in the DCEU film series since all of the top DC stars collaborated for a big battle in ‘Justice League’.
