Driver’s miraculous escape

A branch of a Banyan tree had fallen nearly sparing a driver of a fire engine at the Hasalaka Pradeshiya Sabha around 7 a.m. yesterday (7).
The Banyan tree had caught fire and entangled with an lamp tower with high tension wires on the Hasalaka-Wasgamuwa road before a branch of the tree fell on the vehicle.
The water tank of the fire engine was badly damaged in the accident.
The fire engine had arrived at the scene accompanied by police after a group of youth alerted them about the fire.
Three electric towers had fallen on the road obstructing traffic.
Police intervened and cleared the road for vehicles to pass the spot.
