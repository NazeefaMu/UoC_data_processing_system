Grace Kelly

Grace Kelly, blonde and popular, was one of the world's biggest stars when she was plucked by Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1956. She retired from acting at 26 to become a princess, decamping to the tiny, well-heeled Mediterranean principality on the Riviera.
To say the union on that April 19 whipped up attention is an understatement. It was one of those weddings of the century. Alfred Hitchcock, one of Kelly's film directors, reportedly said of the marriage he was 'very happy that Grace has found herself such a good part.'
Kelly was reportedly accompanied by relatives, bridesmaids, a poodle and more than 80 pieces of luggage when she set off for Monaco aboard the SS Constitution. Thousands bid her farewell, with thousands more greeting her on the streets of Monaco eight days later. Hitchcock and other directors courted Kelly to act again after her marriage, but the prince reportedly objected. On September 13, 1982, Kelly suffered a stroke and lost control of her car on a steep, winding road as she and their youngest child, Stephanie, drove back to Monaco from their country estate. They careened down a 120-foot mountainside.
Stephanie was injured. Kelly died later in a hospital. She was 52. The royal couple had two other children: the eldest, Princess Caroline, and Prince Albert.
