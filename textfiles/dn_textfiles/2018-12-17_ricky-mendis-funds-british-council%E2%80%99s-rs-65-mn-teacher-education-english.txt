RICKY MENDIS FUNDS BRITISH COUNCIL’S RS 65 MN  TEACHER EDUCATION FOR ENGLISH PROGRAM

Earlier this year, in March, the British Council in Sri Lanka partnered with Ricky Mendis to announce the launch of a new project to improve the quality of English language education in Sri Lanka, namely the Teacher Education for English, a British Council delivered project, which would contribute to improving the levels of teaching and learning in Sri Lanka.
Ricky Mendis is a well-known corporate leader who shares the British Council’s vision of a thriving, globally connected Sri Lanka. His prompt response to the British Council’s appeal resulted in a magnanimous donation of Rs 65.7 million to fund the entire project. “My decision to fund this program arose from my concern for the employability of intelligent, qualified young men and women, who are handicapped by their woeful lack of knowledge and use of the English language”, said Mendis.
The project’s goal is to enhance students’ access to good education and employment opportunities by improving the quality of the teaching of English, the language most commonly used in higher education and the private sector. The project is a solid example of the way in which industry and prominent individuals can contribute towards both the development of the skills of young people to support them in securing employment and to the enhancement of Sri Lanka’s economic development through the improvement of the quality of teaching.
The Teacher Education for English Project (TEE) complements the British Council’s Improving Teacher Education in Sri Lanka Project (ITESL), which focuses on the professional development and skills of teacher educators and principals.
A team of six British Council trainers arrived in the country in January this year and are deployed in the four colleges. These trainers are working closely with college faculty to ensure that they also cover the regular curriculum in these colleges.
Gill Caldicott, Country Director British Council Sri Lanka said, “We are very pleased and proud to be delivering this project to improve the teaching and learning of English in Sri Lanka. Ricky Mendis’ vision for a globally connected Sri Lanka with good levels of English will find resonance with employers and educationalists country-wide. A brilliant initiative by a leading entrepreneur.”
