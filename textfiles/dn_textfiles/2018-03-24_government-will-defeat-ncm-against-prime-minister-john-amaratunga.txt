Government will defeat NCM against Prime Minister: John Amaratunga

The government is confident of defeating the No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as it was signed only by 52 members of the Joint Opposition, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said on Thursday .
The Minister was speaking at the swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected UNP members of the Negombo Municipal Council.
"The motion would defiantly not pass since we already have a support of majority of 127 MPs. There was a no-confidence motion against me some time ago. But I defeated it," the Minister said.
"Therefore, we do not have to worry about this matter,” he added.
He said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was still trying to come back to power raising various issues. "But his attempts will not be successful by any chance," he said.
The Minister said these members have to visit house by house in the area to listen to the grievances of the people and to provide urgent solutions for them.
"Newly elected members should work towards achieving reconciliation among all communities living in Negombo. Various communities and religious groups are living in Negombo and we have to create a conducive environment for all of them to live together peacefully. Negombo is one of the UNP’s main bastions and it is our duty to protect it, he said.
