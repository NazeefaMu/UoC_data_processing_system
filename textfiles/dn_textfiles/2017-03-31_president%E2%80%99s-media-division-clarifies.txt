President’s Media Division clarifies

President Maithripala Sirisena signed a Gazette Notification declaring four forest areas north of the Wilpattu Sanctuary as forest reserves, states a release from the President’s Media Division.
The release adds: “Some interested parties with personal or political agendas are carrying a disinformation campaign and falsely state that the Muslim religious places, villages and houses would be seized by the Government and the Wildlife Department under the said Gazette Notification.
“These forests have been declared as Reserves under the Gazette in order to protect the forest areas adjacent to the areas released for the people as settlements to further ensure their security.
“This is to inform that none of the Muslim religious places, villages or houses in which the people live and have legal rights would be seized by the Government.”
