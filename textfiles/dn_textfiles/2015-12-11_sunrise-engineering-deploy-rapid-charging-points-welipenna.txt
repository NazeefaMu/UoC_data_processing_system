Sunrise Engineering to deploy 'Rapid Charging Points' in Welipenna

Sunrise Engineering, a pioneer in the solar power systems was recently awarded with the contract for the country's largest commercial solar installation to date.
This installation, which has been dubbed to be implemented in the capacity of close to one megawatt through net metering to the national electricity grid, will be the largest of its kind to ever have been set up in Sri Lanka.
The location being Canowin Arcade Welipenna will envisage installations occurring on both sides of the locations on the Southern expressway and has been scheduled to be completed by March 2016.
The technology that has been set to be utilized for this purpose is being manufactured specifically from Germany.
Sunrise Engineering had initially proposed the project to Canowin Hotels & Spa's who had in turn gone through the credentials and the potential that the project will bring and have given Sunrise Engineering the go-ahead to commence the set up at Canowin Arcade.
Canowin Arcade is managed by Canowin Hotels & Spas (Pvt) Ltd. and is located on either side of the 44km mile post in Welipanna on the Southern Expressway. The premises have been regarded as the first ever green rest area in Asia. This is an essential rest stop for commuters travelling along the expressway. Each rest area consists of rest rooms, restaurants, supermarkets, Bank ATM machines, clothing stores, first aid and vehicle parking. The fuel stations and service stations are also due to commence functioning in the near future.
On a secondary note, another initiative that Sunrise Engineering has taken up is their collaborative efforts with Ceylon Electricity Board for the purpose of installing Sri Lanka's first fully integrated 'Rapid Charging' Network point at strategic locations around Sri Lanka towards the charging of Electric vehicles (EV). Sunrise Engineering, as a company, strives to highlight the significance of embracing renewable energy integrated Rapid Charging whilst moving forward with the landmark project with Canowin.
The concept of rapid charging will enable electric cars to be fully charged (80%) in 15 minutes. From a broader spectrum, the world's leading innovative entities in rapid charging technology have partnered exclusively in the implementation of EVPOINT.
Sunrise Engineering Executive Director Damith Maiarachchi, elaborated the great potential that Sri Lanka attains in the future of enhancing sustainable approaches as well as educating the public about the significance of utilizing quality, safe and secure re-charging elements when it comes to dealing with electric vehicles. The first batch of rapid charging points "Veefil" and "Rapture" are manufactured by Tritium in Australia and Circontrol S.A in Spain has also been scheduled to be implemented around the beginning of 2016. These intelligent, multi-standard, fully integrated, Re-charging points will be available 24/7 at decisive locations under the preliminary stage of this project.
"We want to give Sri Lanka the best in technology and innovation. These intelligent Re-chargers which will be manufactured and imported is fully certified and encompasses all relevant global regulatory criteria that would ensure quality over quantity. Bringing down the world's most advanced innovation to Sri Lanka, we at Sunrise Engineering believe in emphasizing "EVPOINT" Countries First Fully Integrated, unmanned "Rapid Charger Network" towards enhancing e-mobility in Sri Lanka in the long run," Maiarachchi said.
