Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said that a project to generate energy using Gliricidia plants was launched.
‘Gliricidia plants will be planted in a 2,000 hectares land as a self-employment venture’ the Minister said.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said that approximately 50 percent of country’s energy requirement can be fulfilled by this project using bio-energy, without pollution.
The project will be launched with the collaboration of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy.
