New regulations on employing  foreign nationals soon

New regulations stipulating procedures to be followed when employing foreign nationals will be submitted for Cabinet approval within two weeks, Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said.
The minister made this observation speaking on the FTA with Singapore, while moving two orders under the Strategic Development Act for debate in Parliament yesterday.
He said new Regulations proposed under the Immigration and Emigration Act will address the professionals’ and other stakeholders’ concerns on employing foreign nationals. He said draft regulations have mentioned the categories of employment, employer and employee obligations, and the roles to be played by the professional bodies on recognition of qualifications.
“These will strengthen the regulatory framework,” he added.
