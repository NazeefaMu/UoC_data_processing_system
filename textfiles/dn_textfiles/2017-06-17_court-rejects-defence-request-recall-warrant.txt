Court rejects Defence request to recall warrant

Case against National Blood Centre Directress:
The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court yesterday rejected a request made by Defence Counsel to recall a warrant issued for the arrest of former National Blood Centre Directress Dr. Mangalika Bindusara.
On June 7, the Chief Magistrate issued a warrant against former National Blood Centre Directress for her failure to appear before Court regarding a case which involved the importing of outdated blood plasma filtering units and issuing them for usage.
Filing a motion before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, defence counsel moved court that warrant issued against his client be recalled.
However, the accused was not present in Courts yesterday. Defence counsel said his client is currently overseas and will be returned early next month.
The Chief Magistrate rejected the request made by defence counsel and asked him to make this application once his client was appeared in courts.
Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed a case against former Blood Bank Directress for causing financial loss to the government when importing outdated blood plasma filtering units and issuing them for usage.This case is to be taken up again on August 9.
