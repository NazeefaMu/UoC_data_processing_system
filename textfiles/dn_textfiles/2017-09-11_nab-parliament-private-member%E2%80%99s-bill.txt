NAB in parliament as private member’s bill

The JVP has decided to present the long overdue National Audit Bill (NAB) to Parliament as a private member’s bill.
JVP MP and COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti told the Daily News yesterday that he would present the Bill in the House within a month.
“The National Audit Bill is a pre-election pledge of the Government that was even included in the 100-day work programme. The Government’s waiting game has delayed the Bill for two and half years. This is a vital piece of legislation to curb public sector corruption. If the Government is dragging its feet, we in the JVP decided to come forward and present it to the House,” Handunnetti said.
The MP said the JVP has constantly been in contact with the Auditor General and Audit Services Association over the developments with regard to the Bill. “My private member’s bill will be the same legislation finalised by the Auditor General and approved by the Attorney General,” he said.
“The ‘yahapalana’ Government says that it wants to nab thieves and arrest corruption. Yet they do not present the already finalised Bill designed to reduce corruption and mal-practices within the public sector,” he said.
The first draft of the National Audit Bill was formulated in 2004 and it has been revised 22 times. The National Audit Commission, which has been set up following the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, has been inactive for two years due to absence of legal provisions.
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, convening a special press conference last month, urged the Government to gazette the drafted National Audit Bill observing that the inordinate delay in passing the legislation has hampered work of his Department.
“The latest draft of the Bill has tied all loose ends and got the Attorney General’s clearance. Yet the Government is bidding more time. We have been unable to introduce a service constitution and give regular promotions due to this delay. The approved cadre of AG’s Department has 15 deputy AGs, but today we have only one,” the Auditor General said.
The AG observed that several CAOs (Ministry Secretaries) have reportedly objected to the surcharge provision of the Bill. The powers for surcharge means ‘a recovery of an amount overpaid to a public servant, or a recoupment of any loss caused to the Government for which he is held responsible’.
MP Handunnetti said nobody but those who deliberately contravene the law to engage in corrupt acts objected to the clause.
