HEMAS INTEGRATED LOGISTICS REBRANDED  AS SPECTRA INTEGRATED LOGISTICS

zHemas Integrated Logistics known across the industry for its service excellence, proven track record and corporate backing, turned a new chapter in its journey when the company rebranded itself as Spectra Integrated Logistics. The rebranding was carried out as a result of Hemas going into partnership with GAC Sri Lanka which itself is a partnership between GAC Global and McLarens Holdings.
“Spectra Integrated Logistics is the union of two local giants of the shipping industry backed by a global logistics player,” commented CEO of Spectra Integrated Logistics Niranjan Nallaratnam. He further added that launching a common brand was “a strategic move to position ourselves as one of the biggest integrated logistics providers.”
The company is taking several giant steps towards expansive growth under the new brand including the establishment of a state-of-the-art container yard which will be followed by an ultramodern warehouse.
The new container yard is located in a 15 acre land in the Muthurajawela Industrial Zone in Wattala, within the designated logistics city in the Western Region Megapolis Masterplan Project – a locality promoted by the government as a logistics park between the Port of Colombo and the Bandaranaike International Airport.
With an investment of nearly US$ 20 million by Spectra Integrated Logistics, the new container terminal – which commenced operations following a soft opening on 22 January 2018 – is equipped with top notch modern equipment related to container handling, container repairing, container washing and container rigging to name a few.
This venture is a stepping stone for the company to create a centre of excellence in Sri Lanka in order to go out to the region, focussing mainly on Bangladesh and Myanmar in the Indian subcontinent. The new brand and container yard which targets most of the major shipping lines also seamlessly align with the prevailing expansion plans of Hemas Holdings.
Scheduled to be in the second phase of Spectra’s operations, the company has already commenced building one of the largest distribution centres in Sri Lanka targeting pharmaceuticals, white goods and retail trade.
“With this facility and the gamut of freight and logistics services in our portfolio, Spectra Logistics is set to meet the growing demand for third party logistics services in Sri Lanka, brought about by the increase in global trade, as well as the increasingly important role that the country plays as a sourcing base in South Asia for international buyers, and to introduce the true benefits of supply chain solutions of global standards to Sri Lankan customers,” said Lars Bergstrom, Group Vice President, Asia Pacific & Indian Subcontinent of GAC Group.
To be commissioned in mid-June 2018, the warehouse will have a future focussed set up with a capacity of nearly 25,000 palette positions. The distribution centre will be designed in accordance with global industry standards with five chambers and seven high racking, in addition toelectric material handling. The entire operation is further backed by proprietary software developed by GAC Global and supported by global IT centres in Singapore and Dubai.
