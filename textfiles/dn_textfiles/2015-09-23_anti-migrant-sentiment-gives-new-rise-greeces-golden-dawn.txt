Anti-migrant sentiment gives new rise to Greece's Golden Dawn

UK: Resentment against the growing numbers of asylum seekers crossing Greece's borders has helped solidify far-right Golden Dawn as the third force in the country's politics, one of its MPs says.
Elias Panagiotaros, who infamously described Hitler as a "great personality" in an interview last year, also claimed his party was the country's only true anti-austerity party, after Syriza signed a memorandum of agreement with Brussels earlier this year.
The neo-fascist Golden Dawn won 7 per cent of the vote on the weekend, behind Syriza and the conservative New Democracy - up from 6.3 per cent in the January election.
It scored more than 10 per cent of the vote on the island of Kos, where tens of thousands of asylum seekers have arrived from Turkey since the beginning of the year.
That was double Golden Dawn's vote share from January - and there was a similar pattern on Lesbos, Samos and Symi, other islands on the front line of the refugee crisis.
"We have a lot of serious problems," Mr Panagiotaros told Fairfax Media.
"We have a huge problem with an illegal invasion. Golden Dawn is saying this, we are not afraid of saying things that others want to say but they are afraid of not being politically correct.
"If we want to call ourselves a sovereign country we must patrol our borders. We must have sealed borders. Tourists, businessmen and students may come. No one else."
It did not matter that most of the migrants were just passing through the country, he said.
