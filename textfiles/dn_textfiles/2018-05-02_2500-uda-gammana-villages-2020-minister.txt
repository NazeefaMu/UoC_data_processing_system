2,500 Uda Gammana villages by 2020: Minister

Commemorating the 25th Death Anniversary of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, 2,721 families were provided with title deeds, houses and other relief yesterday at the ceremony, held opposite the late President’s statue at Hulftsdrop in Colombo, yesterday morning.
Minister Sajith Premadasa handed over title deeds to 2,308 families living in the Colombo area, in memory of his father, the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa at the ceremony. In addition, 326 families were provided with fully-fledged houses. Six athletes who won medals at 2018 Commonwealth Games were each given a house worth Rs. 3.5 million. A total of 81 UNP supporters who were victims of political revenge were also compensated at the ceremony. Minister Premadasa pledged to establish 2,500 Uda Gammana villages by 2020.
Minister Sajith Premadasa welcoming the gathering said that he is dedicated to strengthen the Yahapalana government while protecting the President and Prime Minister from organized mud-slingers.
“Some are trying all possible gimmicks to disrupt the progress of this government. We are all dedicated to secure this government upon our lives. Some organized groups are spreading all sorts of fake news and rumors, trying to take down this government. We should defeat all such attempts. The late President Ranasinghe Premadasa had to face a similar situation at that time. So do the present President and the Prime Minister. Some try to come back to power based on lies. I am ready to take a step forward or backward to shield our President and the Prime Minister,” Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
Minister Premadasa pointed out that the citizens want the present government to execute the mandate given by them in 2015. “Titles and portfolios are impermanent. Everything is decided on the power of universal suffrage. We should understand the sovereignty of the people. Our success or lack of it will be decided upon the heart beat of our people. If people are happy, our political journey will lengthen. If their expectations are not met, our political journey will shorten. We need to stand strong with the revolution in 2015,” Minister Premadasa pointed out.
“Some people are trying to imply things about me too. They are spreading rumours on a so-called Raja Yogaya I am waiting for in 2025. I have to say that I am not a man enslaved by astrological beliefs. I believe that the most important Raja Yoga is being a person in people’s hearts,” he said.
Speaking of his father’s political vision, Minister Premadasa said that his father was dedicated to economically empower the downtrodden and the underprivileged. His ideology on social justice is valid to date, Minister Premadasa said. He also said that 25 temples will be established in the 25 districts on June 23 commemorating the birth anniversary of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
