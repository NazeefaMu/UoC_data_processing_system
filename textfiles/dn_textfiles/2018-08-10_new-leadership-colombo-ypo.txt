Whilst thanking the committee, outgoing President of the Colombo Chapter, Dinal Edirisinghe said ““YPO plays a key role in engaging the ages 18-40 youth demography and over the last few years it has led many engagement and community outreach initiatives that had added value to youth of the country”
Calling professionals to make an impact using a viable alternative President elect Pesala Karunaratna said “For a nation to progress, professionals’, the future decision makers of the country, needs to be actively engaged in evaluating policy especially in areas of national interest as they operate as influencers to a wider society. That’s the opportunity YPO creates for anyone with interest to serve the community. Constructive criticism is needed, but action speaks louder, hence I invite young professionals to use this platform to make a difference”
