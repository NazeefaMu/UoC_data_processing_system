Combating Colorectal Cancer : Men beware!

Senior Consultant, Medical Oncology, Parkway Cancer Centre, Singapore Dr Zee Ying Kiat speaks to the Daily News on Colorectal cancer, its causes, treatment procure and preventive measures. Colorectal cancer which is mostly found in men still remains the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world.
What are the main risk factors of colorectal cancer? How can it be prevented?
Age and Gender are non-modifiable risk factors.
Usually, the risk of colorectal cancer increases after age 45. Men, unfortunately, are slightly more at risk than women. Even though it’s more common in men, women also get colorectal cancer.
There are however modifiable risk factors.

Smoking: This is something very important for all the readers. It is not often known that smoking is a risk factor for developing colorectal cancer.
We know that smoking increases heart disease, stroke, lung cancer or oral cavity cancer. But smoking actually increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer too. So one way to prevent colorectal cancer and many other cancers is actually to stop smoking altogether!
Alcohol intake: The use of alcohol is another modifiable risk factor. Actually limiting alcohol intake can help lessen the risk of colorectal cancer developing.
Obesity/lack of exercise: Obesity and lack of exercise too are well linked to colorectal cancer as well. So if we exercise, and maintain a healthy weight, we lessen our chance of developing colorectal cancer.
Food: Red meat is linked with the development of colorectal cancer. It should not be said that we should avoid red meat altogether, but it is important to lessen the intake of red meat.
Low fibre diet: Eating too little fibre is a risk factor. Taking more vegetables and fruits - a higher intake of fibre- is known to lessen the risk of developing this cancer.
Processed food: Consumption of processed food is actually a known risk factor for developing colorectal cancer.
In short, limit the intake of processed food and red meat. It is a matter of moderation. I think the key word here is moderation.
Screening for colorectal cancer is also a form of prevention. Because, if we detect the polyp and if the polyp is removed, we prevent polyp ever turning into cancer in the future.
These are the things that are not only helpful to prevent colorectal cancer but also for one’s general health.
What are the common symptoms?
Half of the patients with colorectal cancer actually do not have any symptoms. It is diagnosed because they have gone for screening which again emphasises the importance of screening. It is known to help save lives and it predominantly does so, because it detects cancer at its earliest stage and treatment is more effective and therefore the outcome is better.
If colorectal cancer does cause symptoms, some of the symptoms it can cause are a pain in the tummy, altered bowel habits (constipation/ diarrhoea) passage of blood in the stool, nausea – vomiting and tiredness.
But these are also symptoms that can be the result of non-cancerous causes. Therefore the best advice for patients with any symptoms is to at least get themselves checked up by their doctor to find out what the cause of these symptoms are and if cancer is found then have the appropriate treatment for it.
How often should a normal person go for screening?
For an average risk individual (an individual that does not have the family history or personal history for that matter of colorectal cancer) the guideline for screening starts at the age of 50 and above.
What are the methods of screening?
There are different methods of colorectal cancer screening.
One is the foecal occult blood test (FOBT) and this test is done to check whether there’s blood in the faeces that is not visibly apparent. This test is usually done once every year from age 50.
The alternative method is colonoscopy (a form of endoscopy), a test that examines the rectum and entire colon using a long, lighted instrument called a colonoscope. If the colonoscopy is normal we usually repeat ten years after the first.
Of course, if an abnormality like polyp is detected the frequency of screening becomes closer.
There are other forms of screening for colorectal cancer as well such as CT Colonography. This is a non-invasive form of screening because it uses CT scanner to produce three-dimensional pictures of the colon and rectum. Although it is non-invasive, it does have limitations. It is less accurate than the colonoscopy.
Therefore if pursued and found to be normal, CT Colonography tends to be repeated every five years and the other limitation of a CT Colonography is, if a polyp is found the CT scan is not going to allow you to remove the polyp. So the patient will have to go through colonoscopy procedure again to get that done.
If detected early, can colorectal cancer be cured?
If the cancer is detected in its early stages, it’s highly treatable and the rate of cure is actually high. For example at stage one colorectal cancer, ninety-five percent of people live normal lives after surgery.
Even if there are relapses, if detected at earlier stages, effective treatment is possible.
Stages of Colorectal Cancer
* Stage 0: The cancer is found only in the innermost lining of the colon or rectum. Carcinoma in situ is another name for Stage 0 colorectal cancer.
* Stage I: The tumour has grown into the inner wall of the colon or rectum. The tumour has not grown through the wall.
* Stage II: The tumour extends more deeply into or through the wall of the colon or rectum. It may have invaded nearby tissue, but cancer cells have not spread to the lymph nodes.
* Stage III: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not to other parts of the body.
* Stage IV: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver or lungs.
* Recurrence: This is cancer that has been treated and has returned after a period of time when cancer could not be detected. The disease may return in the colon or rectum, or in another part of the body.
