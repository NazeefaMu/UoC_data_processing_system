THILINA KANDAMBY

The stocky left handed Thilina Kandamby was in the reckoning for a regular place in all three formats of Sri Lanka cricket not so long ago. Unfortunately two factors blocked his path to glory. Once was, the time when the naturally gifted Mahela Jayawardene and the workman like Thilan Samaraweera stalwarts of Sri Lanka cricket then and established pillars in the middle order and as a result space to get in was restricted to an extent, according to Thilina the selectors at the time were also instrumental in side stepping him!This was unfortunate since Thilina was ready made to step into Arjuna Ranatunga’s shoes as a solid middle order left hander.
Be that as it may, Thilina had clocked 39 ODI’S and scored 5 fifties with a top score of 93 n.o against India at The Kettarama Stadium.He had the honour of captaining a solitary T20 for Sri Lanka against England.He also stressed the fact that he has been a reserve in the Lankan Test team for 17 times which in itself could be record of some sorts. Thilina pointed out that he got three hundreds against the touring English, the New Zealanders and the Indians.This goes to show that either the luck or something else was not on his side.
Thilina gave up all forms of cricket only a few years back, there was no point carrying on since the financial remuneration was not adequate stated Thilina. In 2013 a club player could earn only LKR 300,000/= per season, where as a top level player could earn US$ 5000 per match for Tests and US $ 3000 per match, this is an indication of the yawning gap in earnings between a club player and the true blue professional Test cricketer. There are of course the added fringe benefits in sponsorship packages.
Chandika Hathurusinghe helped Thilina to join Sampath Bank and Thilina pointed out some interesting facts about the “Man of the Moment” and he was none other than Chandika Hathurusinghe. In his own words Thilina said that Hathurusinghe was a one to one man in the sense he preferred to talk to the players without the other players or staff in attendance, Thilina was all for this approach since the player could open out more. But if he was rubbed the wrong way he was quite capable of coming out with choice language, even a late stalwart well known for his “sarong jhonie” taunts would blush like a teenage schoolgirl. Hathuru however was a strong silent character without any false airs about him. Thilina stated that he would even look into the personal problems of not so well to do players and helped them with cash and kind.
Thilina also noted that famous ex cricketers or legends as they say are by and large not good in the coaching stakes since they have an ego issue and they expect “ to demand respect than to command respect.” I was taken back when Thilina was of the view that Anjelo Mathews and Lasith Malinga ( in my opinion both thorough breads in their day who should be left to stud by now) both have two good years left in them, he went still further and noted that in the recent IPL’s 4 out of 5 matches were lost due to the heavy scoring on the 20th over and if Lasith Malinga was there he would have easily plugged the run flow in those final overs. Now since the T20 is gaining a lot of ground with the ICC and they are trying to make this cricket carnival go round the world(Americanization of cricket) which to me the author is a farce.
Back on track Thilina Kandamby thought that having Lasith Malinga back in the fold would definitely be a plus for the Lankan’s in their future endeavors in T20’S.
I found Thilina Kandamy to be well versed not only in cricket but in other cricket related affairs as well. He pointed out that Sooriyawewa Stadium in Hambantota was built at a colossal cost however, not a single div 1 school team or a single div 1 team was to be found and in comparison at Gampaha with many schools engaged in cricket only a few turf wickets were to be found and that meant Gampaha has got step motherly treatment.
Royal Thomian Fever
At present Thilina is coaching the Royal Cricket team and I managed to get hold of him at Nalanda grounds at Nathaniel’s place(there is name change now) where I had the good fortune of Flogging(this term was used by Late Berty Wijesinha reporting to the Evening Observer in 1964) the strong Bens, just to refresh the readers- I came when our strong top oder including A.G.Perera, Duminda Siriwardene, the former was by and large the best opener in schools and the latter a brilliant all rounder the best in the business again in schools at the time and late luxman de Silva were back in the hatch, so I walked in the score board read 4 down for less than 10 if my memory serves me right.From the word go I started lashing them and there was this left arm fast bowler called Withanachchi who time and again fed me with medium pace left arm in swingers which was cannon fodder for me since I was a srong onside player favouring the on drive and executed the pull shot to good effect when their tired shoulders flagged and bowled short, it was my day I suppose and ended up un beaten on 122 no. Poor Sunil Fernando who was the wicket keeper was also floundering behind stumps.
Fast forward and Thilina noted that the Royal old boys were only interested in their team nearing the Royal Thomian and thereafter their enthusiasm just fizzled out.This goes to show that they were interested only in the tamasha of the Royal Thomian be that as it may but the Tamashas going around will one day ruin this country, why not infuse cash and kind to the village schools and the North and East?
