Trinco farmers hold conference on toxin-free agriculture

Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Ratana Thera’s campaign towards bequeathing a toxin-free nation for future generations, bore signs of fruition when farmers in the Trincomalee district held a farmers’ conference on toxin-free agriculture at the Kantale Government Seed Farm.
The event was organised by Transparency International and held under the patronage of Ven. Ratana Thera and Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake on March 18.
Since paddy lands had been recently cultivated by Trincomalee farmers with the use of carbonic manure as a substitute for chemical fertiliser, with the aid of the fertiliser subsidy afforded by the President and the Agriculture Minister, they have flourished beyond expectations.
They main anusana at the farmer's conference was delivered by Ven. Ratana Thera, while Minister S. B. Dissanayake made a brief speech highlighting the value of this endeavour to propagate toxin-free agriculture.
Ven. Ratana Thera and Minister S. B. Dissanayake later, jointly inaugurated the harvesting by cutting the first sheaves of paddy. Subsequently, farmers began the paddy threshing process.
