1,904 appointed as Samurdhi officers:
Work with energy to alleviate poverty: Minister

The Samurdhi campaign is designed to alleviate poverty in the country. The programme was designed after a comprehensive study of ‘Grameen’ of Bangladesh, ‘Kibbts’ of Israel, ‘Samuel Undong’ of South Korea etc. to address the issue of poverty, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S. B. Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the ceremony to award 1,904 appointment letters for new Samurdhi Development Officers at Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on November 15.
He said most of the appointees are young, who have the energy to work with the people by facing any challenge for the task of poverty alleviation.
“You will be getting the chance to work with underprivileged villagers and they will call you ‘Samurdhi Mahaththaya’ or ‘Samurdhi Nona’ out of respect. Your duties will include participating in funerals, weddings and other special events to provide assistance. Whenever they need your support, you must be at their door-step. We will provide all facilities without delay,” he said.
He added that as a campaign, Samurdhi is strong enough to facilitate the people financially since the fund is quite large.
We have about Rs. 20 billion, he said. Unfortunately, during the last 10 years, the Samurdhi campaign was not treated well and did not earn well as it has not invested money in the proper places with good rates. Sometimes they had invested money with 2 percent or 3 percent rates for the last 10 years.
But if they invested the money in banks with good rates, we could have earned at least Rs. 40 billion, the minister stressed.
