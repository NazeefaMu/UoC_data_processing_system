The Coca-Cola Company Reports Strong Results in Second Quarter 2018

The Coca-Cola Company continued to execute on its key strategies in the second quarter of 2018.

During the quarter, the company continued to accelerate its evolution as a total beverage company, from testing new products locally to lifting and shifting successful brands globally.
The company is also driving an acceleration in the sparkling soft drinks category through investment and innovation, with 5% retail value growth in its sparkling portfolio during the quarter. These efforts, balanced with disciplined growth, have resulted in transaction growth of 4% year-to-date, outpacing unit case volume growth of 3%.

Growth was led by Trademark Coca-Cola, including continued double-digit growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, and also reflects the continued strong performance of Fuze Tea. Margin: Operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, grew more than 950 basis points. Comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expanded more than 300 basis points, driven by divestitures of lower-margin bottling operations and the company’s ongoing productivity efforts, partially offset by an approximate 200 basis point headwind from the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard and the impact of currency. Market share: The company continued to gain value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages. Revenues: Net revenues declined 8% to $8.9 billion, impacted by a 15% headwind from there franchising of company-owned bottling operations. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 5%, driven by concentrate sales growth of more than 2% and price/mix growth of more than 2%. Cash flow: Year-to-date cash from operations was $2.6 billion, down 22%. The decline was largely due to the impact of more than $600 million from the year-over-year increase in tax payments in addition to the impact of the refranchising of North American bottling territories, partially offset by strong cash generation in the underlying business. Year-to-date free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $2.0 billion, down 20%. Share repurchases: Year-to-date purchases of stock for treasury were $1.3 billion. Year-to-date net share repurchases (non-GAAP) totaled $730 million.

Unit case volume grew 2% in the quarter. Category cluster performance was as follows: Sparkling soft drinks: 2%, Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages: -2%, Water, enhanced water and sports drinks: 4%, Tea and coffee: -1%, Operating income was impacted by comparability items, predominantly charges associated with productivity and reinvestment initiatives, as well as structural items related to refranchising.
