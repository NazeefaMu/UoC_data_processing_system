Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe accepted President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to remove him from all Ministerial posts, a short while ago.
At a meeting held on August 17 Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe came to an agreement with the UNP Working Committee to be removed from the office if he fails to retract the statement made expressing his disagreement with the Hambantota Port agreement Sri Lanka signed with China on or before August 21.
However the United National Party (UNP) Working Committee requested President Sirisena yesterday to remove Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from office due to non compliance to the agreement.
