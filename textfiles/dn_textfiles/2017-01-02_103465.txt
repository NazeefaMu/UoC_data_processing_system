He said that one the reasons for his success is the innovations and their R and D Section for which around 4% of their profits are reinvested.“I also attend regular global exhibitions on Plastics and bring in ideas from it and my R&D team innovates and makes new designs.”
These designs are very popular among the market and these new structures have also helped some of the producers to have an edge (simply because of our design) over its competitors. Some of the attractive vinegar, soya sauce and oil bottles in the market are designed by them.”
Today the company employs a workforce of 30 and some of our machine producers and mould makers are trained in both Japan and China.
