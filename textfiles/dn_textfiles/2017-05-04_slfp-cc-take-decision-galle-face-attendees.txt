SLFP CC to take decision on Galle Face attendees

The Central Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will meet and decide on the course of action to be taken against the SLFP MPs who participated in the Galle Face May Day rally, UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday he said that the Central Committee will not meet on May 5. “Democracy in the SLFP is at its highest point now and therefore the fate of the Gall Face attendees will not be decided by one person such as President Sirisena or the SLFP or UPFA General Secretary. It will be decided by the SLFP Central Committee” ,Amaraweera said.
According to Minister Amaraweera, elections will be held and there is no need for the Joint Opposition to organize `hartals’ demanding elections. An election cannot be won by just asking for it and the 2015 Presidential Election campaign saw large crowds flock to the rallies addressed by the former President.On that occasion only 500 or 600 persons attended the rallies addressed by the Common Candidate. However the former President was defeated and the Common Candidate won. The SLFP will never be divided. All will unite one day just as it happened at other times in the party’s history.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that it is very painful to see the former President on the stage of another political party’s May Day rally for the first time in the history. If he told that he wanted the Chairmanship of the SLFP, we would have supported him. When the top people unite, the followers will suffer. The best example is Buddhika Pathirana.
Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said that disgruntled elements also participated in the Galle Face May Day rally. Some political parties had demanded those aspiring to be candidates at the next election to bring buses full of people to May Day rally. But the SLFP did not do that.
