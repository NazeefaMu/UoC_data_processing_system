Palmyra trees in Hambantota reducing

The felling of Palmyra trees along the coastal belt of Hambantota goes on unabated, under the noses of the law enforcement officers, residents complain. There had been 5,000 Palmyra trees in 1992 along the coastal belt but now there are only a few hundred trees.
An Englishman named Murray, who was a government agent in Hambantota then, had inaugurated the Palmyra cultivation.
A street was also named after him, known as Murray Street, as a mark of respect for his services.
