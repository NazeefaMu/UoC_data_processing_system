All smiles …

The term ‘forever young’ could have been invented for her. At forty plus years Dilhani Ashokamala Ekanayake can safely step into the shoes of a character much younger than her age. According to her husband, Priyankara Perera, the secret to her youthful beauty is in her carefree nature. She has always been one such person who just loves to be herself and her signature laugh is a great example of how one should let go of stress and simply love what life has to offer. Dividing her time between her shooting schedules and home making, Dilhani has given life to some pivotal roles in recent times. Two of her films Dharmayuddhaya and Heena Hoyana Samanallu are currently screening in cinemas islandwide.
The professional
I haven’t acted for nearly 20 years. Therefore I do not know how shooting proceeds now. However Dilhani has always been very friendly with everyone on the sets. She has been a loveable figure among all the artistes those days. They considered her as their ‘little sister’ because she joined the field when she was very young.
Though she is still acting in many productions now, Dilhani is also very selective. She had to let go of some productions due to issues with the dates. There are also instances in which she has given the green light for a production only to find that another actress had taken over the role later. However, she does not fret over such matters.
The person
Dilhani is not a serious character. However, she is very thoughtful and well aware of what she is doing and what is happening around her. She is easy going. She does not like to take all the issues and stressful factors around her onto her shoulders. She simply loves to live the moment, basking in happiness and freedom. At times even those around her have trouble trying to figure out what is going on in her head. Therefore, it is difficult for people to judge her at a glance.
Lifestyle
Dilhani acted in fewer productions after marriage. She gave acting a break for about one and a half years after our son was born. She had a lot of help from her mother and a couple of maids then. I never pressurised her to handle the household chores. Since I too have been into acting, I knew the nature of the field. There is an understanding between us. Now that our son is 22 years old she can dedicate herself once again to acting. However she manages to balance all her duties well.
She cooks and cleans the house when she is at home. She takes care of me too. We get less time to spend together because of our lifestyles. She goes for shooting during the day and I go to sing at musical shows during the night. At times we do not encounter each other for a day or two even though we both live in the same house.
The meeting
We have met each other during film related events and I remember speaking to Dilhani at such an event once. However we got to know each other well while we were both acting in Upali Priyantha’s Wada Barinam Wadak Na in 1988. I acted a guest role in the film while she did the main role opposite Lal Weerasinghe. She acted the role of a girl who was facing a lot of problems and needed to be rescued. Though this was one of her earliest films, I did not see any amateurish qualities in her. She acted her scenes like a pro.
Later I acted in around five films with her. However only one - K W Perera’s Madhuri - was released. That portrays a love story. Two of our films, Madhumali and Ginigath Rathriya were destroyed. Eka Mawakage Daruwo too was not released due to various reasons.
Our relationship was formed while shooting for Madhumali. I only had brotherly feelings towards her then. However fellow actors like Cletus Mendis, Teddy Vidyalankara and Tennyson Cooray played the matchmakers roles and got us into a relationship. We married on December 24, 1993, three months after we became a couple. We held a small function at Dilhani’s home for the registration without having a grand show because there were too many people to invite. However the news was leaked and some artistes like Sanath and Sabeetha gatecrashed the event. Our son, Pasindu, was born on August 31, 1995. He is studying Aerocraft Engineering in USA now.
Work related matters
We discuss our work together. I have requested Dilhani not to act in certain productions at times and she has respected my word. Sulanga and Sudu Kalu Saha Alu which I almost forced her to take part in have won awards. There are a few times I have advised her to take part in certain productions without considering the money too much because I have felt that they are good work. At times people who are known to me try to rope her into their work. I block such opportunities because I know what kind of people are involved in them. She has worked on a few such productions but had come back to me saying that I was right in the first place because they have jilted her or had not kept their word on some matters. However she does not take such incidents to heart.
His favourite films in which she has acted in
I like Dilhani’s acting in Chaya Maya and Eka Da Vehi. Me Mage Sandai in which she acted the role of a Tamil girl won awards at the Singapore International Film Festival 2001 and the Tokyo International Film Festival in 2001 but I haven’t watched it yet. Sulanga also won a presidential award. Aakasa Kusum is one of my favourites. The last one I watched was Heena Hoyana Samanallu and I think she acted well in it too.
I don’t get a chance to watch a film mostly due to my lifestyle. If I feel that there is a good film I would watch it. However my tastes are mostly with past films. Dilhani too loves old films and songs. Many of the films made today cannot compete with old hits. I am also more of a music person than a moviegoer.
Her favourite songs that he has sung
I am into classical music. However it is mostly my father, J A Milton Perera’s songs that Dilhani likes to listen to. Kandulu Atarata Sina Reli Wemi is one of her favourites. We are both fans of Victor Ratnayake and Milton Malawarachchi.
Rumours
There was once a rumour that Dilhani and I had gotten divorced. Many called inquiring whether she was still living in our house. This was the time that Nilmini Tennakoon and Madhumadhava Aravinda had filed for divorce. Since some of the newspaper headlines read that an actress and a vocalist were separating, many presumed that it was us.
We also do not get a chance to go out together much. Dilhani’s film premiers usually fall on Fridays and since that is the day that everyone gets set for the weekend, there is usually a musical concert that night. I also do not like being photographed consistently. I hate having selfies clicked!
Happiest and saddest moments in life
Last year our son sent a picture of the result sheet which showed that he has scored four As in his examination. Dilhani jumped for joy when she saw this. The only time I have seen her crying hard was at her father’s funeral.
Foodwise
Dilhani is not a picky eater. I am more into traditional village food. She can cook in a jiffy by taking only a little more than half an hour. Whatever she makes, though she makes them in a hurry, tastes good. In rare cases, when she sees that something has not gone down well with me she tells me not to utter a word because that she has prepared it in a hurry. Then she makes a beeline for the exit.
She usually eats around 11 am and then has her dinner by 6.30 pm. She snacks on something like a biscuit around 3 pm. She does not watch her diet in particular because at times she puts on a bit but she notices it quickly and works out to lose the extra flab. She always eats small portions.
An alternative profession
If she did not become an actress Dilhani could have been a zoo keeper! She loves animals. We stopped keeping pets because it was very painful for her when the dogs passed away. Now all the street dogs are her friends. She feeds and cares for them. Then she feeds the birds who visit our garden in the afternoons.
A profession which includes caring for animals would have suited her just fine.
