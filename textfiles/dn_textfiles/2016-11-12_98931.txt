Rain may thwart Aussie fight-back

Hobart, Australia Friday: Skipper Steve Smith said Friday he may play with just four bowlers as rain threatens Australia's chances of rebounding from their mauling against South Africa in the second Test from Saturday.
Heavy downpours are forecast through to Monday's third day in Hobart, which doesn't bode well for Australia as they bid to recover from their 177-run thrashing in Perth -- their fourth straight Test defeat
.Smith's underfire side are anxious not to make selection mistakes ahead of the pivotal Hobart game, the second of three Tests, and the 27-year-old captain has several options in mind.He confirmed that number five batsman Adam Voges was fit to play after hamstring trouble and indicated Australia may line up with six recognised batsmen, throwing into doubt the places of all-rounder Mitchell Marsh and spinner Nathan Lyon.
”No decision yet (on the team), waiting until the morning, having a look at the wicket again and the forecast as well,” Smith told reporters at Bellerive.”The forecast isn't great for the next couple of days so we'll wait until the toss.”Asked about going in with just four bowlers, as rain delays should mean they will get plenty of rest, Smith said: ”We'll wait and see. Anything's possible, it'll wait till the morning..”While that might not bode well for the chances of Marsh keeping his number six spot, after just one half-century in his last 28 Test innings, Smith remained coy.
