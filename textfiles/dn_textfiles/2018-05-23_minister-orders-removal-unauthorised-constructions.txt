Minister orders  removal of unauthorised constructions

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had ordered the Urban Development Authority and the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, to remove all unauthorised constructions in the Kaduwela, Kollonnawa, and Biyagama town areas.
The Minister had ordered so as the said constructions obstruct streams, brooks and brooklets that drain water out and prevent floods.
Hence, unauthorised constructions would be removed with immediate effect.
