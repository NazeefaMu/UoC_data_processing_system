SLPP files three more writ petitions over rejection of nominations

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) yesterday filed another three writ petitions in the Supreme Court naming Election Commission's chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others respondents regarding rejection of its nominations in respect of three local government institutions.
In one writ petition, SLPP secretary Sagara Kariyawasam is seeking an order in the nature of writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Panadura Urban Council to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by the authorised agent of the SLPP for the election of members to the Panadura Urban Council.
The SLPP also filed two other petitions in the Supreme Court in respect of Thirappane Pradeshiya Sabha and Weligama Urban Council.
The nomination papers handed by the SLPP in respect of Panadura Urban Council were rejected on the basis-a clerical mistake of non-insertion of a date and the place of attestation of the signature of the Secretary of the SLPP, in terms of section 28 (5) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
The SLPP is also seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Panadura Urban Council, Thirappane and Weligama Urban Council.
The petitioners had cited Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Kalutara, Anuradhapura and Matara Districts), Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and two other members of Election Commission, SLFP General Secretary Dumminda Dissanayake, UNP General Secretary Kabeer Hasheem, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva and several others as respondents.
