Afghanistan fancying their chances

KOLKATA: Afghanistan cricket has come a long way since being given ODI and T20I status and are now threatening to take on full member teams without any fear. Their ranking as ninth in the ICC T20I championships behind eight ranked Sri Lanka has given them enough confidence that they can beat the current defending champions in their World T20 clash at Eden Gardens today.
Afghanistan failed to qualify for the Asia CupT20 but made a strong comeback to qualify for the World T20 and now look a definite threat to any team.
"We came through a tough qualifying round and this time we are not here to participate but looking forward to beating some good teams," said Afghanistan captain Asghar Stanikzai with determination.
"In the Asia Cup unfortunately we dropped 6 or 7 catches against UAE that was the main reason we lost that game. We won the next two games but it was too late for us. After that we worked hard in all three departments and we are ready," he said.
The form book shows that Afghanistan has won nine of their last 10 T20 internationals whereas Sri Lanka has won only two of their last 10.
Their cricket has been boosted further by the appointment of former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq as head coach last October.
Afghanistan will also take a lot of confidence from their last meeting with Sri Lanka where they nearly upset the form book by coming close to pulling off an unlikely win.
"The last time we came near to beating Sri Lanka in the World Cup 2015 but their experienced batsmen (Kumar) Sangakkara and (Mahela) Jayawardene who played an outstanding innings managed to beat us," said Stanikzai.
"But this time they don't have those names and most of their players are new so we have a good chance to beat them."
