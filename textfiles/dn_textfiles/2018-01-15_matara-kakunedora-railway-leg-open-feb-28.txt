Matara-Kakunedora railway leg to open on Feb. 28

History of Sri Lanka’s railway would be re written on February 28 when the Southern railway line from Matara would be extended to Kakunedora.
Upon completion all Matara bound trains will then be extended up to Kakunedora which is a 6 km extension under this modern railway project. This is the first time in the country’s history that a new rail track is being laid to a new area. The railway line would be then extended up to Beliatta which is around 26.75 kilometers away (single line category) and this will be opened in October this year also creating six new railway stations. The total investment for the project is US$ 258.5 million which is being funded by EXIM Bank of China.
The project is being built by China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation along with the Chinese Railway and also assisted by the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau who also built Sri Lanka’s longest rail bridge and longest tunnel. In addition by introducing a taller rail track and not having gaps in between them the Chinese engineers say that trains could achieve a speed of 120 KPH which too would be the fastest train speed in the country.
“This project will establish an important transportation net among air, ocean and the land, which will help local people get rid of poverty, and have significant influence on the economic recovery. The smooth implementation of this project will further strengthen bi-lateral relations and have positive impact on the two countries in the field of economy and politics,” said Vice President China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation Zhao Jun.
“This project will develop and establish systematic standards and specifications for new railway constructions in Sri Lanka and vigorously promote local employment. The area near the new railway stations too would get developed as they would get a new mode of transport,” he said.
The project which began in August 2013 also includes Sri Lanka’s longest and second longest railway bridges with 1.5 km and 1.04 km length respectively. The longest railway bridge is now nearing completion at Wattegama. One of the highest elevated railway bridges in Sri Lanka coming up in Weralagoda close to Beliatta too is nearing completion. “These are being built to avoid marshy land and also to avoid floods,” said Chairman Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau Eng. G. D. A. Piyathilake.
The longest tunnel with 615 meter length in Sri Lanka is just near the exit of the Kekunedora Railway station and the biggest railway station building with cutting-edge design in Sri Lanka will also be built in Beliatta and this too would be ready by October 2018.
This second phase for which the feasibility study is being conducted is from Beliatta to Hambantota and the third stage would be taking it up to Kataragama. The total distance would be 126.5 kilo meters.
