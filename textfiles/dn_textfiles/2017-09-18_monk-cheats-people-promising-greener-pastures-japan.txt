A number of complaints were lodged at Hanwella police against a Buddhist monk who allegedly cheated over 100 people of nearly Rs. 20 million.
The monk has taken money from the complainants promising them to send them to Japan. The accused, Navagamuwe Wimalaratana, is a resident of a temple in the area.
The monk has allegedly taken Rs. 200,000 from each victim. After money was collected, the monk has fled the area. Investigations are continuing.
