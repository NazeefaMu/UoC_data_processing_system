On a roll

She stood out among her colleagues because of her talent with the pen. Next she made her mark in a less trodden area: roll ball. Senuri Perera is a multi talented young girl who has shown her skills in two areas poles apart. The grade 11 student of Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda, has embarked on her wordsmith skills when she was in grade nine.
“Writing started off as a past time but soon turned into a passion. My first translation was Barbara Park’s ‘Junie B Jones and Some Sneaky Peaky Spying’. It is a book for teenagers and rotates around a boy who engages in mischief at school,” Senuri explained.
Some of her translations are Mura Ballo Saha Vurkayo, Ronnie Ge Pimma, Hima Minisage Abhirahasa, Kauthakagaraye Maraka Abhirahasa, Kannadiyen Mathu Vu Holmana, Othuthu Soyana Pinchi Kella, Avasana Alukuna, Avaman Vu Kumariya, Kakul Thune Kasiya and Minimaru Sevanalla.
“I love reading and once a story captivates my heart I translate it because I think other children too would like to enjoy the story,” she said.
She has given her writing a small break as she is preparing her G C E Ordinary Level examinations these days. She hopes to follow the maths stream hoping to become a pilot one day.
Her books have captivating art work to go with the enthralling story. The drawings are done by her sister, Ushiri Perera who is studying at Devi Balika Vidyalaya. Her father, Ajith Perera, is an engineer. Her mother, Kamani Mangalika is a house wife.
Speaking about her other passion: roll ball, Senuri noted that though the sport is new to Sri Lanka, it is a very popular sport in the west.
“Both me and my sister engaged in table tennis first. We were studying at Girls’ High School, Mount Lavinia, then. We got through the scholarship examination and entered our present schools. We had to give table tennis a break because of this. My father came from abroad these days and he brought skates for both of us. We had to use the Bellanvila and Torrington tracks for our practices because Sri Lanka does not have proper skating tracks. We got into the speed skating stages and then got into the roll ball sport,” Senuri said adding that you need to be good on your balance to excel in the sport.
They were able to acquire a coach later who trained the girls on roll ball. She and her sister were soon able to make it to the Roll Ball World Cup Team 2017. They joined the 12 member team (six players and six extras) and took part in the fourth Roll Ball World Cup matches which were held in Bangladesh in February.
This was the first time that a girl’s team from Sri Lanka had taken part in the event. Apart from translating and roll ball Senuri is also a skilled swimmer. She has won places for her house at the school sports meets. Six more of Senuri’s translations are due to be published soon.
