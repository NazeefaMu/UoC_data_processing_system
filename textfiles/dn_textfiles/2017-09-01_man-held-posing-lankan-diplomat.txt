Man held for posing as Lankan diplomat

The Shahdara District Police have arrested a 40-year-old man for allegedly posing as a Sri Lankan diplomat and driving a car with a special number plate.
The accused had been identified as Krishna Nagar, a resident Nitin Malhotra. Malhotra had bought the vehicle from a Sri Lankan Minister and continued to use the same number plate despite the High Commission number getting de-registered last year, said the Police on Wednesday.
New registration number
“As per documents recovered from him, the High Commission registration number was cancelled on July 15 and Malhotra was issued a new registration number. However, he did not remove the Sri Lanka High Commission registration number from the vehicle despite the cancellation in order to make use of amenities for High Commission cars,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Shahdara) Nupur Prasad.
Tip-off
She said the Farsh Bazar Police station had on Tuesday, received a tip-off regarding a person passing himself off as an employee of the Sri Lanka High Commission and driving a car with special registration number plates.
“The caller said the car was parked inside Chitrakoot Apartment of Shahdara. A raid was conducted and Malhotra was apprehended along with a black car bearing the special plates.”
