Fascinating underwater museum

The Museo Atlantico is the first underwater museum to open in Europe. After Mexico or the Bahamas, the artist Jason deCaires Taylor has installed his underwater sculptures in the Canary Islands, off the coast of the island of Lanzarote. This fascinating underwater museum consists of two monumental artworks, titled ‘The Raft of Lampedusa’ and ‘The Rubicon’, both poignant tributes to migrants and refugees. The underwater sculptures of this Museo Atlantico, installed on the ocean floor, 15 meters deep, will be accessible to divers and snorkelers.
