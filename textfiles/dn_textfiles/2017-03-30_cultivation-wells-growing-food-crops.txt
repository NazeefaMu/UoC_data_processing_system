Cultivation wells for growing food crops

The Agriculture, Agrarian Development and Irrigation Department and the Mahaweli Authority have taken steps to utilise cultivation wells for growing short term food crops in the Anuradhapura district.
Many out of 20,000 cultivation wells in the district are in a dilapidated condition.
The Agrarian Services Department has embarked on a programme to remove sediments in 14,000 cultivation wells to make them usable, Agrarian Services Development District Deputy Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said.
The Mahaweli Authority has launched cultivation wells based food drive in the Mahaweli H area.
