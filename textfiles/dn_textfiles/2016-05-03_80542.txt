JO requests President, PM to reverse decision

The Joint Opposition (JO) has requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in writing to reverse the government's decision to withdraw the Army security detail provided to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa,Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardene said.
He was addressing a press conference organized by the Joint Opposition at the N.M. Perera Centre yesterday.
MP Gunawardene further said that the 50 Army personnel assigned to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had been withdrawn. He said that the former President’s life is under threat as he defeated the world’s most powerful terrorist organization, the LTTE.
“Mahinda Rajapaksa is the only leader in the world who defeated the most powerful terrorist organization. Therefore, Rajapaksa should be given proper military protection,” MP Gunawardena said.
“On an earlier occasion, attempts were made to withdraw Mahinda Rajapaksa's security detail.
 
"But, when Joint Opposition objected and the Leader of the House responded and said that the security would not be withdrawn in a manner that would put the former President's life in danger.”
MP Gunawardena said that proving the Leader of the House's statement, the government has ordered that the Army security detail of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa be withdrawn.
Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa also spoke on the occasion.
