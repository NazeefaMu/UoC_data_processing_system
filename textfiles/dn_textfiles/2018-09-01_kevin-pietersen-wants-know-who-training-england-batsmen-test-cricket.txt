Kevin Pietersen wants to know who is training the England batsmen in Test cricket

In modern-day Test cricket, almost all major teams do well at home and struggle when they are up against an even marginally formidable opponent overseas. We’ve seen Bangladesh beat Australia and England at home while a team like India seldom loses anything at home.
On the contrary, the English batsmen have been struggling at home when the conditions have favoured pacers and Kevin Pietersen has raised serious doubts on the team.
The Indian team is in the country with arguably their best pace bowling attack. They have the workhorse in Ishant Sharma who loves to bowl at left-handers, then there is Mohammed Shami who despite being inconsistent can produce a peach from time to time.
Jasprit Bumrah very early in his Test career has established himself as a lethal bowler with the new ball and later as well.
Then there is Hardik Pandya, the floater in this bowling attack when the opportunity comes even he has the ability to trouble the batsmen and in fact trump them as he had displayed in the previous Test match having claimed his maiden five-wicket haul.
ENGLAND’S BATTING WOES
At the Ages Bowl, Joe Root won the toss and decided to bat first, he seemed to have taken a lesson from Trent Bridge. The opening spell from Ishant and Bumrah pushed them on the backfoot and they just slumped then on.
Keaton Jennings was clueless against an incoming delivery, Root got out twice in 14 balls and couldn’t make it count after surviving a no ball dismissal.
Jonny Bairstow at 4, Ben Stokes at 5 and Jos Buttler didn’t make a significant difference either. Meanwhile Alastair Cook after working hard for 55 balls played at one really far and was dismissed for 17.
All the Indian bowlers were up for the task and constantly troubled the English batters to push them down to 86/6. After such a dismal show Pietersen wants to know who the batting coach of the team is and who inspires them to go out there and do their best.
Pietersen tweeted- “Who coaches England’s Test batsmen?! Who in their setup inspires them to to be their best?”
