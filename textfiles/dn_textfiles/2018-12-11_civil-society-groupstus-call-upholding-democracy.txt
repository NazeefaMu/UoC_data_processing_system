70th International  Human Rights Day
Civil Society groups,TUs call for upholding democracy

Civil Society groups and trade unions celebrating the 70th International Human Rights Day called on all ‘progressive’ groups to band together to uphold democracy in the country.
A commemoration organized by the group ‘Right to Life’ at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) yesterday had a ‘Intellectual Discourse’ with speakers from various civil society groups, Human Rights Activist, Nimalka Fernando, TNA Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran, Attorney-at-Law and President’s Counsel J.C. Weliamuna and National Trade Unions Front President Saman Rathnapriya.
‘Our country is facing a coup right now and as far as we know it, there are only two parties in this struggle; those who are against it and those who support it- there is none in between. So we need to defeat this,” said Right to Life, Executive Director, Philip Disanayaka.
He explained that civil society member, trade unions and activists had met on November 24 and lent their unconditional support to the UNP and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to defeat the ‘coup’.
Dasanayaka also commended all groups for having coming together despite their differences at this time to defeat a common enemy.
“Today we have been able to defeat 80 percent of this coup, just a little more to go”, he said.
The Civil Society activist who also called for legal action to be taken against those who instigated the current political crisis also mentioned that they needed to put pressure for reforms to prevent such a disaster in future. Dasanayake also observed that it was necessary for a civil society movement devoid of political interests to be formed, so that they could push for reforms regardless of whichever government was in power.
Sumanthiran in the meantime said that human rights in this country have been violated on various occasions in the country and that the Executive Presidency since its inception in 1978 has been party to it.
“Further the three decade war too contributed to many violations unchecked,” he said.
The MP stressed that with the recent political changes, many feared that the relative political freedom they had enjoyed in the last four years would disappear and an environment of terror which they fought to change prior to January 8 would return.
“We have to take all possible steps to defeat this. We are awaiting a final verdict from the courts but if we lose this, human rights in this country would take a major step back and we would lose all the progress we made overnight”.
He also stated that a persistent majoritarian thinking in the country was also once again raising its head within the current political crisis, with many stating that the TNA should not get itself involved in the current crisis as it does not concern them.
“We have to move away from this, and until this happens, human rights would always be a question in the country”.
Fernando meanwhile stressed on not supporting any one individual or party but coming together to defeat undemocratic moves. As a member of the Office of the Missing Persons, she explained that the truth could only be found in an environment which is free, devoid of fear and where an independent judiciary functioned. Whilst clarifying that human rights cannot be seen within an international or national spectrum, she stated this time, they would have to join the political powers to defeat the ‘attack’ against democracy, “Development, democracy and human rights have to go together”.
Member of some civil society groups are also currently engaged in a silent protest against the government at the Viharamahadevi Park for the last 20 days.
