EDB holds Entrepót Traders’ Forum

The EDB conducted a forum on entrepót trade with the participation of a large number of traders and exporters and others engaged in such business.
Entrepot trade or the re-export trade involves importing goods from one country and re-exporting to another, with or without any additional processing or repackaging. Goods are exempt from duties at the point of import and re-exports.
Sri Lanka Logistics and Freight Forwarders’ Association (SLFFA), Sri Lanka Shippers’ Council (SLSC), Shippers Academy Colombo and several public sector institutions relevant to the trade including Sri Lanka Customs, Sri Lanka Ports Authority and BOI collaborated with EDB in organizing the Entrepót Traders’ Forum held at EDB Auditorium recently.
This forum provided a platform for the traders and exporters engaged and interested in entrepót trade to understand current entrepót trade procedures in Sri Lanka and to discuss the issues that need to be addressed to develop the trade.
Commercial Hub Regulations introduced initially in Part IV of the Finance Act No 12 of 2012 of Sri Lanka was amended by Finance Act No 12 of 2013, cited as the Finance Act – Commercial Hub Regulations in the Gazette Notification No. 1818/30 of July 11, 2013. Goods are exempt from duties at the point of import and re-exports.
The introduction of these regulations made entrepót trade a distinct sector. t traders as follows:a) entrepót trade under the Commercial Hub Regulations (foreign investors falling under the purview of the BOI); and b) entrepot trade under the Customs Ordinance without entitlements to all of the benefits under Commercial Hub Regulations (local traders).
Commercial Hub Regulations demarcated six areas in close proximity or within the ports and airports as free ports or bonded areas (areas which are geographically inside Sri Lanka but are legally considered outside its customs territory and supervised by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka or the Director General Customs or any other authority under the Commercial Hub Regulations) to facilitate trade.
These are the Colombo Port, Hambantota Port, Mattala International Airport, Katunayake EPZ, Koggala EPZ and Mirrijjawala EPZ. Although not under the Commercial Hub Regulations, the Colombo Airport Cargo Terminal is also a customs supervised bonded area.
Superintendent of Customs Thilak Arumapperuma Arachchi, Shippers’ Academy Colombo CEO Rohan Masakorala, Sri Lanka Logistics and Freight Forwarders’ Association (SLFFA) former Chairman Dushmantha Karannagoda, BOI Acting Executive Director Mahinda Ramanayake, Sri Lanka Shippers’ Council Chairman Chrisso De Mel, and Director General of the Export Development Board Jeevani Siriwardena were among others who participated in the forum.
Thilak Arumapperuma Arachchi spoke on the challenges faced in entrepót trade.
Mahinda Ramanayake said the Government has announced the setting up of free ports and bonded areas to create trade-related infrastructure to facilitate import and export of goods and services with freedom to carry out transactions in convertible foreign currency.
Dushmantha Karannagoda spoke om Customs documentation process, locations for entrepót handling, entrepót trade activities, registration process to handle entrepót activity, prohibited items under entrepót trade and exchange control provisions governing entrepót trade.
He said the bottlenecks and red tape need to be ironed out before we start promoting entrepót trade. Bad experiences could divert the traffic and winning them back would be an uphill task.
According to Rohan Masakorala, Sri Lanka’s location on the international maritime map has put it at a better advantage to be a major player in this field than it is for the leaders in entrepót trade such as Dubai and Singapore.
Jeevani Siriwardena said the EDB has identified the necessity for entrepot trade and successfully conducted four roundtable meetings with the stakeholders concerned to identify ways to develop the trade.
She said that the current entrepót rules and regulations have been reviewed to make it conducive to businesspersons.
A session for issues that entrepót traders currently face was also conducted. The first Entrepót Trade Forum was a great opportunity for entrepót traders and exporters entering the global market.
The major entrepót trading hubs that excel at present are (1) Singapore (which bridges South Asia with the rest of the world); (2) Hong Kong (the Gateway of China to the world); and (3) Dubai (which connects African countries with the rest of the world).
Globally, the top three entrepots (excluding the USA), consisting of Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai have contributed 161%, 83 % and 26% from re-exports to their GDP respectively in 2015.
Hong Kong, the world’s largest re-exporter, serves as the conduit to the Chinese mainland, facilitating much of the mainland’s trade, taking advantage of its location and an investor-friendly tax regime for entrepót trade.
Its main market segment is mainland China. Singapore serves as an entrepót port mainly for goods destined to regional markets such as Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan and Japan, apart from the USA and the EU.
Dubai, emerging from a barren desert, is positioned as the gateway to the Middle East and also re-exports goods to many other countries including China, India Saudi Arabia, Germany and the USA.
These three entrepót ports combined commanded 75% of the global market in 2014 as per ITC statistics, with Hong Kong dominating the landscape with 44% of the global market share. Singapore, the second largest re-exporter lagged behind Hong Kong with 21% and UAE with 10% of market share respectively.
Commodities popularly re-exported are machinery and equipment from Hong Kong and Singapore and pearls, precious stones and metals from Dubai.
These global giants are high-income countries characterized by political stability, high investments in superior infrastructure and warehousing facilities, high labour and utility costs, low taxes and duties, streamedlined procedures and focused policies to take advantage of their location on the trade route map.
The ports and airports of the countries are amongst the busiest in the world. Logistics are mostly outsourced to private operators leading to operational efficiencies.
In 2016 Sri Lanka re-exported to 32 countries around the world: UAE (24%), India (23%), China (11%) and Singapore (11%) accounted for the majority share of 69% of the total FOB value.
Similarly, 63% of the CIF value of imports classified under entrepót were from four nations, namely, China (25%), Canada (17%), UAE (11%) and the Netherlands (10%).
