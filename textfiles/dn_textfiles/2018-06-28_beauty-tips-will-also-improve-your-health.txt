Beauty tips that will  also improve  your health

Exfoliate your skin 
Dead skin cells equal dull skin tone. And by not getting rid of them, you’re sabotaging the hydrating effects of body cleansers and moisturizers as they try to “battle through” the buildup barrier. Use a body scrub about twice a week. Alternatively, try daily dry-body brushing before showering.
Using a brush or loofah mitt, buff your skin in circular motions (don’t scrub too hard), starting with the soles of your feet, then working upward on legs, front and back. Pay special attention to backs of the thighs, upper arms and hips. Of course, in the shower, you can use a nylon puff or sea sponge with your favourite body cleanser for a more gentle slough.
Exercise regularly 
Exercise definitely gives you more energy and keeps you in shape. But new research suggests that endurance exercise might help fight, and even reverse, the signs of aging, such as balding, grey hair and thinning skin.
Endurance exercise is aerobic activity-such as brisk walking, running or cycling-that improves cardio-respiratory fitness, according to the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology. The longer you can do aerobic exercise, the more endurance you have.
Stop shampooing every day 
Some women just don’t feel clean if they don’t shampoo daily. But washing your hair that often depletes your scalp of the natural oils that make hair shiny and manageable. It may make hair greasier as your body overproduces oils to compensate.
Instead, try shampooing every other day. If hair is flat, run damp hands through it and blow-dry on low to bring back volume. It helps if you don’t go wild on hairspray and gel the first day. You could also try a “dry” shampoo.
Apply sunscreen daily 
Exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun or indoor tanning equipment and having fair skin are the most common risk factors for skin cancer. People who work, or exercise, in the sun for long periods of time are at greater risk.
