Chef ‘sDish
How long have you been at your present work place?

What do you feel when you cooking, creating and working in the kitchen?
From the time I was in College I was a very notorious person and always out of the house. I had no choice but to join the Ceylon Hotel School. But now cooking has become my hobby. Those days I really did not have a choice but to cook. But now I love cooking and it’s a part of my life now. I like to be creative. And this is the only trade that helped me to come up. I started working in the kitchen and later I got a scholarship as I was awarded Employee of the Month. Joined the hotel school, did the basics and then flew to Dubai for the cost training in Berlin and France. I worked with many reputed European chefs – this is where my career changed for the better.
Who is your biggest critic?
My wife (chef has a straight face). But actually the biggest critic is Me. Now I am a calm and quiet chef. Few years ago, I was the opposite – like Gordon Ramsey! I was appointed as an Executive Chef when I was just 26 years old. At that time with the age my position was higher and I believe I was not in control and could not cope up with the pressure. But now, I am matured enough…learnt from my mistakes.
How do you handle dishes that are rejected and sent back to the kitchen?
First thing I will do is go speak to the guest and see what went wrong. And then make sure the guest is treated well. And then I will see who was in charge of the kitchen. If it’s someone small in the kitchen I will go see what’s wrong but if it’s someone in the higher position like a Sous Chef then it will be a different way of handling the situation – (Gordon Ramsey way).
When at home…do you cook or do you let your partner take control?
My wife. I never used to cook at home unless she requests me to do so. And I believe she is the better cook and I like her cooking too.
If you were not a chef…
what would you
be today?
I really don’t know. But I do like accounting and I did commerce for my Advance Levels.
Of all the places you worked, at what are your greatest memories of them?
All the hardest part I still remember. I did many openings. When I worked for Inter Continental we opened a restaurant. We had to wake up at 5am and work till midnight every single day. We only had one off day for a week. The other property I worked for had 900 rooms and we used to sleep for maximum 6 to 7 hours and during the pre-opening we didn’t have a day off for two months. It was the same for Kuwait Meridien and that was also a pre-opening. My closest memory still is working at Centara Passikudah as at that time there was no property like that in that area. I started working there during the time it was still in bricks. During the rainy season it would get flooded and still we had to work in our shorts and brave the storm – those were some good memories.
