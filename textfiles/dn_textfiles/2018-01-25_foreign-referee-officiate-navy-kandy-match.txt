Foreign referee to officiate Navy-Kandy match?

It is reliably learnt that Charlie Brown who is the referee manager of the Singapore Rugby Union will most probably officiate as the chief referee in the key Dialog ‘A’ Division League rugby second round match between defending champions Kandy Sports Club and second place Navy Sports Club scheduled to be played at Navy grounds in Welisara on Saturday January 27.
This move has been welcomed by the majority of Sri Lankan rugby fraternity as they would be happy if a foreign referee handles the whistle in this important match due to his vast experience and rugby knowledge.
