Hospitals geared to handle AH1N1 cases

All major hospitals have a comprehensive pandemic response plan and are fully prepared to handle any local cases of AH1N1 influenza that requires hospitalisation, health authorities said.
Authorities however said patients with flu like symptoms should seek professional help without resorting to home remedies.
Health officials said although two people died following the AH1N1 influenza in Kandy, both were patients whose immune system had got weak due to their illnesses. They also urged patients with other serious illnesses to be wary if they have flu like symptoms and seek professional medical help without delay.
Meanwhile, Health Services Acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said the public need not panic over Influenza AH1N1.
“Many may get infected and cured without notice. The best advice is for persons affected to obtain treatment from a qualified doctor,” he said. He said complications can occur among people in high risk categories such as pregnant mothers, children below the age of two, elders above the age of 65 and persons suffering from chronic diseases. Dr. Bandara said a doctor will decide whether the patient should receive OPD treatment or if he or she should be admitted to hospital.
“Persons in the high risk categories should avoid crowded places and also should not visit infected patients,” he said.
