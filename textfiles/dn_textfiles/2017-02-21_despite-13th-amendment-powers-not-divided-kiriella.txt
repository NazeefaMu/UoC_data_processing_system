Despite the 13th Amendment, powers not divided: Kiriella

Ever since our country gained independence, the main objective of all parties was to gain political control instead of focusing on the country, Leader of the House, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Even though the 30 year war has ended, the issues between ethnic groups have not yet been solved. Despite the 13th Amendment, distribution of powers has not been properly divided, he said.
The Minister stated these views attending the commencement of development of the Badulla -Chenkaladi Road as the Chief Guest on Sunday. The project is being conducted under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways and the Road Development Authority. The road is 147km long and Rs. 21 billion is being spent on the development of this road.
“Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa accepted that the 13th Amendment was insufficient for the country. It was he who first stated that authority beyond the 13th Amendment was necessary. If we had divided powers when we gained independence, our country would’ve been a developed country. When the Soulbury Constitution was being drafted, many party leaders made requests for the powers to be divided as India had done according to their constitution. When India gained independence their leaders divided powers, which is why India is united today,” he said.
Kiriella said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have given our country a fresh start. “Our country didn’t get the new beginning we needed after the end of the war. A new beginning can only start with the making of a new constitution. For that, both main parties must work together, draft a new constitution and put it forth to a referendum.”
