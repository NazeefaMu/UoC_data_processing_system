Stern action against tea factories engaging in illegal practices - Navin

The Sri Lanka Tea Board and the Tea Research Institute has invested over Rs 40 million to import machinery to test if sugar is being added during production of tea, said Minister of Plantation industries Navin Dissannayake.
Speaking at a press conference in Colombo he said that 56 factories from 700 had been found engaged in this . “we have identified them and have warned them and would take necessary action after the festive season in April.”
He said that if they immediately suspend these 56 factories, the livelihoods of people working there would be lost and it would be a major issue for the workers to celebrate the new year season. “Hence we differed any action until end of April.”
He said meanwhile they have imported equipment to trace sugar even when the tea leaves are fired.
The Minister said that tea added with sugar makes it more dark. This is not imported tea and there would not be another issue like the Russian Bug scenario again.
