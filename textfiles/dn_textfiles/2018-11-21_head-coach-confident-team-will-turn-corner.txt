Head coach confident team will turn the corner

If one is to believe head coach Chandika Hathurusingha the Sri Lanka cricket team should then turn the corner before next year’s World Cup.
“It’s only been 10 months since I started. We are trying to get back into winning ways as soon as possible,” said Hathurusingha who took upon himself the responsibility for the team’s defeats.
“I have the biggest responsibility, and we are working on things. If you look at the two Tests v South Africa, we won them really well. If you look at the two Tests in this series (v England), there were opportunities for us to win both. You should remember that on pitches like this, they won the toss twice as well. There’s a disadvantage there. I don’t accept that we are that far behind. If we correct mistakes and learn from mistakes, then I think we can win going forward.”
“When you play on pitches like this, batsmen are sometimes put into trouble - they were both tough pitches. If you bat well that’s because you’ve adapted to the surfaces.”
Sri Lanka who were one-time unbeatable against spin find themselves today susceptible to it. Spin was the result of Sri Lanka’s recent Test series loss to England where they trail 0-2 in the three-match series. It was the first series defeat in Tests since Hathurusingha took over as coach.
Spinners Moeen Ali, Jack Leach and Adil Rashid took 19 of the 20 Lankan wickets to fall in the Pallekele Test to seal the series win for England. It’s not that the Lankan spinners Dilruwan Perera, Akila Dananjaya and Malinda Pushpakumara didn’t deliver, they also took 19 England wickets in the Test, but the difference was in the batting where England showed they could handle spin on subcontinent pitches better than Sri Lanka.
This is something new and unheard of where the Lankan batting is concerned for in the past our batsmen were adaptable and quite capable of taking on any spinner who visited our shores.
“Our failures against spin aren’t a long-standing thing. When I go to a selection meeting, there’s an issue where you have to think about how many spinners are there to fight for one place. We will have to think about that,” said Hathurusingha. “We felt Rangana Herath’s absence in this match. We’ve played in these kinds of pitches only in the last two series. If you looked at what it was like before, we played on batting tracks. When we had Murali we knew he’d take wickets on anything. When you score on these pitches it’s hard to compare with what batsmen used to score. If the team total is 250 or 290, a fifty is a good score.”
For Hathurusingha to say that the pitches prepared for the last two series were turners and the ones prepared before them ware batting tracks is quite contradictory to what the stand-in Lanka captain Suranga Lakmal had to say at the pre-match press conference.
“We’ve asked for a pitch that favours the spinners, and I think that’s basically what we have got here,” said Lakmal. “Because the pitch is a turner, what we’re talking about right now is playing just one seamer. Though we haven’t chosen the team yet - that decision will come late in the day.”
So what have we got here? Is the coach trying to cover up for Sri Lanka’s batting deficiencies against spin by blaming the pitch that was prepared for the Pallekele Test?
PAKISTAN’S CONTINUED WEAKNESS AGAINST LEFT-ARM SPINNERS
So much for Sri Lanka cricket, let’s shift our focus to Abu Dhabi where New Zealand pulled off a stunning four-run win over Pakistan in the first Test. Pakistan were on course to win the Test chasing a moderate target of 176 when they were 130-4 at lunch on day four.
But the afternoon provided a sensational turn of events as Pakistan’s remaining six wickets crumbled for just 41 runs to hand to New Zealand a dramatic win.
Pakistan’s weakness against left-arm spinners continued to haunt them as they collapsed to Ajaz Patel who was making his Test debut for New Zealand at the age of 30. Patel ended up taking five wickets for 5 for 59 and seven in the match to take the Player of the Match award.
Since 2009 Sri Lanka’s left-arm spinner Rangana Herath who retired recently was Pakistan’s nemesis after being flown in from the English leagues as replacement for the injured Muthiah Muralitharan for the first Test at Galle.
It was a similar scenario to the Abu Dhabi Test, Pakistan were chasing 168 for victory and
Were strongly place at the end of the third day at 71-2, but on the fourth morning they collapsed to 117 all out with Herath doing the main damage taking four wickets for 15 runs of 11.3 overs as Sri Lanka were handed an unlikely win by 50 runs. They later went onto clinch the series 2-0.
In 18 Tests Herath took 95 wickets bowling his country to an innumerable number of victories against them and eventually ending up being the first bowler to take 100 wickets against Pakistan in Tests – 106 from 21 Tests.
