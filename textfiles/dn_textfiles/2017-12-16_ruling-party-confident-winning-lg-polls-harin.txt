Ruling party confident of winning LG polls - Harin

Minister of Telecommunications and Digital Technology, Harin Fernando said based on the history of our Local Government election results, almost all elections were won by the ruling party. Accordingly, he said the forthcoming Local Government election results will be the same.
He said so at a 'Jana hamuwa' held in Eheliyagoda soon after opening a new United National Party Elections Office of the UNP candidate, Harischandra Kiriella.
Prior to the 'Jana hamuwa ' the Minister and guests were conducted in a procession from Eheliyagoda - Panawala junction to the venue of the new elections office where the Minister opened the office.
Minister Fernando said though there was a slight delay in fulfilling the promises given by the government prior to the last general election, the 'Yaha palana' Government tries its best to maintain peace and harmony throughout the country in a transparent manner. In a comment to those who blame the government for not netting in the rogues, he noted that there is another group engaged in protecting these rogues. "There is a vast difference between the Rajapaksa Government and the Yahapalana Government, as even the Prime Minister of the country voluntarily went before the relevant commissions to give evidence as he had nothing to hide," he said.
He added that the wise voters of the country know that the Local Government bodies should be given to the existing government in order to receive greater benefits.
In conclusion, the Minister said the present government parties will definitely win the forthcoming Local Government elections. Sabaragamuwa Former Provincial Councillors, Siripala Kiriella, Yehiya M. Iflar, Kaluthara District UNP Youth Society Vice Chairman, Prasad Hettiarachchi and UNP Candidate Harischandra Kiriella also spoke.
