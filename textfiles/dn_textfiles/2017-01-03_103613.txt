Time for adopting  community-oriented policing: IGP

IGP Pujith Jayasundara said it is time for the police to adopt a community-oriented policing. He said Sri Lanka Police had to adopt a mission oriented reactive in the war times.
The IGP also said officers should abide by the recently introduced code of ethics.
The IGP was addressing police officers at a ceremony in the Police Headquarters, Colombo yesterday morning.
“In political rebellions and terrorism in the 70s and 80s, Sri Lanka Police had to change its ordinary ways of policing. We had to adapt to a mission oriented policing. But now the war ended, a great demand for a sense of ‘freedom’ is coming from the public,” Jayasundara said.
The police needs to adopt a humanitarian approach in operation, IGP said. He also said SL police should become an absolute professional entity thriving to create a peaceful environment for the citizens for them to live with confidence, free from crime and violence.
It is only the Sri Lanka Police that will be able to grant public wish for freedom and security, Jayasundara pointed out.
“Fulfilling the demand for a free and secured society is a great challenge to us. The police is striving hard quantitatively and qualitatively to reach this goal. We are doing our level best to keep law and order and prevent all sorts of crimes and corruptions. We are to establish and strengthen a common ground to work with people. General public assistance is very important to the police,” Jayasundara said.
The IGP said the police has adopted a mobile community police service wining much popularity among the public to create such a common ground.
The mobile community police service focuses on six areas: religion, culture, health, education, sports, and Sharamada service, the IGP explained. The mobile service operates in selected Grama Niladhari divisions, he said.
“People want us to continue with the mobile police service. Unfortunately, it is practically impossible. We have assessed financial value of sharamadanas being carried out by the mobile police service. It is worth over Rs. 370 million,” Jayasundara said.
The IGP said every police station has solved 70 percent of crimes in their respective areas. Seventy percent of property related crimes and 80 percent personal offences are solved last year, he said.
The IGP said the target for 2017 should be to solve 75 percent of reported cases.
