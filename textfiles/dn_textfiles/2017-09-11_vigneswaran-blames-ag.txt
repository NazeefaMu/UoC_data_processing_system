Vigneswaran blames AG

The Attorney General's Department were informed to expedite hearing cases of LTTE suspects in prison custody, but it does not seem to happen as requested, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran said.
He was speaking to the media after visiting the LTTE suspects held at the Bogambara Dumbara Prison on September 9.
Vigneswaran said he represented the issue to the President, but the cases were not expedited for various political reasons.
He said justice could be meted out to the detainees by considering their confessions as evidence. He said there was no possibility to punish detainees when their confessions were available as evidence. "Therefore, it was important to take quick action on the matter as the detainees were living with hope of freedom," he said.
Vigneswaran said the Northern Provincial Council defeated the 20th Amendment to the Constitution since it was harmful to the council.
He said NPC administration could be taken over by Parliament after the dissolution of the council until an election was held, according to the provisions in the 20th amendment. "But it is wrong," he said.
He said that when a copy of a letter sent to the Attorney General by the Government informing it to expedite LTTE suspect related cases, a case called last week were postponed to November. He said people in the South had a wrong impression about the north. He would request people in the south not to consider him and his people as terrorists.
He said alteration of news sent by northern journalists to suit the needs of media magnates in the south had caused a bad social impact.
He said the statement made by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka about former Army Commander Jagath Jayasuriya would be investigated to see whether there was any truth in it.
