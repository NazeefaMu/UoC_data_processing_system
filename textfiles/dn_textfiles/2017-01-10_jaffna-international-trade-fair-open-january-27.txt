The eight edition of Jaffna International Trade Fair (JITF 2017), the largest Consumer Exhibition and Trade Fair in the fast-growing northern region of Sri Lanka, will be held from 27th to 29th January, 2017 at Jaffna Municipal Council Grounds.
The event aptly named as “Gateway to the North” will comprise both local and international stalls amounting to 300, exhibiting more than 1,000 products to meet the demands of over 60,000 visitors from across the country.
Organized by Lanka Exhibition and Conference Services (Pvt) Ltd (LECS) in association with the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Yarlpanam (CCIY) with the support of Jaffna Municipal Council, Sri Lanka Convention Bureau and International Business Council, the JITF 2017, would cater to a diverse variety of needs and services.
Co–Founder Chairman of JITF and Past President, Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Yarlpanam K. Pooranachandran said this major event would be a great opportunity for business personnel to get involved in Jaffna development activities because there are major infrastructure development opportunities coming up in the Jaffna region shortly.
“Joint ventures, tie- ups, large orders have been the highlights of business matchmaking between the people from the South and North,” Pooranachandran said.
In an effort to explore the trade and investment opportunities, a special 75 member delegation from India will also participate in the event.
The exhibition will feature the construction industry, hospitality industry, food, beverage and packing industry, automobile industry, ICT industry, financial services, Apparel & Textile, Agricultural, Consumer goods and many others, which will be on show during the three days.

The event will offer many attractions for visitors of all ages which includes an amusement park for children, all types of food and beverage, hawker type food courts and special discounts on over 1000 products.
An hourly raffle draw will bring exciting prizes. Further, the event will provide free health check-ups and beauty consultant sessions.
