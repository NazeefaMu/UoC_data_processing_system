Sri Lanka granted CDN$900,000 to implement UNFPA project

 
High Commissioner of Canada to Sri Lanka, David McKinnon and Representative of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Sri Lanka Ritsu Nacken signed an agreement to grant CDN$900,000 to Sri Lanka in order to implement the project, 'Addressing Sexual Gender-based Violence through Public Institutions'.
This project aims to increase the government’s capacity to enhance Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) and to effectively respond to sexual and gender-based violence in Sri Lanka.
These funds were granted to Sri Lanka by the Government of Canada with the intention of launching the project by March 31, 2020.
This is a continuation of the support rendered by the Canadian government intended for women's empowerment, political participation, and ending gender-based violence in line with their Feminist International Assistance Policy.
