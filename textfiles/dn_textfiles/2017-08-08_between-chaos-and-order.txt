Between chaos and order

The origins of violence have mystified and fascinated humans for centuries. It can be seen in an act of rape or murder. It can be seen in the classroom bully and the school yard bully. It was seen in the weapons David Koresh amassed. It found a place in the warped mind of Hitler.
Religious bodies have offered their own explanations of violence. In fact the bible speaks of the origins of violence as one that is spiritual. One that is older than the world itself. It speaks of a violence between the Arch-Angel Michael and the Angel Satan (and possibly the angels they commanded) that was waged over this world. Violence has found its way into all forms of literature.
And it has become a subject of curiosity for Mackenzie Nix. Though by no means a violent man Mackenzie Nix has observed aggression and is intrigued by it. Daily News chatted with Mackenzie on this dark aspect of life that is the theme of his exhibition of ink drawings and digital prints called ‘Things Fall Apart’. His exhibition will be taking place at the Barefoot Gallery from August 4 to September 3.
After completing high school in Australia there is a gap year. That is common in Australia. So he went to South America for seven months and lived in Peru. He has been to Berlin and been to Jordan as well.
Mackenzie is a designer studying to be an architect. He finished his degree in Sydney in 2015 - Design in Architecture.
“I came here to Sri Lanka in 2015. I really liked Sri Lanka from what I learnt about its architecture. It has so much social meaning in it. I came back in 2016 and decided to work here.”
Nix has moved to Sri Lanka in 2016 to work under Channa Daswatte to help record and document endangered heritage architecture in Galle Fort for the Galle Heritage Foundation.
“In your everyday life or wherever you are, sometimes you encounter objects that seem to have so much meaning associated with them. For me in Sri Lanka and when I was travelling in Berlin (which started this mode of thinking), I started to think that, there were some objects, that when you look at them you kind of notice that there is this whole history of violence behind them. You don’t know if it is a domestic item or a religious item, but through these items you can kind of get a glimpse into this violence that runs under through so much history, culture and religion,” said Nix.
Nix referred to the biblical character Noah in our conversation. The problem is Noah’s son did not do anything wrong but was punished. So that is the bone of contention. In Christianity it is not good to get drunk. And all of this is never explained.
“After the story of the flood Noah gets drunk after consuming wine and falls into a slumber, and his son Ham saw his father’s nakedness and got his brothers to cover Noah. When Noah woke up he cursed his sons’ descendants to slavery. So when I read it, I sort of felt the story did not go the way it was supposed to. You have this real injustice done to this boy in this book the bible, which is supposed to be a just book and the foundation of humanity. I found it to be a very strange event which had an undercurrent of violence,” stated Nix.
Nix confessed that he is not sure where this fascination with anger and violence comes from. He feels that he has this fascination with dark details of things. It has always been there. Maybe it is a deep seated discomfort. “This is my first exhibition. After this I guess I can call myself an artist, but I have never really thought of myself as an artist. I am a very visual person. This is more what I like to do. I came here to do Architecture but most of the work I have done is this. So it is all slowly taking over,” said Nix.
Despite our efforts at a carefully constructed society, things fail. Things fall apart. Chaos erupts. There is very thin veneer between Chaos and Order. It can all fall apart in a split second.
“Maybe violence is the wrong word to use. I don’t know the proper word. Maybe I am talking about this bubbling disorder. So basically the themes I explore are basically violence, disorder and chaos. I think you need to contain violence for a society to function but it will always be there. It is always waiting. It is just life. It exists in nature. Things start to fall apart and the world breaks down. Recognizing it can actually free you from the problem or certain ways of thinking. There are dogmas and political agendas that people try and force on you. They are all these very surface level things. There are bigger undercurrents,” explained Nix.
We all carry a certain amount of anger within all of us. It does not mean you are homicidal. It is just a part of being human. “All these things collide and fall apart and living in a world with so many different people, that violence does exist. But having that anger in you, it does not make you are violent person, it is a part of life,” said Nix.
Nix illustrated another example – the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah. God told his angels to rescue Lot and his family. But asked them not to look back at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. But Lot’s wife looked back and was turned to a pillar of salt.
“I always found that story very disturbing. Even though god singled out these good people to save, he killed one of them. So this was really disturbing to me. Not every thing is just and good. And that system of morals breaks down. Both Noah’s son and Lot’s wife saw something and were punished. Lot’s wife just witnessed something and she got punished. Why did that happen? Maybe that happened because there is no morality and that system does not exist,” explained Nix.
So when you take the story of Noah it is really very insidious and dark. This idea of punishing innocent people is very strange. Even Jesus is so different from the God of the Old Testament. Comparing those things together is very interesting. In the Old Testament things are very murky and a bit primordial and very ancient. You find it difficult to draw the line between justice and injustice. But even Jesus was aggressive, once kicking the traders out of the temple. In one incident he even sent the demons in a man, ‘Legion’, into a horde of pigs. But those incidents are also very just.
“I just find aggression really interesting to think about.”
