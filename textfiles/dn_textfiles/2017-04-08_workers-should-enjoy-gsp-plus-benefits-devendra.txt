Workers should enjoy GSP Plus benefits: Devendra

The benefits of GSP Plus should come to employees than employers once the country receives the GSP Plus concessions in future, Industrial Sri Lanka Council (ISLC) Chairman Leslie Devendra said.
He added that the benefit of GSP Plus may be held back by employers without giving those perks to employees.
“Therefore, the ISLC has informed the European Union to look into the matter and ascertain whether employees will receive the benefit of the GSP Plus. Moreover, the EU was made aware by the ISLC to consider the measures taken towards strengthen labour rights in the country. As a result of the awareness, an EU fact finding team relating to labour rights will visit the country on Monday (10),” Devendra said.
The seven member EU delegation, which comprises EU Parliamentarians and union members of the labour rights relations, will meet the President, the Prime Minister,Labour Minister union leaders, employers federations and few more. The EU delegation will stay in the country for three days.
He added that labour rights are badly suspended and violated especially in the garment sector in the country. “Workers in the garment factories are commonly and badly exploited. It has been reported that government workers are working for a meager salary under minimal facilities and with suppressed labour rights. Then the ISLC will stand for the garment workers aiming to protect their labour rights. We strongly urged the employers not to exploit the GSP Plus benefit once the country receives it,” he said. He added that ISLC will forward a road map in protecting and safeguarding labour rights to the EU delegation. We are ready to work closely with the EU and the government to safeguard labour rights of employees.
Assistant Chairman of ISLC Anton Marcus also said that the road map to assert labour rights in Sri Lanka will be forwarded to the EU delegation for their consideration.
He added that most of private sector employees are not paid well and their labour rights have been badly suspended by their bosses compared with state sector.
“The minimum salary of the private sector is Rs 13,000. With all perks including overtime payments most of the employees draw a monthly salary of Rs 20,000 especially in the garment sector,” he said.
