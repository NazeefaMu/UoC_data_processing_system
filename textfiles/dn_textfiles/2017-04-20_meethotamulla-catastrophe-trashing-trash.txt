Meethotamulla catastrophe trashing the trash

The longstanding issue of garbage in Colombo came to a head last week when a section of the Meethotamulla garbage mount collapsed, entombing many innocent lives. The public outrage at the political authority was palpable in the wake of Meethotamulla disaster.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, speaking to the Daily News in the aftermath of disaster, said, some solid actions are the need of the hour to tackle the garbage issue in the capital city. The minister, who also held the Environment Ministry portfolio in the previous administration, however, contended that many plans to deal with the garbage issue could not be materialized due to public protests.
Excerpts follow:
Q: People in Meethotamulla bemoan that they repeatedly told the authorities that this disaster would befall, but such calls fell on deaf ears. comment.
A: Yes, agree. They have repeatedly said that, and we have also repeatedly tried to find a solution. Then again, repeatedly, we have failed. Now, it is time to find a permanent solution once and for all. Agree beyond question.
Q:Can you give an overview of the post-disaster coordination work in the aftermath of the Meethotamulla tragedy?
A: The army is still continuing search operations, and they have found 32 bodies as of Tuesday. As they say, about 8 persons are still missing. The displaced people are provided temporary shelter at Terrance de Silva College in Kolonnawa, and we are providing them with food, clothes, and other needs. Search operations in an area of about 180m x 75m were being carried out with the support of over 1,000 tri-force personnel and Police. We hope to complete the search operations in another day or two. Excavations had to be carried out deep into about 30-40 feet in some areas of the collapsed garbage mound.
At the same time, we are renovating an old paddy market board stores now. Once we complete renovations, we can send the evacuated families to that building. The Government decided that the cost of all funeral arrangements would be borne by the Government. People who have lost their houses will be given new houses through the Urban Development Authority. Part of that money will be paid by the Colombo Municipal Council, and the rest will be borne by the Government.
We also carried out a scientific analysis to find out whether there is a possibility of another landslide at the garbage dump. The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) has earmarked a dangerous zone in the vicinity of the dump and the people in that area have also been evacuated. We are also awaiting the arrival of an expert group from Japan to carry out further study.
In the meantime, the Colombo Municipal Council will not dump anymore garbage to Meethotamulla, and the ultimate aim of the Government is to clear the site. We will have to find a good alternative for the disposal of garbage collected in the Colombo city.
Q: Do you accept that this is a man-made disaster that could have been averted?
A: These types of occurrences have happened elsewhere in the world too, not only in Sri Lanka. The garbage problem is related to the growth in urban population. The expansion of urban population results in more garbage. When the garbage becomes an issue, we have to find a scientific solution. Waste management problem is common to many countries, even including Panama, Mexico, America, and India, to name a few. The Colombo city and adjoining cities are rapidly expanding every year. The more the country is becoming urbanized, the more the people produce garbage. This is a non-ending process. You cannot blame anyone here.

Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa
We shouldn’t accuse each other. It has been a problem throughout despite who was/is in the ruling camp. Whenever we found a suitable place for garbage disposal, the local politicians always objected. Starting from the 1997 World Bank funded project in Meepe, in the Padukka area, hardly any plan in this regard could be materialized because of the protests. There were many problems when it comes to the construction of the sanitary landfill site in Dompe, but somehow, we managed to complete the project. Recently, when a proposal to use a land in Ekala for the purpose of garbage disposal came up, some politicians and clergy were against it. Likewise, this has been a non-ending process for the last few years.
In the aftermath of this catastrophic incident, we need to act more resolutely. It is now time for us to find a place, stick to that, start the project, and finish it off once and for all. We have to find a durable solution to the garbage problem. The possibilities for waste to energy projects are also being looked at. Shouting and berating would be of little help to solve the problem.
Q: The expert group from Peradeniya University and Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) that inspected the site, pointed out that early signs of the disaster such as cracks, bad odour, vibrations, and seepage of water had appeared in the area, but not paid proper attention to. comment.
A: Actually, this tragedy occurred at a most unexpected time when all were celebrating Avurudu. Many people, including officials, had gone on holiday and others were in their houses. Everything happened within three to four hours, and we hardly got any time to do anything.
Even the residents might not have taken those changes in the environs seriously, or they might not have had enough time to pay attention to them. What happened had already happened. We have to prevent it from happening again and find a durable solution.
Q: What kind of proposals were considered to tackle the garbage problem during your stint as the Environment Minister from April, 2010 - January, 2013?
A: At that time, the Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) supported to start sanitary landfills. They built one in Maligawatte, Dompe, as a grant. They proposed to build another five around the city, but after I left the Ministry, there had been certain problems with regard to those places. Therefore, the initial plans have been changed and new project sites have been chosen. Four more sanitary landfills are to be constructed in Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Hikkaduwa, and Polonnaruwa.
Even at that time, we tried to find a solution for the garbage problem in Colombo. A number of proposals came up, and we tried to materialize them, but unfortunately, nobody came forward.
Q:There were contradictory statements on the compensation payment for the lives lost and properties damaged due to the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse. Has the Government decided on compensation?
A: The initial announcement on compensation which said the Government will pay Rs. 100,000 for each death and up to Rs 2.5 million for property damage, is wrong. We have not yet decided the amounts of compensation as the post-disaster situation is still being assessed.
The property damages assessment started on Monday, and the President ordered it to be completed within five days. All relevant Government Agencies are working together for this purpose now.
At the next Cabinet meeting, the Meethotamulla disaster will be taken up, and probably, I will move a cabinet paper on the expenditure on that day.
In addition, the Disaster Management Committee on Meethotamulla also meets every three days to discuss the latest situation and take necessary decisions collectively.
Q:Despite the promises of compensation and new houses in the immediate aftermath of disasters, the people complain the Government is slow to deliver them. The people affected by the Aranayake landslide and Salawa Army Camp explosion which occurred mid last year are yet to receive money and/or new houses. How do you respond?
A: Compensating the property damages due to Salawa explosion is nearing completion. Few more families are yet to receive compensation because they were not satisfied with the initial valuation done.
They are awaiting the final valuation report. Once it is ready, we will proceed to pay them too. All the others have been given money. Most of the damaged houses have already been repaired by the Army, and we have paid the Army for their work. In Aranayake, of course, there was a problem of finding suitable land to resettle the affected families.
However, we managed to find land in some areas, and the construction of houses has begun. In some areas, where we could not find land, we are giving money to the families to buy land and build their houses.
