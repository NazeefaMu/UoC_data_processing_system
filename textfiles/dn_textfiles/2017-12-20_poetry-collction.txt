Prey
Penetrating eyes focus on me with greed
I saw the perpetrator watch my step,
I shall not fall prey to an evil mind?
Running fast as I could with my lantern in hand
I felt his shadow stealthily trail behind,
It leapt on me, but I clutched fast to my light.
Shoving the burning lantern on him with all my might
That blinded the criminal,
I saw it retreat with deep pain and fright,
A miracle saved me in the nick of time.

Christmas – The Holiness
Today, in the beginning of time
Christmas continues unabated
It was that first Christmas
The sky glittering with stars
Spread sporadic a splatter of light
That day dedicated to god
As Christ was born in Bethlehem
That news made rejoice
Story spread far and wide
A touch of birth religiosity
Then the purpose of prophesy
Holiness abound continues
Through times speeding wings
Endowed with the morally good
The spiritual and the supernatural
Holiness Thrives every Christmas
Dedicated to a god incarnate
Today still time continues
As Christmas greet all Holiness
Miran Perera,
 
Remember When
Remember when we first did meet,
our hearts rejoiced and skipped a beat.
Remember our first kiss goodnight,
the hug we shared that summer’s night.
Remember when we walked the beach
and all our dreams within our reach.
Remember how we used to be
when I had you and you had me.
Remember when we used to talk,
when we held hands and took long walks.
Remember how we spent our days
in warm sunshine and in the rain.
Remember when our one desire
was take a chance and ignite the fire.
Remember the times that made our hearts melt
and all of the passion and desire that we felt.
Remember when you looked at me
and saw the one you love and need.
Remember when you reached for me
and knew that we were meant to be.
Remember when our love was new.
Remember the day we both said, “I do.”
Remember the journey we started together.
Remember our love was always forever.
Remember the promise we made together,
to love and to cherish and to care for each other.
Remember the promise in good times and in bad
and to make each one happy rather than sad.
Remember when you held our child
and rocked the baby when I grew tired.
Remember the treasured times
like these when love grew into family.
Remember when the world was bright,
when we would laugh and hold on tight.
Remember when our hearts were broken,
when times were tough and words unspoken.
Remember when we grieved our loss
with parents gone and feeling lost.
Remember when our love endured
the pains and heartaches of the world.
What happened to the life we shared?
What happened to a love so rare?
What happed to the kiss goodnight,
the warm embrace, the love at night?
Did it all just happen? How do we right the wrong?
I know that in my heart your arms I do belong.
Can we live our lives together just like it all began,
and can we hold and cherish each other and remember our love again?
Marcia A. Newton
TIMES
Twenty years growth
Twenty years to abound
Twenty years to be steady
Twenty years slack off
We come to know
A companion when
We face hardness
A warriorin war fields
An honest person
When given a loan
Returns approximately
Spouse, when wealth disappear
Forty years ‘youth’ old age
Fifty, old ages’ young age
Life consists of two portions
Past was a dream
Future desiring
A Seconds error
Causes lifetime sorrow
A second’s patience
Wins years of wholesome
Better not start – than
Leaving half
Minds don’t grow old
A loving mind ‘ever young
Youth is a Roses garland
Youth live convincingly
Olds live with golden memories
Today’s merits brings in
Tomorrow’s sweet and joy
A miser’s account book
And a donor’s same
At the end of the year
The same
Miser’s living – wouldn’t
Last long
No one knows what will happen
Tomorrow, at dawn
Accept weather as it is
Seasons are divinity
Fahim Latiff
A majestic apology!
The blind jumbo, the twisted tusker
The Galgamuwe king of the jungle
I most solemnly kneel at your feet, at your graveyard
On behalf of all Sri Lankans
And beg forgiveness from you
As I too happened to be one of the species
Of that callous breed, mankind.
In the prime years of your dignified life
A gang of bloody barbarians
For the sake of easy money
In greed of your precious ivory
Put an end to your noble life
And your unsuspicious gigantic body
Was an easy target for the heartless poachers.
This heinous crime upon a blind noble creature
Is a disgrace to all mankind, an unpardonable shame
And the pain you had undergone
Is unimaginable tot he animal lovers
To the sensitive mind.
Yet we can imagine your tragic fall
The fall of a majestic mighty king
We can imagine how silently you bone the agony
With your big heart.
A decade ago
The wicked poachers
Had deprived you of your invaluable sight
And since then you wandered like a helpless pauper
What a pathetic plight for a noble creature like you!
Though you are no more
We who have boundless love for fauna and flora
Share your untold pains, sorrow and tears
We apologize to you
The tortured pride of Sri Lanka
Not once, but a thousand times
We pray
“May you never face man’s mean acts
Man’s inhuman, shamelful, wicked deeds!”
D. H. Shanthiratne
Torn between
How did I get to this point in my life?
Love really does cut like a knife,
Torn between two lovers; both dear to my heart.
Now I must choose, one gets my heart and other departs.
Why is this so hard to do?
How do choose, between the two?
Do I give a chance to my new love?
Do I give another chance to my first love?
My first love there’s, security and familiarity,
My new love is a good woman, devoted, fun and exciting.
My first love,
Our love was strong and true,
There was nothing we wouldn’t do,
As time passed, resentment grew between us,
Putting fault, blame and mistrust between us.
You left me because you needed the space
And time to think, to decide if this is just a waste.
You gave me no choice, I wanted to try,
I still wanted to keep you and our love alive.
You said, “I just need time to think and get away,
If you want a chance to get me back some way;
Then you have to relax and give up the chase,
Just leave me alone and let me have a little space.”
So, I gave you, your wish, I left you alone,
Every now and then I tried to phone,
But always the same, “Just leave me alone”
My new love,
You stayed by my side through all of my pain,
You said, “It’s alright you’ll love again.”
I tried not to hurt but you wanted the truth,
So, I told you I still love her, and that our love was true.
You said, “It’s okay, let’s just enjoy it while we can.
Right now, I’m with you and I don’t want any other man.”
I couldn’t believe that you still wanted me,
I told myself you can’t do this to her, make her leave.
But the truth was I needed you there with me,
And as time went on I started to see,
Just how dear you’d become to me.
I told you I loved you quite by mistake,
But I knew I fell for you and it was too late,
I couldn’t deny what I felt inside.
Until one day she finally called, she said, “I want to give us one more try.”
My heart was confused and I felt so overwhelmed, I wanted to cry.
Why is this so hard, now I don’t know what to do?
How do choose, between the two?
Myleena Love
