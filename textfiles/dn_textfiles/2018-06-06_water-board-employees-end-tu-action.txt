Water Board employees end TU action

The Trade Union action launched by Water Board employees on May 23 ended after successful talks between the striking employees and the Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Ministry Secretary, Convener of the Joint Alliance of Water Supply Trade Unions Upali Ratnayake said.
The supply of water and maintenance of water supply infrastructure in many parts of the country were hampered as a result of the trade union action launched by workers of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board over salary arrears.
He said the Water Board employees recieve a salary increase every three years.The last salary increment they received was in 2015 and another increment due in January 2018 has been delayed.
Accordingly, Ratnayake said they launched the trade union action in February 2018 regarding this issue.
