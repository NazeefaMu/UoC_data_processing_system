Railway strike called off

Railway Trade Unions who threatened to strike as of midnight yesterday decided to postpone their strike until 12 noon.
Railway Guards’ Union President Janaka Fernando said the postponement called for on an assurance made by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva that he would submit the necessary Cabinet Paper today to institute their salary increases.
Since October of last year, railway guards, drivers, station masters and controllers have been demanding for salary increases and changes to their pay grade among various other grievances.
In December of last year, Cabinet through a ministerial Sub-Committee headed by former Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama decided to declare the Railways, Education and Health Sector as ‘closed services’ to resolve all the salary anomalies and pay grades across these sectors.
A closed service would mean that an increase in one sector would not affect other government services.
Fernando however pointed out that though the unions had withdrawn from their strike in December based on the government’s assurances of a closed service, Cabinet is yet to approve such a suggestion.
“They are yet to submit that paper to obtain approval for it. But, the Minister has assured us that he will submit the Cabinet Paper today. We are awaiting that. If it does not happen, we will begin the strike at 12 noon,” Fernando said.
He warned that having commuters stranded during the day would be a greater challenge for the government to handle than when a strike is called at midnight.
