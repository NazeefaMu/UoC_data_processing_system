Trade wars will have  implications on  Lanka - Sahay

Ongoing trade war between China and US will have implications on Sri Lanka’s policy choices, said Anubhuti - Head, South Asia, Economics Research, Standard Chartered Bank Mumbai
Nonetheless she said that Sri Lankan government is focused on making the country more open to the world and becoming an attractive place to do business.
“The good news is the government has already initiated measures with the support of IMF and its efforts to enhance revenue by moving towards narrow fiscal deficit targets is definitely noteworthy,” she said.
While noting Sri Lanka has enviable ranking in human development indexes in comparison to other countries in the region, she stressed that the country needs to leverage on its own strength, particularly on its educated and healthy labour force, and to build more business outsourcing unit in the country.
“Many companies across the world are opening up back office operations or business process units in countries such as Poland .Sri Lanka in my view should be the top place to do that as country definitely offers massive opportunities in the field of research and development,” she said.
