To discuss 20A: PM ready to meet lawyers

*BASL upholds govt call to hold elections in January
 *Wants to ensure legislature follows proper ratification process on Bills
Upon learning of the concerns of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) regarding the ratification of the 20th Amendment and its agenda and being informed that the BASL Lawyers were trying to get a discussion with the President and Prime Minister about it, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had on Sunday, informed the BASL higher-ups that he would soon announce a date for a meeting with them. Addressing a press briefing held at the BASL premises at Hultsdorf in Colombo, BASL President U.R. de Silva yesterday, said they have uncertainties regarding the ratification process of the 20 A with reservation whether it underwent a proper procedure inconsistent with the Constitution prior to being law. The 20th Amendment also touches on the provision to hold elections for all Provincial Councils the same day.
“We consider the BASL that it is a positive stance taken by the government to hold elections in January next year, as they have announced already,” he said.
“We were planning to get a sit down with the President and Prime Minister to discuss this when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed us on Sunday night that he would provide us with an opportunity of a meeting with him and the leaders of political parties,” he said.
“We are thankful to the Prime Minister for this move,” he said
“If during a discussion with the President and Prime Minister that we could be satisfied with the appropriate procedures followed in the process of ratification of Bills, while there would be no conflict of views to be generated,” he said.
“The BASL is going to stand by the rights of franchise of the public and needs to make sure that these rights are well preserved,” he said.
Silva admitted that the BASL could not do anything once a Bill become law in Parliament, but said: “It appears that at some point the line seemed to have been crossed in the case of establishing the 20 A .”
