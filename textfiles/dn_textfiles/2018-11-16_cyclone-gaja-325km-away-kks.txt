Cyclone Gaja 325km away from KKS

Heavy rainfall, strong winds and rough seas are expected to hit Jaffna Peninsula today as a result of the cyclonic storm Gaja which is about 325 km away from Kankasanturai to the northeast of Sri Lanka.
Duty Meteorologist told Daily News that heavy rainfalls above 100 mm with high winds (70-80) kmph, gusting up to 100 kmph can be expected over Northern Province, particularly over the Jaffna peninsula.
He said that showers or thundershowers will occur at times over the Northern Province and several places in the Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces. Several spells of showers will occur in Anuradhapura and Puttalam districts while strong winds (50-60) kmph, gusting up to 70kmph can be expected over these two districts. He further said that sea water inundation may occur in the low lying areas in the near coast from Mannar to Kankasanturai.
He said it is very likely to move west-southwestwards. The deep depression over the Bay of Bengal intensified into Cyclone ‘Gaja’ on last Sunday is expected to cross South Tamil Nadu coast and the center of the system is very likely to move approximately 120 km away from the northern coast of Sri Lanka yesterday evening. The system is likely to move away from the country by today. Hence windy and showery condition in the Northern part of the island and Northern sea area is expected to reduce gradually from today.
