OMP next regional meetings in Jaffna, Kilinochchi

The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) will hold its next regional meeting in Jaffna on July 14 and in Kilinochchi on July 15.
The OMP began its outreach programme in May with meetings held in Mannar, Matara, Mullaitivu and Trincomalee.
The seven commissioners of the OMP met with families of the missing and disappeared, civil society organisations, activists working on the issue of disappearances, and the media, to share the OMP’s organisational plan and strategies.
The meetings also facilitated the hearing of public views to incorporate their suggestions on the structure and operations of the OMP. On July 14 in the OMP will meet with the families of the missing and disappeared belonging to the Divisional Secretariat areas of Delft, Kayts, Velanai, Karainagar, Jaffna, Nallur, Uduvil, Chankanai, Sandilipay and Tellippalai.
