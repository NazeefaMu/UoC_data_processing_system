Lady Gaga postpones European tour due to health problems

 
Lady Gaga has rescheduled the European leg of her world tour due to ongoing health complications.
It comes after the singer pulled out of a performance at Brazil's Rock In Rio festival and a show in Montreal after revealing she suffers from fibromyalgia.
"Lady Gaga is suffering from severe physical pain that has impacted her ability to perform," a statement from her label published on Monday reads.
"She remains under the care of expert medical professionals who recommended the postponement earlier today."
The 31-year-old singer also shared a message with fans on Instagram, saying she has been "searching for years to get to the bottom of" her condition.
"It is complicated and difficult to explain, and we are trying to figure it out," she said.
A documentary titled Gaga: Five Foot Two premiered last week at the Toronto Film Festival, explaining the singer's struggles with fibromyalgia, a condition which causes chronic pain all over the body.
"Lady Gaga is devastated that she has to wait to perform for her European fans," Monday's statement reads.
"She plans to spend the next seven weeks proactively working with her doctors to heal from this and past traumas that still affect her daily life, and result in severe physical pain in her body.
"She wants to give her fans the best version of the show she built for them when the tour resumes.
"Lady Gaga sends her love to all her fans across Europe and thanks them for their support and understanding."
The European leg of her Joanne World Tour was scheduled to last six weeks, starting at the end of September, and included five dates in the UK.
Since revealing her medical condition, the singer has been criticised online for being "dramatic".
"If you knew me, you would know this couldn't be further from the truth. I'm a fighter," she wrote.
"I use the word suffer not only because trauma and chronic pain have changed my life, but because they are keeping me from living a normal life.
"They are also keeping me from what I love the most in the world: performing for my fans."
The new dates for the European stint of the Joanne World Tour have yet to be confirmed.
