We will show majority - State Defence Minister

On November 29, the Maithri-Mahinda government will show its 113 majority, State Defence Minister Lakshman Seneviratne said.
He said despite many obstacles, the government is now ready to show its majority in Parliament on November 29.
He also said that within the next few days, the names of unexpected persons would also be revealed in connection with the Treasury Bond scandal.
Addressing a press briefing in Colombo yesterday, he blamed the media for focusing only on the current political crisis, while failing to highlight the issues that led to the President being compelled to take this decision and who created this problem.
“The current situation is the result of a crisis that was brewing for the past 3 ½ years.”
From the day the President was elected, his initial efforts to appoint a Cabinet of Ministers in a scientific manner had failed miserably.
The UNP was not prepared to listen to any of his proposals. The incidents which took place during the past three years should be looked at carefully, to understand why the President was compelled to take this decision,” Seneviratne said.
He noted that today the emphasis is only on the President’s decision to dissolve Parliament and even the Bond scam has been forgotten.
“We need to focus on the sequence of events that took place. The Central Bank which should have been under the Finance Minister was given to another ministry. This was a breakdown of the whole system. As the President puts it, he had tried on more than a hundred instances to discuss these matters with the UNP and come to a solution but all his efforts had failed.
Eventually the President had no choice but to take a drastic decision. Hence, today this crisis is not the problem, it is the result of a long drawn problem,” he added.
Seneviratne said that the President had so far acted in the most Constitutional manner, adding that had the Speaker acted in the same manner, this issue would not have gone so far. However, he declined to comment regarding the dissolution of Parliament as it is a matter before the courts, but, said the President had acted based on proper legal advice and in keeping with the provisions of the Constitution.
