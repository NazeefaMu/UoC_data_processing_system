GMOA to hold special meeting on SAITM issue

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will hold a special executive committee meeting next week in connection with the issues pertaining to South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and the crisis that had arisen in the medical field, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Meanwhile, addressing media in Colombo, yesterday, representatives of Students’ Parents Union said there should not be an institution called SAITM after December 31. If the Government does not keep its own promise, all anti-SAITM forces will get together and re-launch the anti SAITM struggle and death fasts during this month (January), Medical Students’ Parents Union Secretary Gamini Ekanayake said.
Addressing the 14th Diploma awarding ceremony of the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education held in Colombo, recently, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella stated that the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) agreed to recognize the SAITM Medical faculty students with five weeks of clinical training.
The SLMC rejected Minister Kiriella’s claim.
