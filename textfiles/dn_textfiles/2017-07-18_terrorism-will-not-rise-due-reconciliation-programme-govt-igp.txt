Terrorism will not rise due to reconciliation programme of govt: IGP

Although defeated elements sling mud at the Police Department for want of a cheap topic to gain publicity, terrorism will never raise its head again in the North and East due to the reconciliation programme implemented by the President and the Prime Minister, IGP Pujith Jayasundera said.
Participating in a discussion programme relayed over the SLBC Rajatata service, the IGP said that even though the bed rock of terrorism in the country was totally defeated, its international network and diaspora could not be defeated until the demands of the Tamils were met and they were given equal status as other citizens.
He said these changes could not be made overnight. It needed time for systematic implementation. He said the police had been at the receiving end during the 1971 insurrection and the 1979 period. However, the prime objective of the Police was to safeguard peace and freedom for all people. He said the police service was always prepared to accept constructive criticism and act accordingly.
Each and every member in the police service should discharge their duties with a human touch devoid of any prejudice.
Senior DIG Jagath Abeysirigunawardena, DIG Padmalal Sandungahawatta and SSP Ravi Pieris were also present on the occasion.
Earlier in the morning, the IGP paid homage at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura and received the blessings of the Maha Sangha.
