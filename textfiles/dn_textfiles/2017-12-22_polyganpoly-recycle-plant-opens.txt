Polyganpoly Recycle plant opens

Polyganpoly Recycle Pvt. Ltd, one of Sri Lanka’s largest polythene foil manufacturing plants, was opened at Mangalaeliya, Chilaw, with an investment of Rs. 150 million.
State Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training, Range Bandara who was the chief guest at the opening, said that government is now encouraging recycling projects of this nature and the opening of the Polyganpoly Recycle plant was timely.
He also disclosed that over 50% of used polythene is still unfortunately made to perish to the ground and more companies should come up with recycling plants of this nature. “Plastic waste is a very profitable business,” he said.
Polyganpoly Recycle Chairman Vijitha Warnakulasuriya said that he first started recycling of polythene 15 years ago in the Gampaha area. “However, with the business growing and part of the factory being taken for highway expansion we were looking for an alternative place and then we decided to move our operations here."
He said he will now also move to the manufacture of plastic pipes for the agriculture sector. This is in addition to making black polythene rolls for the use of the construction industry.
Warnakulasuriya said he has also received export orders from China and and India to export polythene pallets. He said that he needs more polythene waste but unfortunately people don’t know the demand. “Bottle shops buy polythene but public doesn't know about it. Polythene waste is purchased more than used paper at the bottle shop."
Warnakulasuriya said that they purchase used polythene waste from all over Sri Lanka and then bail them in their collecting yard in Wattala. SS
