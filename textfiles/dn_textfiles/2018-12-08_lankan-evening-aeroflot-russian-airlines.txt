Lankan evening with Aeroflot Russian Airlines

The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Stockholm, in collaboration with the Aeroflot Russian Airlines and Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Sweden Chapter, organised a Sri Lanka Evening for travel companies based in Sweden.
The objective was to encourage Swedish travel companies to offer Sri Lanka as a travel destination by providing them with Sri Lanka tourism information and information on the newly resumed flights to Sri Lanka by Aeroflot Russian Airlines.
Chargé d’ Affaires of the Embassy invited travel trade representatives to focus more on Sri Lanka with the renewed international endorsements to the country from travel brands such as Lonely Planet.
The Commercial Secretary made a presentation on Sri Lankan tourism, followed by a presentation by the Aeroflot Russian Airlines on their services and flight connections to Sri Lanka. A total of 30 travel representatives were present.
The Q&A session provided a platform to share information and to clarify information on recent travel safety updates issued by Sri Lanka Tourism.
The session was interactive which ended with a quiz. Two economy class tickets from Aeroflot and two nights’ stay in a selected hotel from WebBeds were offered as prizes to the winner.
