Chinese doctors bring brightness  to Sri Lankan  cataract patients

Darkness fell in Sri Lanka’s capital city Colombo. Kalutara General Hospital stood quietly in the cool winds after a monsoon season.
The lights in the hospital’s two operating rooms remained on. Several Chinese doctors and nurses were still busy carrying out cataract surgeries for local patients.
During their one-month stay in Sri Lanka, the Chinese medical team, from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), has successfully completed 503 cataract surgeries, as part of their first overseas charitable mission.
“It is not so easy to carry out surgery to a group of local patients in an exotic hospital and a country we are not familiar with. We need to overcome many difficulties such as hot weather, language communication barriers, and the most terrible thing -- power cut during surgery,” the youngest doctor of the delegation, 35-year-old Dr. Zhao Chan told Xinhua.
Not only that, the humid air also made the equipment and machines from China not function well in the hospital.

The Chinese team provided consultations to more than 500 patients on their second day in the hospital, when a doctor-strike took place across the whole island, Zhao said. The programme was titled “Brightness Action,” under which the Chinese doctors helped low-income Sri Lankans to successfully recover their eyesight.
According to Zhao, the majority of patients could regain normal vision, even up to 1.0 degree only one week after surgery.
“Patients queued to shake hands and pray for us, to express their thankfulness to our team,” Zhao added.
“All the staff ... put a lot of manpower as the workload in both the out-patient clinic and the operating room greatly increased ,” Zhao said.
The delegation is part of ‘Lifeline Express’, China’s only mobile eye hospital specializing in charitable medical activities.
The medical team, which consists of eminent eye physicians from PUMCH with modern medical equipment and instruments, also offered a technical training and exchange programme introducing advanced ophthalmology surgical techniques to local doctors and nurses.

All medical services provided by Lifeline Express were free of charge.
In daily communication and exchanges, the China-Sri Lanka relations are the main topic.
“Almost all Sri Lankan doctors and nurses are aware of China’s help to Sri Lanka. The driver who is with us every day, also knows a lot about the donation projects from China to Sri Lanka, such as ports, roads and airports,” Zhao said.
Cui Li, deputy director of the China National Health and Family Planning Commission, said at the opening ceremony of ‘Brightness Action’ that, the Chinese medical team is undoubtedly contributing to the development of China-Sri Lanka relations.

“The medical treatment carried out by Chinese Lifeline Express in Sri Lanka for the local people, not only benefits local people, also makes something meaningful for the bilateral relations between two countries,” Cui said.
In July 1997, in order to celebrate the return of Hong Kong to China, Hong Kong compatriots proposed an initiative to build and donate the first China Lifeline Express to provide sight rehabilitating operations for patients with cataract. - Xinhua 
Cataract
A cataract is a clouding of the eye’s natural lens, which lies behind the iris and the pupil.
Cataracts are the most common cause of vision loss in people over age 40 and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are more cases of cataracts worldwide than there are of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy combined, according to Prevent Blindness America (PBA).
Types of cataracts include:
A subcapsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a subcapsular cataract.
A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.
A cortical cataract is characterised by white, wedge-like opacities that start in the periphery of the lens and work their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.
Cataract Symptoms and Signs
A cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.
Hazy-looking landscape.
Hazy, blurred vision may mean you have a cataract.
A cataract may make light from the sun or a lamp seem too bright or glaring. Or you may notice when you drive at night that the oncoming headlights cause more glare than before. Colours may not appear as bright as they once did.
The type of cataract you have will affect exactly which symptoms you experience and how soon they will occur. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in your near vision, called “second sight.”
Unfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract worsens. On the other hand, a subcapsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until it’s well-developed.
If you think you have a cataract, see an eye doctor for an exam to find out for sure.
What causes Cataracts?
The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye’s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.
The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.
But as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it harder to see.
No one knows for sure why the eye’s lens changes as we age, forming cataracts. But researchers worldwide have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:
Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources
Diabetes
Hypertension
Obesity
Smoking
Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications
Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol
Previous eye injury or inflammation
Previous eye surgery
Hormone replacement therapy
Significant alcohol consumption
High myopia
Family history
One theory of cataract formation that’s gaining favour is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This is supported by nutrition studies that show fruits and vegetables high in antioxidants may help prevent certain types of cataracts.
Cataract Prevention
Though there is significant controversy about whether cataracts can be prevented, a number of studies suggest certain nutrients and nutritional supplements may reduce your risk of cataracts.
How smoking harms your vision.
One large, 10-year study of female health professionals found that higher dietary intakes of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements were associated with significantly decreased risks of cataract.
Good food sources of vitamin E include sunflower seeds, almonds and spinach. Good sources of lutein and zeaxanthin include spinach, kale and other green, leafy vegetables.
Other studies have shown antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C and foods containing omega-3 fatty acids may reduce cataract risk.
 
Another step you can take to reduce your risk of cataracts is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the sun’s UV rays when you are outdoors.
