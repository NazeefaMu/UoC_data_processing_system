Naib stars as Afghanistan win series against Zimbabwe

 
Sharjah, Wednesday : Gulbadin Naib hit a career best, undefeated 82 as Afghanistan defeated Zimbabwe by two wickets to win the fifth one-day international and take the series 3-2 on Wednesday.
Naib smashed six sixes and three boundaries in his 68-ball knock as Afghanistan chased down their 249-run target to claim a second successive series win over Zimbabwe after winning in Africa in October.
Naib's final six came off the third last ball after his team had been 121-5 at one stage.
His partnership of 85 with Rashid Khan for the seventh wicket proved key after Zimbabwe had appeared to be on course for a third successive win in the series after losing the first two matches.
Hamilton Masakadza had hit 110 after Zimbabwe batted first while Peter Moor (42) and Richmond Mutumbami (40) also starred as the African side had been 167-3.
Afghanistan were 66-3 in reply after fast bowler Luke Jongwe sent back Mohammad Shahzad, Noor Ali Zadran and Narwoz Mangol.
But Hashmatullah Shahidi and Mohammad Nabi steadied the innings before Naib took charge with his man of the match performance.
"The partnership with Rashid helped and gave me the energy to carry on," Naib told cricinfo.com.
Afghanistan skipper Asghar Stanikzai hailed his team's win which also cemented their place in the top 10 of the world rankings. AFP
