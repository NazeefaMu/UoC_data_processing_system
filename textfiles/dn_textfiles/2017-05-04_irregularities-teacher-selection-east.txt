Irregularities in teacher selection in the East

Although Cabinet approval has been given to absorb volunteer teachers in the Eastern Province to the permanent cadre, teachers have been selected to schools in 14 out of the 17 education zones. Moreover out of 445 teacher appointments approved, 111 teachers had been selected form the Muthur Education Zone alone.
This has caused a major problem said Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando, adding that several volunteer teachers had complained to him about this irregularity. The Governor said he had now referred this problem to the Education Ministry Secretary for a solution.
