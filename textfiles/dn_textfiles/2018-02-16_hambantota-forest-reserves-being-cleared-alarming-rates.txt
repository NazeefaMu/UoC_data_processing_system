Hambantota forest reserves being cleared at alarming rates

A large extent of forest reserve lands in the Hambantota district have been encroached by state and private sectors for various cultivations and settlements. The Malara and Thammanawa Wewa reserves have also been encroached, wild life officials said.
Residents of the area said felling of trees, poaching, and clearing of forest lands also continue unabated. Residents of other parts of the Hambantota district said that this situation has paved a way for wild elephants invade villages and destroy houses and cultivations. When inquired regarding the matter, Southern Wildlife Director Prasantha Wimaladasa said as a result of the clearing of forest reserves at alarming rates, lives of villagers are in danger and steps would be taken to nab culprits behind these malpractices.
