Tambimuttu’s poetic voice

I remember well the day I met the poet Tambimuttu at his own publishing house named The Lyrebird Press in London as far back as 1969. This happened to be the launch of a new collection of Bangladesh poems translated into English by Pritish Nandy. The book is titled as Poems from Bangla Desh: The voices of a new nation’ (1970). The poet was also known by the shorter name Tambi. He happened to have several links with the BBC World Service.
As such he had a special admiration for those of us who came to see him. The copy of the collection of poems selected by him for the launching occasion gifted to all of us. I still have my copy which I fished out from the shelf and read from time to time. The poems are selected by Tambimuttu, who full name goes Meary James Thurajirajah Tambimuttu (1915 – 1983). The English-reading world came to know him as famous Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) born Tamil poet, editor and publisher known for his editions of Poetry London and Poetry New York.
Early poet
While being an undergraduate in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) attending the University of Ceylon based in Colombo, he left for London at the age of 22 and started the career of an editor solely responsible for bringing out the well-known poetry journal, Poetry London. He was helped by such poets as Lawrence, Darrell, TS Eliot and Dylan Thomas to name a few. Shuttling from the UK to the US, Tambi had the chance of bringing only his own poems but also o bring out many a collection of poems from others.
He arrived in London in 1968 and founded the Lyrebird Press to which we visited as cited earlier. Tambi’s name is identified with those poets who wrote poems during the period before and after the Second World War. In 1942, he brought out his anthology of poems titled Poetry in Wartime: An Anthology, which became known as an epitome of creative pacifism. Followed by the success, he compiled the companion volume titled Indian Love Poems.
As he told us on the launching day of the Poems from Bangla Desh: The Voice of New Nation, the aim in the founding of the Lyrebird Press is to help the wearied people of the west to gather and be influenced by the books on the prophetic vision of the East and more broadly the spiritualism in the Orient. Regarding the matter, he was a regular participant in the BBC Radio Broadcasts ‘Talking to India commenced as far back during the few months of World War II.
Creative skills
Coming on to the topic of the poems from Bangla Desh, the 35 poems in the anthology in English translation represent the main trends in the creative skills of the poets living in East Bengal, which emerged as a new nation called Bangla Desh. Most of these poems were written in the early sixties and most of them too had come to be known since the declaration of the Independence in 1971. The themes in the selected poems cover such aspects as the day to day stories of the people, the pains in the living conditions, the need for social changes etc. The lines of the opening poem by Ahmad Mansur go as follows.
Every day this happensAnd it will happen again:This fire is fearlessIt will burn againWorkers are restlessAngry processions marchThe roads and the fields trembleWith the voice of the peasantEvery day this happensand it will happen again.
The need to live in a land that is loved a person the sense captured in the poem titled My Truth, This Land by Abuttena Mustafa Kamal:
The Mountains, the fields,And the orchards of my landThe ports, the farms andThe faces of her childrenAre all one with my bloodThey have mingledAnd are nowPart of my consciousnessWhen the beauty of a womanEnchants me, or when theThe magic of some lost songEchoes in my mind,I find O, my motherland!
The poem titled as Not War, We Want Peace captures the sense of misery caused by war tortures as composed by the poet Daud Haidar.
Not war, bring peace,We want to live, all our days togetherIn this same home,What shall we gainBy hoarding hate,Each in our private world?Come, let us be friends,Let us cross the mountains of grief,Not war, bring us peaceTo these two nations,So that we may live all our days togetherIn friendship
The preface to the collection of poems as written by Tambimuttu explains some of the inner textual meanings in his selections. He says that some poems date back to the period of the popular language movement when East Bengal was rocked by police firings on crowds who were demonstrating against the imposition of Urdu as the official language.
Reminiscing the poetic essence left behind by the great poet Rabindranath Tagore, the Bengal poet Nyamat Hussain writes the following lines:
If I am slaughteredAll that will remain of meMy blood, my flesh, my bones,Will be Bengal.Bengal has suffered greatlyAnd yet in spite of her suffering in her literatureAnd in her songsIs the passion for languageThis is the anguish we shareWe respect the memories of Shakespeare, Dante and Tolstoy. But in the blood of my heart remain Tagore. The poet Hussain’s point of illumination goes as:
Ours is the language of Tagore,This is the Language that is Tagore,Bengal.
The poem rests on two layers namely the patriotic vein as well as the sense of portrayal eyes of masses on the subject of love for one’s nation.
It is recorded that most of Tambimuttu’s own works are difficult to access and his earliest works published before he came to London are untraceable and perhaps lost. His greatest influence was as an editor and publisher, especially during the 1940s. I am not soo sure whether the English literary scholars in Sri Lanka have devoted their studies on Tambimuttue in order to find the real portrait of Tambimuttu as a legacy.
But I faintly remember that the late English Professor Lyn Ludowyk devoting several pages of his work ‘Marginal Comments’ on Tambimuttu and his works.
