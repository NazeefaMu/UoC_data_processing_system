Telecom ‘manpower’ issue to be resolved

Sri Lanka Telecom has taken measures to solve the issue of the manpower workers attached to it without causing any injustice to the existing permanent cadre, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said. He made this observation at a press conference at the Jaic Hilton yesterday.
He said there were around 2,181 manpower workers attached to Sri Lanka Telecom and out of them, 400 have already been made permanent with 100 being absorbed last year and another 300 this year into the permanent cadre.
He also said that there were more than 5,000 employees in the permanent category and they opposed making the manpower workers permanent as they would face difficulties when promotions are granted .
Minister Fernando said however the issue had been solved without causing any injustice to the permanent staff. He added that the Board of Directors of Telecom decided to increase the age limit to 47 for recruting into the permanent cadre.
However, the management would have to find out another solution for those who are above 47 years, Fernando said.
He added the Board of Directors decided to recruit the manpower workers into the permanent cadre at the rate of 200 each year.
He also said that due to this decision all manpower workers below 47 years of age would be recruited within three years.
