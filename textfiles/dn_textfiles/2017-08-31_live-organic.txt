Live  organic!

It is present in your vegetables, it is there in your spices, your tea, and even in your beverages. It is in your jam, dhal, millet-bread, and curries and it is in your clothes as well. But more than ever it is on your mind. It is a word called ‘organic’ that is becoming a whole new way of life — of benefitting from going back to your roots.
Sri Lanka is seeing a quick sprouting of organic products. These are sold not only in large shopping hubs, but also in smaller localities and neighbourhoods. Once found only in health food stores, organic food is now a regular feature at most supermarkets. A lot of people seem to be catching on to the organic mantra each day, as word spreads, and demand increases. There is a store at an arm’s reach for most people in the city today.
Noting this fondness for a green lifestyle Udara Ratnayake has come up with a unique concept. She has introduced the Sri Lankan organic enthusiasts to a special tea made exclusively from Gotu Kola (Centellaasiatica). What is new about Udara’s product is that it is actually the Gotu Kola leaves which will be used to be brewed to make tea rather than the power. Herbal Gotu Kola rather than the common Gotu Kola grown in gardens is used for the product.
What triggered Udara’s concept is her mother, Nilani Champika’s love for gardening.
Herable Gotu kola tea
“She grew flowers in the front garden while the back portion of land was reserved for the kitchen garden. We hardly bought vegetables from the market since everything was home grown. I was brought up in an environment which promotes organic eating. This motivated me to start ‘Green Care’ since I noticed that there is a demand for a healthy lifestyle in the nation,” Udara explained.
‘Green Care’ was initiated as an environmentally conscious start up with a strong aim to support and promote organic agriculture. Gotu Kola tea was the first product to be introduced under the brand.
“I believe in healthy alternatives to contemporary fast food. I met Achala Samaradiwakara of the Good Market and she told me that a many people sell organic fruits, vegetables and green leaves. A new product will catch the eyes of the visitors. Herbal teas have a lot of demand from the public. So my answer was to introduce Gotu Kola herbal tea to meet the growing demand for healthy lifestyles in the nation,” she said.
She notes that herbal Gotu Kola is more difficult to grow than the normal kind. She had engaged in a market research going through all the herbal tea ranges available at the market. Since Gotu Kola herbal tea was absent from the list she had worked towards developing the product.
Often dubbed as the ‘wonder herb’ Gotu Kola is a healing plant with a power to combat a number of illnesses, increase memory power, rejuvenate skin health and offers a truly restful sleep. Commonly known as Indian Pennywort, Gotu Kola is said to be a herb frequently consumed by Yogis in India to improve their concentration power. Gotu Kola not only fortifies the immunity system, but it also acts as a natural purifier of blood. It also helps to reduce skin disorders. It has the power to boost the central nervous system which further helps conditions such as epilepsy, senility and premature ageing.

Gotu Kola is a natural memory amplifier as well. It helps to relieve stress and depression. It also aids to combat chronic illnesses like high blood pressure, and help the body to defend against toxins. According to research Gotu Kola is used for treating rheumatism, congestive heart failure, urinary tract infections and hepatitis too. This miracle herb is also ideal for speedy recovery from wounds.
Since the idea came about from her mother’s hobby, ‘Green Care’ goes under the tag line ‘From her Garden’. Though her main product is Gotu Kola herbal tea, Udara has also introduced moringa and curry leaf herbal tea.
“These types of drinks do not necessarily have to be made from tea leaves. You can brew a ‘tea’ from other plants as well. These beverages are similar to green tea since they have a lot of health benefits,” Udara said adding that the daily consumption of moringa and curry leaves is good for a person’s wellbeing.
“You get a lot of nutrition from them. Moringa is a good fighting agent against diabetes. Curry leaves help to lower cholesterol levels. They also fight against cancer and possess anti-diabetic and antioxidant properties,” she mused.
An old girl of Girls’ High School, Kandy, Udara comes from a family which is engaged in business. Her father is Deepal Ratnayake. Her sister, Dilhara, is a lecturer at a private university. Udara followed arts for her G C E Advanced Levels. She holds a business management degree and is employed as a marketer for a leading manufacturing company in the island.
Bringing back the age old farming concepts to lifethrough innovation, Green Care ardently practices organic farming in their plantations located in Galkulama, Puttalam. The plantations are verified under Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) and provide the base ingredients for Green Care organic.

“Becoming an entrepreneur is my goal. Green Care Organic is a step towards this venture. However I want to give something back to the society as well. This is why I have employed 10 women to engage in producing the products. They face various hardships. so a job which they can engage in leisurely is a great relief to them. I consider them as my partners in this journey rather than workers. We meet up during weekends and during my holidays,” she said.
Speaking about the challenges she met in developing the products Udara notes that they were mostly related to transportation, packaging and allocating the relevant market for the products. Going strong for six months the response has been tremendous since the products sell like hot cakes.
Part of the proceeds from Green Care is reinvested for CSR initiatives which Udara personally oversees conducting workshops on organic farming in rural areas.
These workshops are mainly implemented in farming communities enabling the rural farmers to build their capacity to meet the rising demand for organic food, locally and internationally. The newest product that Udara has added to her brand is handmade coconut oil. She is working on developing a product using asparagus.
