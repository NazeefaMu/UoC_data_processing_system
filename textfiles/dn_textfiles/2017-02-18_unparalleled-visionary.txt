Unparalleled visionary

Don Richard Wijewardene was historically an inspired visionary. With his far-sight, he was unshakably certain that only the people blessed with knowledge, will be the truest inheritors of independence.
In the days of his higher education in the UK, with an admirable restraint, he curbed his restless patriotism. He turned to more pragmatic moves, which in the long run would ensure the true and stark achievement of independence. He had the first question asked in the Mother of Parliament about the need to look into “Ceylon’s” independence. He achieved his pioneering parliamentary victory in the UK through an MP who was sympathetic to the Ceylonese Independence Cause.
His austere policies yielded spectacular successes at times. In association with yet another fearless warrior in the “unarmed” battle for Sri Lanka’s Independence, Wijewardene made a startling discovery. He came upon Sri Lanka’s original Lion Flag, which was taken down to hoist the British Union Jack.
Newspaper publishing domain
Wijewardene and his companion, ultra-patriot E. W. Perera, found this historical Lion Flag in a closet in the Royal Hospital at Chelsea - of all places.
It is this historical Lion Flag that incidentally became the first national flag of the newly independent nation.
Though even his spirit would resent such due recognition, the life story of D R Wijewardene is very much a saga.
Returning home from overseas, he established a newspaper publishing domain. He was fully convinced, that information and proper knowledge should constitute the twin staple assets of a truly independent nation. A well-informed nation equipped with pragmatic wisdom will be the enlightened citizens, who will be able to make the right choices for the land and the people.
Wijewardene’s “Lake House” was a highly impressive establishment of discipline, orderliness and unscrupulous dedication to service. It had such allure that, even some new graduates preferred employment in the executive and editorial grades of Lake House, to civil/administrative services.
Wijewardene himself personalised a rare quality of austerity.
Lake House publications
His sense of austere administration was so keen that he never allowed either his photograph or any written reference to him to appear in Lake House publications. When he imposed such strict conditions on his own official conduct, restraining others would be a matter of course.
Some of his biographers have observed that Wijewardene preferred Green Gruel as his sun-up repast, rather than non-local exotic breakfasts.
He introduced an administrative system that was so methodically conceived, even the state bureaucracy would have at times felt at least a tinge of jealousy.
All the extensive departments of the Lake House establishment, had a complex organisation, directed towards one particular goal - the printing, publishing and the circulation of the printed products. The multiplicity of activities were all meticulously made to converge upon this unified organisational target.
One cannot help but wonder that a Sri Lankan entrepreneurial genius would possess this form of unimaginable managerial dexterity.
His eye for detail, was a marvel by itself.
He had a responsible officer whose sole duty was to seek shortcomings, and if there were any, to put them right as quickly as possible. Throughout his service days at Lake House this was his professional focus.
The transport system organised under his supervision, turned out at one point to be a trusted passenger service as well - the primary purpose of which was the delivering of the published material.
I was recruited to the editorial staff personally by Esmond Wickremasinghe. The illustrious genius D R W was his father-in-law.
One day Wickremasinghe told me that D R Wijewardene was keen to see me at his residence. One must be a very young journalist at Lake House at that time, to appreciate what a prestigious occasion this was for me, still at the threshold of my profession.
Illustrious father’s sacred memory
With due deference, I visited Wijewardene’s residence. He waved me into a large comfortable chair. But seeing my senior colleague (very, very senior colleague to be exact) Mr. Hulugalla, Editor Daily News, seated on a bench, I preferred to sit with him. The reason why he requested me to see him filled me with a pleasant surprise. He wanted me to instruct his son - Ranjith Wijewardene - in Sinhala.
Even at present, whenever I meet Ranjith Wijewardene at some gathering, he greets me with a smile, and reminds me that I taught him Sinhala. I find this a very gracious and touching gesture.
The great, austere and ultra-cultured administrative tradition of D. R. Wijewardene is being perpetuated by Ranjith Wijewardene, paying an exalted tribute to his Illustrious father’s sacred memory.
When I was walking out, after that historical meeting (for me, of course) Mr. Wijewardene stopped me for a moment. He told me: “You will be with us for a long while.” I just cannot fathom, even now what was exactly meant by that saying of the media sage. Lake House, has become the ‘Establishment’ for media publications in our land today too. The solid personality of late D.R Wijewardene still towers over our media filed, as an unshaken colossal.
What this single-minded, exceptionally austere super-entrepreneur achieved in his lifetime is a blazing torch held aloft to guide the path of generations to come. People may not quite know that in most of the book and newspaper publishing areas they still unknowingly employ techniques of organisation and discipline that were once endowed upon this land by this Immortal Entrepreneurial Thinker.
May the memory of great D.R. Wijewardene remain fresh as some material printed just a second ago.
