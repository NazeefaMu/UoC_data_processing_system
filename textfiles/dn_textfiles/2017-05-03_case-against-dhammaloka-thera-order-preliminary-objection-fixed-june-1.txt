Case against Dhammaloka Thera: Order for preliminary objection fixed for June 1

 
Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe today fixed a date for the order regarding the preliminary objection raised by Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka of Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda over a private plaint filed against him for allegedly using loudspeakers in a manner causing nuisance.
Accordingly, the private plaint filed against Dhammaloka Thera was fixed for June 1.
On December 6, 2016, the Court issued a conditional order preventing Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka from using loudspeakers in a manner causing nuisance at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda between 5.00 a.m. and 6.00 a.m.
The Court made this order taking into consideration a private plaint filed by six parties including former Minister Milinda Moragoda and the Centre for Environmental Justice alleging that loudspeakers used by Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda was causing an annoyance and disturbance to the residents.
Through this private plaint, the six complainants sought the Court’s jurisdiction to avert noise pollution taking place in the area in terms of the section 98 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The six complainants Gavinda Jayasinghe, Dr. Kalinga Kaluperuma, Diren R. Hallock, Milinda Moragoda, Kamalesh Johnpillai and Centre for Environmental Justice informed Court that they were compelled against their will to listen to the amplified sounds which emanate from the loudspeakers at the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple.
They said the authorities have turned a blind eye to their complaints made on several occasions.
Senior Counsel Ravindranath Dabare with counsel Sugath Attapattu appeared for the Centre for Environmental Justice.
