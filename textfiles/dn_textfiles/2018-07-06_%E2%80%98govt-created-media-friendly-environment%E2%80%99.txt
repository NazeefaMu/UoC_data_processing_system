‘Govt. created a media - friendly environment’

Investigations could be launched if the New York Times’ journalists, who were said to be threatened for furnishing a report concerning former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, lodge a complaint, Public Administration, Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
He said so addressing the media at the Ministry auditorium yesterday.
The Minister added that an impartial investigation could be launched into such allegations if the said journalists lodge a complaint with the Police.
Minister Bandara noted that during the reign of the last regime ie before 2015, around 25 journalists were assaulted or killed by the white van culture of the then government. According to the Minister, no journalist had been assaulted or killed under this government, unlike the former regime. Journalists have been granted total freedom and opportunity to perform their duties impartially with dignity. No incidents of threatening, killing or assaulting had ever been reported since 2015 under this government, he said.
The Minister added that this was the only government which was able to maintain a media friendly environment for nearly four years.
Meanwhile, the Minister seeks the assistance of the media to do away with organised crime, drug trafficking, underworld movements and other unruly acts.
