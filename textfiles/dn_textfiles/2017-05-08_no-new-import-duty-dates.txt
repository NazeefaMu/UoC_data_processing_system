No new import duty on dates

Baseless news items are published by certain media that new duty has been imposed for dates. Only a special commodity tax of Rs.60 is currently charged for imported dates per kilogram. In addition, no other tax is charged for dates, a statement issued from the Trade and Investment Policies Department said.
A total tax of Rs.130 was charged per kilogram of imported dates by 2015. It consisted of 15 percent Customs duty, 7.5 percent ports and airport duty, 25 percent Cess tax, 11 percent VAT and 2 percent Nation Building tax.
All taxes for dates were abolished when prices of essential commodities were reduced on November 20, 2015 after the Good Governance rule assumed office and, a special commodity tax of Rs.60 per kilogram was introduced instead. This enabled traders to import dates Rs.70 less than that of the price they paid earlier, the statement showed.
In addition, the government has already made necessary monetary allocations for respective ministries in lieu of the taxes they ought to pay for stocks of dates the country receive as donations from foreign countries to be distributed free during special religious events, the statement pointed out.
Participating in the parliament debate with regard to the special gazette notification dated November 21, 2016 in connection with the imposing of special commodity tax, although Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti interpreted this as imposing new tax for dates, this is not imposing any new tax but further extension of the already reduced tax plan for dates maintaining since November 2015, the statement said.
Therefore, all print and electronic media reports published sourcing to the statement made by the JVP MP are untrue and, no new duty has been imposed on import of dates as they are brought to the country during the forthcoming Ramadan festival, the statement stressed.
