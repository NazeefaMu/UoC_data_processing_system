Kandy SC opens Clifford Cup k/o against CH today

Defending champions Kandy Sports Club will go all out to assert their supremacy when they play host to CH & FC in their Clifford Cup quarterfinal fixture at Nittawela today at 4.15 pm.
On current form Kandy SC will not have any difficulty in beating CH whom they have twice thrashed in the league matches scoring over 50 points in each match. Kandy is expected to carry on from where they left off last Sunday and continue their winning vein into the knockouts.
For today’s match Kandy will include the best young talent they have at their disposal. Kandy has been playing cohesive rugby which has unsettled many of their opponents. Another incentive to the Kandy SC side is the encouragement given by their trustee Malik Samarawickrema.
Kandy SC had their final work out last morning and the two coaches Sean Wijesinghe and his assistant Nalaka Weerakody who put the players through their paces has in consultation with the rugby committee decided to make a few changes from the side that played CH last Sunday.
In the forwards play, Kandy SC should get the better of their opponents and give the Colombo lads a torrid time. Their backs have been performing with good understanding as they have proved in the league games. Their backs have regularly provided that extra pace which has made their task easier. Their strong point against CH will be their back division.
CH & FC will be at full strength, but will face a tough task to stop their opponents from going on another scoring spree. A better show is expected from the Maitland Crescent Club. But whatever they do it is going to be a difficult task for them to match the champion Kandy outfit.
