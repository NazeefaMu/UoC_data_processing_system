Parent numbers seeking mantenance allowances on the rise

The number of parents who seek legal aid for maintenance allowances from their well-to-do children, is currently on the rise. Accordingly, about 131 aged parents have filed cases against their children during the first nine months of this year as those children have ignored them after owning all their properties and lands legally by way of title deeds.
Last year, 93 complaints were received by the Social Welfare Ministry and these figures have been confirmed by the National Secretariat of the Elders Director Suminda Singappuli.
Most of these children who have neglected their aged parents are professionally-qualified government doctors, lawyers, engineers and other categories of high-ranking officials. Some are employed abroad at present. In Sri Lanka, about 1.7 million persons who are above 60 years of age are currently living in the country.
"Since certain children don’t look after their aged parents, a suitable insurance and welfare project for aged parents have to be introduced in the future by government authorities," said Kurunegala Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake, speaking at a meeting of representatives of elders’ societies of the Kurunegala district held yesterday at the Bingiriya Youth Training Centre in Kurunegala.
