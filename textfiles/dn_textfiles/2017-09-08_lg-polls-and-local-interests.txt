LG polls and local interests

The silhouette of Local Government elections is in the distant horizon. Its postponement caused public anxiety for many services rendered by local government bodies were paralyzed under the administration of Commissioners. The latter had been not so enthusiastic about public welfare.
Two issues highlighted the weakness of the existing system and the need for early elections. They are the Dengue epidemic and the issue of waste disposal.
An unduly long time was taken to reform the elections law and technical issues were not sufficiently foreseen in formulating them. This caused so much repeated delays that one began even to wonder whether they were deliberately caused by interested parties. It is impossible to tell the exact date or period in which elections could be held till the relevant Local Government Election Acts are revised. Another factor that delayed the elections may be the reluctance of governing parties to hold elections till they put their houses in order.
New legislation that replaced the earlier Local Government election law is an advance in democracy. For the first time it has ensured 25% women representation in local government bodies. Such a mandatory quota is necessary in the context of male dominated political parties and cultural constraints on women’s political activities. It has done away with the notorious preferential of manape system and retained the advantages of proportional representation through a hybrid system combining the latter with the First-past-the Post system. The abolition of the preferential vote makes electioneering much cheaper and accessible to poor candidates. It also reduces the dependence on money-bags.
Geneva Human Rights Council resolutions
Political parties have already started the polls campaign. What are the issues they are raising? It is the same as that has been raised at any election whether Local Government, Parliamentary or Presidential. For example, issues highlighted were related to the prosecution of war heroes, the Geneva Human Rights Council resolutions, threats to sovereignty of the State, international conspiracy etc. Almost the same topics are debated even today. Of course new slogans are coined to update the dialogue. For example, the Joint Opposition claims that the Yahapalana government has sold the country to foreigners and is colluding with the LTTE Diaspora.
The Government parties argue that they have not only not done so but also have regained the lost prestige of the country in the international domain and prevented international probes of alleged war crimes. They will also harp on its achievements nationally without referring to any local development issues.
Is there anything that concerns local interests or development of the locality? None at all. It means only central themes will become election campaign issues. Political parties will use the elections to test their national popularity or that of the Government. In fact it has been said so openly.
Returning to the Ward system of electing members is progressive. However, the full advantage of it is denied by allowing political parties to decide upon nominations. What would happen is the candidate that earns the confidence of the central party leadership or the MP of the area will get nomination while there may be more popular candidates in the locality. Considering the corrupt nature of central politicians anyone who gets into their confidence may also have a chance of being a controversial person of similar character.
Political parties
There were serial rapists and murderers among the local Government Heads in the last administration. Some have crossed allegiances and become members of other parties. Party nomination forces party loyalists to vote for the party candidate without questioning their credentials. Independent groups are powerless to challenge the authority of political parties unless in special cases. This factor nullifies the advantage of the new ward system. An elected member also would have a stronger allegiance to the party leadership or the party MP of the area than to his voters.
Now it is the political parties that could rectify this situation by nominating candidates of exemplary character from the localities. They could easily do so if they heed public opinion of local residents. In most cases, candidates themselves are to blame for they depend on the prestige of central politicians or the party leaders to attract votes. The latter too should discourage their names or photos being used to canvass votes.
Elections alone would not make local government better institutions. Avenues should be explored for people’s participation in the work of Councils. Two issues that need special attention are the Dengue eradication and waste disposal in the area. Both these need people’s participation. Besides public works such as road maintenance and public health also would be better served with popular participation. For example, a system of voluntary Ward Residents’ Committees could be established with the help of elected members for such purposes. Local government activities could be used as a testing ground in moving towards a system of participatory democracy to replace the majoritarian rule.
