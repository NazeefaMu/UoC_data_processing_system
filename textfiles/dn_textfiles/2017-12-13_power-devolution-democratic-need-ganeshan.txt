Power devolution, a democratic need - Ganeshan

Power devolution is not an ethnic issue, it is a democratic need, said National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan yesterday, introducing the four slogans for national and religious coexistence in the country.
The Religious Co-existence Convention held at the BMICH brought together religious leaders of the four main religions in the country focused on the four slogans of:
“Sri Lankan our identity, diversity our strength”, “Let’s not take up arms to achieve political goals”, “Let us review our history and correct our mistakes”, and “One country, power to all”.
“The era to separate, break apart and divide the country has gone. We all live in one country,” noted the Minister and having established this,” he remarked that for peace, it was necessary that power be devolved beyond Colombo.
“Over the years, through consequent governments, we have seen a certain class in Colombo concentrating power at the Centre. But, our government for the first time is going to devolve power to the provinces in the truest sense”, Minister Ganesan said.
“Since 2003 we have had the dream to change the electoral system and from next year, the people can reap the benefits of the new system,” he added.
“A Northern Provincial Councillor recently refused to raise the National Flag though all government servants take office having accepted the Constitution and National Flag. What he did was wrong and we condemn this. At the same time we saw extremists in the South carrying the national flag with the green and orange stripes removed. That too is wrong. We have extremists on both sides,” he explained
“The President and government has chosen to walk the middle path between these extremes and we need the guidance and direct intervention of our religious to make it a success,” Minister Ganeshan said.
“We will accomplish this as we have a strong government to implement it,” the Minister said.
