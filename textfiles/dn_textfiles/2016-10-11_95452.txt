Gunning for another Oscar?

She won an Oscar in 2004 for ‘Monster’ after gaining 30 lbs to play serial killer Aileen Wuornos. And it is rumoured Charlize Theron is back to her method acting ways again as she appeared to show a fuller figure on set of her new film ‘Tully in Vancouver’.
The apparent weight gain could be the result of a prosthetic suit, but the dramatic physical change would certainly be in line with the 41-year-old actress’ commitment to the craft of acting. Raising three children in the film, Charlize plays the main character Marlo who was gifted a night nanny by her brother, and to her surprise, formed a unique bond with the unique young nanny.
The film is directed by Jason Reitman who, along with Diablo, collaborated with Theron on 2011 film ‘Young Adult’. For her Academy Award winning role in ‘Monster’, Charlize gained a whopping 30 pounds in the film which saw her celebrated with 17 acting honours.
To gain the weight the actress claims to have eaten lots of doughnuts.
However, it wasn’t just about gaining the weight as Charlize claimed at the time that the body transformation aided her in getting into serial killer Wuornos’ mind.
The convicted killer was executed in 2002 for the murders of six men, a seventh murder she was not tried for. Mail Online
