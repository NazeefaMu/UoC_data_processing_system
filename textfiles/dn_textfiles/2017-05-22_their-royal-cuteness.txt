Their Royal Cuteness!

It may be Pippa’s big day, but all eyes were on Princess Charlotte and Prince George as they toddled down the aisle behind their aunt today. The brother and sister looked angelic dressed in adorable ensembles from Spanish clothing company Pepa & Co.
However, it seems that after an hour in church the pressure of being a pageboy may have become a bit much for three-year-old George who was seen becoming tearful after leaving the church.
Charlotte, two, appeared to be quite content as a patient Kate tried her best to calm her son who, after such a big responsibility, may be in need of a rest.
However, when George continued to tantrum he received a rare public telling off from his mother who was eager to prevent anything from disrupting her little sister’s big day.
However, the prince appeared to cheer up at the prospect of riding in a vintage wedding car as he made his way to the reception with his mother and sister and could be waving to onlookers.
