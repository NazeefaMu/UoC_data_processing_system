Tanner - a next generation aviator

Tanner Fernando, 17, who lives in Michigan, USA, created a major sensation having joined the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) at the age of 14.
CAP gave him the opportunity to learn many aspects of aviation in which he has participated since he was 11.
Tanner’s motto is ‘knowledge is power’, which gives a will and determination to improve
aviation-related knowhow every day.
His aviation video shows of his flight simulator test is testimony to his skill, enthusiasm and determination to succeed in his field.
Tanner’s talent in aeronautics was proved when he was selected by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University for Commercial Aviation which he will begin in September.
He has a long way to go, but believes that the strong foundation he has will stand him in good stead.
He is the son of Rukmal Fernando, of Michigan, USA.
