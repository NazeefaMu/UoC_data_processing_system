Point of view
Equity markets remained in positive territory yet again this week with the broad-share ASPI recording W-o-W gains for the third consecutive week.
Despite a 13.2 point loss early in the week, the ASPI rebounded sharply on Thursday and Friday (by 65 points) to close the week ~52 points higher.
A strong come-back by Retailers on the back of last week’s strategic sale of JINS General Insurance to Global giant Allianz along with a rebound in Foreign interest (net foreign purchases increased 182% W-o-W to record the 3rd highest net foreign position so far this year) helped the Index close comfortably above the key 6500-mark. Gains on the ASPI stood in stark contrast to peer EM/FM equities, which recorded six consecutive days of losses as the global stock rout continued. Global equity markets have tumbled since Monday as US stocks crashed (from their nearly nine year bull run) on concerns of rising inflation and higher bond yields triggered by positive wage data which showed wages growing at its fastest pace in over 81/2 years.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields - a broad gauge of inflation expectations- rose to a 4-year high, highlighting investor fears that the synchronized recovery in US and EU would prompt the US Fed to raise rates at a faster than anticipated pace in order to rein inflation pressure.
Domestic equities however, have remained largely immune to Global market developments and markets in the week ahead are likely to seek direction both from the outcome of the LG elections and the CBSL’s first monetary policy statement for the year.
Initial earnings negative; fitch retains rating
Initial corporate earnings of the Dec’17 quarter have been largely negative, with ~66% of the 47 companies who have reported results so far recording Y-o-Y declines in earnings.
While the overall direction of the total corporate earnings is difficult to gauge at this early stage (only 16% of the total market has reported results so far), JKH’s (a broad proxy for the overall market) 13% Y-o-Y decline in earnings implies that earnings growth this quarter could potentially be negative.
Nevertheless, Banks have yet to report their earnings and the direction of this will be crucial in determining the overall direction of market earnings for the quarter as Banks typically account for ~40% of total market earnings (Diversified account for ~16%).
Fitch Ratings meanwhile retained its B+ (Stable Outlook) on Sri Lanka citing the revised policy framework. The ratings agency added that policies aimed at fiscal consolidation along with a more disciplined monetary stance under the framework of IMF’s three-year programme have improved Sri Lanka's policy coherence and credibility.
Fitch estimates that although 2017 GDP growth (3.9% Y-o-Y) is likely to fall short of its original forecast due to weather-related supply disruptions, growth should stabilise at ~ 5% in 2018/19. Fitch added though that Sri Lanka's external debt service outlook remains challenging over 2019-22 as external debt service payments total ~$15Bn cf. current reserve levels of $7.7Bn. The Group noted that although the expected approval of the liability management bill in 2018 should allow for smoother debt payments, the scale of the external refinancing creates potential vulnerabilities especially in the context of expected monetary tightening in developed markets.
