FCID completes probe, awaits AG’s instructions

The FCID informed the Colombo Fort Magistrate that the investigation into former Minister Mahindanada Aluthgamage’s alleged misappropriation of Rs 39 million has been completed.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne ordered FCID officials to inform the Attorney General of the developments in the probe.
The defence counsel appearing for Aluthgamage informed the Court that the Secretary General of the Parliament has informed that his client was unable to appear before the court since he had to attend parliament sittings yesterday. However, two other suspects Chaminda Harshajith and Nalin Ruwanjeewa who are on bail, appeared before the Court yesterday.
FCID officials informed court that they had requested for the Attorney General’s instructions to file the charge sheet. The case was fixed for October 12.
