Nestlé launches Maggi  Creations noodle meal kit

Nestlé has launched yet another exciting innovation to the market Maggi Creations. It is Sri Lanka’s first ever noodle meal kit, providing consumers with pre-portioned food ingredients and recipes to prepare home-cooked Nasigoreng and Biriyani style noodle meals. It is part of Maggi’s “Simply Good” initiative to inspire and offer tastier and more nutritious choices, and encourage more home-cooking among the younger generation.
Each Maggi Nasigoreng and Maggi Biriyani pack serves two people, containing two noodle cakes made with the goodness of oats, a seasoning mix of spices and vegetables, and a spicy sauce. It also provides recipes to enhance the meal with vegetables and meat for added nutrition. Priyadarshinie Karunaratne, Nestlé Vice President Food stated, “I am proud to say that this marks a new era of innovation for our much loved Maggi brand. The new generation of consumers are looking for cooking experiences that are easy and quick but also fun. With Maggi Creations, we are giving our consumers the opportunity to create exciting homemade meals they’ll love, with the added goodness of oats. With our two unique variants offering a tantalising taste experience, consumers can cook and treat friends and family to a tangy, sweet and spicy Nasigoreng, or a Biriyani style meal worthy of the most discerning palates, easily and efficiently.”
Catering to consumer preference for no artificiality and more natural and familiar ingredients, the Maggi Creations range contains a variety of popular Sri Lankan spices to naturally enhance flavour, including garlic, coriander, cardamom, turmeric, cumin, chilli, black pepper, nutmeg, fenugreek and aniseed. It also offers nutrition and portion guidance on-pack to help consumers eat a healthy and balanced diet.
Said Shivani Hegde, Nestlé Managing Director: “We believe our purpose as a company is to enhance quality of life and contribute to a healthier future. Maggi has been an integral part of living this purpose, by innovating and renovating its products to offer consumers tastier and more nutritious cooking solutions over the years.”
