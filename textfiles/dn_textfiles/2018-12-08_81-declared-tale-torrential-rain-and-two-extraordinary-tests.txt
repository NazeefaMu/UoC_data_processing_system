81 declared: a tale of torrential rain and two extraordinary Tests

In only two Test matches have both captains declared with scores below 150 and in those games, by definition extraordinary, the higher of those totals was a mere 81. Both involved England and both had one other thing in common: rain, plenty of it, and pitches at best partially protected and massively affected.
The two third-innings declarations remain the two lowest such totals in the history of Test cricket and they set the two lowest fourth-innings, post-declaration targets ever, though one was almost three times as big as the other.
The more recent ended in Brisbane 68 years ago on Wednesday but the first was played in Barbados at the start of 1935 and, in a taste of what was to come, the start was delayed by 20 minutes because of light morning rain. Soon it was wickets that were falling.
Ken Farnes England’s 6ft 5in fast bowler.
Ken Farnes was a 6ft 5in fast bowler who was to die in 1941, two years after being named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year, when his first solo night flight after volunteering for the RAF ended in a crash moments after he took off from Chipping Warden airfield. By lunch he had taken four wickets for 15 in nine overs and West Indies were five down for 31. They recovered to reach 102 and by stumps on the first day England were 81 for five, with Wally Hammond unbeaten on 43. That night it rained long and hard, and on day two things got really interesting.
It took until tea for the groundstaff to make the surface playable and even then it was only just worthy of that description. England’s innings lasted three more balls, with Hammond falling to the second and Errol Holmes to the third, at which point Les Ames decided they would be better off bowling than attempting to score the 21 runs they still required to draw level.
West Indies opened with Les Hylton and Rolph Grant, No 7 and No 8 in their first knock, and as the team tried to survive until stumps they were followed by Nos 11, 10 and 9. Hylton, a fast bowler, was to record his two highest Test scores (he played only six times and was hanged for the murder of his adulterous wife 20 years later). He was still there at the close of play, with his team on 33 for three.
That night it rained long and hard, and again the next day it was nearly tea before the groundstaff, with the help of an obliging sun, made the surface playable. Three more wickets fell, including Hylton’s for a career-best 19, before Jackie Grant, Rolph’s brother, declared at tea. This must be considered among the most daring declarations of all time: there were four sessions still to play, his team had four wickets in hand and three top-order batsmen yet to bat, and they led by only 73.
England sent in Farnes and Big Jim Smith, at 6ft 3in the shorter of the pair, specialist bowlers who had already taken 10 wickets between them, to open the batting, a gambit that crumbled as both were out before the team reached double figures. “Excitement was now intense, and the fieldsmen were on their toes, eager to press home the advantage,” the Guardian wrote, but Patsy Hendren came out and scored 20, including a six, and after a couple more quick wickets left England still in some concern at 48 for six, Hammond took control and settled the issue with another six, concluding what it called “one of the most amazing Test matches played in recent times”.
Which brings us to the first Ashes Test in Brisbane in 1950, a game whose first day – by some margin the least remarkable, discounting the entirely rained-off second – featured, in the words of the Observer’s report, “cricket of an interest not seen since that match between England and Australia at Leeds in 1938”. At its end the Guardian described “a wicket so easy in its pace that when Hassett won the toss he hardly could have imagined that his batsmen would score less than 500 … It was a batsman’s rather than a bowler’s wicket to the end.” It went on to predict – and bear in mind that the game had started on a Friday – that, “if England can score 500 runs before the close on Monday they should win the match”, and declared the hope that, “if they are 50 runs ahead tomorrow night with most of their wickets in hand, they have a good chance of victory whatever the weather does”.
In fact England were batting at the close on Monday but that is as close as they came to fulfilling that prediction: by then, on the archetypal Brisbane sticky, they had lost 16 wickets, still not scored 100 runs and were heading for near-certain doom. On that day 20 wickets fell at an average of 6.4 apiece. “The scene was like a circus, and the players like unwilling clowns,” wrote the Observer.
England had reached 68 for seven when they declared, still 160 runs behind, in order to attempt to skittle Australia cheaply and have a decent go at reaching whatever target remained on day three. Batting conditions improved from here, with the Guardian describing “the taming influence of a tiny garden roller” that left the pitch “still disconcertingly lively, but now it was possible to play some orthodox shots”. This did not seem so clear to the Australians, who lost their first three wickets before a run had been scored. After less than 14 overs they too declared on 32 for seven.
After application of a heavy roller the wicket was further calmed but England gave their wickets away too easily – Arthur McIntyre particularly culpable, run out while attempting to sprint an unnecessary fourth – and on the third day Len Hutton, playing brilliantly, ran out of partners and England were all out for 122, 70 runs adrift. “England have been their opponents’ betters in every department of the game under all conditions,” wrote the Guardian, and yet they had lost what RC Robertson-Glasgow in the Observer called “a struggle against nature’s cruelty as much as Australia’s skill”.
“One point that arises for consideration is whether slapstick of this sort is Test cricket,” he wrote. “Test cricket surely means a trial of cricket strength or nothing. Any team can put up with the fortune of war. But this was the fortune of farce. Such pitches mock the art of bowling as well as of batting.”
England went on to lose the series 4-1, winning the final Test with the Ashes long gone, and have won on only two of their 17 subsequent visits to the Gabba. At least in 1950 they were able to blame defeat on something other than their own inferiority. – theguardian
