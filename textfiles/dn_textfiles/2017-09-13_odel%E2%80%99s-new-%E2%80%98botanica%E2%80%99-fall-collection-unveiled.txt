ODEL’s new ‘Botanica’ fall collection unveiled

Nature continues to enthral fashion designers around the world, whose efforts to synergise their creations with the environment are well represented in the latest collection unveiled by ODEL to celebrate fall 2017.
Mirroring the patterns and shades of botanical bliss, the new collection takes its inspiration from some of the planet’s best known designers – Balmain, Gucci, Valentino, Prada, Elie Saab and Jason Wu and is supported by a campaign themed ‘Botanica’ which will also transform store interiors and decor. Featuring fabrics as diverse as crepe, matte satin silk, tweed, organza, chiffon, fennel, georgette and corduroy among others, the Botanica collection uses botanical, vintage floral and check prints with embroidery detailing for a truly distinctive look and feel.
The new collection uses elements of nature such as flowers, plants, landscapes, insects and other animals that stimulate our affinity with the environment while incorporating advancements made possible by technology.
Khaki green, orange, brown, grey, dark blue, white, beige and other earthy shades enhance the collection’s nexus with nature and are in harmony with local conditions and settings. A matching jewellery collection emulates the theme with earthy elements such as leaf prints, insects and flowers, ensuring ODEL shoppers can perfectly sync their clothing and accessories.
“The Botanica collection is particularly interesting as it reflects the synergistic energy with the environment that the fashion industry is beginning to explore globally,” said Desiree Karunaratne, Group Marketing Director of Softlogic Holdings, which owns the ODEL chain. “At ODEL, we too are digging deeper to understand what it means to be a fashion brand in the age of sustainability.
The Botanica collection is just one example of Green fashion, sustainability and care for the environment which is embodied in our latest themed campaign.”
As always, the fall 2017 collection will be available across all ODEL stores around the country and will offer a selection to suit all age groups, genders and sizes, and will include matching shoes, bags and other fashion accessories.
