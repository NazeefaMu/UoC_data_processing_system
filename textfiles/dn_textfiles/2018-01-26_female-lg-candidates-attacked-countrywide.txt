Female LG candidates attacked countrywide

The Women Action Network (WAN) has condemned the attacks faced by female candidates during the run up to the Local Government Elections.
Highlighting specific incidents, they stated, “A woman candidate involved in election campaigning activities in Wellawaya in the Monaragala District was admitted to the hospital after being brutally attacked. In Arayampathy Selvanagar in the Eastern Province, a woman candidate’s house and the contents inside were damaged. A woman candidate in Puthukkudiyiruppu in the Mullaitivu District was physically assaulted, kept locked in a house, and asked to withdraw the complaint she made to the Police.
Women candidates in Puttalam and other districts have been verbally humiliated by religious leaders and their families and have been subjected to revolting comments. Vulgar comments on women candidates and disgusting opinions on their race and religion are increasingly being shared in social networks and circulated leaflets”.
Further, they observed that video clips of Moulavis Niyas Siddiqi Siraj and Murshid Abbasi verbally attacking Muslim woman candidates and their family members in a disgusting manner for their recent campaign speeches in Puttalam have gone viral in social media. The Moulavis preached their own opinions, for example, ‘Men can never be administered by women’, and ‘Women are only for performing household duties and to look after their husbands and children’. They cast these as teachings from Quran in their degradative speeches and used words that violate human dignity such as, ‘Husbands and family members of these woman candidates should be ashamed of them.’
Thus far, no political party or independent group has condemned such speeches and nor has any action been taken against such religious leaders.
They also observed that many incidents of physical and psychological assaults on woman candidates not been reported to the Police or the Election Commission are being reported through women’s organisations and activists.
In 2016, a 25 percent mandatory quota for women in Sri Lankan local government was passed into law. This creates the possibility of a minimum number of 1,991 women from 341 local councils becoming locally elected members.
Thus far, female representation is 5.3 percent in Parliament, 4 percent in provincial councils and 1.9 percent in local councils.
“Violence against women is a key factor in preventing their political participation. Ethnic, religious, and cultural barriers, along with structural violence, persecution, sexual bribery, physical assault, threats to family members, financial pressures, warnings and threats from religious heads, vandalized media reports, humiliation in social networks, and open public challenges from people with patriarchal attitudes are what prevent women from participating in politics”, said WAN further.
The Women Action Network reiterated that the 25 percent mandatory quota for women in local government should not only be nominal. It must be an obligation for the present government, the President, and the electoral structures.
