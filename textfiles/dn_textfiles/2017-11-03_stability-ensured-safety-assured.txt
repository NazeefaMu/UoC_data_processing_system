Stability ensured, safety assured

Our government, since January 08, 2015, has ensured that all citizens of Sri Lanka are secure and safe, and that stability prevails across all sectors of the society.
Safety, security and stability play a pivotal role in building a stronger and sustainable economy and our efforts have received wide support from across the globe.
We have taken diligent measures to ensure that the damages done in the past are redressed and all communities are a focus for the national development agenda.
Tackling serious crimes was a top priority for the UNP and as a result, serious crime rate has been cut by almost a third since 2014.
Today’s Sri Lanka is a more stable and safer country than it has ever been and our plans for economic development will ensure that this remains the case.
The government is bringing back stability and security so that people can enjoy peace of mind and live without fear. Public investment in police and public security has increased 8-fold, from Rs 3.3 billion in 2014 to Rs 28.5 billion in 2016.
Organised Crime and Narcotics Range
To further strengthen our battle against serious crimes, we set up the Organised Crime and Narcotics Range to defeat narcotic trade in Sri Lanka and established the Financial Crimes Investigation Division to tackle issues including major financial crimes, fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and unlawful enrichments.
The overall goal of our government in relation to the drug problem is an ambitious one and its key objective is to reduce the drug supply and drug use to minimum levels by 2020.
This goal will be pursued relentlessly by all drug law enforcement agencies, the government agencies directly involved in drug demand reduction, including provincial and local administrations and other agencies, which have a strong potential for contributing to the end objective of our mission. We have already sought the support of NGOs and private sector agencies in this regard.
The Government will deal with this horrendous scourge, while curtailing overseas supply chains of drug lords, in partnership with our friendly nations. At the same, we will intensify our battle at home as it will play a critical role in shaping the future of our country, our society and our children.
Our progressive efforts on the front of accountability and reconciliation has been recognized and appreciated by former UN Secretary General Ban-Ki moon who said the unity government was geared to find a solution to the long-drawn issues in this area.
He said: “I commend the unity Government for taking steps to pursue truth-seeking and accountability mechanisms and to deal with the grievances of people in the North and the East. I welcome the establishment of an office of missing persons and the process to reform the constitution to achieve a political settlement.”
Law enforcement authorities
Our Government has a clear commitment to reconciliation, peace building, peaceful co-existence, and the rule of law. We have directed the law enforcement authorities to immediately take all necessary steps in accordance with the law, against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech targeting any religious and ethnic groups in the country. We will protect all citizens equally and we will punish anybody who harasses them, irrespective of their positions, affiliations and allegiances.
We must all stand united to strive to eliminate this dangerous affliction of hatred towards each other, and resolve that we will never allow ourselves in the present or in the future, to once again be dragged into a conflict as in the past.
By building a strong economy and an efficient law enforcement system, we can create a safer Sri Lanka that has the right resources to protect all our people. This is what drives this UNP led government and this is our passion and the core commitment.
