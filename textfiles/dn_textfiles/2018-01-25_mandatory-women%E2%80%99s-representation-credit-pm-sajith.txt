Mandatory women’s representation a credit to PM - Sajith

At a time when other party leaders were unconcerned about giving pride of place to women in society, Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe had taken measures to ensure mandatory women’s representation in Pradeshiya Sabhas, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He was addressing a meeting of the UNP Tissamaharama central organisation held near the Tissamaharama bus stand premises. Nearly 8,000 women members of the Eksath Lak Vanitha Peramuna were present at the meeting.
Minister Premadasa who predicted a certain UNP victory at the Tissamaharama Pradeshiya Sabha election, said that after setting up a UNP administration they would announce a special women’s Hambantota district which would be fully implemented without paying mere lip service for the welfare of women in the district.
He said vast crowds which got stranded without gaining any progress after following other political parties and individuals in the past had now flocked behind the UNP to ensure a convincing victory for the party.
The Minister said Tissamaharama today was witnessing giant strides in development. People were being given land allotments and title deeds to their lands.
New Udagama housing schemes were springing up in all parts of the electorate. Youth were being offered respectable state jobs. A new UNP controlled Pradeshiya Sabha would organise free tuition classes for needy students. Minister Premadasa said certain sections of the opposition were engaged in bankrupt politics by resorting to character assassination.
Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said Minister Premadasa is such an efficient and demanding Minister that one had to be on one’s toes 24 hours a day when working with him.
The village and the country would attain quick development if they followed his strategy. He had had rendered a colossal amount of work for the welfare of people even when he was an opposition Parliamentarian, Minister Fernando said.
He said to people who question them as to whether they were happy about the ‘Yahapalanaya’ government, he would say they were extremely happy about ensuring the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena They were happy about the law and order situation. People were free to point out any shortcomings in the system so that they could correct them.
Citing an example, he said President Sirisena’s brother was involved in a motor accident where the victim succumbed to his injuries. The President’s brother had to languish in remand custody for 14 days. Thereafter he was produced in court and released on bail. The President never personally intervened on behalf of his brother. This was the essence of ‘Yahapalanaya’. Could people witness such non-interference in the country’s legal system during the Rajapaksa regime?, he asked.
