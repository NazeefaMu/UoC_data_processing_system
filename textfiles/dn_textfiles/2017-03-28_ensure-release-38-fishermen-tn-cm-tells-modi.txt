Ensure release of 38 fishermen, TN CM tells Modi

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palanisami on Sunday asked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure the release of 38 fishermen from Tamil Nadu arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy.
The number of fishermen includes 12 picked up on Sunday after they set sail from Jegathapattinam and Kottaipattinam fishing bases in Pudukkottai district, according to Deccan Chronicle. “It is unfortunate that these incidents have taken place at a time when our fishermen are hopeful that a pragmatic and permanent solution to this issue would emerge as was discussed at the meeting with Swaraj,” Palanisami said in the letter.
"The “recent” act of the Sri Lankan Navy again creates anxiety and unrest in the minds of our fishermen and vitiates the atmosphere of hope which was generated as a result of these meetings," the CM said, asking the PM to send “a firm, clear, unequivocal and unambiguous message” to ensure that these apprehensions are stopped.
“I reiterate that the issue of apprehension of our fishermen and release of their boats be taken up at the highest diplomatic level and the Government of India take necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of our fishermen,” the CM said. - Deccan Chronicle
