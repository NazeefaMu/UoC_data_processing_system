Wadduwa Central girls excel in cricket

Wadduwa Central College, in the Kalutara Education Zone, has made remarkable progress in the cricketing and athletic spheres.
The school has been popular due to a number of sporting records at Zonal, district, provincial and national level tournament matches and big matches.
Dhanushka Ranmuthu, the senior cricket coach of the school, with the co-operation of D. Kenneth, has dedicated much of his time and strength in producing a girls cricket team. Within a very short period of less than 6 months, Dhansuhka was able to produce a very talented and hard working girls cricket team for the first time in the history of Wadduwa Central.
They won their first ever tournament cricket match played against the Bolossagama MV team played at the Wadduwa Central College Playground. Dhanushka says, its very difficult to establish a hard ball team and there are only three schools having girls leather ball cricket teams in the Kalutara Zone up to now.
Bolossagama MV, Mahanama MV, Panadura and Wadduwa Central College are the only three schools where girls hard ball cricket is played, according to cricketing reports.
Dhanuska Ranmuthu, who was also a former head prefect of his Alma Mater Wadduwa Central College has a genuine love for this cricket team. He usually gets his boys and girls to practice after school hours at least three days a week, the Master in-charge of sports and cricket at Wadduwa Central, D. Kenneth told ‘Daily News’ recently.
Dhanushka Ranmuthu highly appreciates the co-operation extended by the principal of Wadduwa Central S.D.N. Gunarathne.
