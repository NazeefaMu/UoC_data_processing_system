Due to non charging of overweight baggage fees:
SriLankan Airlines deprived of Rs. 7.7 Mn

SriLankan Airlines had been deprived of an income of Rs 7.7 million due to non-charge of fees for over weighed baggage during the tenure of former Sri Lankan Airlines Chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe, it was revealed before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry yesterday.
The relevant fees for additional weight had not been charged due to a relief granted by the Chairman’s Office.
It was also revealed that billions of rupees had been spent on the Chairman’s office from 2008-2014. Rs 50 million had been spent on foreign travel and allowances of employees attached to the Chairman’s office.
These were revealed when the Commission recorded evidence from Sri Lankan Airlines Company Secretary Dalrene Thirukumar.
