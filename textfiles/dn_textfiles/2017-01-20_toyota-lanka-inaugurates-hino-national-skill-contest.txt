Toyota Lanka inaugurates HINO national skill contest

Toyota Lanka being the national dealer distributor for Toyota and HINO brands in Sri Lanka and a member of Toyota Group Japan inaugurated the first-ever HINO National Skill Contest 2016 (National Skill Grand Prix) recently.
The primary objective of the HINO National Skill Contest is to diagnose, develop and sharpen the skills of technicians at all levels to increase the output productivity and improve the customer quality delivery for HINO at all customer service touch points.
Being a one-full day exercise, the HINO National Contest assessed the task orientation, timing of performing technical tasks, service management skills, maintaining repair standards and service delivery time. These were measured by an expert panel of judges under the supervision of Hino Motors Limited Japan who were invited specially to grace and witness this remarkable event.
General Manager (Service) MatheeshaSamaranayake commented that “With the rapid expansions in the country it is critical that the infrastructure development too expands which in turn will help to transport people and goods from place to place. These expansions boost a huge demand for industrial and heavy vehicles, and also for skilled technicians for service repairs. The Toyota-backed Hino presence in Sri Lanka is therefore very important at this stage.”
Hino Service Assistant Manager and Service in Charge concerned, Nuwan De Silva stressed, “The HINO truck brand launched in 2009, and gained a sharp increase in a short period of timecreating a new level of customer transport mobility solution. In this sense, Toyota Lanka is fully geared to provide total transport solutions with total after sales support. In order to cater to the high anticipations in service maintenance Toyota Lanka has also a dedicated Hino infrastructure with the new upcoming 3S facility (Sales, Services, and Spare-parts).”
The winner of the National Skill Contest was Dinidu Buddhika Peiris and Amila Nuwan Karunanayake was placed second. The winners were not only provided a stage to demonstrate skills and competencies, but offeredwith a globally recognized certification from HML. Winners will be sent to Japan for the Global HINO Award Ceremony held in the grandest stage.
