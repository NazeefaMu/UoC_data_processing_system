Countrywide Emergency Response Team soon: IGP

A ceremony to mark the 152nd anniversary of the Sri Lanka Police Department, was held at Police Park, Bambalapitiya, yesterday.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe participated as the chief guest.
Public Administration, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara and Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara were also present.
A special feature of the event was the parade showcasing various units of the Police Department.
Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara said that an Emergency Response Team (ERT) with specialised training, equipment, tactics and strategies, would soon be established at every police station to address any emergency.
The IGP said the ERT would be in operation 24/7. He said that officers had already been selected for the first 25 Emergency Responsive Teams, and that they were receiving special training.
The IGP said they would receive training similar to that of Special Task Force officers. Jayasundara also said that another special division under the purview of a Deputy Inspector General, would soon be established with regard to road accidents and traffic. Highlighting Community Policing, he said that members of Civil Security Committees (CSC) would be provided with special identity documents, adding that CSC members who showed exceptional commitment to the service would be appointed All Island Justices of Peace.
He said that the total estimation of the expenses by the Police for services including welfare, education, religious, health, sports, and community services, exceeded Rs.1.35 billion from 2016 to 2018.
“Rs.446 million had been spent to build and repair 368 houses as part of a community service initiated by the police,” the IGP said.
