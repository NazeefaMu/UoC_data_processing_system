Warrior withered, legend never will

Sri Lanka faced its darkest period in the annals of contemporary history with the escalation of the relentless attacks by Tamil Tigers. During this period, a gallant warrior came to the fore to take the bull by the horns. He was Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne who was affectionately referred to as ‘Jungle Wimale’ or ‘Kela Kumaraya’ during his early days in the army. Later he became known as Prince of Gajaba or Father of the Gajaba Regiment.
Sri Lanka Army named the new infantry battalion formed in Anuradhapura after the legendary Sinhala Monarch Gajabahu who invaded Chola Kingdom. Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne used to narrate the historical background and the Regimental insignia which carries the famous Keteriya of the grand Sinhala King Gajabahu I with pride and affection. He would not have fathomed that he too will join the clan of legends in the modern military history.
My first encounter with him was a family vacation at Diyathalawa in the mid-70s when I accompanied my mother who was his lovable female cousin, Padma Akka. He and his wife, Manel, received us with much love and made us feel comfortable in their cosy bungalow in front of Polo Grounds at the Diyathalawa Army Cantonment. He was the guiding star in my early life after my father’s untimely death in 1979. While involved in his busy army life Viji mama had time to listen to us and offer guidance.
Gajaba Regiment
He was gradually promoted to higher ranks and raised the formidable Gajaba Regiment to the status it enjoys today. It played a pivotal role during the first three Eelam wars albeit limited in hardware at the time. Determination, courage and the astute leadership at the battlefront were his forte. He was not discouraged by the failures of the establishment to place him on proper seniority.
General (Rtd) Gerry de Silva writes in his book War Heroes Killed-In-Action:
“Vijaya must have felt that the Army was unkind to him…” In reference to a mistake done in 1962 about the seniority of this ‘Soldier’s General’ who was appointed as the appointed Battalion Cadet Adjutant in his final term Battalion an under officer in the prestigious Indian Military Academy – Dehradun during his training period. Indeed a major achievement for a non-Indian Cadet Officer.”
I had the opportunity to meet this gallant soldier between August 4-5, 1992, a few days before his untimely death (it was the last time); when he hurriedly came to Colombo on a Siamachetti fighter aircraft piloted by the late Squadron Leader Shirantha Gunathilake to attend an emergency meeting at Army HQ; later I got to know that this hurried visit to Colombo was with regard to the major offensive he planned with late Lt. General Denzil Kobbekaduwa to gain control of a part of Jaffna from LTTE. He was in a somewhat of a distraught mood due to the then army hierarchy not permitting to proceed with the planned operation and failure to appreciate his patriotic commitment; specially that he volunteered to take up the appointment of the Commander Security Forces of Jaffna; whilst he was selected to follow prestigious National Defence College – India programme which was considered the most important Military Degree to take up the highest command appointments including the post of Army Commander.
General Hamilton Wanasinghe commended his role in Operation Balavegaya (August 6, 1991) and made special emphasis on the fact that then Brig. Wimalaratne’s ‘decision to stay behind and fight the separatist terrorists instead of availing yourself of the NDC course is indeed commendable gesture and no measure appreciate very much.”
Officer par excellence
Viji mama was not unfettered by being placed in the incorrect place in terms of seniority. On the contrary, he was fully committed to task bestowed on him and had the highest amount of zeal and resolve to take up the challenge of finishing the war, which by then had dragged for over a decade. He proved beyond doubt that sheer commitment, continuous training, honesty and integrity will open the path for an officer par excellence.
He had sterling qualities of a military leader. This has been noted by his fellow officers and subordinates (including some who took part in the final battle against LTTE -Humanitarian Operation) in numerous books and articles. It needs no repetition.
His knowledge of the Sri Lanka’s history, as well as the military, was profound. He took time off of his busy schedule to place on record the heroic achievements of his subordinates. This exercise could produce a star-studded galaxy of battle-hardened warriors from the Gajaba Regiment, which he commanded in its formative career days until his untimely death.
Amidst his busy and demanding career; he was in touch with all members of the family. He used to entertain the gatherings by singing songs like Yaman Bando Vesak Balanna and Bola Bola Meti Gedarata Genenawa Guwan Yanayak Wage depicting the humorous and jovial facet of this much-loved warrior general.
Asiaweek correspondent John Colmey in the August 1992 issue identifies Wimalaratne, 51, as a legend in the Sri Lankan Army (Asiaweek - Volume 18, Issues 27-51 - Page 492). The legend never had the opportunity to read this article owing to his untimely death on August 8, 1992. Maj. General Vijaya Wimalaratne left a legacy which is still remembered with pride by fellow warriors and Sri Lankans and indelibly stamped in the annals of military history of our isle.
Nishsnathi and Hiran lost their much-adored father during their youth. But keeping true to his wishes, both selected medical profession. Dr Hiran Wimalaratne serves in the Army Medical Corps following his father’s footsteps while Dr Nishanthi Wimalaratne serves in the Cardio Unit of the General Hospital Colombo.
