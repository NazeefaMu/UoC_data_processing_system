I took decisions on behalf of motherland - President

President Maithripala Sirisena said the statement he made that he would not appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister even if all 225 Members of Parliament should present a signed request was his political opinion. “I still stand by that statement, but as a leader who respects Parliamentary traditions and democracy, I offered him that post,” he said.
The President was speaking to United National Front Parliamentarians after Ranil Wickremesinghe took oaths before him as the Prime Minister, at the Presidential Secretariat, on Sunday.
Reminding the Parliamentarians that according to the Constitution, neither did Parliament or the Judiciary have the power to name a Prime Minister, the President said since a majority of Parliamentarians had expressed the view that Ranil Wickremesinghe should be given the Premiership after casting 117 votes in his favour, he agreed with that view because he was a virtuous leader who respected Parliamentary tradition.
The President said he took steps to dissolve Parliament, prorogue Parliament, and appoint a new Prime Minister, not at his whims, but after consulting legal experts. Those decisions were taken with good intentions putting the country’s interest first.
He said he had not the slightest intention of breaching the Constitution.
The President said he believed the best solution to the unrest was holding a general election, the reason being that more than the opinion of 122 Members of Parliament, the opinion of 15.5 million voters was decisive, for it will demonstrate the sovereignty of the people, acceptable to the world. “I issued the gazette notification to hand over power to the nation.”
“Although the setting up of an Independent Commissions was a good aspect of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the other aspect was a political controversy.”
The President criticised the government for the way it acted for three-and-a-half years, indefinitely postponing the enactment of the Bribery Commission Act which aimed to penalise the accused in the Central Bank bond issue and to recover the money lost by it.
He said failing to apportion ministries on a scientific basis as stated in the election manifesto, failing to implement the recommendation of the Presidential Commission which investigated the Central Bank bond issue, losing the confidence of the Bhikkhu Society, and the imprisonment of war heroes were the other issues of concern that he had objected to.
These factors influenced my recent decisions, he explained.
“Whatever people say, I took my decisions in the interests of the public.”
Referring to the threats made by certain people to impeach him in Parliament, the President said even if he was sent to prison, the decisions taken by him putting the country before self would be written in the country’s history books as such, like an inscription on a rock. “If no one writes it, I will write it,” he said.
Referring to the threats about dragging and killing him like Gaddafi, the President said threats of that nature had never been made against any of the country’s previous leaders. This was because people knew the fate that would have followed them if they vocalised such threats under those rulers.
President Sirisena said he was fated to confront such threats because such was the freedom and democracy that has seen the light of day under his office.
“I intend to continue administrative function of the government without any clashes because clashes would retard the country’s development,” the President said.
President Sirisena said a political movement that is against fraud and corruption is needed in the country to rebuild its economy.
The yahapalana political concept which was breached could be resuscitated only through a political movement that is patriotic and that promotes our cultural and social values, the President said.
