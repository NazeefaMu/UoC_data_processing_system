Arrest of LankaEnews website Editor: Working Journalists Assn. wants probe on magistrate’s decision

Members of the Sri Lanka Working Journalists Association in a statement issued yesterday, requested the Chief Justice and the Judicial Service Commission to conduct an impartial investigation into the decision taken by Gampaha Magistrate Kavindra Nanayakkara to issue a warrant through Interpol for the arrest of the Editor of the LankaEnews website in the first instance without issuing summons on him to appear in court in connection with a news report published in his website.
The statement signed by Association president Lasantha Ruhunage said the charge against the LankaEnews Editor was that he published a photograph of a suspect in the Upul Tennakkon assault case in his website before an identification parade was held regarding the case in the Gampaha Magistrate's Court.
The statement said the Interpol warrant had been issued without a request from the CID which is investigating this assault and attempted abduction case.
