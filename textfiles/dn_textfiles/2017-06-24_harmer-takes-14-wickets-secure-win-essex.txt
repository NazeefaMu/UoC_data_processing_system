Harmer takes 14 wickets to secure win for Essex

LONDON, Thursday - South Africa Test spinner Simon Harmer claimed a career-best 14 wickets in the match as County Championship leaders Essex dealt bottom club Warwickshire a fourth innings defeat of the season.
Resuming on their overnight score of 27-2, the Bears added 20 runs before six wickets went down for 35 before lunch, five of them to Harmer. After a delayed lunch, he took the last two to end with 8-36, also a best. Warwickshire were bowled out for 94 to lose by an innings and 164 runs.
Harmer's 14-128 was Essex's best bowling figures in a match since Mark Ilott took 14-105 against Northamptonshire at Wardown Park, Luton in 1995.
Essex, chasing their first Championship title since 1992, extended their Division One lead to 14 points with their fourth win of the season. And they will be boosted by the addition of Pakistan international Mohammad Amir for their next game - the day-night fixture against champions Middlesex, which starts on Monday.
Durham secured their first Championship win of the season by beating Glamorgan by nine wickets at Chester-Le-Street.
Four wickets from Barry McCarthy helped the hosts dismiss Glamorgan for 263 in their second innings to give Durham a target of 158 to win. Opening batsman Stephen Cook scored an unbeaten 89 from 78 balls to guide them to victory.
It was Durham's first win since the county were relegated from Division One and handed a 48-point penalty by the England and Wales Cricket Board in October 2016.
Joe Clarke hit his second century of the match and Daryl Mitchell also made a hundred as Worcestershire pulled off the third biggest run chase in their history to beat Kent at New Road.
Mitchell made 142, his fourth century in five Championship matches, while Clarke was unbeaten on 110 as the hosts reached 401-6 to win by four wickets.
Kent spinner Yasir Shah (5-132) caused a wobble with four quick wickets. But Ross Whiteley (29) plundered vital late runs to see his side home.
England seamer James Anderson, who took 3-5 on the third evening, finished with figures of 4-20 as the Red Rose skittled Hampshire for 168 on day four.
The visitors had resumed on 50-5, still trailing by 148, and were unable to make Lancashire bat again.
Dane Vilas' 244 had put the home team in control earlier in the match.

McLaren also chipped in with centuries to give Lancashire a big first-innings lead, but it was their impressive bowling display in Hampshire's second innings that ensured victory.
England's all-time leading wicket-taker Anderson was playing in his first match after a month out through injury, with his country's first Test of the summer against South Africa starting on 6 July.
