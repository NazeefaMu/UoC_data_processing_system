The Inaugural Conference of Sri Lanka Health Qigong Association (SLHQA) and the first training program of Chinese Health Qigong were held successfully at the Opulent River Face Hotel in Rajagiriya recently. SLHQA was formed in 2009 and is the only official representative affiliated to the International Health Qigong Federation (IHQF) in China.
During past six years SLHQA has been involved in various activities such as international Qigong promotional conferences, competitions and trainings with the collaboration of IHQF. As a result of utmost efforts SLHQA has succeeded in winning three gold medals and a silver medal at the second International Health Qigong Competition which was held from September 12 to 14 in Bozhou, China last year.
