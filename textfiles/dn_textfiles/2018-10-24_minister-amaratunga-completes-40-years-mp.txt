Minister Amaratunga completes 40 years as MP

Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga completed 40 years of service as a Member of Parliament on October 19.
Minister Amaratunga had his secondary education at De Mazenod College in Kandana and at St. Joseph’s College, Colombo. He later entered Law College and passed out as an Attorney-at-Law in July 1966. Minister Amaratunga, who had a successful legal practice in Negombo, cut his teeth in politics as a youth joining the United National Party. Amaratunga is also a Notary Public, Justice of the Peace and Unofficial Magistrate (JPUM).
He was the first parliamentarian to be appointed to the Assembly without an election under the provisions of the 1978 Constitution. He was appointed a Member of Parliament for the Wattala electorate to fill the vacancy created by the demise of then Posts and Telecommunications Minister Shelton Jayasinghe.
He has held many positions in his career spanning over 50 years as a UNP member.
A special felicitation ceremony will be held on October 28 at the BMICH at 4pm to mark Minister John Amaratunga’s 40th anniversary of service as a Member of Parliament under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
