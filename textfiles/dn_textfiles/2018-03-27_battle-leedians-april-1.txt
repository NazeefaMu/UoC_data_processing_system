The inaugural Inter-Leeds, one day cricket big match between Leedians of the Western Province and the Leedians of the Southern Province, will be held on 01st April at 9.00 a.m, at the Bandaragama New Sports Complex Ground.
This historic sporting event of the Leeds School Network is scheduled to be graced by island’s prominent cricketers the Director Board, Heads of Leeds Schools and many other dignitaries.
Inter-Leeds Cricket Big Match is an exciting cricketing experience organized to encourage and promote the cricketing talents of the Leedians, who were in action at the recently held All-Island Schools Cricket Tournaments and at the Inter-International Schools Cricket Tournaments.
The Leeds Schools hope this platform would be a great opportunity for the Leedians to gain the Big Match experience and are certain that, with the interest shown this year, this initiative will continue to grow from strength to strength in the coming years.
