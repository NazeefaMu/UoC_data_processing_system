LAUGFS Eco Sri launches ‘YOU’ in Celebration  of International Women’s Day

In view of International Women’s Day 2017 the programme “YOU” was organized by LAUGFS Eco Sri, in recognition of the contribution made by female staff in the organization.
With the launch of this programme, the company demonstrated its continued commitment towards gender equality as well as recognition and appreciation of diversity within the workplace. The theme of “YOU” 2017 was “Empower your inner soul” which encourages women to develop their strength, character and capability that supports an empowered status in society.
These female employees play a pivotal role in day to day operations, supporting the technical team in the process of vehicle emission testing which is a nation-wide air quality management programme run in joint collaboration with the government and appointed testing entities.
Majority of Eco Sri female employees are therefore located at direct contact points of the customer. Meanwhile, those at the Head Office handle back office operations, and provide their unwavering support to the company’s growth and success.
The programme “YOU” was organized with the intention of empowering these employees so that they would be able to withstand the challenges that they encounter at work as well as in their personal lives.
The program also presented the opportunity to appreciate the continuous dedication and contribution these employees make towards a cleaner, safer and greener tomorrow with LAUGFS Eco Sri. The full day programme was held at the Wisdom auditorium of LAUGFS Head Office recently with the sponsorships of Johnson & Johnson, Forever, Hemas Hospitals, LAUGFS Lfinity and Frank Constructions.
Highlights of the programme included a motivational speech by Jayanthi Kuru –Utumpala, the first Sri Lankan to summit Mt. Everest and a grooming session by Beautician Achini Jayasinghe.
Actor Kavinga Perera kept the audience entertained with a fun filled interactive session which was followed by an awareness session on health and hygiene that also included a spot screening for breast cancer and certain other tests.
LAUGFS Eco Sri pioneered air quality management in Sri Lanka and opened the country’s first emission testing centre in Gampaha.
