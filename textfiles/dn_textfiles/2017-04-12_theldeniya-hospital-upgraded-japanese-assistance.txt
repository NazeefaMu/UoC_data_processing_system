Theldeniya Hospital upgraded with Japanese Assistance

The Japanese assisted Theldeniya Base Hospital was opened under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Japan Embassy Charge d ’Affaires ad interim Koji Yagi at Theldeniya on April 11. The Government of Japan provided 3,935 million Japanese Yen (approximately LKR. 5,232 million) through JICA under the project “Improvement of Basic Social Services Targeting Emerging Regions”.
The project aims to provide four secondary hospitals in Sri Lanka with facilities and necessary equipment to detect, treat and prevent non-communicable diseases.
The Kaluwanchikudi Base Hospital and the Warakapola Base Hospital were refurbished and vested to public recently under this project and the Theldeniya Base Hospital was the third.
The latter was revamped with a five-storey building comprising the Operation Theatre Complex, Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), Judicial Medical Office Unit and equipped with the latest Bio Medical equipment to ensure quality healthcare to the community of the Central Province.
