MLH CELEBRATES WORLD CHOCOLATE DAY

World Chocolate Day was celebrated at Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) recently. MLH presented an all- you- can - eat buffet coated in chocolate giving the opportunity for chocoholics to try out a range of dishes. The buffet included flavoures from Sri Lankan spiced chocolates to all time favourites and chocolates for the heart.
From chocolate fountains to shawarma’s and pizzas; to eggless and sugar-free chocolates; it was indeed a treat to indulge.
