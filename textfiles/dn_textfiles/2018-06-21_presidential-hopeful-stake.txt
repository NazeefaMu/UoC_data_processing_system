Presidential hopeful at stake

The fractious nature of party politics came to the fore last week as the two rival factions of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) engaged in a tussle to gain political advantage in view of the upcoming presidential and general elections in 2020.
The catalyst for this appears to have come from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and its political strategist, Basil Rajapaksa, former Minister of Economic Affairs in the Mahinda Rajapaksa government and younger brother of the former President.
Buoyed by the SLPP’s strong showing at the local government elections in February, the SLPP is now laying down conditions to the SLFP even though it is the breakaway faction of the mainstream party. This has produced mixed reactions from SLFP parliamentarians still loyal to President Maithripala Sirisena.
This situation has come about following the fallout of the motion of no confidence moved by the Joint Opposition (JO) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in April. The motion was comfortably defeated but in its aftermath, the United National Party (UNP) insisted that it was no longer tenable for those ministers who voted for the motion to remain in a government where Wickremesinghe was Prime Minister.
Thereafter sixteen SLFP ministers, state ministers and deputy ministers as well as Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala resigned from their positions and sat with the opposition. However, in doing so, they made it clear that they were not aligning themselves with the ‘Joint Opposition’ group in Parliament but would function as an independent group.
This stance is now irking the hierarchy of the SLPP, which is the default political party the JO parliamentarians will revert to at the next national elections in the event they are unable to reconcile with the mainstream SLFP by then.
The SLPP, Basil Rajapaksa in particular, is insisting that the ‘group of sixteen’ should take a decision about their political future. The SLPP has indicated that, if the group is unable to reach a unanimous decision, it would be able to accommodate parliamentarians in the SLPP on an individual basis. This is obviously an incentive for those who are in the ‘group of sixteen’ to cross over to the SLPP.
Fate of the ‘Group 16’
Basil Rajapaksa has also stated that the ‘group of sixteen’ will not be welcome in the SLPP as long as they remain members of the SLFP. He is insisting that they should leave the SLFP and obtain membership of the SLPP, a sacrifice which at least some in the group are reluctant to make.
This has placed those in the ‘group of sixteen’ in an unenviable position. They have already lost their ministerial perks and privileges. However, most of them feel a sense of loyalty to President Sirisena and do not wish to defy him by joining a camp that is opposed to his leadership.
On the other hand, many in the group, especially those in the more contentious electoral districts, are aware that their chances of re-election could possibly be enhanced if they ran on a SLPP ticket rather than a SLFP list. For this reason, they would prefer to throw in their lot with the SLPP but they fear they will anger and disappoint the President by doing so.
Others in the SLFP who still remain with President want the President to rally the SLFP which is still the parent party with an established history and go it alone at the elections. In this group are Minister Duminda Dissanayake who was recently appointed as national organiser of the party as well as Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera, Sarath Amunugama and Mahinda Samarasinghe.
There are other concerns as well. Among the ‘group of sixteen’ are several seniors, including former General Secretaries of the SLFP S. B. Dissanayake and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, former General Secretary of the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Susil Premajayantha and senior party stalwart John Seneviratne.
At least some of them are of the opinion that if they were to defect to the SLPP, they would not be accorded the same seniority and respect that they enjoy in the SLFP. This is because, firstly, they would be considered as ‘late entrants’ to the party and secondly, because the SLPP is under the firm control of the Rajapaksa family, an issue they also encountered in the SLFP when Mahinda Rajapaksa was President.
This conundrum has not been helped by public pronouncements by the likes of S. B. Dissanayake who have floated the suggestion that their objective is to have President Sirisena run as the SLFP’s presidential candidate in 2020, so that after his victory, he could appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as his Prime Minister.
Others in the party query whether their remarks have been sanctioned by President Sirisena who, it will be recalled, was quite categorical in the run up to the 2015 general election that he would not be appointing Rajapaksa as his Prime Minister even if the SLFP won the election.
There has been a consistent war of words between those who still remain within the government, those in the ‘group of sixteen’ and those in the JO. These verbal interactions, although they could be considered pre-election rhetoric, have been far from cordial and have not helped the cause of unifying the SLFP. For all these reasons, there is much ambivalence and differences of opinion about the SLFP aligning with the SLPP.
2020 presidential poll
The ‘group of sixteen’ did meet with President Sirisena last week to discuss these issues and the message they received was that the President wanted them to take decisions as a single entity, instead of individual parliamentarians making their own ad-hoc decisions.
If these were the issues irking the mainstream SLFP, the SLPP also had its share of anxious moments last week. That came in the form of controversy over former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who is being touted as a potential presidential candidate for the party at the 2020 presidential poll.
That was after it was reported that outgoing United States Ambassador Atul Keshap, who made a courtesy call on Mahinda Rajapaksa was reported to have indicated that the United States would not support the prospect of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa becoming President of the country.
Despite the United States being among the most powerful nations in the world, these sentiments would have amounted to little if not for the fact that the younger Rajapaksa is in fact a citizen of the United States and, under the 19th amendment to Constitution introduced by this government, dual citizens are now prohibited from seeking high political office in Sri Lanka.
That would mean that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa would have to renounce his United States citizenship if he were to run for President and questions remain whether it is simply an ‘over the counter’ process which he could do at will or whether the United States government could potentially place stumbling blocks in his path.
That is what the UNP would be hoping for and that is what the speculation was all about. The SLPP has not been helped by the fact that both the United States Embassy and the former President’s office failed to issue a categorical denial that ruled out the possibility of such a discussion taking place.
The next national elections are many months away but the shadow boxing between the major political camps has already begun. Unless an agreement is reached soon between the different camps loyal to President Sirisena and former President Rajapaksa, it is clear that the SLFP voter will be faced with a dilemma at the next election: should it opt for the official party or should it go with the rebels who have dared to defy a sitting President? It is a question most SLFPers hope they wouldn’t have to contend with, come 2020.
