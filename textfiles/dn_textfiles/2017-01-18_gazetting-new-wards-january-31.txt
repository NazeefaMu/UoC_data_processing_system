Gazetting of new wards by January 31

The gazetting of new wards will be done by January 31, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said as he finally accepted the report on delimitation yesterday. Elections however may not be held any time soon.
“The last time they submitted the report they only had the signatures of three of the five committee members. Hence, I refused to accept it and when I sort advice from the Attorney General on the subject, he said it was better to have the signatures of all five and for those who object, to give it in writing,”explained the minister addressing a media briefing at the Ministry along with Chairman of the Delimitation Committee, Asoka Peiris.
The final member to sign, UNP member A.S.M. Misbah had signed the report last morning along with a footnote.
“The footnote does not impact the report greatly. He simply states that there were those who brought other concerns before the committee which did not come within our mandate. For example, requests such as to turn an urban council into a municipal one,” Peiris said.
Peiris has also requested time until the end of the month to finish off the final administrative work on the report, “We need to correct any type errors in the report and then we can gazette it,” Mustapha said.
The Elections Commissioner in the meantime has informed the government that around 54 areas in the Local Government Elections Act would need to be amended before an election is held. Amendments thereafter would have to go through the Legal Draftsman, Cabinet and then garner Parliamentary approval in order to come into effect.
Minister Mustapha insisted that the ministry would do the needful to bring in the amendments to the Act as soon as possible.
Once the wards are gazetted however, the Elections Commission by law has a minimum of 55-72 days to hold an election and thus as stated by the Commissioner himself, elections are not to be expected before May.
The minister in the meantime was confident that all ‘progressive’ parties would support the amendments and added, “The Prime Minister has promised all minor parties that the government
would not allow for any injustice in the delimitation process and that all concerns would be addressed. But, he has insisted that we would stick with the mixed system as that was the mandate the government received by the people when elected to power”.
