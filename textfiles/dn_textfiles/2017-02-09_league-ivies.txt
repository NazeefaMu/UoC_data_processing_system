In league with the ivies

Nilakshi Parndigamage
Nilakshi Parndigamage’s story is one of success – a dream realized. Strong-willed and determined, she showed signs of promise very early on in her life and subsequently attended Yale. She was recently appointed the Dean of Ezra Stiles, one of the undergraduate colleges of Yale University. Outstanding Personalities features Nilakshi Parndigamage, who is certainly living up to her potential.
Q. Your entire education in Sri Lanka was at Visakha Vidyalaya, where you were also appointed the Head Prefect in 2000. How do you think your time at Visakha helped you later in your higher studies and in your career?
A. I received a world-class education at Visakha. I say “world class” without any hesitation because it is Visakha that prepared me for my academic and professional careers. In addition to the academic aspect, the school also taught me that it is the most natural thing in the world to befriend, love, respect, and work with those who were different to me; treating everyone with compassion and respect. Perhaps it was the influence of Buddhism because we were reminded daily that we needed to be mindful of our thoughts, words, and actions because they ultimately have the power to affect others and the world around us. I am deeply indebted to some of my teachers, who had a knack for keeping me grounded and teaching the importance of humility. I know that what I gained from the school has shaped who I am and continues to influence decisions I make on a daily basis.
Q. Yale is one of the highest ranked and most competitive universities in the world. You attended Yale on a full scholarship and were a student leader on campus who was very involved in several student organizations. Can you describe some of your activities while you were a student?
On her wedding day
A. I have been very fortunate to have been influenced by wise and caring teachers, professors, mentors, and bosses. I was a member and later the President of the Center for Buddhist Life at Yale. The university had a considerable population that identified themselves as Buddhists. I met a lot of people from around the US and the world. Some had a formal education in Buddhism and others were more focused on practicing the Dhamma. It was a wonderful group. In the aftermath of the tsunami, we organized an overnight pirith ceremony - the first of its kind at a Yale - bringing in monks from various countries who were based in the US to chant overnight. Members of the Yale community from all over the world gathered in solidarity at the pirith ceremony. It was tough to be so far from home during that time, but it was remarkable to witness that pouring of love and support.
Q. Can you speak a bit about your academic interests while at Yale?
A. I majored in Political Science and wrote my thesis on the difficulty of prosecuting sexual violence perpetrators in international war crimes tribunals. During my four years at Yale, I chose to study a lot about the rise of nationalism in various countries such as Germany, the former Yugoslavia, and Rwanda, and explored the mechanisms adopted by various post-war countries in reconciling the horrors of civil war. I was awarded a fellowship to work at the Yugoslavia War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague for a summer, which was a fascinating work experience. The tribunal was prosecuting those who carried out wartime rape, and I was interested in studying how difficult it is to prove wartime sexual violence in a court of law. That led me to my thesis topic. I went back to work at the tribunal after I graduated from Yale.
Q. Why the fascination with civil wars?
A. I honestly did not know how to not study the topic. Having grown up in Sri Lanka and having experienced the war second-hand as a Colombo-resident, I was used to the single narrative of why the war came about and how we should not question history as it was written down in our text books. After I arrived at Yale, I had the option of really digging deep and studying about other countries that had similar civil war narratives. I realized just how similar and flawed all our narratives were.
Q. You have won many awards while representing Sri Lanka at various public speaking contests around the world, and also after you moved to the US. At your Yale graduation, you were one of three students from the entire university who was awarded the David Everett Chantler Award for “exemplifying the qualities of courage, strength of character and high moral purpose.” What was this award about and how did you feel upon receiving it?
A. I had done a lot of academic work on human rights and civil wars, had worked at the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal as a student, and had done a lot of work with the homeless population in New Haven and with the Buddhist Center. I believe it was in recognition of all that engagement.
Q. After your time at Yale and in The Hague, you pursued a career in law and ended up in Baghdad and later in a high-level corporate law firm in New York and Washington, D.C. Can you describe some of those experiences?
A. I attended the University of Virginia School of Law which is located in Charlottesville, Virginia where I obtained my juris doctor degree. I did human rights advocacy work while in law school and worked at the International Center for Transitional Justice in South Africa for a summer. After law school, I worked for an organization based in Washington D.C., where I helped advise Iraqi parliamentarians on how to re-draft some of their legal codes to better protect religious minorities.

This was at a time in Iraq’s recent history when the violence was relatively low, and there was genuine interest and hope expressed by Iraqi lawmakers who wanted a set of legal codes that would better adhere to their international treaty obligations. I worked there for a year before joining an international corporate litigation firm in New York. I worked at the firm for almost five years, first in their office in New York City and then in Washington, D.C., specializing in complex commercial litigation involving big U.S. and multi-national companies. It was very different from my previous work in the human rights field, but I did pro bono work to keep my sanity!
Q. You now serve as the Dean of Ezra Stiles College at Yale University where you preside over a college of 500 Yale undergraduate students. What does your job entail?
A. I am thrilled to be back at Yale. I loved the inclusiveness and intellectual curiosity that was pervasive at Yale when I was a student, and I am happy to say not much has changed since then. Ezra Stiles is one of the twelve undergraduate colleges at Yale, and I serve primarily as the main academic adviser to Stilesians who study various subjects in the sciences, arts, and humanities. I love my job because, in addition to advising students on their studies, I also get to counsel them through whatever challenges they undergo during their four years at Yale. In addition to my duties as the Dean, I will be teaching a class in the Political Science Department at Yale next year. My days are busy but never the same, and I like the unpredictability that comes with the job. I am fortunate to live with my family in the Dean’s residence inside Ezra Stiles College. We enjoy being a part of a very diverse community, and I especially appreciate getting to work with thoughtful and smart students.
Q. How do you stay connected to Sri Lanka?
A. My heart and soul will always be Sri Lankan. My parents, extended family, and best friends still live in Colombo, and I don’t think I go half a day without talking to some of them. I get involved in various social justice projects from time to time, which keeps me connected to those who are not family or friends in SL. I have been fortunate to have returned home to Sri Lanka every year since I first left in 2002, and I hope to continue that tradition even though it gets a bit tougher once your family starts growing.
My son Gihan is bi-lingual and loves eating rice, parippu, and pappadam. While his childhood is definitely different to the one I had, he still benefits from some important aspects of having a Sri Lankan parent (like getting to eat a lot of Lankan food at home!). I do not need to make a special effort to stay connected to SL – thankfully, it’s a natural extension of who I am.
