We do not oppose giving lands to Chinese companies

A group of Buddhist monks holding a press conference at the Hambantota District Secretariat yesterday said they would not oppose the government’s moves to provide lands to Chinese companies to set an industrial zone.
They said the youths in the province will receive employments and the country will receive dividends of the development through this move.
A group participated in the press conference obstructed the Buddhist monks by shouting various slogans. They said Buddhist monks are betraying the heritage and lands to a Chinese company.
Beliatta Shasanrakshaka Balamandalaya Secretary Ven. Muruthawela Kassapa Thera said Minister Mahinda Amaraweera Sajith Premadasa, and Deputy Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi have assured them that no land of the Hambantota people would be acquired.
“The Hambantota harbour and the Mattala airport were constructed to develop the region. Those opposing the development of Hambantota have petty political agenda in mind,” the Thera said .
He said the United National Party never opposed constructing a harbor and an airport in the South.
