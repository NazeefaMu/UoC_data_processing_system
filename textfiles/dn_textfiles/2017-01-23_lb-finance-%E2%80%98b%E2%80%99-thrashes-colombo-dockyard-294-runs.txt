LB Finance ‘B’ thrashes Colombo Dockyard by 294 runs

It was a massacre of the innocents the manner that LB Finance ‘B’ annihilated Colombo Dockyard by 294 –runs, in the ongoing 06 th ‘BMW/Hyundai Trophy, MCA ‘C’ division 50 over League’ Tournament 2017, continued last week-end.
LBF ‘B’ sent to bat piled up a mammoth 333 for 06 in 50-overs, as their openers Hashan Wanasekera (128 in 124 balls, inclusive of 02 sixes and 16 fours) and Gihan de Silva (58) sent the bowlers on a leather hunt, putting on 165 runs in 161 balls. Middle order batsman, Hansamal Perera made the bowlers suffer further with a quick fire 51 runs in 45 balls.
Severely demoralized, CDL threw in the towel, all out for 39 runs in 18.5 overs, thus making easy meat for the bowlers, Ranitha Liyanarachchi (6/8/3), Chamath Gunasinghe (3.5. 1/12/3) and Ashan Fernando (3/2/1/2).
The best bowling effort came from Commercial Leasing Co.’s pace man, Geethal Fernando, (10-49- 6), who wreaked the strong Commercial Credit’s batting line-up, thus spearheading his side to a fine 34 runs win. Dependable duo, all rounder, Aruna Henrickson (10-2- 36-4 ) and opening batsman, Charith Satharasinghe (81 not out in 100 balls, with 12 fours ) put Std. Chartered Bank on the right side of the ledger, beating JL Morison by 03 wickets.
