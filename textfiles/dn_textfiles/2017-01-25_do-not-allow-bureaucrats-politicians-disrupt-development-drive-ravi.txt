Do not allow bureaucrats, politicians to disrupt development drive: Ravi

Professionals should not allow bureaucrats and inefficient politicians to disrupt ongoing development drive, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He said many public officials and even certain politicians keep silence in the face of such bureaucracy consequently suppressing the innocent people of this country.
The minister was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the Diploma in Public Procumbent and Contract Administration Training Course held at the Miloda Financial Academy in Colombo on January 23.
Procumbent Specialist and Fraud Investigator Dr. Colin Cram of the Charted Institute of Purchasing and Supply in Britain delivered the keynote address.
Minister Karunanayake said professionals today need not to fear to challenge bureaucrats and inefficient politicians.
He pointed out that professionals should come forward to implement the development drive introduced by the government.
The minister said it is no point if it is unable to prove walk the talk.
He said many public servants are reluctant to challenge inefficient politicians. They just keep silent and get accustomed to the entrapping system, he said.
The minister, explaining how public funds are lost due to inefficiency and corruption in the procurement process, said that money could be saved by improving efficiency in the part of public servants.
He said drastic changes need to be made in the Procurement Commission and in its Appeal Board; therefore, the President and the Prime Minister have appointed a Special Cabinet Subcommittee intending to correct this situation. Many powerful countries now show their keen interest in Sri Lanka, and it was proved during the World Economic Forum concluded recently at Davos in Switzerland, the minister said.
He said a large number of foreign investors met him in Davos and evinced their interest to invest in Sri Lanka and all these developments are clear evidence that our country passed a gloomy era and has reached to an optimistic turning point.
Minister Karunanayake pointed out that the country should have a smooth business friendly supportive system to provide necessary facilities to prospective foreigners when they reach here to invest.
He said the entire world is facing economic turbulence today and the reason for top world investors to eye on Sri Lanka is the disciplined and coherent economic foundation built in the country during the current regime.
The minister said the duty of all professionals is to forget the past and make commitments to enable this efficient government to reach its set goals and face impending global challenges.
Miloda Financial Academy Chief Executive Anura Lokuhetti was present.
