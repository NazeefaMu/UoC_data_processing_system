U.S. Embassy trains Customs officials

The U.S. Department of State’s Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) Programme trained 33 Customs officials from Sri Lanka in risk management of cargo from August 21, 2017 to August 25, 2017. The training was conducted in Colombo and coordinated by EXBS.
Participants learned how to identify high-risk shipments and improve cargo targeting capabilities through the use of document analysis. Customs organizations utilize finite resources to screen cargo entering, transiting and exiting their borders and the workshop provided the participants with concrete ways to assess the potential risk cargo may pose to national security and public safety. They can now better screen shipments by identifying those that require a physical inspection.
EXBS aims to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the transfer of conventional weapons that threaten regional peace and stability. The EXBS programme comprises a wide range of non-proliferation strategic trade control assistance programmes, from licensing and legal/regulatory technical assistance, to provision of equipment and training for seaport, border control and law enforcement officials.
