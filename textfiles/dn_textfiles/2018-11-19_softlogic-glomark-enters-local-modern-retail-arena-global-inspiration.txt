Softlogic GLOMARK enters local modern retail arena with global inspiration

Softlogic Holdings PLC announces the launch of Softlogic GLOMARK, Sri Lanka’s first inspirational global market which will revolutionize modern trade retail in Sri Lanka, with the unique, curated global experience it delivers.
Located in an expansive facility in Delkanda, an up and coming suburb of Colombo, Softlogic GLOMARK heralds a completely new offering. GLOMARK harnesses the widest selection of items and the best of technology for a superlative consumer experience, which will introduce a series of firsts in the country. The modern trade venture by Softlogic will stock the widest selection, sourced from around the world, delivering freshness and high quality for a one-of-a-kind experience.

Customers can revel in Softlogic GLOMARK’s expertise across their Bakery, Butchery, Cheesery, Essentials and Living sections. Experts will be on hand at each section to guide shoppers on pairing specialty ingredients for the best outcome, from selecting one of many cheeses sourced from around the world to an expertly sliced cut of meat.
Thus far, many shoppers have had to compromise on certain specialty ingredients which are not available in Sri Lanka, but the arrival of GLOMARK will change that as it stocks all the possible exotic international grocery items seen in supermarkets across the world. Shopping at GLOMARK will be a seamless affair, aided by the latest retail tech and specialist guides to ensure that customers find every single item on their shopping list under one roof at GLOMARK.

Ashok Pathirage, Chairman and Managing Director, Softlogic PLC opening the facility
GLOMARK is being launched by Softlogic Supermarkets Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Softlogic Retail PLC, under the ultimate parent group, Softlogic Holdings PLC. As a consumer-focused business, it has over 100 international brands marketed through one of the country’s strongest distribution channels.
On the occasion of unveiling Softlogic GLOMARK, Chairman and Managing Director of Softlogic Holdings PLC, Ashok Pathirage said, “It gives me immense pleasure to bring the global experience of Softlogic GLOMARK to the citizens of Sri Lanka. GLOMARK will introduce a new benchmark in modern trade for consumers to truly enjoy their supermarket experience and be able to source every need under one roof. Our selection spans all imaginable daily and household needs to infuse further convenience for shoppers. We understand today’s shoppers and their need for speed via tech-driven tools and easy shopping experience, which are all offered by GLOMARK’s inspired experience.”
Softlogic Holdings PLC has already established its pioneering leadership as a retail giant, leading the consumer electronics and apparel segments and innovating in the restaurant and food business, through partnering with global brands. It is now expanding its footprint in modern trade to tap into the strong potential this segment holds.
Sri Lanka’s modern grocery retail sector has also seen robust growth supported by improving incomes, rising urbanisation and changing lifestyles, which has attracted more customers from traditional grocery channels. Penetration, however, remains low with only 15%-18% of FMCG sales generated by modern grocery retail, relatively low in comparison with regional peers as per Fitch (2017).
Softlogic Holdings PLC is one of Sri Lanka’s largest diversified conglomerates with leading market positions in growing economic sectors in retail, healthcare, financial services, leisure and automobiles. Softlogic holds Authorized Distributorships for key global brands and today, employs over 10,000 people in its offices located in Sri Lanka and Australia.
