Treat indeed for Sanhinda Children’s Home

In celebration of World Childrens’ Day, SriLankan Cares, the charitable arm of SriLankan Airlines, one of South Asia’s Grand Dame’s Galle Face Hotel and the pioneers in the transport world in Sri Lanka, Ebert Silva, joined hands to make children their main focus.
The day was not simply a day to celebrate children for who they are, but for them to enjoy a journey of hospitality. A culture of giving is one of the defining features of a successful society; indeed the three companies that joined hands on this occasion certainly did improve the quality of life of the children in the Sanhinda Home.
“Today’s experience for the children was an exposure to the kids to inculcate in them what they could aspire to be”, Ebert Silva Holidays Chairperson Rajini Mendis stated.
“The synergy through the three companies made the children very happy. A guest journey is not only about a hotel experience, it is also love, hope and the personal care provided that make it a memorable experience,’ Galle Face Hotel Director Marketing Communications Mahika Chandrasena added.
Arriving at the airport in a double-decker bus and then heading to an aircraft with a familiarization tour for the children by the authorities of airport and aviation, and finally a delectable tea party at the Galle Face Hotel indeed made the children rejoice to the utmost.
“The children are our treasure and handling them with care and commitment whilst opening a whole world of hope for these innocent children who have been less cared for, was our main objective”, SriLankan Cares Manager Niroshan Ranawake said.
