Presiding over a forum of ministers and parliamentarians in the Southern province, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, while discussing new strategies for the South, said the government would make productive the mega development projects launched in Hambantota, despite dissimilar views within the government.
"Whatever different point of views on the mega projects launched in the South by the previous government, the reality is that the country has already spent colossal amount of money over these projects. As they have proved unproductive, these are hard financial burdens to bear. For this reason it is important to rectify the situation by transforming these mega projects into dynamic ventures, despite differences in opinion," the Prime Minister said.
"We who are united under the leadership of President Maitripala Sirisena, are making collective effort to usher progress and prosperity into the country.
We need the united cooperation of all the people's representatives towards this national goal," he said. He further elaborated that foreign investors had been invited, and that the government was in contact with China, in a bid to make dynamic these projects.
The Western Province's contribution towards the Gross National Product is 42% while Southern Province has contributed 10% towards it. The combined contribution of these two provinces' to the GDP is 52%, however, take note, these two provinces are the economic hubs of the country - the Prime Minister is reported to have said, urging those present not limit the decisions made that day mere rhetoric, but to, instead, duly implement the conclusions agreed upon at the forum.
