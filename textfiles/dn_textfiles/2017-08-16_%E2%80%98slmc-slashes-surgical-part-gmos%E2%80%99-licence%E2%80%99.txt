‘SLMC slashes surgical part from GMOs’ licence’

The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) issued the licence to Grade Medical Officers to practise medicine and surgical procedures. But after 2004, the SLMC issued the licence only to practise medicine. It dropped the surgical part from the licence, Grade Medical Officers’ Union (GMOU) Chairman Dr. Ruchira Saranapala said.
He was speaking at a press conference held at the CSR in Colombo yesterday.
The Grade Medical Officers’ Union (GMOU) has presented 12 demands to the Government, he said.
“Over 90 percent of the doctors are Grade Medical Officers, but some associations put us forward, obtain various privileges and share them among their officials and consultants. They fight for irrelevant matters but not for the issues of doctors,” he said.
Dr. Saranapala said the GMOU supported around 15 doctors to regain their benefits. They had been the victims of revenge. “Now all doctors’ transfers are done through the Public Service Commission . In the past, doctors were given negligible increments and at one time, it was only five rupees,” he said.
“Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, being a doctor, understands doctor’s issues well. He is a former trade union leader and knows hardships that doctors undergo. He was able to win several benefits for doctors in the past. Vehicle permit and private channeling are but two of them,” he said.
