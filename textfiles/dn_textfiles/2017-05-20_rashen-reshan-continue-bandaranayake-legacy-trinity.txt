Rashen, Reshan continue Bandaranayake legacy at Trinity

Two young Trinity College ruggerite brothers, Rashen and Reshan N A H Bandaranayake who are performing quite well for their Alma Mater in
the present school rugby season are the fourth generation ruggerites of a family with a rich sporting history at Trinity college.
Their farther Rajiv Bandaranayake was a Rugby Lion and played for Trinity as a tree quarter in 1987.
He was also a jersey winner in 1986. Rashen and Reshan's great grand father Ananda Hulugalle Bandaranayake was a malty faceted sports personalty who excelled in both rugby and cricket. He captained Trinity cricket team in 1953 and was a Cricket Lion.
He represented school rugby team in 1952 and 1953 where he played as a full back. He also received school colours for rugby and known to be a very popular character in Trinity sports.
The family sporting tradition continued to another generation, extending to over 100 years as the great great grand father of Rashen and Reshan, Jinadasa Hulugalle Bandaranayake went on to excel both in rugby and cricket during his school days. He captained Trinity cricket team in 1919 and entered Trinity Lion-hood as a Cricket Lion.
His school rugby career stretches from 1918 to 1919, but there were no clue about the position he played.
This fascinating sporting legacy of Bandaranayake family is a rare feat and might be the only its kind of family sports record in Sri Lnkan school sports history.
The elder brother Rashen is a third year player and plays as a full back while his younger brother Reshan is a three-quarter, playing in his first year for Trinity first xv.
