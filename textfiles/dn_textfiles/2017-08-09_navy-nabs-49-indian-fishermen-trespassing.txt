Navy nabs 49 Indian fishermen for trespassing

Fast Attack Craft attached to the Northern Naval Command and Sir Lanka Coast Guard while on routine patrol, have arrested 49 Indian fishermen and impounded 12 fishing trawlers for trespassing into Sri Lankan territorial waters and engaging in illegal fishing on Monday night and yesterday morning.
Two of these fishing trawlers were impounded in the waters northwest of the Delft Island and the rest were taken into custody in the seas north of Kovilan Point. These fishermen had ventured into Sri Lankan waters and practiced illegal bottom trawling which is considered as a destructive fishing method.
Having brought the arrested trawlers and fishing gear to the naval base SLNS Elara in Kareinagar and fishermen to SLNS Uththara in Kankesanthurei, they are due to be handed over to the Assistant Fisheries Director in Jaffna for further legal action, the Navy media unit said.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Navy on August 3 facilitated repatriation of 77 Indian fishermen, who were released from Sri Lankan custody as a gesture of goodwill, after detaining them for poaching in the island’s territorial waters.
