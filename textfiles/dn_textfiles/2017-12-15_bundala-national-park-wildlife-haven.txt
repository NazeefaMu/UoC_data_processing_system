Bundala National Park - a wildlife haven

The Bundala National Park with an area of 6,216 hectares was declared open in 1969.
There are also many mini salterns and lagoons within the park. Mahalevaya salterns, Koholankala salterns, Bundala salterns and Pallemalala Ebilikala oya and Kiridioya lagoon are some of them.
According to the records at the park there are forty eight species of flower plants belonging to twenty six families. Bundala is one of the most popular areas for resident and migratory birds wintering. The Bundala National Park is the refuge of the migratory birds known as flamingos.
The salterns, lagoons and the marshes accommodate more than 20,000 shore birds at any given time, the records said. The biggest attraction at the park is the elephants rather than birds.
There are eight to ten permanent residents, twenty five to thirty semi residents and about seventy to eighty migratory elephants who live in Yala, Bundala and Lunugmwehera areas.
