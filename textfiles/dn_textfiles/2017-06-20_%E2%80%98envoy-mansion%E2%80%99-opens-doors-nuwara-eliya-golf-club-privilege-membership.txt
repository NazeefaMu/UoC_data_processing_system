‘Envoy Mansion’ opens doors to Nuwara Eliya Golf Club privilege membership programme

The iconic men’s wear brand Envoy Mansion in association with the leading loyalty networking company Channel17 warmly welcomes the membership of Nuwara Eliya Golf Club (NEGC) to enjoy premier fashion and luxury lifestyle at their plush showroom at Bagatalle Road in Colpetty.
NEGC Membership Card holders will receive special privileges from Envoy Mansion on a range of world renowned products.
“We are delighted to partner with CH17 Loyalty to recognise NEGC which is the finest and the oldest golf courses in the country” said Fouzul Hameed. Akin to our brand, the golf fraternity deserve the best in lifestyle and tastefully delivered and we have the perfect match, he added. NEGC card holders can present their membership card at any time of the year at the Envoy Mansion and the staff will be happy to extend the courtesies, he said.
The Management of NEGC thanked CH17 Loyalty for making this arrangement with Envoy Mansion and affording privileges to their membership. Recently the Club introduced a Privilege Program to all members where the membership Card will offer attractive year round privileges through a special arrangement made with CH17 Loyalty.
“We want to add more value to our membership and give the best to our card holders” said NEGC President Maj. Gen. S M De A Rajapakse.
We are equally delighted to build this special “bond” between the two major brands which will also establish a loyal relationship between them, Jumar Preena CEO of CH17 said.
