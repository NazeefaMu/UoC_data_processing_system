child’s lesson

Reconciliation, springboard for a better future:
Proper time and effort leads to more secure future:
As Sri Lanka sets up its reconciliation processes, it is important that all groups who were affected by the civil conflict are represented therein. Many argue that inclusion should not only be open to ethnic and religious factions but also to children.
To that end, the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) jointly hosted a panel discussion on Tuesday evening at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute entitled “The Role of Children in Reconciliation: Lessons from International Experiences.”
Over the course of two hours, the panel of six international experts engaged in a wide-ranging conversation on the challenges and opportunities that reconciliation processes present and noted that, if properly conducted, these procedures could help unite the country and heal old wounds.
“It’s such an opportunity you have before you, and it can bring the country together. We are very excited to be part of this, to listen and learn from your experiences and to support you in any way that we can,” said Saudamini Siegrist, Global Senior Adviser, Child Protection in Emergencies, UNICEF.
That being said, she added that it is the Sri Lankan government and citizens who should shoulder the responsibility for deciding on the proper methods through which to carry out the reconciliation mission.
“The international community should have a supportive role and should not impose from the outside. It should listen to and support your agenda. In order for transitional justice to be meaningful, it must be grassroots.”
“There are many options for these processes and no one size fits all. It’s up to the government and people to look at the national context to determine which processes are most fitting for the country,” she said.
Dr. Cheryl Heykoop, of Canada’s Royal Roads University, echoed Siegrist, arguing that the reconciliation process must be contextualized in the national situation so as to have the best chance to be consequential for the people.
While the group brought different perspectives to the table, they agreed that including children in the Sri Lankan reconciliation process will be incredibly important. They did caution, however, that the transitional justice procedures will likely be long and arduous.
“I’d like to say that transitional justice processes are long-term projects. The point is that you have to find a stable way to conduct them so that the state is committed to helping and society is involved. Cooperation is key to maintaining sustainable success,” said Iris Marin Ortiz, Presidential Advisor on Human Rights, Colombia.
“Colombia has been doing this for more than twenty years, and we have just started,” she added.
Siegrist concurred, and added that, though a long-lasting procedure, it is a crucial one: “Reconciliation is an urgent process because children cannot wait. We have to address these issues and bring children into the process as urgently as we can.”
Indeed, the panelists cautioned that, since so many people see truth seeking and reconciliation procedures as both a means of closure and a springboard for a better future, civil society and government must properly manage the public’s expectations for the processes.
“It’s critical to manage expectations and to make sure expectations are realistic and realizable so that we don’t have dreams that can’t come true. We should have a (continuous) reality check throughout the process,” said Siegrist.
Managing expectations is easier said than done, as countless people will expect different things from the truth telling and reconciliation mechanisms. Despite this, the experts maintained that people should be patient and understand that every one of these processes is different from its predecessors and therefore somewhat experimental.
“All of these processes in any country are experiments. They’ve usually not been done before. The importance of looking at other places while recognizing that every situation is different can be useful,” said Caitlin Reiger, a lawyer who works for the British Council in Myanmar.
Notwithstanding the daunting challenges that Sri Lanka faces in successfully reconciling its divided masses, every panelist argued that one of the processes’ keys would be the inclusion of children and the promotion of justice for the young who suffered during the civil conflict.
Children in reconciliation efforts
The challenges innumerable children faced during the conflict, coupled with the fact that the young, by virtue of their relative vulnerability to abuse, often suffer more than older people during emergencies, makes it very important that they are well represented in the reconciliation processes.
They should be, according to several of the panelists, included in the processes and given the opportunity to speak and tell their stories in hybrid and traditional courts. They must not, however, be expected to take on the lion’s share of the burden of reconciliation, according to Siegrist.
Despite that many people have considered the testimony of children to be unfit for a court of law, the experts argued that this is simply not true, as Reiger said that children can be effective and useful witnesses when called upon.
“What is necessary is to hear their voices and engage in a process that allows them to express their views.”
“And we have done this in many countries, where we have gotten children’s active participation as witnesses in providing testimony, sometimes giving statements in truth commissions, taking part in traditional processes and restorative justice processes, and participating in reparations programmes,” Siegrist said.
While lauding the inclusion of children in reconciliation mechanisms, she also noted that the government should work to protect children who choose to participate in the reconciliation process.
“It is essential that we take the precaution that children’s participation actually does strengthen their protection and does not expose them to further harm. It has to put in place procedures that safeguard youth’s participation.”
“Every step of the way, we need to make sure that what we do is in the best interests of children. That’s the principle. It is paramount, fundamental, and should guide everything we do,” she said.
For the experts, accountability helps both communities and children heal and leads to a more secure future. Though it does take time and effort to properly engage children in reconciliation processes, it is very much worth it, as there is evidence that participation makes people become active citizens in the future.
The panel did, moreover, recommend that the reconciliation procedures be flexible enough to accommodate the desires of a vast number of people, as only those who are comfortable with the mechanisms are likely to participate.
Heykoop, in her prior experiences working in Africa, said that young people were almost always keen to share their experiences, but that many of them had very specific desires for what the mechanism would look like.
Siegfried, for her part, recounted how, in Sierra Leone, children insisted that they told their stories in the way they experienced them and that they would be left uncensored.
“This actually helped empower them and gave them more agency and a more dynamic role in the proceedings,” she said, while adding that this strategy would be part of a larger method of including people so as to make sure nobody feels isolated.
On the subject of prosecuting child soldiers, Reiger argued that children should be held accountable for the crimes they commit, but that they should always be considered victims first.
“I think the limitations of a formal justice process suggest that it is perhaps better to deal with the liability of children through other transitional justice processes.”
“Even if children have committed horrendous crimes, and should have some form of responsibility, they are still first and foremost victims,” she said.
Ending cycles of violence
The panelists also spent a significant amount of time discussing the need for reconciliation to help end cycles of violence. Many countries go through reconciliation and truth seeking projects only to fall back into civil strife, and the experts cautioned that any proper mechanism would try to educate the public about the need to come together and end infighting.
Friedrich Affolter, a Global Education Specialist at UNICEF, emphasized the importance of both telling different sides’ stories and studying conflict in general in order to put cultures of violence to rest.
“Transitional justice could benefit from education if we manage to explain to young people why conflicts occur. If we focus on how the education system is used to connect people rather than to divide people, we can make progress towards building peaceful societies.”
“Conflict can grow if we successfully dehumanize and devalue the other side. Education can stop this destructive process by teaching about conflict,” he said.
Other members of the panel echoed Affolter, saying that it was crucial to dispel rumours that certain groups believe about their former adversaries.
Finally, the panelists noted that it is of the utmost importance for society to be compassionate during the proceedings especially because of the sensitivities surrounding the issues.
“Ultimately, everyone, not only judges and witnesses, needs to be aware and sensitive when the country designs a child-friendly constitution or court process so that the mechanism has the best chance of succeeding,” Reiger said.
