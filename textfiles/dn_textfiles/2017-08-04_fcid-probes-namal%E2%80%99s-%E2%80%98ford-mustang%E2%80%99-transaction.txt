FCID probes Namal’s ‘Ford Mustang’ transaction

The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) yesterday told the Kaduwela Magistrate’s Court that they are investigating whether any financial irregularity has taken place in the transaction of the Ford Mustang car belonging to MP Namal Rajapaksa to a third party.
The FCID officials informed the court that investigations are under way to ascertain whether any irregularity has taken place when transferring the car imported by Rajapaksa on a duty free concession of parliamentarians to a third party.
The investigators were making submission with regard to the vehicle before Kaduwela Magistrate Prasanna Alwis.
The lawyer appearing for the present owner of the vehicle informed court that the vehicle in question has been imported on duty free facility granted to parliamentarians and his client has duly purchased the car from Rajapaksa.
He pointed out that the vehicle is rusting away and pleaded court to release the vehicle forthwith.
The Magistrate after taking the submissions of both parties into account put off the case till August 31
