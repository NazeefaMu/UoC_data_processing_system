CDB offers Sisudiri scholarships to students

Encouraging academic achievement by rewarding students who have excelled in the Grade Five scholarship and GCE Ordinary Level examinations has been an integral part of the CSR initiatives conducted by Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB).
The CDB Sisudiri Scholarship Programme, presented 36 scholarships to the top achievers of these Grade Five Scholarship and GCE O/Level national examinations at a ceremony held at the Tower Hall recently. Director of Ceylinco Life Palitha Jayawardena was the Chief Guest at the event which recognized the achievements of these future leaders, honouring them with laurels to continue on their high achieving path.
MD/CEO of CDB, Mahesh Nanayakkara in his welcome said, "Contributing towards Sri Lanka's education has been a cornerstone in our company's CSR endeavours. It has been an important resource that has significantly influenced our calendar of sustainability initiatives.
We take pride and pleasure in improving the quality of education in our country sustainably, providing students who have made the nation proud with their extraordinary results to achieve their dreams and aspirations."
In his address, Palitha Jayawardena said, "Education is an asset that Sri Lankan parents appreciate and CDB should be truly commended for providing Sisudiri scholarships to outstanding students who have the potential to contribute meaningfully to national progress in the years to come." The scholarship awards held annually is in its ninth year and has conferred scholarships on 370 students at an investment exceeding Rs 14 million. By continuing their education, these CDB scholars will maintain their high academic standards and thus optimize their chances of entering a prestigious university to pursue their academic goals.
CDB awards cash grants to those who excel at the Government Grade Five Scholarship Examination until completion of the GCE O/Level examination. Those who excel at their O/Levels, receive cash grants throughout the study period for their A/Level examination. The bursary is remitted to the scholar's parents to ensure that they are able to benefit from the scholarship and is a gesture greatly appreciated by them, as the challenging quest for funding their child's education is greatly reduced due to this scholarship.
