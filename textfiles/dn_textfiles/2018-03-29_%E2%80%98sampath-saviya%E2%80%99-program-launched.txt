‘Sampath Saviya’ program launched

Sampath Bank announced the launch of its renowned ‘Sampath Saviya’ entrepreneurship development program for the year 2018.
The ‘Sampath Saviya’ initiative is at the core of Sampath Bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts. Offering technical support and financial assistance, the program has nurtured over 2,000 Micro, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs), including exporters, since its launch in 2013.
Sampath Bank has also conducted several projects in partnership with the CEFENET Sri Lanka, Export Development Board, Regional Chambers and Divisional Secretariats under this initiative.
The Bank has called for applications from startups and budding micro, small and medium entrepreneurs for the next batch of the ‘Sampath Saviya’ program.
In a bid to empower the nation’s youth with the skills and resources to stand on their own feet, Sampath Bank has opened the program out to Advanced Level (A/L) and Ordinary Level (O/L) students who have discontinued their studiesthis year.
The Bank believes that this will help cut down on their idle time and make them more productive, thereby enabling them to better contribute to national development.
“At Sampath Bank, we firmly believe that the nation’s micro, small and medium enterprise sector is one of the key drivers of economic development.
Hence, right from our inception, we have worked closely with entrepreneurs around the island. Going beyond our business interests, we launched the Sampath Saviyaentrepreneurship development program in 2013 with the vision of enhancing and empowering the capacities of MSMEs for sustainable development of Sri Lanka,” said Lalith Weragoda, Assistant General Manager – Human Resources, Sampath Bank PLC.
Selected applicants will initially take part in workshops to develop their skills on business knowhow, marketing and financial management. Participants will be encouraged to develop and submit their business plans at the end of the workshops.
A panel of experts will evaluate these plans and help fine tune them further.
