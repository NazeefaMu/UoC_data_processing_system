JO to commence signature collecting campaign

The Joint Opposition (JO) is planning to sign a petition against the sale of state lands to foreign investors and to demand to hold the local government election with immediate effect. Parliamentarian Gamini Lokuge said at the Abhayarama temple yesterday.
He said the JO will collect 5.8 million signatures to the petition. The JO will go round the country for signatures under this move, he said.
“The main aim of this move is to urge the government to hold the LG polls with immediate effect,” Lokuge said.
He added that the national unity government has done nothing for the country and people, and therefore, trade unions are against the government.
The JO will launch a countrywide protest campaign against the government with trade unions and all others who are against the government. The preliminary discussion in this regard was already done, he said.
