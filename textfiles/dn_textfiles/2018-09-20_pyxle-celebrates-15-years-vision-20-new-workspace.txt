Pyxle celebrates 15 years with Vision 2.0: new workspace

Enterprise technology solution provider, Pyxle, celebrates 15 years of success this year.
The company marked this milestone with the launch of its new workspace and brand Pyxle 2.0 - a fresh vision for the next decade at a company that has evolved from its beginning to become an industry pacesetter, delivering digital transformation and technology solutions to clients across four continents.
Pyxle was founded by Presantha Jayamaha in 2003 with a small team and a simple vision that focused on delivering innovative solutions and cultivating a thriving workforce.
Today Pyxle is seen as a trusted name at the forefront of enterprise technology solutions. Tier 1 and Fortune 500 companies across four continents turn to Pyxle for transformation strategies that drive revenue growth and improve operational performance.
The company is one of four tech businesses in Sri Lanka that global investment organisation Tavistock Group recently invested in under the group name Elovate. This Sri Lankan cluster offers partners value through end to end technological solutions covering hardware, software, marketing and analytics.
Pyxle offers partners a package of technology consulting, software development, managed IT and data services. Solutions focus on transforming day to day business to maximise efficiency and results. For example, the company has developed software products such as an enterprise reporting system for a U.S. Fortune 100 company to track energy performance contracts for property managers, and another that manages agricultural assets across millions of hectares.
Pyxle’s 15-year journey has helped to transform how Sri Lankan businesses are perceived globally and has allowed the Pyxle team to gain valuable international exposure, says Founder and Director Presantha Jayamaha. “It’s only been 15 years, but in that time Pyxle has transformed from a small unit of two to a thriving family of 90 that works with partners around the world to consistently deliver,” he said.
Pyxle 2.0 is a vision for the company’s next decade of growth, reflected in its new logo which enlivens the familiar print with a future forward design. Pyxle’s new vision is twofold, focused on providing innovative solutions that enable partners to change the way they do business, drive revenue and improve operational excellence.
