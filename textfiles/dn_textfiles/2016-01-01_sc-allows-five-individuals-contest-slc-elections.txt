SC allows five individuals to contest SLC elections

The Supreme Court yesterday permitted five individuals including former vice president of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) K. Mathivanan whose nominations had been rejected, to contest the upcoming Sri Lanka Cricket elections.
Despite the Supreme Court having delivered this order on December 18 following a settlement reached by all parties concerned, the Court had to make a clarification since then presiding Judge Eva Wanasundara did not put her signature on the judgment. It is learnt that Justice Eva Wanasundara is currently overseas.
When the matter came up before special Supreme Court bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice K.T. Chitrasiri, the court affirmed the earlier judgment.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court allowed K. Mathivanan, Asanga Seneviratne, Nihal Lewke, Sujeewa Lokuhewa and Easman Narangoda to contest the Sri Lanka Cricket elections scheduled for the January 3, 2016.
The Court made this order consequent to a petition filed by K. Mathivanan. He sought an interim order requiring the Director General of Sports to permit the nomination of the petitioner to be elected to the post of vice president of Sri Lanka Cricket.
