Prevention of elephant-train collisions:
Committee Report presented to minister

The Committee Report proposing recommendations on preventing elephant–train collisions on railway tracks was handed over to Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva by the Committee members on Thursday.
The Committee has recommended the introduction of a telephone alert system to warn train drivers about the presence of elephants on railway tracks, clearing of shrubs in an area up to 30 metres on either side of the railway tracks, enforcing train speed limits, building paths (overpasses and underpasses) for elephant crossings at multiple locations, removal of obstructions in elephant crossings at locations with bridges and erecting electric and bio fences at places where elephants enter.
The report has proposed a system whereby the installation of sensors in low-lying areas (cuttings) on railway tracks would trigger an alarm if breached by elephants transmitting an automatic signal to the engine driver to stop the train.
The report also suggests the installation of an automatic device to scare away elephants walking on tracks when a train is approaching and issuing warnings to engine drivers to alert them that an elephant is on the track. Fitting a horn to issue a warning to approaching engine drivers to reduce the speed of the train when an elephant is on the track and the installation of thermal Vision-Digital Active PTZ camera to identify live objects on the track, are among the other proposals.
A month has been granted for public consultations and submissions for this report. Once the public consultations are over, a draft proposal will be made to estimate the expenses involved and to seek Cabinet approval for the project.
Thirty places where underpasses can be built and 22 places where overpasses can be built on the railway track beyond Mahawa for the smooth passage of elephants have been identified.
A team of 14 officials of the Railways and Wildlife Department appointed on the instruction of Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, have observed the elephant transit points along the Northern and Eastern railway lines to make recommendations for preventing elephant–train collisions.
The team was engaged in the observation of elephant transit points along the Northern and Eastern railway lines starting from Mahawa Railway Station, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Anuradhapura, Thalaimannar and Kankesanthurai from October 11 to 14.
Department of Railways, Project Director of Elephant Collisions Irosh Perera said elephants freely move from wildlife protected areas to forest reserves and vice versa, which also include their home ranges.
"The obstruction and blockage of elephant corridors due to human activities has ultimately led to elephants having to cross railway lines, thus invading villages. In a conflict situation, both humans and elephants have impacts from the other," Perera said.
"It is necessary to build a safe environment for elephants and special attention should be paid to the elephant corridor. We should focus on scientific methods to prevent this crisis," he said.
"We have identified 142 kilometres of track where elephants are vulnerable to collide with trains. The other identified zones are 188 km-long mid-level danger area, 38 km-long low-danger area and 294 km-long zone where elephants do not roam. Accordingly, an area of 368 km has been identified as a zone where elephants roam freely," Perera said.
"We have found many reasons for elephant-train collisions. Among them are non-visibility of elephants at bends, non-visibility of elephants due to shrub jungles on both sides of the track and poor lighting on the headlights of trains,” he added.
