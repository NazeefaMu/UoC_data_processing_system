U.N. member states welcome overall improvement in HR, democratic reforms

The main sponsors of the Human Rights Council (HRC) resolutions 30/1 and 34/1 on Sri Lanka; the United States, United Kingdom, Macedonia and Montenegro in a joint statement on Wednesday reiterated that ‘Sri Lanka still had a historic opportunity to avoid returning to divisions of the past” and that the implementation of the resolutions would “help give all
Sri Lankans the assurance of the safe, peaceful and prosperous future they deserve”.
“We welcome the overall improvement in human rights and democratic reforms. Sri Lanka is safer and freer than it was in 2015. The Government’s constructive engagement with the UN special procedures and support for the Peace building Priority Plan is welcome. The Consultation Task Force issues an important report to reflect the views of Sri Lankans and recent legislation on enforced disappearance is also positive”, read the joint statement.
The four countries however observed that they were disappointed that the pace of progress of implementation has been slow.
“Much still remains to be done to implement Sri Lanka’s commitments. We remain concerned about reports of abuse of authority by some officials. And multiple incidents of inter-communal violence, attacks and hate speech against minorities are alarming and demonstrate the need for reconciliation efforts”.
The statement also highlighted Sri Lanka’s acknowledgment when co-sponsoring resolution 30/1, that devolution of political authority through constitutional reform in integral to lasting reconciliation and non-recurrence of violations and abuses. The countries also continued to urge Sri Lanka to make the Office of Missing Persons fully operational, take meaningful steps to establish the other transitional justice mechanisms, bring about effective security sector reforms, repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and release more military occupied land to civilian ownership.
With determined leadership and a clean timeline for action, this Government can deliver the reform and justice agenda, encouraged the statement further.
