‘Darling’ tweet!

A Young Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip and Prince Charles (in a Scottish Kilt!) Get Cozy on a Blanket at Balmoral!:
Buckingham Palace threw it back to 1960 on Thursday – with a dash of plaid for good measure. The palace gave a rare glimpse of the royal family in complete casual mode at Balmoral Castle in a tweet last Thursday. In the sweet photo from 1960, Prince Charles, then 11, Princess Anne, then 10, and a baby Prince Andrew cuddle up on a plaid blanket on the yard of Balmoral Castle with their mom Queen Elizabeth, then 34, and dad Prince Philip, then 39.
The young royals look picture perfect in the darling photo – complete with the family pup! Queen Elizabeth is pictured doting on young Andrew, while a proud Prince Philip looks on. And siblings Charles and Anne fit right in with their Scottish surroundings in matching kilts.

The Queen retreats to her Scottish estate every summer for her annual two-month holiday in Aberdeenshire. She has been spending summers in the Scottish highlands ever since she was a young princess visiting the grand estate with her parents King George VI and Queen Elizabeth I. She and Prince Philip continued to make memories there with their own four children (and of course, the Queen's beloved corgis!).
The picturesque castle, which sits on 50,000 acres, has been in the royal family since 1852, when the estate was purchased by Prince Albert for his wife, Queen Victoria. The royal Scottish retreat is also special to Prince William and Princess Kate. During college, Will would whisk Kate away for romantic weekends to Tam-na-Ghar, the three-bedroom cottage on the castle grounds given to him by his grandmother.
