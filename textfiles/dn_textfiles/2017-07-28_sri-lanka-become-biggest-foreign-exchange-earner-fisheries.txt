Sri Lanka to become biggest foreign exchange earner in fisheries

The plan to set up three aquaculture parks across the country and utilise islandwide 10,000 tanks and 116 lagoons for fish farming, aims at turning the inland fisheries sector into a biggest foreign exchange earner, Fisheries and Aquatic Resource Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday. Minister Amaraweera was addressing the 35th scientific sessions of the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) in the NARA premises yesterday.
"Our main objective is to transform fish exports into the country’s first foreign exchange earner by 2020 by developing the country’s coastal fisheries, deep sea fisheries, inland fisheries and aquaculture fleets," the minister said.
Sri Lanka’s fish harvest has a great foreign demand compared to other countries. Sri Lankan tuna fish has a greater demand in the global market due to its high nutritional level.
A kilo of Sri Lankan Tuna is sold at Rs.20,000 in the global market, he said.
The minister said the demand rose as a result of lifting the ban on Sri Lanka fish exports by the European Union recently. Sri Lanka earlier decided the price of the International Fish Market. Later it was acquired by the Maldives due to the EU ban on Sri Lankan fish, he said.
"We must work hard to regain this position in the next few years," he said.
"We should take precautions not to harvest the entire fish population at once. Around 40 percent harvest of fish is wasted. There should be a plan to prevent the waste, he said. Minister Amaraweera said although researchers spend money for participating at foreign seminars, conducting research and producing inventions, they do not reach the people and do not benefit the country."
