Condolence Motion on Late Premier Wickramanayake: He was a key figure from 1960 to 2015: PM
Parliament yesterday, expressed condolences on the demise of former Prime Minister late Ratnasiri Wickramanayake.
The Vote of Condolence was moved by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Party leaders, while members on both sides of the House joined in.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at the condolence motion said, “Late Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka was a key political figure from 1960 - 2015. Over these 55 years, there had been many transformations in Sri Lankan politics and Wickramanayaka could well adapt to these changes. He won the confidence of both ex-Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunga, which made him special.”
“Despite his political affiliations, we were always friends. There may be different political views, but we must have the ability to work together. I saw in the You Tube how UK Parliamentarians acted in unity during the terrorist attack in front of the UK Parliament. This is how the Commonwealth Parliamentary system works,” he added.
He always maintained dignity of Parliament - Sampanthan
Opposition Leader R Sampanthan joining in the condolence vote said that late Wickramanayake was not a person who used communalism or chauvinism to promote himself to politics.
“I valued my interactions with him because I always felt that I was interacting with a person who had very clear and strong views, but at the same time, those were very modest views.
He was firmly of the view that this country should be undivided, indivisible and united, but also held the view that all the people in this country must be able to live with equality and justice.
He was very careful to maintain the highest decorum and dignity of this House and never did anything that would reduce this august assembly to a common market place. He was not noisy, arrogant and aggressive,” he commented.
He was no racist, but had a nationalist feeling - MR
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said, “Late Wickramanayake entered Parliament representing the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP). He was no racist, but had a nationalist feeling. He was an advocate on the unitary character of the state. He came forward to advise us at needy times and we were ready to listen to him. He was a humble politician and a good example to the new comers.” Former President Rajapaksa concluded his speech expressing his well-wishes to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for his birthday which coincidentally fell on the same day.
Parliament decided to continue the condolence motion on another date as the Leader of the House informed that many other members, including President Maithripala Sirisena were willing to speak on it.
Speaker advises MPs to avoid disgracing Supreme body
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya making a special announcement in Parliament yesterday, advised the MPs to stick to the subject that was being debated in the House and not to insult or level unsubstantiated allegations against fellow members.
He made this observation making special reference to the Parliamentary debate of March 22, when the House took up a motion relating to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). The Speaker pointed out that certain MPs who spoke during this debate resorted to insult the Prime Minister and other fellow MPs with unfair, false and baseless allegations.
He said this behaviour was a disgrace and disrepute to the Supreme body, adding that it was a clear violation of the Standing Orders. He said he raised this matter with the relevant MPs by summoning them.
