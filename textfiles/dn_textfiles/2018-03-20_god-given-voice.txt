God given voice

Jean Vanheer has had so many girls telling her that they want to be like her. Vanheer says she is a largely self-taught singer and is now doing what she loves best which is playing Jazz. Melodies features Vanheer who says she will sing today and in the life to come.
“There are so many who want to sing like me. Some girls have even told me how much they want to be like me. So they listen to me. Because I think it is a god given talent. Everyone says it is a god given voice when they listen to me. I have a lot of fans who come just to listen to me. They all recognize me for what I have. I am enjoying my life now because my goals are simple – I just want to continue what I do best and that is singing till the day I die,” said Vanheer.

Vanheer did pop for nearly 25 years, and then after that went into Jazz because that was her liking. From her youth she loved Jazz. When she was eight years old, her mother allowed her to take part in some talent shows.
“I really admire singers like Nat King Cole and Ella Fitzgerald. So now for 15 years I have been doing Jazz. I lost my husband very early, so singing was my bread and butter to take care of my kids and my passion. My children are now married and settled down. So now I am doing it purely for pleasure and my husband Rodney Vanheer. We are working for ourselves and we are happy doing Jazz. I represented Sri Lanka in India for a jazz event seven years ago. I have been awarded three times in recognition of my talent,” stated Vanheer
Vanheer has never tried to be someone she is not. She is not a copy of other singers. She has her own identity. She tries to innovate and put something very original out.
“I have a great love for singing. It is something that is indescribable. I have never copied any singer. However I listen to them and take the basics and I always change it and try to do my own thing the way I feel. Even when I was a little girl I was always singing. My first experience with senior musicians was with Jimmy Manuel, Joy Ferdinands & Clement Kumaravel,” added Vanheer.
Singing is her life and she has steered her own ship. She made it on her own steam even though her uncle gently introduced her to the vocation. She started her music career when she was already married and had children
“Singing is my life. Because I am largely a self-taught person. I just sing from my heart. I have not gone for voice training. I have only gone for competitions winning many. It was my uncle who always told me that I had a voice and I could sing well. Then in 1965 Mr. Malcom Andree asked me to sing at his shows at the Kandy Lake Club. I used to sing there once a week,” said Vanheer.
The next step was S.L.B.C. for voice grading. She was given all- star grade, and was given a regular 15 minute program called "In Concert Style".
“It was then that my career started to rise. Those days the industry was very selective. They looked to see if you were a very qualified person who had gone through these voice grading. Then they took you.
“My next performance was with the "Patrick Nelson Combo". The line- up was Patrick Nelson (Piano), Bella Karekase (Saxophone and Trombone), Nasen Manikawasager (Bass), Melroy Passe Silva (Guitar) and Farook Miskin (Drums) and myself.
“I was with them for six years at the Mount Lavinia Hotel at the ‘Little Hut’. In time they went abroad but I could not leave my children and go. So then I was called by Mr. Gazali Amit to sing at the Blue Leopard. Then the line-up was Gazali Amit (Guitar), Jimmy Manuel (Piano), Valentine Manikawasager (Bass Guitar), Rodney Vanheer (Saxophone), Clifford Foenander (Drums) and myself. There I went on for another six years.
“Then Rodney and I formed our own band and we called it Rage. Then we started playing on our own at the Leopard. Then we got an offer at the Pegasus Reef Hotel. There we were for another six years going as Rage.
“It was then that I went overseas and was out for two or three years. Unfortunately I met with an accident and broke my leg. And for a year I was doing nothing. Then I started singing again at the Mount Lavinia Hotel along with Kuma De Silva and Hans Mater. So we started a three piece. That went on for a year or two.
The present five piece band comprises of Kuma De Silva (Piano), Dulip Gnanakan (Bass), Shiraaz NoorAmith (Drums), Rodney Vanheer (Saxophone) and myself,” explained Vanheer.
