Vajpayee: true friend of Sri Lanka: PM

Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee was an outstanding Prime Minister of India and a true friend of Sri Lanka who always stood by Sri Lanka. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he was grateful to the former Indian Prime Minister in this respect.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the Indian High Commission in Colombo on August 19 morning and signed the condolence book on the demise of former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he first came to know Vajpayee in 1975. He had been in jail for sometime. In 1977, Vajpayee was appointed Foreign Minister of India under the government of Prime Minister Desai.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that subsequent to his appointment as Deputy Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka in 1977, he was able to further cement his friendship with Vajpayee.
“Neighbouring countries hailed Vajpayee as a good foreign Minister, the Prime Minister said. He took the side of Sri Lanka during its difficult times. Vajpayee strongly believed that Indo-Sri Lanka friendship should always be protected,” the Prime Minister said.
The two of them also met as opposition leaders of their respective countries later. They continued their friendship when Vajpayee became Prime Minister of India and he had even given his private contact number to him.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that when he became Prime Minister, the LTTE had became a strong outfit and security forces had been on the retreat.
“The economy was in shambles. Against this background, Vajpayee assisted Sri Lanka to develop its economy and train its security forces.
If not for this help, we could not march forward successfully later,” he said.
“Vajpayee assisted us to combat the sea tiger movement. He could be described as a leader who had great interest in Sri Lanka’s well-being,” the Prime Minister said.
From 2009 to 2010, Vajpayee suffered from failing health and his visitors were restricted.
“The great service he had rendered during the history of India can never be forgotten,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
