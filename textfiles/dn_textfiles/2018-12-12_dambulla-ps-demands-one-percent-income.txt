Tourism in Sigiriya:
Dambulla PS demands one percent income

The Dambulla Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) recently demanded one percent of the income generated through tourism in Sigiriya, pledging to stage a protest if the demand was not met.
Dambulla Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman K.G. Somathilake said that as a large number of local and foreign tourists visit Sigiriya, the Pradeshiya Sabha was facing difficulties.
He said that the income acquired through tourism in Sigiriya was taken by the Central Cultural Fund (CCF), but that the Dambulla Pradeshiya Sabha had to provide facilities since the site was located within its jurisdiction.
The chairman said that road maintenance, electricity provision and garbage disposal in Sigiriya was done by the Dambulla Pradeshiya Sabha, but the Central Cultural Fund had not paid for it.
He also said that no portion of the income had been used to enhance the living standards of the residents in the locality.
He added that a minister of the previous government had employed more than 100 youths from Kuliyapitiya to Sigiriya, but had done nothing for the youths in Sigiriya.
He said that foreign tourists visiting Sigiriya were charged Rs.4,900, while local tourists were charged Rs.50. The authorities had to work to increase the daily income to Rs.10 million, he added.
