‘e-Government policies must be effectively implemented’

Sri Lanka needs to step up efforts to effectively implement e-Government policies with a unified approach, said Wasantha Deshapriya, Secretary, Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure.
“This could only result in easier access, less cost and faster delivery of services for citizens,” Deshapriya said.
He was speaking at a event titled, ‘Go Digital with Google’ hosted by Finetech Consultancy together with Google Inc, in Colombo. The first e-Government policy was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in 2009, Deshapriya said adding that only 30 per cent of government organizations are making efforts to follow policy recommendations in delivering government e-services whilst ensuring consistency in their ICT practices and activities.
Though the government efforts in regard to digitization process has made considerable progress over the years, according to Deshapriya, Sri Lanka has to go a long way in terms of national enterprise architecture and common standards to provide faster and better services for citizens and businesses.
