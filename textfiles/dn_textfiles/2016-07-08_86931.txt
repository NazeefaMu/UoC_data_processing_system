Senior citizens to receive pension and social security benefits

 
The aging population in Sri Lanka has been growing rapidly over the last 20 years and it is estimated that 25 percent of the population will be over 60 years by 2040. It is nearly one-fourth of Sri Lanka’s population that will be over 60 by 2040, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake said.
The Minister pointed out that the aging population is currently at 13 percent. The Sri Lanka Social Security Board is devoted to safeguarding the future of elderly citizens. As a national responsibility, a monthly pension payment and social security benefit should be guaranteed to them.
“We want to ensure that the senior citizens are treated with dignity and we want to create an environment of hassle free living for them. The Board’s function is to enroll all personnel who are not entitled to a government pension or are not holding pensionable posts, for the pension and social security benefit scheme,” he added.
The minister said that the institution which rendered a yeomen service to the elderly persons since 1996, was not properly functioning during the previous government over the past 7-8 years. Therefor, his ministry has planned to launch a massive programme to strengthen the board and make its services popular among the people.
Plans are also afoot to appreciate the service of government officials who have achieved their targets on the enrollment of new persons for the pension and social security benefits scheme.
Enrollment Offices, such as Grama Niladhari ,Samurdhi Development Officers ,Divisional Secretaries ,District Secretaries, Social Service Officers and Divinaguma (Samurdhi) Managers who have achieved their targets during the period 2008 to 2015 will be appreciated under this programe. Accordingly 194 government officers will be awarded with a token of appreciation by Minister Dissanayake at a ceremony to be held at Nelum Pokuma Mahinda Rajapaksa theater on July 11.
