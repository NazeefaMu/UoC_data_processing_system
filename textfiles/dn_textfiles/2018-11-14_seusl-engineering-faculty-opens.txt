SEUSL Engineering Faculty opens

The academic activities of the Engineering Faculty of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka (SEUSL) will commence today at 8.30 am, according to Registrar H. Abdul Saththar.
The university requested those who are entitled for hostel facilities to report to their respective hostels before 5.00 pm yesterday.
The other faculties will remain closed.
All faculties of the university were closed on October 24 following the unrest prevailed after some students were remanded when they protested demanding that their fellow students who were suspended, be taken back.
