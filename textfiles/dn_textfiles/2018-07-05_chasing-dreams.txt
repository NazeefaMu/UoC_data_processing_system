CHASING DREAMS!

People always say that dreams do come true, and this is my dream coming true,” said Yashenka de Zoysa, the 18 year-old Chairman of the Western Music Society at Royal College, Colombo. He is one of 40 members of the Royal College choir selected to compete in the World Choir Games, which is popularly known as the Choir Olympics. For the first time this year, Sri Lanka is sending two choirs to participate: Royal College and Soul Sounds Academy. 
The World Choir Games, held biennially (every even year), is purportedly the largest choir competition in the world. In 2016, at the Games in Sochi, Russia, some 12,000 singers in 283 choirs from 36 countries participated. This year, the Games held in Tshwane, South Africa from July 4 to 14 will have at least 9,000 participants.
Being selected to represent Sri Lanka at the World Choir Games has come about after the boys won the Gold medal under the Youth choir category at the Asia Pacific Choir Games last year. Boys from grade six to 13 have been selected to take part in this event. A band too will accompany them in providing music for the songs. 
Speaking to the boys of Royal College, their passion for singing rings true.
“[Music] is filled with soul. When you sing you can express your feelings to the audience… It gets me out of my sad mood. It gets me out of my troubles and feelings. Every time when I sing, all my troubles go away. It feels like home again, anywhere,” said Pavan Abeysinghe, a bass in the choir.
“The choir represents brotherhood. We all know everyone inside out. We know that we are there for each other, so that gives us all strength to perform at our best,” Pavan Abeysinghe expressed.
He has been involved in the choir since 2012. Singing has been his passion and he has joined the primary choir in grade one.
But passion is only the first element necessary for the Royal Choir’s success this year. Priyanthi Sudusinghe, the teacher in charge of the choir, and Sureka Amerasinghe, the choir directress, described the almost fourteen-year-long effort it took to bring the Royal College choir to this point.
“I have trained choirs before and we have had the most amazing team from Royal College. We initially started off trying to be the best choir in Colombo. They won provincial competitions and this motivated them to aim higher but I did not know that my boys had dreams of wanting to become the best choir in the world,” Amersinghe said with a smile.
The hallmark of Royal College is in its originality. Amerasinghe firmly endorses the idea that when she gives to Royal College, she gives back to Sri Lanka. Most of the choristers are also part of the Royal College Western Orchestra.
“A boys’ choir is more complete. We do not get Tenor or Bass in a girls’ choir. You get less voice singing in a mixed choir. However this kind of setup unites and binds them together,” she explained.
Sudusinghe added that the growing interest towards being members of the choir resulted in the annual Festival of Choirs, a choral festival which encourages fellowship among school children. The event is organized by the school’s Western Music Society.
The instructors were inspired by the boys’ enthusiasm and hard work, which was the only way to push through their grueling practice schedules-from two to four hours a day, three to five times a week. On top of that, the choir received support from Royal College’s Principal, B A Abeyrathna, who described how, “they preformed well from the beginning,” and he knew that it was important for Royal College to invest in the choir.
The Royal College choir prepared several songs for the event, some of them integrating choreography with the music. In the Youth Category, the college is performing “Sri Lankan Coral Fantasy,” choreographed by Dinesha Senayake, a Hungarian song, an African song, and “When You Believe” from Prince of Egypt. A collage of Sinhalese folk songs has been included for the Folklore Category with Accompaniments. In the Pop Category they are performing “I want you back” and “ABC” by Michael Jackson, a Stevie Wonder medley, “Uptown funk” by Bruno Mars, and a Queen medley.
Choir Leader Nisal Pathiraja said that says that his duty is to see that things run smoothly and take care of the other members.
“There are no special powers because we all consider ourselves as equals,” he said.
Nipun Kannangara is the Assistant Choir Leader. He said that he is looking forward to taking part in the World Choir Games.
“It has been a dream some years back but we were the ones who got the opportunity to turn it into a reality,” he enthused.
“When You Believe” is Nipuna’s favourite song out of the collection. He says that the song sounds amazing when the boys sing it on stage. This was one of the reasons why they managed to win the Gold medal at the Asia Pacific Choir Games.
Being able to pitch properly and the quality of a person’s voice matters a lot when you are a member of a choir. Meth Hettihewa notes that they faced a couple of auditions before being included in the final 40. He says that it is an honour to represent his school and the country at the event.
“The Asia Pacific Choir Games was a new experience for us. All the judges were foreigners and competing with foreign choirs and actually winning a medal boosted our confidence. Singing is only part of the choir. We have a lot of fun in the process. That is one of the keys to our success,” he said.
“The Hungarian gypsy song is the toughest song in the collection. “Uptown Funk” is one of our favourites. There is a lot of chorography involved in the songs,” Amiru Gamage said adding that more than winning the competition they would like to show the world that the Royal College choristers enjoy music.
