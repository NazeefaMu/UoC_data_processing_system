PUCSL to expedite grid connection of domestic solar plants

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), has directed the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity Company Private Limited (LECO) to connect domestic rooftop solar plants to the national grid within two weeks from the date of application.
“The direction to provide the connection for rooftop solar plants to the national grid in an efficient manner within a time fame will encourage people to move for solar power,” Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said.
Sri Lanka aims to add 200 mw of solar electricity to the national grid by 2020 and 1000 mw by 2025.
The PUCSL advised the distribution licensees (CEB and LECO) to expedite grid connection process of domestic rooftop solar plants within a time frame of two weeks. PUCSL asked CEB and LECO to ensure completion of the grid connection and signing the Net metering, Net accounting or Net Plus agreements within the time frame. Sri Lanka has 7904 domestic rooftop solar plants that are installed and connected to the national grid, data up to Novemeber 2016. This includes 256 rooftop solar plants in Southern province, 4806 plants in Western province, 184 plants in Central province, 105 plants in Sabaragamuwa province, 249 plants in North Western, 98 plants in North Central, 1707 plants in Northen province, 32 plants in Uva province and 73 solar plants in Eastern province.
The total domestic rooftop solar plants before the Soorya Bala Sangramaya (the energy battle for solar) stood at 6485 and increased to 7905 by end November 2016.
1420 domestic rooftop solar plants were added through Soorya Bala Sangramaya by end November 2016.
Generation of electricity through renewable energy sources has become a major concern for government as well as private sector investors.
The Government policy is to increase the existing 50 percent of the electricity generation based on the renewable energy sources to 60 percent by the year 2020 and to increase it further up to 70 percent by the year 2030 and to generate the total energy requirement through renewable and other indigenous energy resources by 2050.
