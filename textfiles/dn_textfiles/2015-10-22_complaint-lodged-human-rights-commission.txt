Non-payment of promotion arrears of teachers, principals
Complaint lodged at Human Rights Commission

The non-payment of promotion arrears of government school teachers and principals is a violation of human rights, said members of the Teachers and Principals Trade Union Collective who filed a complaint at the Human Rights Commission yesterday.
The arrears in relation to the promotion have been delayed and the officials were officially informed but no solution was received, Teachers and Principals Trade Union Collective convener Mahinda Jayasinghe said.
The complaint was lodged against the secretaries of the Education Ministry, Public Administration Ministry and the Finance Ministry.
A complaint was lodged against the delaying of promotion arrears of teachers and principals, Jayasinghe said.
He said the circulars issued in 2004, 2005 and 2009 were not implemented and the officials have failed to settle the promotion arrears.
Teachers and principals who were promotion have not received the arrears for the past 30 months, Jayasinghe said.
