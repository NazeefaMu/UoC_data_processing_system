Cricket fans given chance to purchase land at Lord's

Cricket fans around the world are to be offered the chance to buy parcels of land at Lord's, the home of the sport.
This remarkable opportunity launched on Wednesday will make possibly tens of thousands — or even more if the initiative is a success — part-owners of cricket's iconic ground for a cost of £500-per-share.
The consortium, who will be selling shares in the strip of underground tunnels that stretch the entire Nursery End of the ground, is being led by former England captain and Sky cricket presenter David Gower and former MCC chief executive Keith Bradshaw.
Other well known cricketers, including former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd and England batsman Alan Lamb, are expected to come out in support.
The scheme that is set to seriously divide the 18,000-strong MCC membership, one of sport's most famous private clubs, has nothing to do with the Lords's management as the land being sold is owned by property developer Charles Rifkind through his company Rifkind Associates.
And it is Rifkind's Plan B after his ambitious blueprint for the Nursery End that would have paid MCC £150million was rejected by the MCC membership last September by a landslide margin of over 90 per cent in favour of the club going it alone out of their own resources without any property development funding.
That was seen by MCC as final closure in a civil war that has been ongoing since 1999 when Rifkind bought a 999-year lease on the two defunct railway line tunnels under Lord's from Railtrack for £2.35m.
MCC chairman Gerald Corbett said of the vote: 'This is an unequivocal outcome that closes the door on the residential debate. The club will now move on to update the MCC Masterplan.'
But just six months later Rifkind, rather than disappear to oversee other areas of his property empire, has smashed open the Lord's door again to present the members as well as global lovers of cricket with another unprecedented option.
Rifkind calls it is a one-off opportunity to own an historic part of London which your grandchildren might benefit from.
Gower said: 'Although I supported redevelopment at the Nursery End, this is not a protest or reaction to the members voting against it last September. I should like to have a friendly association with MCC. I want Lord's to regain its status as the finest in the world.
'There is no sense of confrontation from my point of view and if I receive any flak, it cannot be as bad as what occurred to me when we lost the Ashes in 1989.'
The big sell will be accompanied by a huge advertising campaign with those buying into the Nursery End through the consortium named www.NewCommonwealth.com receiving a cryptocurrency coin as proof of purchase.
It is a long-term property play however — more likely to benefit future family generations of investors — as Lord's still have an 119-year lease on the top 18 inches of land above the tunnels.
However the belief is that if this project takes off, MCC will be forced to the negotiating table sooner rather than later by the sheer weight of numbers. And MCC members are likely to be offered a discounted price to buy a share or shares in the Nursery End.
