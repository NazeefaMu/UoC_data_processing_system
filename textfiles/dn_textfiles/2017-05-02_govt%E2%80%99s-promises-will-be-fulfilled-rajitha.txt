Govt’s promises will be fulfilled: Rajitha

The victims of the 30-year war are from the working class, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the ‘North and South May Day Rally for Humanity,’ held in Jaffna, organized by the Democratic National Movement.
“The Sinhalese soldiers and LTTE cardres who died in the war are children of the working class,” Minister Senaratne pointed out.
Dr. Senaratne said there is a delay in fulfilling the promises that the Yahapalana government gave the Tamil people in the North and as a Cabinet Minister, he said he rallies for Tamil’s rights in the Cabinet.
“At the 2015 Presidential Election, we promised the North to provide solutions to issues such as the ownership of land, political prisoners and disappearances. However, the Yahapalana government is yet to fulfill these promises,” Dr. Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne added that the government is taking all steps to fulfill these promises.
“I have called for a report containing statistics on all disabled people in the Northern Province. I have spoken with parents whose children have disappeared during war. I believe that all prisoners who cannot be charged based on the Criminal Code, should be released,” Minister Senaratne said.
Gamapaha MP Chatura Senaratne also spoke.
