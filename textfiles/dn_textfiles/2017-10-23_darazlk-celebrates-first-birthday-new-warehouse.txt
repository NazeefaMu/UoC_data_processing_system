Daraz.lk celebrates first birthday with new warehouse

Daraz.lk celebrates one year with the opening of a new warehouse and pick up location together with guests from Reckitt Bankiser’s Marketing Team Jude Martino and Daraz Regional Director Sumit Jasoria.
The expansion of the new warehouse facility was born out of an effort to keep up with the steady growth and success Daraz.lk has experienced within their first year of operation. The warehouse is located at Gregory’s Road Colombo 7 will be operational from Monday to Friday between 9:00 am and 6 pm.
“With our first birthday bringing us more success than we’d ever imagined and our order rate not just doubling but tripling within the year, we decided to celebrate in a way that is as always uniquely Daraz. We hoped to give back to everyone that made this a possibility namely our Customers and Sellers by giving them yet another service that would shape all our lives, in terms of convenience for customers with quicker deliveries and giving us more space for consignment stocks from sellers” said Daraz.lk’s Country Manager Bart Van Dijk.
The warehouse is equipped to handle faster deliveries within Colombo limits, enabling them to launch their latest effort, Daraz Express which will ensure quicker delivery times and act as the precursor to what they hope to soon offer with same day delivery.
