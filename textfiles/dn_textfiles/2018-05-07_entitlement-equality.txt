Entitlement to equality

Human Rights epitomise a complex, interactive, dialectical and yet unfortunately volatile relationship between people and their states. Human rights have taken a central importance in politics both inside and outside Sri Lanka. They demarcate the boundaries between the citizens and the civil society on the one hand, and the state and the political authorities on the other. The protection and promotion of human rights are considered to be important for peace, democracy and development throughout the world. From the perspective of history, ‘human rights’ is a successor term to ‘natural rights’ but there is a distinction between the two.
International Law
The adoption of the United Nations Charter in 1945 marked the beginning of a new stage in international law regulation of economic, social and cultural rights. (ESC Rights). The UN Charter states that one of the primary goals of the United Nations is the higher standard of living, full employment and conditions of economic and social progress and development. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted in 1948 contains an extended and specific list of ESC rights.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Article 22 provides that ‘everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organisation and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality’. The Declaration recognizes that ‘everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work’. The Declaration also recognizes the right of all workers ‘to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests’ and their ‘right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay’.
Article 6 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressly recognized livelihood or the right to earn a living, in the following manner –
1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts, and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right.
2. The steps to be taken by a State Party to the present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall include technical and vocational guidance and training programmes, policies and techniques to achieve steady economic, social and cultural development and full and productive employment under conditions safeguarding fundamental political and economic freedoms to the individual.
The Covenant also recognized the right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work which ensure, in particular, the remuneration which provides all workers, as a minimum, with:
(a) Fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value without distinction of any kind, in particular women being guaranteed conditions of work not inferior to those enjoyed by men, with equal pay for equal work;
(b) A decent living for themselves and their families in accordance with the provisions of the present Covenant.
The Covenant also guaranteed safe and healthy working conditions, equal opportunity for everyone to be promoted in his employment to an appropriate higher level, subject to no considerations other than those of seniority and competence, as well as rest, leisure and reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay, as well as remuneration for public holidays. States Parties to the Covenant also undertook to ensure the right of everyone to form trade unions and join the trade union of his choice, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, for the promotion and protection of these economic and social interests. The Covenant expressly provided that ‘No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others’.
ILO approach
The ILO approach to the practical implementation of human rights is based on three guiding concepts: laying down standards by way of Conventions and Recommendations, promotional and education activities, inquiring into complains and practical assistance in involving in applying policy standards and procedures. The ILO has promoted freedom of association, collective bargaining, equality of treatment at work and the abolition of forced and child labour as fundamental principles and rights at work over the period of time since its inception. In recent years, with globalization and open markets and the threat to workers’ right, the international community has felt the need to reaffirm the fundamental and universal character of these principles and rights embodied in the core-conventions, to ensure social justice uplifting and protecting livelihood and a fairer society. The ILO stress that good governance of workplaces is essential to the promotion of sustainable economic development.
Indian Constitution
Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty ‘except according to procedure established by law. This right is available to the citizens as well as non-citizens. Its ambit was widened by the Indian Supreme Court to say that the ‘procedure established by law’ had to be just fair and reasonable.
In Maneka Gandhi v Union of India, the Indian Supreme Court held that the right to ‘live’ is not merely confined to physical existence but it includes within its ambit the right to live with human dignity. Elaborating this view in Francis Coralie v Union Territory of Delhi the Court said that the right to live is not restricted to mere animal existence. The Court further held that non-payment of minimum wages to the workers amounted to the denial of their right to live with basic human dignity and violated Article 21.
In the case popularly known as the Pavement Dwellers’ case, the Indian Supreme Court observed that the word ‘life’ in Article 21 included the ‘right to livelihood’. It said that if the right to livelihood was not treated as part of the constitutional right to life, the easiest way of depriving a person of his right to life would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood. Therefore, right to livelihood is an integral facet of the right to life.
It is useful to note here that the phrase ‘the right to life has been given a wide interpretation in many jurisdictions. The first document of constitutional importance in which there is a reference to the right to life is the American Declaration of Independence, 1776. The 5th Amendment to the US Constitution (1791) consolidates this position.
