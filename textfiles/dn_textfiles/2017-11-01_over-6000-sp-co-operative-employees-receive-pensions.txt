Over 6,000 SP Co-operative employees to receive pensions

Over 6,000 Co-operative employees in the Southern Province will be provided with a pension, starting from January. The decision was conveyed by Co-operative Development Commissioner G. L. N. K. Kularatne, who recently visited the Co-operative Department in Galle. This decision was taken in consultation with the Chairman and General Manager of all Cooperative Societies in the Southern Province.
Accordingly, 80 percent of the final wage earned just before retirement is expected to be paid as a pension. The concept proposed by Southern Province Co-operative Minister U. G. D. Ariyathilaka, will have the same format as the pension scheme implemented by the North Western Provincial Co-operative Department.
The Beralapanathara and Beliatta Co-operative Societies already have a functioning pension scheme, but this will be a first for the Southern Province.
