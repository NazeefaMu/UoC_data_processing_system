Pechstein set for seventh Winter Olympics

Berlin: Germany's Claudia Pechstein, 45, is set to compete at her seventh Winter Olympics next February after claiming a World Cup victory in Norway on Sunday.
The five-time Olympic champion won the women's 5000m World Cup race at Stavanger by clocking 6min 56.60sec, having only needed a top-eight finish to qualify for Pyeongchang, for the 33rd World Cup win of her career.
She narrowly beat Canada's Ivanie Blondin, who finished second, despite being 18 years younger than Pechstein.
"I'm very, very proud of myself. I had set myself the goal of skating under seven minutes, but such a time is crazy for me," Pechstein told German broadcaster ZDF.
"I think I am on plan, now it is all about staying healthy and building on this form."
The Winter Games in South Korea take place from 9-25 February and Pechstein will turn 46 on the 22nd. The German is the most successful Olympic speed skater, male or female, of all-time. AFP
