Tragedies not so uncommon

I may dare not agree with most local book publishers and readers when they say that the literary genre known as ‘short story’ cannot be promoted and sold in the book market. The great short story writers such as Anton Chekhov from Russia and Guy du Maupassant from France have, over the years, proved that a commonplace slice of life - if sensitively created - may lead to penetrative insights. That is required from creative thinking.
The fact that the novel as a creative writing may have a popular appeal cannot be undermined. But the verdict cannot be passed in the taste and judgement on an aesthetic plane as regards the short story. I felt that good short story creations come as a gift from writers who consider the form of expression seriously. Right at the moment, I take the example set by the Sinhala writer Nihal Gunasekara on reading his latest collection of short stories titled as ‘Yasohamige Kathava Saha Tavat Katha’ (The Story of Yasohami and Other Stories).
Impending calamities
The title story of Yasohami revolves round the day to day life of an ageing mother and her three sons whose lives are portrayed as struggles. The mother sees and feels her surroundings torn between the day to day events and the impending calamities. Her eldest son, married, is drunkard more often than not with a pregnant wife.
The mother expects him to see her in a sober mood which she never faces. The second son, though not a drunkard, is being jilted by his girlfriend making him a mental sufferer. He is leading an agonised life looking after his ageing mother, who so desires to see him getting married.
But it never gets materialised. She sees how her son avoids the company of merrymakers and makes use of his isolation in a meditative mood. The third son has joined the army forces and is heard to be leading the life of a combat soldier, a would-be-hero, who is also torn between the world of life and death. The ageing mother desires to know ‘war news’ over the radio.
But she is sometimes sleepless, and restless, contemplating on the destiny of the youngest son of hers. She is accustomed to praying and religious deeds as she feels that it is the only way out of the calamity. But what does happen? She comes to know that the wife of the drunken elder son has given birth to a deformed, disabled, child. The youngest son has become an amputee - news brought over by the police officers and sent by the Army Headquarters in the distant war torn areas.
Plight befallen
The ageing mother who has solace from his mentally disturbed second son tries to adjust herself from the calamity via the understanding of the plight befallen. The reader too is made to feel that the essence of living depends on the feel of the pulse of the existing moment. The man lives from moment to moment.
The creative short story writer, Nihal Gunasekara, has shown in his short narratives, the selection of commonplace situations could be transformed into sensitive perceiving of human situations. Two good examples could be drawn from the short stories titled as ‘Issaraha Gedara (The House in Front) and Nadagan (Good for Nothing Affairs).
The portrayal of characters and situations are found, though as mundane, nevertheless envelope sensitive inner layers of expression.
The best short in the collection is titled as Muhunu Pothaka Avataraya (The Facebook Avatar). The central experience centres found a young girl who is shown as addicted to the use of facebook in her phone. She is isolated and for a long time cut off from the family matters. Her mother is worried. Her father has gone abroad to make a living for the betterment. Her bribes and sisters are worried over her behaviour. The most innocent of them happen to be the mother, who never knows what actually happens. One day, the protagonist the girl, enmeshed in the facebook, sees her own photograph being dismantled to the point that she sees a nude body attached to her. She in dismay does not know what had befallen. In order to relieve out of the tragedy, it is claimed that she should give Rs 50,000. She falls down from her dream.
Forgetful image
She is disillusioned by the dismay that she has to undergo. From hitherto onwards, she discards the face book letting go off the suffering completely forgetful of her image. The story is well written containing a layer of human interest. I use this creative piece as a classroom exercise in creative communication.
As stated by literary critic, Malcolm Bradbury, the short story has become an adventurous, inventive, very various and, above all, a discovering form.
