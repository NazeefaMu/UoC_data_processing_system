New cricket selection committee

Having earlier made the announcement that former Sri Lanka fast bowler Graeme Labrooy will be the new chairman of cricket selectors, it is reliably learnt that Sri Lanka Cricket has sent the names of the following former cricketers Asanka Gurusinha, Gamini Wickremasinghe and Jerry Woutersz to the Minister of Sports for ratification.
Gurusinha who is the current cricket manager of the national team retains his position as national selector having served in the previous committee headed by Sanath Jayasuriya that resigned at the end of the Indian series on September 7.
The first task of the new selection committee is to pick the Sri Lanka squad for the two Test series against Pakistan in the UAE starting later this month.
