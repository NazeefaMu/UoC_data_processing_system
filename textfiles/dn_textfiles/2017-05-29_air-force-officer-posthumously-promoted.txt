Air Force officer posthumously promoted

Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) Officer Y.M. Yaparathna, who died during the rescue operations following the floods, was yesterday promoted posthumously. The Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) said.
The Air Force Officer sustained serious injuries after he fell off an aircraft, while he was engaging in a rescue operation in the Neluwa area, Galle last Friday. He was rescuing flood victims with the help of a cable when the accident happened.
Admitted to the Karapitiya Hospital, he had succumbed to injuries.
