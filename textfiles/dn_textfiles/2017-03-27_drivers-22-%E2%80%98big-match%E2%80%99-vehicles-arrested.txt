Drivers of 22 ‘Big Match’ vehicles arrested

The drivers of 22 vehicles participating in ‘big match’ vehicle processions in Colombo have been arrested by the Police for violating traffic laws.
The vehicle processions were organized by students of two leading schools in Colombo. The drivers had been arrested by Borella and Kurunduwatte Police officers on Saturday. Police Headquarters recently issued a warning that strict action will be taken against such vehicle parades obstructing traffic and inconveniencing the public.
Police issued the warning following a group of students from a leading boys’ school in Colombo unlawfully entered a girls’ school and behaved in an unruly manner recently.
Police said legal action will be initiated against those arrested on Saturday.
