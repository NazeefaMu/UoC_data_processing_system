Revised Code of Conduct, Standing Orders for MPs

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he received a detailed report on the unruly behaviour of MPs during the last Parliamentary session on January 10 and it would be referred to the Privileges Committee to take disciplinary action.
Responding to a question by journalists at a press briefing in Parliamentary Complex, yesterday, the Speaker said the new Code of Conduct for MPs and the revised set of Standing Orders would be adopted in House next Tuesday (23).
The Speaker, regretting the misbehaviour of MPs in Parliament, said Sri Lanka Parliament, which has received the admiration of the Inter-Parliamentary Union as an “exemplary Parliament,” must strive to retain that status.
He added that the set of Parliament Standing Orders (SOs) currently in use, was formulated in 1979 and last revised in 1993. The new set of SOs has proposed stricter measures against members misbehaving in House.
