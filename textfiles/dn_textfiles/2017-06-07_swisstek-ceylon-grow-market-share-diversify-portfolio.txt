Swisstek Ceylon to grow market share, diversify portfolio

Swisstek Ceylon PLC is looking to grow its market share over the next few years by leveraging on its diversified portfolio.
However the company expects that its decision to open the aluminium market via the free trade agreement to Chinese suppliers will be a challenge for it to retain market share.
Going forward, the company plans to introduce proprietary system windows and doors and new innovative products in the aluminium industry. Following a further investment of Rs.560 million, the extrusion capacity will be increased to 1,000 MT per month in 2017/18 enabling the company to manufacture larger aluminium extrusion.
In a challenging environment, the revenue of the company increased by 20% to Rs. 608 million, as a result of increased demand and value added product categories. Swisstek (Ceylon) PLC group posted a robust performance for the year ended March 31, 2017. The company is mining its wealth of resources and knowledge base in a way that expands internal efficiencies and creates streamlined systems and processes. Swisstek Ceylon was able to increase its flooring product range and diversify the product portfolio. Technological and infrastructure developments include a new plant, increase in warehouse capacity and new product supply chain.
Swisstek (Ceylon) is a leading supplier of wooden flooring, tile grout and tile mortar in the local market and their products manufactured to international quality standards cannot be compared with low-cost substitutes available in the market. (IH)
