Over 7,000 SDD officials to receive appointment letters: Minister

Over 7,000 Samurdhi Development Department (SDD) officials would receive appointment letters during a ceremony to be held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium, tomorrow.
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa would also participate in the ceremony, Housing and Social Welfare Minister Wimal Weerawansa said.
“In addition, 1,135 Samurdhi managers will receive their appointment letters from the Public Service Commission,” he said.
He was addressing the media during a press conference at his Ministry, yesterday.
The minister added that he would submit a Cabinet paper next week, ensuring the necessary privileges to Samurdhi Development Department employees who had retired, as well as for the families of those who had passed away.
He added that issuing appointment letters to department officials did not mean that they would be given new jobs in the public sector.
“These officials who are currently in service, will receive their appointment letters as employees attached to the department,” he said.
