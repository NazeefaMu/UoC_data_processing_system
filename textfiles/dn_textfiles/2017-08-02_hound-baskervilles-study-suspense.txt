THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES: A STUDY IN SUSPENSE

Written as a powerful fiction that became a modern classic in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created two characters based in London of the time as two detectives, Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. Watson who practiced their profession at 221B Baker Street. So realistic was the address that people from and around London, sought their assistance to solve mysteries and so great was this fictional address that led to the creation of clubs such as Baker Street Irregulars in New York in 1935, Sherlock Holmes Society of London in 1951 and a Sherlock Holmes collection in Marylebon Public Library in London.
This was their Scotland Yard they believed in. All criminal cases and murders were handled by Holmes and Watson so much so that people in trouble visited 221B Baker Street, London until the internet replaced this address that was fictions much like Holmes and Watson when they realized they were no better than other fictions such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza or for that matter like Steinbeck's George and Lennie and may be like of Mice and Men who were seen as two sides of the same person as Holmes and Watson. The difference that modeled Sherlock Homes as an armature detective and together they appear in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in 1891 and the Memories of Sherlock Holmes in 1894 which are collection of short stories. Conan Doyle who made his detective look partly like a teacher from Edinburgh but known for his powers for detection in the field of medicine. He was made to appear as rather an eccentric man because of his behaviuor with such unusual gifts. However, to all of us Dr. Watson appear less original and not quick in the uptake.
Getting rid of Sherlock Holmes
By the time Holmes became globally famous, Conan Doyle was tired and exasperated writing on him and planned willfully to 'finish' him off but his readers demanded him to continue. He was already tired of his hero and allowed him to fall to his death from Swiss Alps in the story of The Final Problem. He had to 'resurrect' Sherlock Holmes back to life for further adventures as recorded and collected by Dr. Watson in The return of Sherlock Holmes in 1914, His Last Bow in 1917 and The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes in 1927.The first edition of The Hound of The Baskervilles was in 1902.
SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
Who was a doctor from Edinburgh University was in service from 1891. He was knighted in 1902 after his work in field hospital in Bloemfontein during the South African War from 1899 to 1891.
He most probably may have drawn the character of Dr. Watson from where he worked, Edinburgh University. Conan Doyle used basic language sans literary brilliance but it superseded many books of his time mainly because he was a man of medicine but loaded with imagination beyond what a mind can conceive.
THE LEGEND BEHIND THE HOUND
One of the most complicated and harrowing legends I have read over and again to feel its intended impact, Hound of the Baskervilles is spiced up in mystery, intrigue, suspense and ideology making the reader's mind reel and spin… The story has many compelling questions posed such as this conversation with the cabman hired by Holmes in a situation that pointed to wrong identities and made Holmes laugh at himself but making the mystery deeper and deeper :-
'They told me later that a gentleman at this address was asking for 2704.
I have driven this cab for seven years. What do you have against me?
'I have nothing against you, my good man' said Holmes but have a half sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my question'
'Well, I've had a good day and no mistake. What was it you wanted, Sir?
'First of all your name and address
'John Clayton, 3, Turpey Road
Sherlock Holmes made a not of it.
'Now, Clayton, tell me about your passenger who came and watched this house at ten o'clock this morning
The cabman looked surprised.
'Why, there is no good in telling you things you already know. The gentle man told me he was a detective and that I was to say nothing to anyone. 'My good fellow, you may find yourself in a rather bad position if you try to hide anything from me. Dis he say anything more ?
'He said his name'
'What was his name?
'His name, said the cabman was' Sherlock Holmes'.
Never had I seen my friend more surprised. Then he burst out laughing.
The cabman was happy left when he left and Holmes turned to me,
'I tell you Watson, this time we are fighting a very clever man. I can only wish you better luck in Devonshire than here in London but I do not like sending you. Towards the end of the story and in the dark night of Dartmoor was the site where the legendary Hound of The Baskervilles stay hidden. Obviously two men hid on the moor to be apprehended later. Holmes and Dr. Watson combed through evidence why Barrymore the butler kept watch at the window. Did they expect the Hound to be back to hunt Sir Henry Baskerville. As they kept probing one after the other, fresh clues emerged for the detectives to consider whether Sir Charles walked away from the house and not towards it. Obviously, Sir Henry was in full control of the situation and well focused.
Stapleton’s plan
In the meantime and on last day, Mrs. Stapleton knew her husband was in the outhouse and planned to kill Sir Henry. She was angry and would not allow him to do so. She would go out and tell the people of his plan and therefore he tied her up until Holmes and Watson discovered and saved her life.
Stapleton's plan to get the money and set himself as the master of the Hall, intrigued and baffled Holmes and Watson but they were aware if somehow he found the money he will move in with his mistress to the Hall.
Or would he?
There was Mrs. Stapleton whom he thought was dead and Sir Henry and the wining of the unfortunate Hound whose death call, will haunt him forever.
As for Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, there was more work waiting for them at Baker Street.
