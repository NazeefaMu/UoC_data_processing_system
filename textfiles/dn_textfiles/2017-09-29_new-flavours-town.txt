New flavours in town

&Co, the exclusive pub and restaurant of The Steuart by Citrus recently unveiled a new menu with 17 exclusive dishes for a whole new experience. Catering mainly to western cuisine lovers since its inception two years ago, The Steuart sits in the elegant Dutch Hospital.
The Steuart’s &Co Pub and Restaurant’s existing menu undergoes a transformation every four to six months, adding in tastes and flavours inspired from the west to the orient. The chefs at &Co have decided to include 17 new dishes comprising three kinds of bites, 13 mains and one dessert.
Starters at &Co present an interesting combination of the finest Italian flavours wrapped in the ‘Italian Delight’ along with an infusion of Mediterranean delicacies discovered in the ‘Cold Mezze Platter’. The Italian Delight uses high grade ingredients such as the Buffalo Mozzarella and the Parma ham imported directly from Italy, and will be served with melon and tomatoes offering a rich blend of flavours.
As for desserts, the &Co has made another change by placing three varieties of dessert choices on a single platter. According to Chef Panduka, The Steuart is popular for offering sizable dessert platters for its customers. But as majority of its customers are office employees from the neighbourhood, they prefer a quick luncheon and often overlook the desserts due to time constraints. Taking the matter into account Chef Panduka and his team of culinary experts have introduced the ‘Trio of Desserts’ with a three in one option, appealing to more palettes. The new dessert menu will offer you a combo of Tiramisu, Chocolate Mousse and Apple Tart.
As for the Main dishes, &Co has prioritised on preserving its Scottish -British flavours while catering to the rising demands of traditional Sri Lankan flavours. Creating new trends in the gastronomic encounters, &Co presents its new menu serving ‘Vegetable Risotto’, ‘Traditional Sri Lankan Beef Curry’ and ‘Thai Me Up’. While the Risotto caters to veggie lovers, the traditional Sri Lankan Beef Curry satisfies the meat lovers seeking authentic taste in pork and beef curries outside their homes. And for those craving for a spicy yet saucy noodle dish, ‘Thai Me Up’ is the ideal choice. Inspired by Mongolian flavours, Thai Me Up incorporates the Pad Thai noodle and comes in 4 distinct varieties such as Chicken, Beef, Pork and veggie.
Chef Panduka of The Steuart’s &Co Pub and Restaurant explained that ‘bites’ are essentially a Sri Lankan requisite whereas Europeans don’t usually consume bites with their drinks. &Co Pub has introduced three kinds of bites including Beef stew, Battered Oyster Mushrooms, and Marinated Chicken Skewers flaunting a Mediterranean touch.
