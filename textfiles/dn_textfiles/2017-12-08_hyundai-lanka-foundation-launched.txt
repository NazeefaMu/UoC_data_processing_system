Hyundai Lanka  Foundation launched

Hyundai Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Sri Lanka's sole authorised importer and distributor of Hyundai vehicles, announced the launch of Hyundai Lanka Foundationon Wednesday (06), to uplift and empower people through selected charitable organisations.
Established as a subsidiary of Hyundai Lanka (Pvt) Limited, The Hyundai Lanka Foundation will operate with a strong CSR vision to enable the people of Sri Lanka from vulnerable and marginalised communities to achieve their full potential through holistic social and entrepreneurialdevelopment with a focus on education, life skills and health.
To achieve its vision, Hyundai Lanka Foundation will allocate LKR Rs. 10,000 for every Hyundai vehicle sold from the month of December and will channel the fund to a worthy cause or for the betterment of an impoverished community. As a first initiative, the Foundation has partnered with the SOS Children's Villages Sri Lanka this season and will support the villages by directing the funds collected during the seasonal transactions for the improvement of the SOS Villages Sri Lanka, which is focused on providing a loving home for every child.
Commenting on the launch of the Hyundai Lanka Foundation, Julian Reuter, Director of Hyundai Lanka (Pvt) Ltd said, “Although Sri Lanka is experiencing rapid socio-economic growth, the country continues to be challenged with a large number of unemployed youth, children and deprived communities with a need for basic livelihoods. With the establishment of the Hyundai Lanka Foundation, we aim to contribute to mitigate these numbers by collaborating with non-governmental forward thinking organisations to drive our CSR vision in the long term. We are certain that the Foundation will occupy a strong foothold and will help the country's most pressing issues in the long term.”
With the support of the Hyundai network, we look forward to reaching out to and garner more participation from individuals, organisations, hospitals and other NGOs to join us in our CSR drive to help improve the country and the lives of its people.
Speaking about the partnership, Ananda B. Karunarathne, National Director at SOS Children's Villages Sri Lanka said, “Whilst we are honoured to partner with one of the world's most renowned automotive brands, we also recognise and understand the approach of the Hyundai Lanka Foundation to fuel hope for the people of Sri Lanka, which strives to be considerate, compassionate. We believe that the establishment of Hyundai Lanka Foundation will not only help to empower children across the country but will also enable the country to achieve new heights in building a prosperous nation”
