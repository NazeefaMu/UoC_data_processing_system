Teenage couples loitering at Nikaweratiya held

Nikaweratiya police nabbed over 56 teenage couples in the last couple of weeks.
Nearly all of them are students, police said.
They had pretended to their parents that they were going to private classes on weekends and had gone with their friends. They had received money from parents and were loitering at public places and isolated areas. Many of them had expensive mobile phones at the time, Nikaweratiya Police OIC I.P.G. Sirisena said.
Their parents were summoned to police and handed over the children to them, police said.
