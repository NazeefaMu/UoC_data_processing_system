Rooting out Trees, strangling Wanni life

“My husband owns this land. Here we were not able to grow any crops for a long time because of the war. After the war, the government returned the land to us. Our homes are in Kilinochchi; we have started cultivating this land now. Legally, we can remove unnecessary timber on our land if we need,” 61-year-old Sinnamma said. Sinnamma does not know about the gravity of the environmental harm the felling of trees causes. After all she has returned to her land at Mukkappan in Kilinochchi after 30 long years. She just wants to restart cultivation and live in peace on her own land.
She simply feels overjoyed and grateful as she finally got the opportunity to carry on with her life. But opportunistic politicians and timber smugglers exploit people like her to carry out complex and massive timber smuggling operation.
An investigation into the illicit timber trade in the area revealed that many resettled people in the area have cultivated beyond the acre of land given to them by the government. Timber smugglers also use these lands to carry out their illegal logging. Kilinochchi soil is rich in iron. It contains a red-yellow latosol, silica, and aluminium oxides. Its colour is so distinct it was called ‘Thamirawani’, which was later led to the region being called the Wanni. It is also the root of the names ‘Thamirawani’, ‘Thambuwani’, ‘Thammanna’ or ‘Thambapanni’ - the ancient names of the island. The Kilinochchi district spans 1,279 sq. km. and 32km towards Mannar from the Mukkappan-Arassapuram Forest Reserve. The regional temperature is quite high. Rains mostly come once a year. But now anyone can hardly predict the rain. Perhaps the increased deforestation may have caused the climate change, but Sinnamma and her family prefer not to think too much of the bigger picture,
“We were very happy now. We had to flee the region when the war erupted. We simply had no choice. My husband, two sons and daughter were taken by the movement (LTTE) several times. At the end, my youngest son and I left Mukkappan. When we were in Kilinochchi, the war was at its worst. However, my husband and two sons used to visit us in secret,” she said. “Just as we left, they also left us,” her daughter Thangamma said. She was forced to work with the LTTE. After the war, Thangamma was sent to a rehabilitation camp and she returned home a year after.
“Now we three carry on with our lives without much fuss,” she added. However, what they had gone through, the pain and trauma, have not left them. Their eyes show it all, and the pain they underwent at the loss of their family members still haunts them. Sinnamma and her family, like many other resettled families in the area, got only permits to their lands. They were not given title deeds as they expected.
The Mukkappan-Arassapuram Reserve lies to the right of Sinnamma’s land. Further into the reserve, one can witnessed the clearings where once were trees. The trees lie strewn about, felled, torn from their roots - the pristine environment that was once there, has gone. Huge machines had been used for logging and clearing.
The reserve is now a centre of a massive illegal timber operation. Several valuable trees were logged and taken away. Many are being sawed. Our guide made us know that an organised group was involved in the illegal logging operation.
As we proceeded, we heard the noise of felling trees and birds' restless cries. We saw around two acres of cleared land and the people on it preparing for some other illegal task. As we approached them, they stopped working and shockingly looked at us and the camera in our hands. Raju, one of the workers, informed us that they do any work for a day wager.
“The man who owned this land asked us to clear this area. He told us that this was his land and that he had all the documents to prove it. That’s why we work here. We have heard that many fell the trees in the forest and take them away. I don’t know who they are. We are not residents of this area,” he said. As we left the area, we turned around to see them get on bicycles and disappear further into the forest. They might not have told us the truth. Perhaps, they were being exploited for the timber smuggling and land grabbing operations.
About 40 km from the site, lies the district Forest Officer’s office. It houses two buildings. When we reached the office, a woman at a desk informed us that the officer just had his lunch and was resting in the next building. Back at the office, he told us that the LTTE cadres run the group; Posi, Suman, and Pradeepan. They fell trees and transporting them to areas in Kilinochchi and Jaffna. Sseveral government officials helped them because they (officials) want to transport their contraband across.
“We do not get any support to arrest them. We have only seven officers and are extremely short staffed. Our officers do not speak Tamil, so it is very difficult for us to carry out our work. During raids, we have many problems since we cannot communicate in Tamil,” he said. If we received more assistance from the police, we would apprehend them,” he said.
“The problem, however, is that they have support from many government officials. It is under their supervision they transport the timber via forest routes to Kilinochchi and Jaffna,” the official said. As the authorities turn a blind eye, trees in close to 12 sq.km of the Mukkappan-Arasapuram area had been ravaged, logged and transported.
If the deforestation continues, the already parched land will face acute water shortages. Apart from the human catastrophe, we are also facing great biodiversity losses that have already made the impacts of climate change very real to all in the Wanni.
