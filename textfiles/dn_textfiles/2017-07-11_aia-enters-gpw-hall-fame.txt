AIA enters GPW Hall of Fame

AIA Sri Lanka takes great pride in entering ‘Sri Lanka’s Best Companies to Work for - Hall of Fame,’ as the company collects its 5th consecutive Great Place To Work recognition. This incredible achievement is testament to AIA’s commitment to doing the right thing, the right way and most importantly, with the right people.
AIA is about being pre-eminent and constantly raising the bar. It is about empowering its people and creating the most conducive work environment, so everyone can be the best they can be. AIA believes that surveys such as Great Place To Work have provided valuable insights, which are essential indicators of the level to which employees are connected to the company. By employing a process called ‘Impact Planning’ AIA is able to use that in-depth understanding to improve the employee experience. AIA’s success over the last five years as a ‘Great Place to Work’ demonstrates that this systematic approach in listening and acting on what employee say, is very effective.
AIA’s Director Human Resources Chathuri Munaweera commented; “at AIA we recognize the vital role of the ‘leader’ in empowering our employees. This GPW recognition is testimony that our leaders, at all levels, have continued to successfully create a conducive, business savvy workplace which engages employees and brings out the best in them.”
“We have a very special culture here at AIA” she added; “It is a bond between people that surpasses the business of the organization and is prevalent across all functions, across all employees regardless of position or designation. I believe it’s what keeps us together, moving towards one common goal.”
She further commented that “gender parity is central to having a dynamic balanced workforce and we have a special programme to ensure this parity while encouraging and motivating women employees to continue working and reach greater heights. We also have many measures to enable our female employees to balance ‘home and career’, including support endeavours during early motherhood. I am proud to note that females now make up 35% of our workforce.”
CEO Pankaj Banerjee congratulated AIA’s employees for the spirit of company before self, adding that “the consecutive awards alongside the growth and performance of the company shows that we continue to get the balance right.” He added, “Life insurance is very much about people and our employees are our best brand ambassadors. Knowing that our employees believe in and are engaged with the vision and direction of the Company, demonstrates to the leadership team, that we are doing the right thing the right way with the right people, to get the right results.”
