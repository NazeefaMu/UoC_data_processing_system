Victoria Golf and Country Resort: Luxurious relaxation

The Victoria Golf and Country Resort is beautiful, luxurious and elegant resort located in the picturesque environs of Rajawella. The Golf course has been ranked among the ‘100 Most Beautiful Golf Courses in the World’ and is the proud winner of the award for ‘The Best Golf Course in the Subcontinent’.
However not many people are aware that The Victoria Golf and Country Resort is a resort of a very high standard offering comfort and to quality service. Daily News visited the resort and experienced first- hand how wonderful it is to stay there. Personalized attention is a feature of the resort which exceeds expectation. It is ideal for relaxation away from the hustle and bustle of Colombo.
The rooms were tastefully designed and had all the creature comforts necessary to make the stay a most memorable one. The food the resort offers is sumptuous and the ambience was just perfect. All in all it was a blissful experience. The cuisine was of excellent quality ranging from traditional Sri Lankan to Western and Asian Cuisines.
The property is 517 acres of Land Area including the Golf Course which is a 120 acres 18 hole, finished in 73 strokes for a professional. It is a world class golf course.
The golf course is the vision of Mark Bostock, leader of Rajawella Holdings who had the dream of creating a world class golf course in Sri Lanka. For this he selected the UK National Golf Architect Donald Steel who drew up a plan for an 18-hole golf facility. This was in 1992. In 1997 the designing started.
“And today we have a majestically crafted masterpiece full of breathtaking scenery. Here much attention was given to detail such as the locations for the greens, and the shaping was done with machines which produced excellent results. The opening was in 1999. In 1999, a hundred golfers gathered for the opening and played for the Donald Steel Trophy. However Bostock’s vision was to turn this into a golf resort, where you have a golf course as well as a residence around,” said Resort’s General Manager, Asela Wavita.
Wavita pointed out that there is a Junior Academy where there are 40 – 45 kids at the moment. They are given a good foundation and sessions are fun. They just launched golf at Trinity College and they are looking to take it to other schools in Kandy to promote golf. There is also the dream of starting the school tournament in Kandy as well. The Victoria Golf Club is open to membership and the club has a great atmosphere.
“When initially building the golf course, it was a lot of hard work since at that time, this was a high security zone. But after some time, and after getting through a lot of red tape, the project was finished and now we have a golf course that we can be proud of. And now every February we have the Donald Steel Championship,” stated Wavita
As for the resort itself the target is to have around 50 rooms by early 2020. Some of the activities that the resort offers at present are nature treks which are ideal for wildlife enthusiasts and horse riding. He added that they are looking forward to add watersports as well. When it comes to weddings the resort is in demand and a wedding at this resort will definitely be memorable. The golf course is excellent for socializing and just having fun.
