KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
Two Kandy products coach Kingswood and Joes

Both Kingswood and St. Joseph's will go flat out for victory in the semi finals of the President's trophy knockout tournament, at the Sugathadasa Stadium. Both schools are coached by products of Kandy - Dinesh Gamage of Kingswood and Nilufer Ibrahim of St. Joseph's. Both teams have steadily improved and today’s match should be an indicator to that. For Kingswood the forwards will be their main strength with their ball carrying ability and should give the side much needed momentum. Their fly half Asiri Seneviratne is also expected to give off his best by creating opportunities for his team-mates with his impressive skills. For the Josephians although they are playing in Colombo, a win in this all important game is a must. Their backs division comprises good players who are a genuine threat in attack and If they get the ball they are sure to dominate.
Siva to head
The AGM of the Old Trinitians Scrummage will take place today in Colombo, and former Trinity, Combined schools and Kandy SC prop forward Siva “Playakats” Subramanium is tipped to take over the chairmanship and continue the good work done by the earlier chairman. Scrummage’s object is to promote the advancement and progress of rugby in concurrence with the Principal, to enlist the support of former rugby players of the school, to foster fellowship among all former rugby players and to raise funds in support of rugby
Golf winners
The Rajawella Victoria Golf and Country resort did well to pocket both men and women’s golfing events at the 2nd Victoria Gregory Golf Derby which took place at Rajawella recently. This is the second win for this golf club, they won it in the inaugural year both events. This event was held in the best 18-hole golf courses, which is stretching across a spacious area of 517 acres, the Victoria Golf course is a challenge, because of its terrain, to even veterans of the sport.
Kandy’s cricket can improve with more support and facilities
Despite 10 schools playing top class cricket in Kandy, the town hasn’t been able to play in the Division I of the Premier Cricket Tournament of the country, for a few years now. The main reasons for the drop in club cricketing standards is that the players don’t have a regular playground for practices and even for matches. All rivalry and no proper support for players have badly neglected the sport. The two clubs, which are playing Division I cricket, are Kandy Cricket Club and the Kandy Youth Sports Club, while several clubs played in Division II.
Kandy Cricket Club is one of the oldest clubs and in the early days it was known as Kandy SC and played cricket. Later due to BCCSL suspension, they formed the Kandy CC which has produced a galaxy of top players. Kandy Youth SC is not an old club, but play good cricket but hasn’t risen to Division I level.
In Kandy, clubs have to play a significant role as nurseries, but it is unfortunate that cricket, at grass root level in clubs, is not as developed as it should be, mainly due to not having proper grounds for practices, clubs are run on a self help basis. They are lucky to have good presidents and committee members, who help to generate funds to keep the clubs alive.
The financial assistance from the controlling body is insufficient as whenever they go out they have to spend a lot on accommodation, food and transport. In the meantime there is a growing list of young schoolboys and school-leavers being attracted to Colombo clubs.
The newly formed Kandy DCA committee is going all out to put things in order.
Maheshika leads Mahamaya to win
Maheshika Hewage led Mahamaya Girls College to emerge champions at the 4th annual inter school swimming championship, which took place at the VA Sugathadasa Stadium. This was their 20th win in a row.
Trinity failed at rugby this season
Trinity College failed to live up to expectations in rugby. They started the season, with a player’s death through a heat stroke, on the first day's training off a road run when he collapsed and died. Then in the league they were placed sixth the lowest. ranking ever, and in the knockouts came up to the quarters and were shown the exit door.
KMC inter-department football
Due to the keenness of the Mayor Kessara Senanayake to promote sports among the staff, members an inter department 7-a-side football tournament will take place today at the “Rakade” P.T. Rajan play grounds where over 12 teams will be seen in action. The tournament will be played under the patronage of the Mayor and Opposition leader Sena Dissanayake.
KC AGM
One of the oldest clubs in the Central Province the Kandy Club will holds its AGM next Saturday 30 June in the evening followed by fellowship.
It is customary that the incumbent president will continue as president for a period of not less than three years with some of the committee members of his choice unless some others who are interested come forward to contest.
In the past those who were enrolled as members were of a different caliber and were all professionals and planters, but in this era you hardly get personalities that the club can expect.
Today this club has forgotten all the past good work.
