Central Bank highlights need for fuel pricing formula

The need for a cost reflective pricing formula for domestic fuel prices has been highlighted in the Central Bank’s latest annual report.
Price reforms for petroleum products have been a long-standing policy issue in Sri Lanka due to its direct impact on the cost of living and the cost of production as well as on the overall macroeconomic stability, the report says.
In the global market oil prices rose above US$70 yesterday for the first time since 2014. In June 2016, the prices remained at the level of US$ 48.
Economists say significant increase in imports due to under pricing of fuel adversely affects Sri Lanka’s balance of payments and puts pressure on the currency. “Static retail prices where global cost of fuel imports increases results in increasing losses to Ceylon Petroleum Corporation which are eventually borne by the tax payer. Current CPC debt to state banks is around Rs 333 billion which is not sustainable,” they point out. The cost of petroleum products comprises Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) price, terminal charges for storage and bulk distribution, transport costs, exchange rate variation cost, short-term financing costs and personnel and overhead costs of the CPC.
The petroleum sector of Sri Lanka is dominated by CPC, a strategically important state-owned business enterprise, which accounts for approximately 86 per cent of the retail market share. Sri Lanka depends heavily on imported petroleum products to meet the primary and secondary energy requirement of the country. Moreover, as a small net-oil importing country, Sri Lanka is a price taker in the global market. Due to the high impact of petroleum prices on the cost of production, and thereby the cost of living, setting of petroleum prices has always been a politically sensitive issue in the country. However, non-adjustment of retail fuel prices to reflect their costs has seriously challenged the financial viability of the CPC on numerous occasions while creating macroeconomic imbalances and in fact lowering consumer welfare.
Under pricing of fuel will result in over–consumption of fuel. The result is increased levels of traffic and also higher generation of pollution. Over the last few years, there’s been a drastic increase in fuel imports into the country.
If there is a pricing formula, “as global prices change, Sri Lanka’s retail prices will adjust accordingly, with in-built measured to prevent excess volatility. A transparent formula can be implemented with a gradual progression towards full implementation to avoid a sharp disruption,” according to an economic analyst.
Other regional countries such as India, Pakistan, Philippines, Nepal and Laos have successfully implemented oil pricing systems.
The Central Bank also said, the implementation of a cost reflective pricing mechanism also needs to be extended to other utilities as well, to ensure the financial viability of the relevant state-owned business enterprises.
