USS Anchorage, Suranimila conduct exercise

The USS Anchorage joined the Sri Lankan naval ship Suranimila to conduct an exercise at sea on August 28.
The exercise allowed the ships to improve each crews’ knowledge and strengthen a wide variety of seamanship skills critical to operating throughout a free and open Indo-Pacific region. During the exercise, multiple ships sailed in formation to practice communications and maneuvering procedures. In addition to the Anchorage and Suranimila, two landing craft air cushions (LCACs), one AH-1Z Cobra helicopter, and one UH-1Y Huey helicopter participated.
