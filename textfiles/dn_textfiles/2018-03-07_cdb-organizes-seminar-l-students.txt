CDB organizes seminar for A-L students

Building on its deep-rooted commitment to youth empowerment, Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB), launched its knowledge based CSR initiative by organizing a seminar for advanced level students in a bid to equip them with holistic knowledge that would steer them towards sustainable careers.
Titled, Citizens’ Wisdom Path and constructed on the theme, ‘Build beyond the future’, CDB conducted the seminar in Colombo for 310 students of the commerce stream and thirty teachers from selected schools in the Western province.
Using the learned resources of highly acclaimed academic personnel from the Faculty of Management and Finance of the University of Colombo, the students were taken through the rudiments of writing examination papers, maximising results through effective studying and being psychologically prepared for the pressure of examinations.
In adding further value to the knowledge gathering process, these resource personnel also touched on common errors done by students when attempting examinations and also the practical application of human resource management in workplaces in both the public and private sectors.
An important facet in youth empowerment was highlighted by CEO of Unisons Capital Leasing Limited and President of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing Karthik Elangovan when he explained about the demand required for the labour market by 2030.
“There are manifold skills, talents and competencies that are required for jobs of the future and this includes soft skills, not simply academic and professional qualifications,” he stated. “One of the fundamentals that has become the platform for an organisation’s success is honing the qualities of good productive teams and instilling leadership skills in team leaders. It is these facets that ensure career progression enabling young people like you attain their career aspirational goals.”
CDB, Director and CCO Roshan Abeygoonewardena stated that, “Given the success of this seminar, we intend to continue this series with young people around the country as we believe it is vital they are given the knowledge on the fundamentals required to be successfully employed in the career of their choice. As a responsible corporate steward, CDB feels it is important that young people are given the fundamentals to empower themselves and become productive effective contributors to national development.”
