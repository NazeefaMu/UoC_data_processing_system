Jaffna treats at OZO Colombo

OZO Colombo recently launched a mouth-watering selection of Jaffna cuisine with the introduction of the theme night, ‘Yaal Meets West,’ at their EAT Restaurant. Every Sunday evening from 7 pm, diners will be treated to an explosion of taste infused with traditional Jaffna and western Sri Lankan flavours, creating the perfect balance of taste and textures.
From the fan-shaped leaves to the root, the Palmyra palm forms an essential part of the life and cuisine in the Northern region of Sri Lanka. This is apparent in the buffet selection available at EAT, OZO Colombo.
The distinct spice combinations from Northern Sri Lankan have been infused together to bring specialities, such as the signature soup, known as Odiyal Kool, of the north. Odiyal Kool is a seafood broth that encapsulates the flavours of the Indian Ocean from crabs to fish, cuttlefish, prawns and crayfish with hints of tamarind. The dish is thickened using a Palmyra root flour, which is authentic to Jaffna cuisine. Other starters include the Yaal vegetable platter, which bring the western Sri Lankan traditional treats, such as fish and vegetable rotis.
Other chart toppers at the Yaal Meets West buffet at OZO Colombo include the mutton pooriyal, a traditional fiery Jaffna crab curry, and the ginger-flavoured fish curry with turai kholumbu.
