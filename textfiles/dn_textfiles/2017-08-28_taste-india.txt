Taste of India

“Prasthaan” a Bollywood themed Street Food Festival organized by the Batch Eight students of the William Angliss Institute was certainly a night to remember with unforgettable memories. The way the evening was put together really was amazing. It was the result of hard work and sincere commitment on the part of the students.
The evening also had an educational element to it. The 8th Batch students’ event "Prasthaan" will be their final Assessment in the Advanced Diploma. It was obvious that this was an exemplary effort put together by very passionate students. They can be very satisfied with their work, because of the revelry of the crowd gathered. It was a purely fun event on one hand for all those that partied that day, but on the other hand putting something like “Prasthaan” it must have been very demanding.
"Prasthaan" was supported by the Indian Cultural Centre, Australian High Commission and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau.
The students selected the name “Prasthaan” because of its finality and new beginning. It is the end of campus life and the beginning of a life out there in the world beyond the portals of Wiliam Angliss.
The purpose of organizing full on Bollywood, such a spectacular event is to create incredible memories with a touch of India for all the people attending. This event will highlight the Indian culture by showcasing the street food, glamorous fashion of India as well as incorporating Indian music and dance. India, Sri Lanka and Australia have always had good relations. The leaders of all three countries have a mutual desire for friendly ties with each other. Therefore it is no surprise that the event had a Bollywood theme which makes it rather cosmopolitan. Ultimately these students will be the future of the hospitality industry. The Hospitality industry is one of the most essential industries in the world. It is this industry that forms connections between cultures. It is this industry that promotes friendships. It is this industry that carries the message that our similarities should bring us even closer and that our differences would create opportunities for understanding.
The world is full of hate and violence. But no one is born hating. It is something that we learn and love is something, the Hospitality industry teaches us. Therefore these students are emissaries and messengers of hospitality.
Australian Deputy High Commissioner Tim Huggins commented that he really appreciated and was excited by the magnitude of the event. He called the event everything that one could imagine. “First thing is, I want to tell all of you in the committee, that you have put together a truly awesome show. It is a pretty amazing set up.” Huggins pointed out that Bollywood is big in his family with his wife being of Indian Origin and said he is a big fan of Bollywood culture. As it so happens Bollywood is making its presence felt in Australia. There is a big fan base there. “We had Aishwarya Rai in Melbourne this week for an Indian Film Festival. Also the first female action hero in Bollywood was an Australian woman!” Huggins also commented that he finds Indian street food fantastic. Huggins addressed the students and said that the career they have chosen in the hospitality industry is a wonderful and wise choice.
He said it is important because it makes a huge difference in peoples’ lives such as a wedding or a honeymoon or a holiday or any other function. “Hospitality professionals make it great. You have chosen a great career which makes a big contribution to other things. It is a fun industry to work in. It is a booming industry here in Sri Lanka.” Institute Steven Bradie Milles, CEO, William Angliss commended the Batch eight for holding such a great event which has been planned for a long period of time. He commented it was a privilege for him to witness such a great performance. “Obviously one knows that it is part of the curriculum. I have been really interested in the team work of this batch. The team work and diversity is one of the reasons that this event is a success today.” This event actually corresponds with the Indian Independence Day which is one of the reasons it is a Bollywood styled party. Milles commented that he is impressed by the arrangements, the stage, lighting, dance and music.
He also commented that the committee has done a fantastic job with the food. “I want to thank Kasun Abeynayake and other staff members who have worked extremely hard. They are a truly admirable batch. I need to thank Chef Kapila and his staff in the kitchen. I wish to thank both the Australian High Commission for their support. It is great to have that connection. Lastly I wish to say that it has been a privilege supporting these young individuals.”40 students will be leaving the institute. Milles commented on how close students and teachers are at the institute. They will be missed by the staff.
The students met with Rajashree Behera, The Director- Indian Cultural Centre who helped us in terms of the cultural segments of dance and music. The students also approached Charlotte Blundell - Counsellor and Dulani Sirisena - Program Manager of the Australian High Commission who agreed to help the students by promoting the event within the Australian community.
