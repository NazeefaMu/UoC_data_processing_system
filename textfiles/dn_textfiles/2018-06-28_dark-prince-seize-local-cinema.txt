Dark Prince to seize local cinema

Jayantha Chandrasiri is a folklore artiste of modern times. Being a filmmaker, playwright and a journalist he crafts his creations in a unique manner to carve a niche in any sphere he is involved.
Jayantha’s films are made for the Sri Lankan audiences and he doesn’t yearn for international recognition. Yet his philosophy in life can be kept on a global platform. Hence international creators too could benchmark with his rationalistic vision.
Sri Lankan audiences eagerly await a film by Jayantha Chandrasiri because they know his films talk to their inner conscious. This silent communication between the local filmgoers and the latter is sheer magic.
Gharasarpa
Demons and demonic possessions are subjects that are common to all religions and societies in the world.
Jayantha Chandrasiri has touched on this subject in his latest cinema, Gharasarpa.
Gharasarpa (Serpent that sneaks) revolves around the acts of Kalu Kumaraya (Dark Prince) a demon that dwells in the wits of people who respect Sinhala folklore and rituals.
The Dark Prince unleashes his power on young women who yearn for love and possesses the latter. Being a demon greedy for love and lust he only preys on young females.
At a weekend sermon at the Gadagama church the Dark Prince showcases his power to possess women and even challenges the priest.
The young adolescent Sandares being a new man in the environment finds this phenomenon alien to him. His distraction diminishes when his eyes meet with the electrifying eyes of Vidya, a Tamil girl in this premise.
Sandares witnesses Vidya’s inclination towards the Dark Prince’s power. However the demonic power of the Dark Prince fails against the love of Sandares towards Vidya and on finding that the girl’s heart is being occupied by a mere mortal, the demon puts his wrath upon Sandares.
The demon prince is an expert of manipulation having played this game of preying on love for centuries like Dracula, challenging even the holiest people.
On the other aspect even the most inseparable love would be separated by socio-political factors taking place in a country. The two young lovers eventually fall prey to this scenario. Stripped from their lost love, the two lovers carry on with life.
Yet the Dark Prince follows Sandares for decades seeking for a chance to triumph over his initial defeat.

After 37 years when the separatist war ceases in the country, Dr Vidya Doreiyappa, a beautiful psychiatrist returns to her motherland.
Meanwhile Prof Sandares Edirisinghe, a professor in philosophy who still misses his first love is now respected by the Dark Prince for reasons unknown to others.
