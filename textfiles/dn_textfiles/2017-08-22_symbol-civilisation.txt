Symbol of civilisation

Going through the opinion of C V Vivekanathan attorney-at-law on Daily News of August 14, while seeking to point out a couple of factual errors, I am totally in agreement and support of Vivekanathan's question to the authorities: “why then speaking of one country and one people without translating it into action?”
Vivekanathan has started his opinion by saying: “The Lion Flag that was flying over the Kandyan Provinces for many years was hauled down with signing of the Kandyan Convention."
This statement gives the understanding that the Lion Flag is the Flag of Kandyan Provinces. But the fact is that Lion Flag is the flag of the country from time immemorial. Late Ven. Hisselle Dharmarama Thera giving evidence at The National Flag Committee in 1950 has stated that “all kings who ruled from 3000 BC to 1815 (Sinhalese, Cholans, Dravidians, Kalingas, Gangas, Rajaputs, Giris, Wannis, Nayakkars) used the Lion Flag as the Royal Flag”. It means the Lion Flag is the flag of the entire country, Sinhale, and not the flag of the Kandyan Provinces only.
E W Perera who brought the Lion Flag taken away by the British and kept in the Chelsea Hospital in England. His book Sinhalese Banners and Standards adds that King Devanampiyatissa went to the harbour with Lion's Flag in front to receive the Bo sapling brought by Ven Sangamitta Theri. Further, he says, it was also the flag of the country when King Parakramabahu VI was ruling the country from Kotte.
Original flag
Vivekanathan is quite right when he says that the four Bo leaves found in the present national flag were not in the original one. It is factually incorrect to say that the four Bo leaves were inserted in the 1978 Constitution by President J R Jayewardene. In fact, this change to Bo leaves took place in 1972. Those instrumental in that exercise were Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike and Cultural Affairs Director Nissanka Wijerathna.
Coming back to the Lion Flag, and subscribing to Vivekanathan's contention as to why talking about one country and one people without translating it into action. It is not the major, yet in fact the greatest single problem faced by the people of this country today. As Senator Nadesan said in his dissent in the report of The National Flag Committee, 'the ideal of national unity which I consider most important in the conception of a National Flag.'
“In my view, this design is adopted, far from being a symbol of national unity will be a symbol of our disunity.”
Today after more than six decades, it is the same thing that is happening, nay, actually done and practised. Talking about unity but working towards disunity. Talking and discoursing about unity and amity but working towards more and more disunity and enmity.
This whole process started with either modifying or corrupting the flag of the country by the people who were entrusted with ruling the country for the British. The intention of the British, when this country was given so-called independence, was to ensure continued exploitation of this country by the brown Sahibs, tamed and trained for the purpose, they were also given an instrument or an apparatus, called Parliament to guide them to do it.
Accordingly, they speak about the development of this country but in translating it into action they have no alternative but to help the international gang of exploiters calling themselves international community.
This could be safely and smoothly done only by undermining the sovereignty of the people of the country. In other words, by undermining, or removing of ownership of the country, the Sinhalese, the real owners of the country. It was the Sinhalese (Ceylonese) who handed over the country to the British in 1815. It is to the Sinhalese – (Ceylonese) the British gave back the country. In both these occasions, the ownership or the sovereignty of the country was symbolised by the lion flag, the Sinha flag of Sinhale.
The Cardinal imperial principal of exploitation of a country is divide and rule. In the process there cannot be one nation, it needs to be divided. That is how the brown Sahibs were trained. It is for this explicit reason that the Sinhale Sinha Flag, the flag of the country for millennia, was modified or changed. The real purpose was to create divisions among the people, and also disunity and enmity among the people.
Senator S Nadesan has very well explained this situation in his dissent to the National Flag Committee. It should also be remembered that there was a consensus in the committee about keeping the flag as it is.
As Vivekanathan has quoted, J R Jayewardene and Don Stephen Senanayake have talked much about keeping the lion flag, but in the final deliberations, they had to abide by imperial teachings and practices.
This change made in the Sinhale Sinha Kodiya, or the Lion Flag of Sinhale is, therefore, the root cause of all the problems that this country is facing today, ranging from terrorist war to Bond scam through frauds and corruptions of parliamentarians and their henchmen.
Changing, making alterations, or disfiguring the Sinhale Sinha Flag, the hereditary flag of the country could, therefore, be considered as the worst ever crime committed against the Sinhalese, the nation of the country.
The Sinhale Sinha Kodiya or the lion flag of the Sinhalese flag is, in fact, a civilization flag. As such nobody on this earth could interfere with it and makes any changes.
What the so-called national flag committee has done is an unpardonable fraudulent crime. Joining or adding two stripes to the Lion Flag actually amounts to adding two clauses fraudulently to the title deed.
Therefore as Vivekanathan requested this error has to be corrected in the new constitution if the intention of which is to have unity and amity in the nation.
