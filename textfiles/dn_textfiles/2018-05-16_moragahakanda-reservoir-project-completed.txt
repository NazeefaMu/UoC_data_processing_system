Moragahakanda Reservoir Project completed

A special Kiri Ithireeme Mangalyaya (boiling the pot of milk ceremony) will be held at the Moragahakanda Reservoir Project grounds on May 16, to mark the release of water from the project to 95,000 acres of farmlands, Project's Public Relations Officer P G Dayananda said.
The ceremony will take place from 6 am to 7.30 am under the patronage of Daham Sirisena, son of President Maithripala Sirisena, he said. Moragahakanda is the last and final reservoir project under the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Scheme. Release of water began with the completion of the project.
In addition to irrigation, the project will generate 25 kilowatts of electricity to be added to the national grid to facilitate the production of 4,700 tons of fresh water fish and provide drinking water facilities to people in a vast tract in the region.
The ceremony will be attended by Resident Manager of the project and other officials in addition to 2,500 farmer families.
