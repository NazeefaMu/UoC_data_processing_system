Kerosene subsidy from June

The government decision to provide the kerosene subsidy to fishermen owning one-day boats and house owners without electricity will be implemented from June.
The subsidy will be directly paid to the beneficiaries under this scheme from June, the Finance and Mass Media Ministry said in a statement.
The statement said the price of kerosene which was Rs. 44 per litre was increased by Rs. 57 per litre from May 10. The Treasury has decided to provide a cash subsidy of Rs. 57 per litre to these beneficiaries to enable them to continue purchasing the kerosene at Rs. 44 per litre. This subsidy will be paid to house owners without electricity, totalling about 47,555, along with their Samurdhi allowance.
According to estimates, there are about 24,282 fishermen owning one-day boats filled with outboard motors.
Their subsidy will be paid to them directly in cash according to an agreement reached after discussions with them.
