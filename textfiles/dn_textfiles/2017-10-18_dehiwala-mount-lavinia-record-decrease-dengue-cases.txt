'Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia record decrease in dengue cases'

The dengue eradication programme carried out by the Local Government Authorities was a proven success. The most successful was the one carried out in the Dehiwala, Mount Lavinia areas, Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary Kamal Pathmasiri said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo recently.
He said hotels, factories, traders would be asked to pay a levy for the garbage disposal scheme.
“We have appointed a committee to look into that because local authorities charge different rates for the garbage disposal, he said.
The Secretary said Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia recorded 90 percent reduction in dengue cases this year when compared to the figure recorded in the last year..
Dehiwala Medical Officer S. M. R. Oddyar said the areas reported 490 dengue cases by July and the figure has dropped to 38 in September and has reduced to 20 in October.
“The present number was the lowest reported from a Municipal Council in the Colombo District," he seaid.
“We expect a slight increase in dengue cases in December. If we take necessary action we can control it,” he said.
Dehiwala-Mt Lavania Municipal Commissioner Dammika Muthugal said his officers had carried out a successful dengue control programme together with the officers of the Dehiwela-Ratmalana Divisional Secretariats, Medical Officers, Police and members of the public.
“The Dehiwala-Mt Lavania area has the least number of dengue cases in the Western Province.
Everyone says rainy season increases dengue. We are researching in this regard. We must appreciate workers who provided their services in numerous ways to control the disease. Some workers contracted respiratory diseases. Some wanted to resign.
We were able to win over the disease since we worked as a team," he said.
Several under-developed sites in the area are breeding grounds for dengue mosquitoes. We intend to acquire them under the Public Nuisance Act,” he said.
