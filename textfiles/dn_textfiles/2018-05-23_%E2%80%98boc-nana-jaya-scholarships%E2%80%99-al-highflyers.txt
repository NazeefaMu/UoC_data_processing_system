‘BOC Nana Jaya Scholarships’ for A/L highflyers

Empowering Sri Lankan youth in pursuing their higher-education dreams, the Bank of Ceylon re-launches its scholarship Program for A/L highflyers as “BOC Nana Jaya Scholarships” to support them financially with an endowment offered monthly.
Education is the key to personal development that ultimately boosts the country’s potential to thrive socially and economically. With this very important task in mind, BOC formulated the “Nana Jaya” Scholarship awards to support deserving students in their higher education for a maximum time period possible. A total of Rs. 16.2 Million for 2016 and Rs. 16.3 Million for 2017 will be disbursed over 800 eligible students who have sat for A/L in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
In combination with the country’s Premier Youth savings account “BOC 18 Plus”, this initiative has adapted a similar platform to that which the Government has laid to encourage higher education through “Mahapola” scholarship programme. Students will be assisted by the Bank to cover up their additional expenses up to four years- for merit scholarships and up to three years- for regular scholarships. This will be credited to their “18+ SmartGen” savings account as a monthly endowment to cover-up additional expenses that incur until they complete their higher-education. Students who have maintained Rs. 5,000/- in their 18 Plus account from January 1 till December 31 2016 and have got high Z-scores in the year 2016 are considered eligible to receive these scholarship awards on district basis.
Similarly for students who have passed 2017 A/L examination with high Z-scores, maintaining a Rs.10,000/- from January 1 2017 till December 31 2017 are considered eligible to receive the scholarship. Selection for both types of scholarships will be based on the Z-score received by the student irrespective of state or any other university entrance.
Application forms can be down loaded through www.boc.lk and a specimen application is available in newspapers. For further information you may contact your nearest BOC branch. Completed applications should be sent by registered post to “Assistant General Manager, Marketing Division, Bank of Ceylon, 16th floor, Head Office, Bank of Ceylon Mawatha, Colombo 01”.
Going forward from 2018, students who have sat for their A/L in the year 2018, can make themselves eligible to “BOC Nana Jaya Scholarships” by maintaining a minimum balance of Rs.10,000/- in their “18 Plus” savings account for six months from August 1 2018 till January 31 2019.
Bringing the latest technology available in banking to add convenience, BOC opened a new phase of banking through digital transformation.
