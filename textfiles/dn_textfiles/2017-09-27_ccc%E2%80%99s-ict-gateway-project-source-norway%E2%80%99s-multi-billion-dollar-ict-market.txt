CCC’s ICT Gateway Project a source to Norway’s multi-billion dollar ICT market

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) invites Sri Lankan ICT firms to join the Chamber’s ICT Gateway Project, an initiative by the country’s premier chamber to help local firms benefit from the thriving ICT industry in Norway.
The move, launched under the ‘Sri Lanka Norway Matchmaking Program’, which has already brought down 500 Norwegian firms, including 50 ICT firms to partner with Lankan firms, is looking to expand its reach and scope, to enable local ICT firms join the international value chain. The ICT Gateway Project was launched by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with the Fair Deal AS Norway, who help find Norwegian ICT firms interested in partnering with Lankan counterparts to serve the increasing demand for ICT products from within Norway, EU and the US market. The Government of Norway is a steady and large-scale buyer of technologies and its spending on ICT development is estimated at just under US$ 2 billion per annum.
Better payment and e-commerce solutions are also in demand for omnichannel retail and other organizations, whilst B2B and B2C consumers in the Nordic market are moving their online shopping from their PC to their phone, thus creating opportunities for ICT firms.
US security vendors with niche products or unusual technologies or capabilities are also considering Norway and the Nordic region, which shows promise for the Norwegian ICT sector.
Sri Lankan firms who join the ICT Gateway Project of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce will be able to meet with the Norwegian ICT firms, visit Norway and also be listed under a database of ICT firms, which the Chamber will develop for future reference. For more information email [email protected].
