Jerusalem issue: World defies Trump

At a special meeting of the United Nation’s General Assembly (UNGA) convened to circumvent a United States veto of a UN Security Council (UNSC) resolution on the status of Jerusalem which had the support of 14 of its 15 members, an overwhelming majority of states passed a resolution opposing the decision of the United Sates to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The resolution sponsored by Yemen (Chair of the Arab Group) and Turkey (Chair of the Organization of Islamic Countries) received 128 votes for and 9 against with 35 abstentions.
The resolution, though non-binding shows the humiliation and isolation of the United States and Israel from world public opinion. Earlier when the resolution was brought before the UNSC the Ambassador of the United States in the United Nations Nikkei Haley in a letter addressed to 180 of 193 UN members warned them that the names of countries which vote against the decision of the United States will be reported to the US President.
“As you consider your vote, I encourage you to know the President and the United States take this vote personally…The President will be watching this vote carefully and has requested that I report back on those who voted against it,” her letter said.
The letter was to intimidate the countries, especially those in the developing world that receives US aid. However, majority of countries refused to be intimidated and rebuffed the United States. The countries that opposed the resolution were the United States, Israel, Guatemala, Honduras, Marshal Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo. Those that abstained included Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, El Salvador, Argentina, Latvia et al.
Turmoil in Honduras
Unrest continues in Honduras following the official release of the final results of the Presidential election by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) last Sunday, there weeks after the poll. Though earlier announced results showed the Opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla leading the poll, the Tribunal later announced that incumbent President was leading.
According to the final result the majority of the winner was only 50,000 votes or a meagre 1.6 percent. The Opposition rejected the official results and its supporters have been in the streets protesting against election rigging. The Organization of American States, an Observer in the elections said that there were “serious questions” about the poll and that the Election Tribunal’s computer system was manually meddled with. The OAS Secretary General Luis Almegro has called for fresh general elections to resolve the dispute. Opposition candidate Nasralla has warned that the acceptance of the results would lead to civil war.
The United States, Mexico and the European Union, however, seem to accept the results and back the incumbent President Hernandez in a scene similar to their justification of the military coup in 2009 which ousted democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya with the help of the Nationalist Party which is now headed by Hernandez.
Catalans vote for separation
On October 1, 2017 the Parliament of Catalonia, an autonomous state within Spain held a referendum to decide whether it should establish a state separate from Spain or remain within it. The referendum, boycotted by those who wanted to remain in the Spanish Union and outlawed by the Spanish Parliament, nevertheless decided to separate. The Spanish Parliament dissolved the Catalonian Parliament and took over its powers to the center and jailed the Catalan separatist leaders. The Catalan President Puigdemont found asylum abroad. Among the jailed is Vice – President Oriel Junqeras.
A fresh election was held last Thursday to the Catalan Parliament in a bid to resolve the issue. A record 80 percent of the voters took part in it. The separatists, comprising three parties, clinched a majority with 70 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament. The anti-secessionist centrists, on the other hand, became the single party with the largest representation of 37 seats.
Though the result could be seen as an affirmation of the people’s desire for separation the future is uncertain. The best result would be a compromise which would give Catalonia more freedom while remain in the Spanish union. Separation would spell doom for Spain and even the European Union for most of the economic wealth of Spain lie there.
Popular backing for Venezuelan Government
At the Municipal elections held on December 10, ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) won 308 of the 335 mayors’ offices and 71% of the vote, representing 6,517,606 voters, as compared to the opposition's 2,749,000.
This was despite claims by the imperialist dominated Western media that President Nicolas Maduro has lost his popularity. Commenting on the violent anti-government campaigns conducted uninterruptedly by the Opposition with the support of the United States Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said that “just when the violent opposition thought the leadership of the Revolution, the government and President, were weakened, the people reacted and peace was established”.
Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Zamora Command running the PSUV election campaign, noted that this is the largest margin of victory any political force has ever achieved in Venezuela's history.
He added that Chavista forces now hold more mayor's offices than ever before, recalling that in 2013, they won 255.
