55th Battle of the Brothers :
Debut century by Jayavihan puts Thurstan on top

A century on debut by Thurstanite Jayavihan Mahavithana 125 not out put his school in a strong position at the end of the first day’s play in the 55th Battle of the Brothers against Isipathana College at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Jayavihan who came to the middle with Thurstan reeling at 33 for 3 wickets after being put into bat by Isipathana was involved in an invaluable stand of 120 with Nimesh Perera who made a well compiled 52 before he retired due to an injury.
Jayavihan was also involved in another fruitful partnership with Savan Prabash of 74 runs. Nimesh Perera had six fours in his innings with lasted 106 minutes while Prabash had four hits to the ropes and four over it in his 25-ball knock of 50.
Jayavihan who faced 143 deliveries had 12 boundaries and four sixes in his majestic innings which helped Thurstan to declare at 314 for 5 wickets. He had the rare honour of being the first Thurstanites to score a century on his debut in the series. He joined a select band of cricketers who has scored centuries in the Battle of Brothers.
Isipathana going into bat before the tea break were also in dire straits losing three wickets for 33 runs before they staged a partial recovery through last year’s skipper Sanjula Abeywickrama 44 not out and skipper Ayana Siriwardana 22 not out who have so far put on 60 runs in an unbroken fifth wicket partnership. Sanjula has so far hit four boundaries.
Thurstan skipper Nipun Lakshan did the early damage by capturing the wickets of Ilangathilaka and Leshan Amarasinghe in the same over before Abeywickrama and Siriwardana averted further trouble.
