Executive-Legislative tussle: Yatharthaya Organization requests SC
Issue judgment before vacation

Yatharthaya Organization yesterday requested the Supreme Court to issue its pending judgment as regards the continuing Executive-Legislative tussle in the country before the year-end court vacation.
December Court vacation begins on December 14. Yatharthaya Organization (reality Org.) General Secretary and Grandpas’ Sri Sudarshanarama Temple Chief Incumbent Shastrapathi Ven. Kiri-ibbanaare Vijitha Thera said, “The masses of this country, the community of the Mahasangha, the members of the Christian order, Hindu and Muslim priests and nationalist political leaders are in high hopes of getting a verdict from the Supreme Court about the President’s dissolution of Parliament within the course of this week.”
The masses are affected by the awkwardness of recent
manifestation of events that has called into question the conduct of Parliament, the rejection of Presidential orders by the legislature, the suspension of the functionality of the government among other things, said Vijitha Thera.
“This has enervated people to the point of being collapse. They are the worst hit by the situation,” he said.
“They breathed a sigh of relief with some burdens being released from their shoulders by the newly appointed government. But they have lost all these benefits at the drop of a hat because of a rift between legislators and the President,” he explained.Ven.Viijitha Thera was speaking at a press conference at the Sri Sudarshanarama Temple in Grandpas, Colombo.
“It is from the people that both legislators and the executive derive power. The judiciary too derives its power form them. Therefore It is our view and the expectation that the judiciary will put more weight on the people in passing its judgement,” he said.
“We all respect the highest Court and at all times accept its decisions,” he said.
“Let it be a decision taken on behalf of the country,” he added.
