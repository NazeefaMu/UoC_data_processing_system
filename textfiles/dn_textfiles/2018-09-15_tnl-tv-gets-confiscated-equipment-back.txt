TNL TV gets confiscated equipment back

Polgahawela Magistrate Ruwini Jayawardena yesterday ordered the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission to release all communication equipment which had been confiscated by them earlier.
The order was given when the case was heard at the Polgahawela Magistrate's Court yesterday. President's Counsel Anuja Premaratne representing TNL TV said the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission is not under any of the Government Ministries at present and therefore it does not have any authority to act in a such a manner. The equipment was handed back to TNL TV Chairman Shan Wickremasinghe after sealing it under a Rs 10 million bond.
The case will be heard again on January 8, 2019 in the Polgahawela Magistrate's court.
