Regulatory frameworks for electricity, water, petroleum sectors

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is in the process of preparing regulatory frameworks to ensure the quality and transparency of electricity, water and petroleum sectors, PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said.
He said the PUCSL has taken measures to conduct public consultations in all nine provinces to identify the issues of the public regarding the electricity, water and petroleum sectors.
Speaking to the media at his office, the PUCSL Director General said the issues relating to the electricity sector will be included into the regulatory framework and regulatory frameworks for water and petroleum sectors will also be prepared.
He said standards and proper procedures are required for a better water and petroleum supply and measures will be taken to submit the plans to relevant ministries for implementation.
Kumarasinghe said the PUCSL will form a regulatory framework to expedite the installation of solar panels on rooftops to speed up the programme for ‘Soorya Bala Sangramaya’.
He said a regulatory mechanism is being prepared for electric vehicle charge stations. “Public views will also be gathered”.
Kumarasinghe added that the licensing of electricians is important for safety. The PUCSL is preparing a mechanism for licensing electricians, to have a proper grading system as well as properly trained electricians to ensure safety and better standards for electrical installations.
