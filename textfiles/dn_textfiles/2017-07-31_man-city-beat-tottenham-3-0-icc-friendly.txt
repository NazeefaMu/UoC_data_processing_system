Man City beat Tottenham 3-0 in ICC friendly

WASHINGTON AFP July30, 2017 Manchester City posted a convincing 3-0 win over English Premiership rivals Tottenham on Saturday in an International Champions Cup friendly in Nashville, Tennessee.
John Stones, Raheem Sterling and Brahim Diaz scored for Manchester City, who were coming off a 4-1 win over Spain and European champions Real Madrid in the exhibition tournament in North America.
Jones opened the scoring at Nissan Stadium, home of the NFL’s Tennessee Titans, with a glancing header in the 10th minute. City had plenty of chances to increase their lead before Sterling made it 2-0 in the 72nd minute, and Diaz came off the bench to complete the scoring in injury time.
Tottenham had the first real chance in the third minute, but Dele Alli’s attempt was smothered by goalkeeper Ederson.
From there Manchester City inexorably took control. They were rewarded in the 10th, when Kevin De Bruyne’s free kick from the right found Stones, who stooped to head the ball past Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris. Spurs had a chance to equalize late in the first half when Harry Kane appeared to have a clean look at goal against a hard-charging Ederson, but he fired over the crossbar.
