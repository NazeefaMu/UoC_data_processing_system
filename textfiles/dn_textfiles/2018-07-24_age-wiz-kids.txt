Age of the  wiz kids

The opening ceremony of the computer unit of Padagoda Maha Vidyalaya, Beruwala was held recently. The chief guest was Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne.
"I gave a number of computer laboratories to the colleges in Beruwala. In developing schools, science and technology should be developed. The world today is a global village. Children can join the world. A technical understanding should be given. Science changes every day. Gene technology has been introduced to the United States by now. New medical equipment has emerged. They are multifunctional. Books are done on computers today. A generation of children who do not have a computer will not be born to the future. We need to end the demands of youth behind politicians. The children should be given the right place," he said.
"It is also the responsibility of parents to direct the children to the science and technology. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe decided to provide tabs for school children. Then President Maithripala Sirisena said that tabs lead children on the good as well as bad route. The desktop computer can provide the opportunity for the children to see the whole world,” he added.
Member of Western Provincial Council Prasanna Sanjeewa and the principal of the school were also present at the event.
