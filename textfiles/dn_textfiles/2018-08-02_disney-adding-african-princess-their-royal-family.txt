Disney is adding an African princess to their Royal Family

Disney is developing a live-action fairytale film centered on an African princess. Titled ‘Sade’, the film will be produced by ‘Dope’ director Rick Famuyiwa.
According to the reports, the studio bought a pitch from Ola Shokunbi and Lindsey Reed Palmer, who will co-write the screenplay about a young African girl named Sade whose kingdom is threatened by a mysterious evil force and accepts her newly discovered magical powers to protect her people, with the help of the kingdom’s prince. A director has yet to be named. Tendo Nagenda and Zoe Kent are overseeing the project for the studio. PTI
