Stunning mandalas created out of natural objects

Nature is beautiful as it is, but James Brunt is constantly finding new ways to make it look even more appealing.
James creates artworks using natural objects he finds around his home in Yorkshire, England, and their intricacy will please both your eyes and your soul.
From rocks and twigs to leaves and even berries, Brunt arranges the materials into spirals, concentric circles, and other detailed patterns. James regularly photographs his work and besides viewing the images on social media, his fans are also welcome to join him as he works.
