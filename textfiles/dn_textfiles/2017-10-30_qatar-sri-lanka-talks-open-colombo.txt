Qatar-Sri Lanka talks open in Colombo

The State of Qatar is despatching an official delegation led by an influential Qatari Minister to Colombo to move bilateral trade actions forward within four days of a Presidential level delegation from Sri Lanka successfully wrapping up its bilateral work in Doha.
Qatari Minister of Economy and Commerce Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim bin Mohamed al-Thani will lead his 20-man delegation to Colombo for the second Joint Committee Meeting between two countries that will commence on October 30 in Colombo.
This is one of the largest ever Qatari delegations to arrive in Sri Lanka for bilateral trade talks.
Sri Lanka’s Minister of industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen leads the Sri Lankan team at the talks. The visiting Qatari members are from various Qatari state agencies, Chambers and Doha corporates in power, food and banking.
Both sides will discuss bilateral cooperation in trade, investment, tourism and economic development at the two-day in-depth sessions that will conclude on October 31. A one to one meeting between the visiting Qatari Minister Al Thani and Sri Lankan Miniser Bathiudeen is also scheduled towards the end of two-day sessions.
