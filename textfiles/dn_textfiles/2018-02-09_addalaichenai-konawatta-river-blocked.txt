Addalaichenai Konawatta River blocked

The Addalaichenai ‘Konawatta’ River has been blocked by shrub jungles. The Konawatta River joins the sea by the side of the Akkaraipattu DS division.
The river helps to speed up the flow of drainage excessive water from the paddy fields in the western direction to the sea Bay of Bengal.
Konawatta river which is adding beauty to the village is instrumental in taking the excessive drainage water from Kudakarai East and West Kandams to easily pass to the sea Bay of Bengal.
The people urge the Irrigation Department Authority to protect the Konawatta environment.
