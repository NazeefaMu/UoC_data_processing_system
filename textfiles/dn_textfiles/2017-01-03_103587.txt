elephant attacks car, driver  hospitalised

 A wild elephant attacked a car plying on the Dambulla Habarana road at Inamahuwa on January 1 night causing injuries to the driver who is receiving treatment at the Habarana hospital. The car was badly damaged, Sigiriya Police said.
However, wildlife officers in Sigiriya refuted the claim and said the car would have been damaged badly after hitting the wild elephant crossing the road at this point since the elephant had retreated to the jungle after the incident.
The injured driver was identified as Tuan Hitley Mohamed of Kohuwala.
He had however claimed that the elephant had attacked the vehicle. Sigiriya Police investigating the incident said they had put up sign boards along this strip warning drivers to be aware of wild elephants crossing the road at night.
