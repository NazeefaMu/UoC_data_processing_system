No comment by AG

Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC has stated that expressing an opinion on the change in Premiership, would be deemed inappropriate.
The Attorney General said this in response to a letter sent by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya about the matter. In a letter released to the media by the Speaker’s office, the Attorney General states “I write with reference to your letter dated 28th October 2018 received by me on 29th October.
I have considered the questions set out in your aforesaid letter. Having regard to the role of the Attorney General under the constitution, I am of the view that expressing an opinion on the said questions would be deemed inappropriate”.
