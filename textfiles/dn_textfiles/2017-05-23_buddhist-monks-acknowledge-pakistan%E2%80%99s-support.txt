Buddhist monks acknowledge  Pakistan’s support

Pakistan is a friend of Sri Lanka that stood with it in conflicted situations, natural calamities and every hour of need, Sri Lankan Buddhist monks’ delegation head Prof. N. Gnanaratana Thera said.
Ven. Gnanaratana Thera made these observations while talking to APP during the opening ceremony of ‘Vesak Mela’ in Pakistan on Monday.
Referring to a quote, “A friend in need is a friend indeed”, Professor N. Gnanaratana said, “Pakistan is true friend of Sri Lanka and this is not only the observation of Sri Lankan government but the people also think in this way”. He said: “Whenever there is any debate or issue at international forums, Pakistan has raised its voice in favour of Sri Lanka”.
Both the countries have many cultural similarities and have great love and respect for each others religion, he said.
To a question, Professor N. Gnanaratana said, Pakistan and China are two of the countries which always extended unconditional support and love to Sri Lanka and its people.
He said from Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, Asif Ali Zardari and the present leadership, all had played vibrant roles in strengthening ties between Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Talking to this news agency, the female Buddhist monks, including P. Dhammanande, M. Seelapriga and A. Summanaseeli, they said, “We are in Pakistan for the first time and excited about our journey to the sacred places of taxila and Takht Bai”. A delegation of around 40 Buddhist monks and visitors from Sri Lanka reached Pakistan on Sunday to attend ‘Vesak Mela’ celebrations being arranged by the National History and Literary Heritage (NH&LH) Division.
