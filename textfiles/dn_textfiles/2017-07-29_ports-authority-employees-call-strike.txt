Ports Authority employees call off strike

Port Authority employees on Thursday called off their token strike scheduled for today (28) since President Maithripala Sirisena had promised to introduce amendments to the Hambantota Port Agreement on August 1.
The Agreement was expected to be passed in Parliament today (28) and scheduled to be inked on Saturday (29). All Ceylon Port General Workers’ Union General Secretary Chandrasiri Mahagamage speaking to the Daily News said the strike was only temporarily called off and depended on the amendments introduced by the President.
Earlier this week, Cabinet approved a framework agreement with the China Merchants Ports Holdings Company (CMPort) Limited and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) over the Hambantota Port. According to the Agreement SLPA would hold 30 percent of the share while CMPort will own 70 percent of the joint venture. The agreement caused workers at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to go on strike on Tuesday (25) as they protested against the Hambantota Oil Tanks being given on lease to the Chinese. President Sirisena issued a gazette notification on Wednesday (26) making fuel distribution an essential service.
Later, CPC workers reported to work and a discussion with the President has been promised on August 4 regarding the agreement.
"We stand in solidarity with the CPC workers, Mahagamage said, though the Port workers are yet to be granted an appointment with the President.
Mahagamage’s Union has protested against the 99 year lease of the Port to the Chinese and has asked that if it is to do so, the SLPA should be the majority stakeholder in the venture.
