Power of Play’s Camp Kreativ returns in August

Back for the 4th consecutive year, Camp Kreativ (CK), a summer holiday program initiated by Power of Play (PoP) covers multiple creative disciplines, with a chance for participants to be exposed to a world of alternative careers that thrive outside the box of traditional employment.
Taking place from 14 to 19, August at the Sooriya Music Village, 49, Skelton Road, Colombo 5, CK 2017 features workshops in drama, dance, robotics, mime, musical theatre, online safety, photography and more. Open for ages 4-6 years, 7-12 years and 13-19 years, the workshops have been formulated to ensure that they cater to the needs and interests of each of these unique age groups.
“We are proud to say that we have a really amazing line up of artists and professionals who have come in as CK facilitators this year” says Founder and Artistic Director of Power of Play Sulochana Dissanayake in a press release.
“Each set of workshops has been carefully thought out, and we are delighted to have so many great teachers on board with us, sharing in our vision of providing children with an immersive, enriching experience that makes a lifelong impact, all in a completely non competitive environment,” he adds.
For the 4 to 6 age group, counselor Seema Omar and drama therapist Tehani Chitty return to CK this year to take kids through ‘Discovery through play’ a module that uses drama games, storytelling, art and movement to develop participants’ creativity and imagination. Imesha from the Chitrasena School of Dance will handle the dance workshops for this group, while Sulochana herself will step in for sessions on drama and puppetry.
The 7 to 12 age group sees the return of two favourites from last years’ camp – Sri Lankan Australian musical comedy performer Larry T Hill who handles the musical theatre workshops; and Hasith from Igniterspace who returns with some new and fascinating robotics and coding activities. Brand new this year, a session entitled ‘Girls, Boy and our bodies’ by Subha Wijesiriwardena which focuses on gender and self awareness as well as building self esteem and self confidence. Sulochana and Imesha will run drama and dance sessions respectively for this age group.
The workshops for the teenage group is another segment that Sulochana devoted a lot of time to structuring.
