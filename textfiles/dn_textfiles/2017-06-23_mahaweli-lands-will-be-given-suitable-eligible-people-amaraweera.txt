Mahaweli lands will be given to suitable, eligible people: Amaraweera

Mahaweli lands will be given to suitable people. Earlier there was a saying that if anyone requests Mahaweli lands, he was considered a loser and if anyone grabbed Mahaweli lands, he becomes a winner, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a press conference held at the SLFP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that a lot of people killed each other and had several fatal conflicts because of the ownership of Mahaweli lands. This issue will be solved and the ownership of Mahaweli lands will be given to the suitable and eligible people, he said.
According to Minister Amarawera, over 77 percent work of the Uma Oya project has been completed and assistance of the experts from Switzerland has been obtained to stop the water leakage. The water leakage will be completely stopped by June next year and the project will be opened by the end of next year. All victims will be given the highest compensation ever offered in Sri Lanka, for a similar project.
The electricity generated by the Moragahakanda Project will be added to the National Grid next month. "I do not know what will happen to the newly built Angunakolapelessa prison. But, other development projects worth over Rs. 7,000 will be handed over to the public soon.
International level swimming pool, outdoor and indoor stadiums, shopping malls etc are included in the project", the Minister added.
