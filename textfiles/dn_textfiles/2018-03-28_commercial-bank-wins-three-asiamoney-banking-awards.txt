Commercial Bank wins three  at Asiamoney Banking Awards

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been conferred three prestigious international awards, being adjudged the ‘Best Bank,’ ‘Best Bank for Premium Banking Services’ and the ‘Best Bank for Corporate Social Responsibility’ in Sri Lanka by Asiamoney, considered the most authoritative voice for the banking industry in the Asia Pacific region.
The most prestigious award of the ceremony, Asiamoney’s Best Bank award recognises Commercial Bank’s profitability in 2017, its growth, relative outperformance of peers, and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions and client needs.
The award for ‘Best Bank for Premium Banking Services’ is a tribute to Commercial Bank’s wealth management operations in Sri Lanka, with an emphasis on how its offering has outperformed competitors over the review period.
The Bank’s strategy in winning net new assets and client acquisition related to business gains, initiatives in areas such as relationship management and digital services, and testimonials from clients contributed to winning this award.
The award for ‘Best Bank for Corporate Social Responsibility’ recognises the Bank’s CSR initiatives, achievements and milestones reached in the previous year.
Although charitable and philanthropic initiatives were considered, the award also focused on the Bank providing financial or market solutions to its customer base.
Commenting on the three prestigious accolades from Asiamoney, Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Mr Jegan Durairatnam said: “These awards highlight the balance Commercial Bank maintains between being a financially-sound institution and a service-oriented bank while also contributing generously towards the pressing needs of the society it operates in. This equilibrium is an affirmation that we are on a stable and sustainable trajectory.” Commercial Bank is the largest private bank in Sri Lanka in terms of its assets (Rs 1.143 Trillion as at 31st December 2017) and is positioned as the Bank with the Highest Market Capitalisation, all of which contributed to the ‘Best Bank’ award.
In the sphere of CSR, Commercial Bank’s largest contribution is towards IT education in Sri Lanka.
To date the Bank has donated 175 fully fledged IT laboratories to schools island wide, benefitting over 200,000 students.
Alongside these initiatives, the Commercial Bank has also invested in uplifting healthcare services and funding research related to preventing and mitigating Chronic Kidney Disease.
