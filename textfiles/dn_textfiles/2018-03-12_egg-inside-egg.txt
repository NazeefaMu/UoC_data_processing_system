Egg inside an egg

A hen has laid a small egg inside a much bigger egg.
Stockman’s Eggs in Queensland, Australia, posted an image of the enormous egg on Sunday. People were excited.
Owner Scott Stockman told ABC news that the egg weighed 176g. It is similar in size to that of a goose.
The phenomenon of an egg in an egg is called a counter-peristalsis contraction, and happens when an egg that isn’t quite ready makes its way towards the ‘vent’, but before it’s laid, goes back up inside a chicken’s reproductive line.
As the egg returns, a second egg forms around it. It is extremely rare that two fully formed eggs, one small, one large, are incubated together and laid. It does happen occasionally, however. Last year, for example.
The latest occurrence is confusing a lot of people online. Associate Professor Raf Freire, from Charles Sturt University’s veterinary sciences school, told ABC: “Biologically, I’m struggling to understand why that smaller egg never dropped out, it’s very odd.”
Still, Prof. Freire added that it’s not unusual for hens to retain eggs – which they often do when “very stressed” – but then they usually drop out the next day.
For a second ovum to be released prematurely, it could be that the hen was a bit stressed, but then really rather happy almost straight away afterwards. Who knows. We’re not eggsperts...
Normally, a hen ovulates and releases an oocyte, which travels through the bird’s oviduct and forms the yolk.
Along the way, the oocyte collects layers of membranes and albumen – this is what creates the white part of an egg. In the uterus, a shell emerges.
As mentioned, it’s very rare for ovulation to happen before an egg is fully formed. Rarer still is an egg being sucked back up to the first area of the oviduct, and another to begin to form and encapsulate the first.
Also fascinating is that chickens have one passageway for everything – reproduction, urine (not liquid), and excrement – but turn their cloaca (scientific term for the hole) inside out when laying so that eggs don’t ever come into contact with anything dirty. Mirror
