‘Foreign policy needs restructuring’

It is a topical requirement for Sri Lanka to restructure its foreign policy based on a commercial diplomatic system and with a pragmatic approach to tap maximum benefits out of the emerging economic surge in the Asian region, said Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The minister pointed out that for such an approach, he would take action to give priority to obtain the services of young and talented professionals to Sri Lanka Foreign Service.
Foreign Minister Karunanayake expressed these views during his opening address at a conference held under the title ‘Foreign Policies and emerging issues in the Indian Ocean,’ held at the Lakshman Kadirgamar International Institute, recently.
Minister Karunanayake stated that the economic power is gradually moving from the West towards the East. He explained that China will economically overtake the world’s top economic nation - United States by 2029 and, India would follow suit to overtake America’s economic power by 2050.
The minister said Sri Lanka’s geographical situation is a natural endowment for the country to exploit benefits from this economic transition. Minister Karunanayake said unprecedented economic potential could be gained in the event we properly manage this strategic geographical situation of Sri Lanka.
Minister Karunanayake stated that digitalization and social media have become popular implements especially among the young generation in the modern world. “Although they create some negative effects on certain occasions, without fearing them, and preventing such untoward consequences, these modern advents should be used as precious resources to increase the country’s economic growth,” he said.
The minister who explained how Sri Lanka’s foreign policy should respond to these activities said China has already invested US$1.5 billion in this country. He said India has also pledged to invest US$1 billion in Sri Lanka and several other countries including Japan have consented to invest in the island.
Under these positive circumstances, our country has meagerly responded to such prospective neighboring countries and other countries that are willing to bring investment.
“We should not wait sluggishly until some benefits are automatically reached to our country subsequent to the economic power transition from the West to the East. The main role of the diplomatic missions of Sri Lankan is to utilize this great opportunity and help this effort which is aimed to tap maximum economic benefits,” he said.
“Therefore, it is appropriate to promote dual identity for Sri Lanka in the global arena; one is to promote the country as the centre of the Indian Ocean and, the other as it is the gateway to the Sub Continent. Building a dual identity is not only a commercial effort. The Commercial Diplomacy of Sri Lanka should be designed on a clear and stable policy planning. That should be strong enough to face the existing crises in the region as well as other international security disputes. We should come to an agreement with the partners who are working with us in order to make it a success,” the minister said.
Foreign Affairs Minister Karunanayake stated that factors such as international law and the respect to laws relating to naval freedom for transport could not be disturbed due to economic development. He said as one step towards managing such situations properly, President Maithripala Sirisena signed ‘Jakarta Agreement’ last March and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe signed another agreement on ‘Behavioural pattern of military vessels in the Indian Ocean.
Foreign diplomats, economic experts, scholars and Executive Director of Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute Dr. Dinusha Panditharathna and others were present.
