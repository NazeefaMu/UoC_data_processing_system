Recognizing the crises of coalition unity

The political and economic crises in Sri Lanka, will certainly move into more difficult terrain from US President Donald Trump’s decision to abandon the Nuclear non-proliferation agreement with Iran, to which the US was a signatory with the UK, France, Russia, China and Germany, and which has been endorsed by the United Nations. India is already considering the problems over the import of oil, of which Iran is the main supplier.
Sri Lanka will be in the midst of a crisis affecting all South Asian nations, as the Trump sanctions begin to scuttle Iran.
It was just the day before the US action against Iran and the principle of multi-lateral understandings among nations was announced, that President Maithripala Sirisena made his statement to Parliament on the crises facing Sri Lanka. “If we are to overcome the challenges faced by the country, the power struggle between the two main parties in the coalition government must cease. The competition for power between the Opposition and the ruling party must also cease”, said President Maithripala Sirisena, addressing Parliament at the opening of its new session this week.
President Sirisena, who is both the Head of State and leader of the unity coalition, said the record of governance of the past three years showed the country lacking in the political and social maturity needed to realize the objectives of coalition government, causing a power struggle that had driven the people to despair.
This is certainly an interesting analysis of current political realities, coming from the highest seat in the State and Legislature, giving it the feel of a diagnosis by an unrelated observer. However, it must be understood as more of a self-confession by a participant of the very political process, in a strong leadership position in the ruling coalition; and a veiled abandonment of the politics of coalition that saw the victory of the Common Candidate in the Presidential poll in January 2015.
The observance of politics in the past three years was largely that of a power struggle between two rival parties – the UNP and the SLFP, the latter was seeking to dominate a coalition in which, it was certainly the weaker partner. Overcoming the power struggle between the two main parties of the coalition, is hardly the substance of political reality today, with divisions allowed and encouraged to spread for narrow political gains.
The competition for power between the Opposition and ruling party/parties is hardly able to cease, being the very stuff of parliamentary and electoral democracy.
While the diagnosis would largely appear to be correct, the cause of the current political disease affecting the country, is largely the departure from the core of the political organisation that brought about the unity coalition.
The campaign beginning in early 2014, building up to the heated presidential poll in November 2014, was largely intended to defeat the increasing authoritarianism of the Rajapaksa Regime, with its massive show of nepotism and corruption, and was not one to strengthen any political party. It was the search for a broader, meaningful democracy, which was being largely set aside, by the political forces built up under the Executive Presidency, brought to the country through a majority that did not vote for such a change.
SLFP leadership divide
Maithripala Sirisena, Common Candidate in the fight to defeat the Rajapaksa Regime, clinging to his links to the SLFP, and gaining the SLFP leadership as the new President of the country, was caught between two political challenges - to be the leader of the SLFP or the Common Candidate leader of a democratic state. His belief in the ability to do both, with little regard to the arising political contradictions, is largely the cause for the issues he has sought to diagnose in the speech at the opening of Parliament.
Another reality is the largely limited commitment of the coalition partner, the UNP, to think in terms of a larger unity of coalition, and not as the larger party of the alliance with its own goals of building strength for a decidedly UNP government in the future.
This comprises the stuff of the ‘power struggle’ within the unity coalition, driven to inevitable rivalries between two parties somewhat different in broader economic policies and aspects of social unity, but wholly united in a lack of commitment to fight corruption and bring about an unquestionably clean government, which were the principle goals of the struggle of January 2015.
The cross-over of the 16 SLFP members to the Opposition benches in Parliament, with their loud calls for a break of the UNP-SLFP coalition, the economic and political developments that would emerge in the coming months of the shaky coalition of unity, trends in the search for a new President from 2019, and the call to abolish the Executive Presidency proposed by the JVP, will be the situations of interest and concern in the coming months.
Judicature Amendment
It certainly took a long time for the coalition of unity to see to the passage of the Judicature Amendment Bill, an important step in giving life to its pledge to fight corruption in the country. The provision to set up a permanent High Court at Bar to expedite cases of large scale fraud and major financial crimes was passed in Parliament with a majority of 67. The general line up of politics on the issue was clear in the voting, with the UNP and SLFP (in government) voting for with the TNA, and the absence of the JVP members. The Joint Opposition voted against, not surprisingly. What is of special interest is that the six of the 16 SLFP members who crossed over to the Opposition, were present in Parliament at the time and voted against the Bill.
This was a legal provision considered as important in keeping with the government’s pledge to fight corruption. The JO voting against it is no surprise because several of its members are either indicted on charges of corruption, and some others are under investigation on such allegations.
The slogan of the JO has been that this legislation is part of the move by the government to take revenge on its political opponents.
The fact that this Act is now a reality is of significant importance to the political forces that campaigned and fought to ensure the election of a government with a commitment to fight corruption. The past three years have seen many delays in the legislative and judicial processes in fighting corruption, and there have also been ministerial changes due to these delays.
The new law gives power to the Permanent High Court at Bar to try a number of offences, including theft, dishonest misappropriation of property, criminal breach of trust by public servants, banker, merchant or agent and dishonestly receiving stolen property etc. Cheating, forgery, making a false document, making or possessing a counterfeit seal, plate etc, with intent to commit a forgery and offences of money laundering can also be directed to these separate courts. Bribery of judicial officers, Members of Parliament, Police officers, peace officers and other public officers has also been listed as offences that can be tried in the permanent High Court.
The voting against this Bill by the six ‘independent’ SLFP members now in the Opposition is an important display of the major differences that prevail within the SLFP, especially in the context of the party leader, President Sirisena’s own call of commitment to fight corruption, which was underlined in his latest speech in Parliament, too. They are clearly demonstrating their line-up with the Joint Opposition, and the lack of any accord with the principles of the unity coalition in fighting corruption, and also show their lack of support for wielding of the Presidential Sword against those who are corrupt.
The passage of this law is also of importance in the context of the new arrests made of the Chief of Staff of the President’s Office, T. H. M. Mahanama, and Chairman of the State Timber Corporation P. Dissanayake (also a former Chief of Staff of President Kumaratunga’s Office) in the alleged fraud involving Rs. 20 million from an Indian investor, involving material of the Kantalai Sugar Factory.
A matter of special interest is that the position of Chief of Staff of the President’s Office, has now been continuously linked to major fraud, with the Chief of Staff in the Office of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gamini Sedara Senerath, also indicted on an alleged major fraud involving funds for the construction of a large tourist hotel in Colombo and other related activities.
The action against Mahanama and Dissanayake also brings the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) into considerable recognition, especially in the context when it was treated with opposition by the Government, especially over the bringing to Court on allegations of corruption, persons who have a right to wear the ceremonial uniforms of the Armed Forces. That is certainly another issue the country has to face in any progress towards genuine democracy.
