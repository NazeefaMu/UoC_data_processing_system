From crisis to resilience – Part 6: Do they have any idea how valuable I am to the company?

When you begin to think of your career advancement, the two biggest questions you have to ask yourself are - What is my value to the organization? What am I doing to contribute to the bottom line?
Remember, as one of the executives of the company, (senior or junior) you’re supposed to be an investment. Your company pays you a salary and other perks and they expect a good return. The more value you contribute, the better the investment and the more likely they are to continue investing in your future - and potentially invest in a bigger way. That means raises, promotions and job security for you.
Your actions in the workplace have an impact, whether you realize it or not. The more you can create measurable, positive, powerful outcomes through your actions, the more people will sit up and take notice. The more they’ll want to keep you happy and acknowledge you for your efforts.
Improve value
Take for example, you are an administrative professional whose role is to purchase office supplies. Sure, you could simply follow the standard procedure, place orders for items requested from approved vendors, and ensure the purchased products are received in time.
Or, you could find simple ways to improve your value like, (1) Researching vendors to find more competitive pricing and making informed recommendations to decision-makers. (2) Aggressively negotiating with existing vendors for better pricing. (3) Creating an “office supply sharing” program between departments so inventory doesn’t pile up in one area while another is always in need. (4) Purchasing in bulk when appropriate to increase savings. (5) Strategically purchasing to take advantage of sales, rebates and discounts. (6) Offering tips to help staff members reduce waste of supply inventory, and planning to start a competition or reward system to inspire participation.
These value-add tactics aren’t defined anywhere in your job description. It takes a few extra hours of thought and a little imagination, but using these strategies, you could save your company (say) over Hundred Thousand per month.
And think about it: If you track your cost-saving initiatives and measure the positive results, you could certainly make a compelling case for a raise in the future. Perhaps higher management maybe already aware of it. If your actions have a positive impact on the organization’s bottom line, your value is higher than that of your peers who are simply going through the motions status quo. Every Rupee your company chooses to spend employing therefore becomes a superior investment. Who wouldn’t be willing to pay a little more for an employee like that?
Tips
Don´t expect your bosses to notice your extra work, staying late at work, working weekends, or additional training, creative ideas, and special projects. You may be enthusiastic and intelligent, communicate effectively, exhibit strong leadership skills, embrace change, work efficiently, and possess technical competence and strong interpersonal skills - yet still find yourself struggling, simply because you fail to persuade the skills, ideas, and commitment that are vital to ‘Team Success’.
Follow these few tips to ensure that you have a good chance of proving that you are an executive worth positive consideration.
Help generate revenue:
If your organization is committed to making a profit by providing top-quality products/services along with extra value to its customers, then you must show how you contributes to that pursuit. The customer ultimately determines the ability to make a profit.
As Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart, American multinational retail corporation, said: “There is only one boss—the customer. And he can fire everybody, by spending his money elsewhere.’ You must bring added value in the form of profits by focusing on the impact on customers.
When you are helping in the success of the company financially, you prove your value. Companies want to make sure they are getting a return on their investment, so if you can focus your time on adding financial value to the company by excelling at your assignments and projects, then it shows that they made a good investment in you as a professional person.
Help save money:
You can also help increase profits by saving money. Leaders seek to save in five ways: 1) reduce staff (downsizing), 2) cut benefits, 3) lower salaries, 4) decrease products or services (cutbacks), or 5) increase productivity. Since you aren´t interested in the first four options, think of ways to increase your productivity by working smarter and producing more to maintain your earnings and benefits. If you are worried about your job security and frustrated by the extra work and fewer resources, you can´t let this affect your job performance. If you can spot money-wasting activities and then come up with a solution to remedy the situation, you´ll prove your sincerity, commitment and added value.
Standout in a Positive Way:
Many people argue, whine, and complain about their jobs, duties, customers, equipment, and co-workers. If you attract attention by being negative, don´t be surprised when you lose focus on goal, results and ultimately your opportunity! Negative attention does not help. People should associate your name, face, and expertise with positive feelings about your work, your teamwork, your customer commitment, and the value you bring.
Stay away from trolls:
The single most detrimental thing for a thriving and productive team is negativity. In order to show your value, be that positive influence in a team or group, and encourage your peers to be the same. If you come across someone who is essentially “trolling,” be honest with them that their negativity is not welcome. Encourage them to change their attitude and try to look for ways to help them. If they persist, then they should be removed from a project.
Invest in yourself as a professional person. Take time out of your life to treat yourself like a shiny, new product ready to be marketed to the world. Invest in yourself through blogging, participating in networking events, attending lectures, talking to new people, and sharing new ideas. By doing this, companies see that you take the time to build yourself up as a professional, and help boost the company by representing them well in the industry.
Get smart!
Staying on top of new and interesting developments in the industry keeps ideas and conversations fresh. Reading, learning, and discussing these topics shows that you are flexible and interested in the future. It makes for some fun discussion with peers at the next company outing.
Be reliable and dependable: Make sure you work all the hours you have agreed to and more. Arrive early and leave late. Don’t tend to be clock watchers; shop the bosses that you are willing to go the extra mile and work hard. Confirm that the time you take your lunch break is convenient and be back with time to spare. Let your bosses know that you are available to work when and where needed – be as flexible as possible with your scheduling.
Look the part: Make sure you dress according to the company culture and that you appear well groomed and neat. Pay attention to all aspects, from your hair to your shoes. If you wear a uniform, make sure it is clean and pressed, even if it means washing and ironing at night!
Have a positive attitude:
Show confidence, enthusiasm and a strong work ethic. Be a problem-solver rather than the employee who moans and finds fault. Show that you are self-motivated and proactive. Take care of problems and deal with issues as they arise. Speak up if you have a good idea. Don’t miss an opportunity to show your ability to take initiative.
Volunteer for extra duties:
Show that you are not just there to work the bare minimum and make some holiday cash, but that you are a committed and enthusiastic worker. Prove your value and versatility by going above and beyond what is asked of you. Be the first to volunteer for extra work. Pay close attention to everything and be prepared to learn new tasks. Be proactive bout developing new skills and gaining pertinent knowledge.
Be careful what you say:
Avoid spending time gossiping with colleagues, especially about other workers, the leaders or the company. This is always notices by employers and is not the responsible behaviour they want from future employees. Do not engage in personal conversations with other employees with earshot of customers. Be friendly, but keep your discussions positive and work-related as much as possible.
Remain calm under pressure:
Demonstrate a cool head in busy and stressful situations. Try not to panic if you start to feel overloaded; just keep working steadily through whatever comes your way. This will help you stand out from other holiday employees as a professional and calm employee.
Note for new executives
If you are a newly promoted or recruited leader, then your action plan should be “Stretch and learn.” Start by taking on responsibilities and duties associated with your position. Get to know what is required of the person doing the job, to acquire those necessary skills and knowledge.
Be willing to attend company-provided training, or take the initiative to strike out on your own to find educational and skill-building courses that make you the best possible candidate for the promotion. Examples abound of leaders who started at the lowest position in the leadership profile in a company only to rise to a position of prominence by following this simple action plan. Find your inspiration by looking up a few of them and then do what they've done to get what you want.
Remember: those who are highly valued are most likely to be the first to be considered for career advancement or some of the company’s best new assignments. And during tough times, those who are highly valued will most likely not be the first targets in a corporate downsizing. In addition, increasing and improving value to an organization can increase self-satisfaction, thereby decreasing stress.
