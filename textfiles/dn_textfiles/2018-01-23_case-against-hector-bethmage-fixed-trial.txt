Case against Hector  Bethmage fixed for trial

The case filed against Western Provincial Council Member Hector Bethmage, for allegedly causing gunshot injuries to a person following a shooting in the Nawagamuwa area in 2009, was fixed for trial on March 27 by the Colombo High Court, yesterday.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, the defence counsel sought a further trial date.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Provincial Councillor Bethmage for allegedly causing gunshot injuries to Dinesh Pushpakumara, while being a member of an unlawful assembly.
Bethmage had allegedly shot Dinesh Pushpakumara, a supporter of a rival UPFA candidate, on April 11, 2009 at Nawagamuwa.
Senior State Counsel Vishwa Wijesuriya appeared for the Attorney General. Defence counsel Randi Amarasekara, with Ranjith Caldera, appeared for the accused.
