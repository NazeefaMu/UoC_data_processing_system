Sun shines over Korea

Sun shines over Korea dissipating dark clouds of war and Moon beams over especially the South as one of the world’s best designed modern cities- Seoul residents breathe a sigh of relief. Both “mad man and the “rocket man” have been converted into “peaceniks”. The latter’s “football diplomacy” has borne fruit.
Metaphor apart, the summit between President Donald Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong-un of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in Santosa Island, Singapore on June 12 has been a success.
When recalling the atmosphere of virtual belligerency and politics of brinkmanship that prevailed six to seven months ago the mere fact of their meeting is a measure of success. It signifies a shift from antagonism towards friendship and civilized discourse.
The joint statement issued at the conclusion of the summit said, “President Trump and remains and Chairman Kim conducted a comprehensive, in-depth and sincere exchange of opinions related to the establishment of new US – DPRK relations and to building of a lasting and robust peace region in the Korean peninsula. President Trump promised to provide security guarantees to the DPRK and Chairman Kim reaffirmed his firm and necessary commitment to complete denuclearization of the peninsula”.
A win-win situation
The two countries also resolved for the immediate repatriation of those already identified.
Obviously, this is a win-win situation for both sides. Not only did the DPRK get a security guarantee against regime change and confrontation but also the United States could assure itself that Pyongyang nuclear weapons would not fall on American soil.
As critics pointed out the general nature of the statement without any specific details what would be actually meant by denuclearization is a drawback which would lead to misinterpretations or different interpretations. However, a statement issued by the official Korean News Agency on June 13 said that leaders “recognized that it is important to abide by the principle of step-by-step and simultaneous action in achieving peace, stability and development of the Korean peninsula”.
Incidentally, the two leaders in their joint statement also said “committed to follow up negotiations led by US Secretary of State Pompeo and relevant high official of the DPRK at earliest possible date, to implement outcome of the summit”. This seems to be a pragmatic approach for problems have to be discussed comprehensively and technicalities sorted out in detail with the participation of experts.
The two leaders have also invited each other to visit their countries and the invitations were accepted.
Apparently not everybody is happy. The Democrats and the military-industrial complex are angry that the United States has yielded too many concessions to a “tyrannical” regime. These groups who openly assisted Washington’s policy of buttressing dictatorial regimes of Pinochet’s Chile or the Banana Republics or the Coup d’ tat of General Suharto in Indonesia etc. now cry foul as their mercenary interests may get affected. They are especially worried that President Trump promised to stop US-South Korean joint military drills without complete and verifiable irreversible disarmament (CVID). North Korea had from the outset opposed CVID, taking a lesson from the fate of Colonel Khadafy. As noted earlier Trump has been pragmatic enough to accept it and preferred a step-by-step approach. Conservative sections in the US would like one-sided denuclearization of the DPRK without the US removing its nuclear arsenal and war apparatus from the Korean peninsula.
Family union of Koreans
President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea has more than one reason to be happy. He won the elections of a pledge to improve relations with the North. He has delivered more than he pledged for. Prospects of signing a peace treaty and thereby ending the state of war between the two Koreas are brighter. Ensuring family union of Koreans separated and living in the North and South is near at hand. Though not near, the peaceful unification of Korea is on the agenda and possibly it would take a different path than Germany.
Most world leaders have welcomed the outcome of the summit while some of them have been cautious too. Among those who welcomed are South Korea, United Kingdom, China, Russia, Singapore and the European Union. Malaysia has said that it would re-open its Embassy in Pyongyang. Israel has openly expressed its displeasure while the United Nations have appealed to all nations to give Kim “patience and support”.
Ensuring a peaceful atmosphere in the Korean peninsula would be a great contribution to a peaceful Asia-Pacific region which would benefit not only that region but also the world at large. China would also feel more relieved.
On the other hand, China will play a crucial role in the implementation of the summit outcome for it is the biggest trading partner of the DPRK and its security guarantor. Had it not being for the strong bonds between China and the DPRK and measured assistance from Russia it would have impossible for the DPRK to challenge and stand up to the World’s only super power.
It is clear what caused the change of heart in Washington is the nuclear capability of the DPRK. In nuclear war superiority rests not so much in the strength of the nuclear arsenal but on the sequence of their use or who strikes first. Once the DPRK developed its nuclear weapons and missile technology the balance of power changed in the peninsula. In this sense Kim’s strategy seems to have worked. His next strategic target seems to be economic development and he has high hopes to transform the country to a developed status for it has immense and untapped resources.
