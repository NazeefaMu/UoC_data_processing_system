Ambatenna Water Supply and Sanitation Project inaugurated

The National Government formed by the SLFP and the UNP is a strong and stable government which has rendered a great amount of service to the people in several sectors. Although certain sections are trying to topple it we will render our unstinted support and co-operation to it to move forward by overcoming all challenges, Town Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem said recently while addressing a meeting held at Paragollagama after inaugurating the Passara Ambatenna Water Supply and Sanitation Project. He said that this is part of a project operating in 7 districts funded by the World Bank.
Already Rs 50 million had been allocated as dividends of this project to 300 families. Although the Ministry gave a start to this project its continued maintenance was the responsibility of community based organisations.
The Minister said his ministry only implemented medium and large scale projects. Already 353 such projects were in operation throughout the country.
The project opened by President Maithripala Sirisena at Demodara was one such project. The Demodara project costing Rs 12,000 million would benefit 25,000 families in Ella, Hali-Ela and Badulla.
Steps have been taken to set up a project of this nature in Bandarewela and its suburbs. The President was directly involved in this project which has already received Cabinet approval.
Hakeem went on to say that a countrywide network was involved in large scale water supply projects launched in the country which had won World Bank acclaim. He also said Uva Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dissanayake, and Passara UNP Chief Organiser Vadivel Suresh should be commended for the optimum service rendered by them to the people in the area. The Minister said he was thankful to the Prime Minister for assigning him a ministry which enabled him to work with the people by rubbing shoulders with them.
Uva Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dissanayake, Passara UNP Chief Organiser Vadivel Suresh and several others also spoke.
