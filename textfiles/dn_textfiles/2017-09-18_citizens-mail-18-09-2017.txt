[CITIZENS' Mail - (18-09-2017)]

Ministers and mobile phones
It was reported that at the Cabinet meetings chaired by the President, certain Ministers were not attentive even to speeches made by the President, and were preoccupied with cell-phones plugged into their ears.
This is a sad revelation, to find that scant respect is being paid to state business by irresponsible and puerile ministers - how on earth could the country progress?
It was encouraging to learn of the response of our President, taking the bold step of banning the use of cell-phones during Cabinet meetings. Well done Sir!
This practice is often seen at meetings of various Boards and Councils, where their members are not attentive to the business being dealt with, resulting in loss of integrity of these bodies. I hope the Chairpersons of Boards and Councils will emulate the example of our President, and ban the use of cell-phones during their meetings too.
