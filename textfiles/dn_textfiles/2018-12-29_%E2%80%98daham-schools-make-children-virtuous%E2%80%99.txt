‘Daham schools make children virtuous’

Children should attend Daham schools and learn their religion in addition to the subjects they learn at their schools, Ven. Omare Kassapa Anunayake Thera of the Vidyaneketha Pirivena in Hambantota said.
The Thera was delivering an anusasana at the foundation stone laying ceremony for a Budu Medura at the temple on December 25.
“A majority of the citizens are virtuous and they rarely commit sins. Even though some people follow western ways, many of our citizens respect their heritage and avoid alien habits and concepts,” the Thera said.
The Thera said it is a bless to have the children who follow Buddhist path by attending Daham pasals.
Hambantota Sinhagiri Viharadhipathi Ven. Vikarandeniye Vajira Thera and Southern Provincial Minister H. W. Gunasena spoke.
