Live the story!

Aditha Dissanayake has been in the limelight recently as the winner of the H.A.I Goonetileke Prize at the Gratiaen Trust Awards, 2017 for her translation of Batuwangala Rahula Thera’s ‘Rankaraduwa’ to English as ‘The Golden Casket’. Translating however, is only one of her talents – a regular contributor to the Daily News she is a journalist, novelist and children’s writer.
Her journey from obtaining a first class in English (hons) from the University of Kelaniya and as a lecturer of English also at the same university to the post of Features Editor of the Sunday Observer and a stint at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, New York University, USA, is an intriguing story in itself.
Q: How did you start writing?
When I was small I was a voracious reader. There were always plenty of books lying around at home, but I would go through them in next to no time and walk around saying I have nothing to read. My father, Daya Dissanayake, who is also a writer, would say ‘If you don’t have anything to read, write something.’ I didn’t listen to him at first, but then, because I so wanted to read something new I started to write my own stories – and read them when I had no other books to read. I never grew out of that habit.
Q: And then you became a famous short-story writer?
Every Sunday, for about ten minutes – that’s the time it takes for my readers to go through one of my short stories – I became a short story writer. I’m not sure about the adjective though. I was at university when my first short stories and articles were published in the Sunday papers and I felt I had begun my journey. I was on my way to become a writer. I was lucky because unlike most parents who want their children to grow up to be doctors, engineers or lawyers when I told mine that I want to be a writer my parents said, go ahead. And I thought I was going to become a famous novelist. Instead, now I’m known as a translator.
Q: How did that happen? How did you end up from being a journalist to creative writer to translator?
Remember what Alan Saunders said about life? “Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.” That definition fits me almost perfectly. When I was at the University of Kelaniya I decided to major in English and planned to take archeology as my subsidiary subject. But there was a rule saying those who didn’t study archeology in their first year could not take it as their sub in the second year. So, I stumbled upon the rather new, rather unknown subject called translation methods. Back then no one hardly knew about it. And back then I didn’t dream I would end up becoming a translator.
Q: What makes a good translator?
You will have to ask a good translator this question. I don’t see myself as a good translator. I strive to be good. I strive to reach perfection and I leave my readers to judge if I am good or not.
Q: What techniques do you use when translating a story?
None. I simply connect with one or two major characters in the story. In ‘Rankaraduwa’ it was with the protagonist – the monk that I connected so totally. I lived his story, with him, in English.
Q: Translation is one of the important fields in building cultures. So do you think it is the responsibility of the translator to reconstruct the source language text in the target culture in a way which complies with the cultural beliefs of the target language?
Not necessarily. It is not the translator’s responsibility to reconstruct the text to fit the cultural beliefs of the target language. The translator has no right to change or modify a text. If this happens it can never be called a translation. Then it becomes an adaptation.
Q: There’s a dearth of good translators in Sri Lanka. Readers usually get bored in the middle of reading translations due to their sheer complexity and ambiguity. How clever should a translator be to produce a translation which is as interesting as the original?
The translator should have a thorough knowledge of the source language and all the nuances that come with the source language and then have a thorough knowledge of the target language, too. Most critics think something is always lost in translation. But I believe something can be gained in translation too.
The best example of this that I have come across is Sugathapala de Silva’s ‘Ata Massa’. In my eyes the translation is better than the original text - ‘The Glad Fly’.
Q: Tell us about your own work.
I have written two collections of short stories for young adults, one children’s book, and one novel – ‘Somewhere on the Green Hills’. My second novel, ‘When a Cloud Left the Sky’ will be out this September.
Q: What is the hardest thing about being a writer?
Well...quite a lot of things: the panic that you have run out of ideas for stories; the struggle to make each new story better than the one before; the fear of not knowing if what I created is any good at all.
Q: The best thing?
When someone takes the time to find my email address or search for me on social media and sends me a note saying how much they like my work. Or meeting my readers in person; the warmth of a handshake, that instant connection - they know me through my books and my articles.
