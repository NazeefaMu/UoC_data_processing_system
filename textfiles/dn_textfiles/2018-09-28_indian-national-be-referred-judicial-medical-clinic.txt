Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday ordered the CID to refer the Indian National arrested in connection with the ongoing investigations into the alleged conspiracy to harm the President and Former Defence Secretary to the Judicial Medical Clinic to determine his mental condition.
The Magistrate also ordered the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) Director and DIG Nalaka Silva to appear before the Government Analyst Department to conduct a voice verification at 10 a.m. today.
Anti Corruption Force Organization Working Director Namal Kumara recently revealed some information on TID DIG Nalaka Silva’s alleged conspiracy to assassinate the President and the former Defence Secretary.
Accordingly, the Criminal Investigation Department has commenced an investigation into the incident.
