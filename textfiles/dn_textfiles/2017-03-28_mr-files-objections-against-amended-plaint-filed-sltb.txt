MR files objections against amended plaint filed by SLTB

 
Three defendants including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, named as defendants in connection with misappropriating a sum of Rs.142 million owed to the SLTB, whose buses were used to transport people to election rallies of former President during the 2015-Presidential Election campaign, yesterday filed objections against the amended plaint filed by the SLTB.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, presidential election committee members Gamini Senarath and Amal Senadhilankara were among the respondents who filed objections against the amended petition.
Commercial High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne directed the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) file their objections on May 23.
At a previous occasion SLTB decided to exclude Minister Susil Premajayantha and Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa from the defendant list.
According to the amended plaint SLTB has named five UPFA 20015-presidential election committee members, including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) election committee members Gamini Senarath and Amal Senadhilankara as respondents.
The SLTB earlier named seven parties including SLFP former general secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha as defendants.
The plaintiff said the UPFA hired buses from the SLTB for the January 8th, 2015 Presidential Election rallies but failed to settle the payments after obtaining the services.
