Kandy favourites to beat Police

The 2017/18 Rugby League second round gets underway and there is a fair amount of hype surrounding this showcase event. There is no doubt that
With the 2017/18 Dialog rugby league second round getting underway defending champions Kandy S.C. will prove very tough to beat as they go into the tournament as deserving favorites. Today they will play Police SC at Nittawela grounds, kick of is at 4 pm. with Ajith Kumara handling the whistle.
Kandy is expected to start the second round with a comfortable win, in front of their home town fans.
They head into the game with plenty of confidence following the superb performance in the first round. They have one of the best forward packs in the competition, and their back line is packed with plenty of excellent performers and they could build on that performance in the game. Kandy’s attacking style of play helps to drive their ability to demolish opponents.
The pressure will be on the cops to perform. They have lost all the games and are last in the table.
The policemen are lacking the big names that are in the squads for some of the other teams, but they have a well-balanced, consistent outfit that could present with some issues in the first quarter of today’s game. Policemen will go all out to present a strong team – especially in the forwards.
Whatever they do, they could struggle to cover the huge line of the opponents.
