SC in landmark judgement states dissolution ultra vires constitution:
Upholding Democracy

The Supreme Court seven-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Nalin Perera on December 13 unanimously ruled that the gazette notification issued by President to dissolve the Parliament prematurely was inconsistent with the Constitution.
Chief Justice Nalin Perera delivered the judgement and held that the Proclamation to dissolve Parliament has been issued outside legal limits and has resulted in a violation of Petitioners’ fundamental rights. Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Murdu Fernando agreed with the judgement penned by Chief Justice ordering to quash and render null and void the concerned proclamation published in the Gazette notification dated November 9.
While agreeing with the judgment delivered by Chief Justice and five other judges regarding these ten Fundamental Rights petitions, Justice Sisira de Abrew delivered a separate judgment explaining different reasons to justify his stance.
The Supreme Court delivered its judgment in respect of ten Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed by several political parties, social activists and individuals. The first FR petition was filed by Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan under the registration number bearing SC FR 351/2018. The second petition (SC FR 352/2018) was filed by UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and UNP former General Secretary Kabir Hashim. The third petition (SC FR 353/2018) had been filed by Centre for Policy Alternatives (Guarantee) Limited and Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu. Attorney-at-law Lal Wijenayake, the Secretary of United Left Front filed the fourth petition (SC FR 354/2018). Attorney-at-Law Champika Jayangani Perera filed the fifth FR petition (SC FR 355/2018) challenging the dissolution of Parliament. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and its Parliamentarians Bimal Ratnayake, Vijitha Herath, Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, Sunil Hadunetti and Nihal Galapaththi filed the sixth petition (SC FR 356). Parliamentarian Manoharan Ganesan filed the seventh petition (SC FR 358/2018). All of All Ceylon Makkal Congress leader Rishad Bathiudeen and its Parliamentarians Ameer Ali, Abdullah Mahroof and Ishak Rahuman filed the eighth petition (SC FR 359/2018). Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader Rauff Hakeem and six others filed the ninth FR petition (SC FR 360/2018). Professor S. Ratnajeevan H. Hoole, a Member of the Election Commission filed the tenth petition (SC FR 361/2018).
The petitioners cited the Attorney General Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and Election Commission members N.J. Abeysekara, Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dassanayake, Secretary to the President Udaya Seneviratne as respondents.
The Supreme Court permitted Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Party Chairman Prof. G. L. Pieris, Parliamentarian Udaya Prabath Gammanpila, Wellawattage Jagath Sisira Sena de Silva, Mallika Arachchige Channa Sudath Jayasumana and Attorney-at-Law Premnath Chaminda Dolawatte to be involved into these petitions as the intervenient petitioners.
This is an excerpt from judgment delivered by Chief Justice Nalin Perera in respect of the Fundamental Rights petition filed by TNA leader R. Sampanthan.
On 09th November 2018, the President issued a Proclamation which was published in the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2096/70 dated 09th November 2018. The proclamation contains four main components as follow.
(a) Dissolve Parliament from midnight November 9 and summon the new Parliament to meet on the 17th of January, 2018;
(b) Fix, 5th of January, 2018 as the date for Election of the Members of Parliament;
(c) Specify the period beginning on the 19th of November, 2018 ending at Twelve Noon on the 26th of November, 2018 as the nomination period, during which nomination papers shall be received by the Returning Officers; and
(d) Specify each place mentioned in Column II of the Schedule hereto as the place of nomination for candidates seeking election in the electoral district mentioned in the corresponding entry in Column I of that Schedule.
On 12th November 2018, these Petitions were filed praying for a Declaration that the aforesaid Proclamation infringes the Petitioners’ fundamental rights contained in Article 12 (1) of the Constitution; an Order quashing the aforesaid Proclamation, an Order declaring the Proclamation null, void ab initio and of no force or effect in Law, an Order quashing the decisions or directions contained in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Proclamation and other related reliefs including interim reliefs suspending the operation of the Proclamation.
The Petitioners contend that the dissolution of Parliament sought to be effected by the Proclamation is “ex facie unlawful and in violation of the Constitution and nothing flows from the same” because; The President is expressly prohibited by the Constitution from dissolving Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting” and “the date appointed for the first meeting of the Eighth Parliament of Sri Lanka was 1st September 2015.” as established by the Gazette Notification dated 26th August 2015.
In this regard, it should be mentioned here that the Petitioner is basing this contention upon Article 70 (1) of the Constitution which states
“The President may by Proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament:
Provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present), voting in its favour.”
Thus, the period of four and half years specified in the proviso to Article 70 (1) had not passed when the Proclamation marked was issued;
(ii) “The only exception provided by the Constitution to the above prohibition is where Parliament requests the President to dissolve Parliament by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present) voting in its favour.” and “no such resolution has been passed by Parliament requesting the President to dissolve Parliament.”.
In this regard, it is undisputed among the parties to this application that, up to this date, there has been no resolution passed by a two third majority of Parliament requesting His Excellency, the President to dissolve Parliament. The Court can also take judicial notice of the fact that, up to this date, no such resolution has been passed;
(iii) “Thus and otherwise, the Petitioner states that the purported dissolution of Parliament dated 9th November 2018 was inter alia:
a. In violation of the express prohibition contained in the Constitution contained in the proviso to Article 70 (1);
b. An unconstitutional attack on Parliament;
c. Ultra vires the powers of the President;
d. Unlawful;
e. An assault on the legislative power of the People;
f. A violation of the sovereignty of the People;
g. A violation of the rights of the Petitioner and each and every Member of Parliament;
h. Arbitrary, irrational, capricious, vexatious and unreasonable;
i. Action that offends and is in breach of the principles of reasonableness and legitimate expectation and is motivated by improper objectives; and
j. Null and void and of no force or effect in law.”;
Thereafter and with regard to the Petitioner‘s right to invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this court, the Petitioner pleads that the impugned actions of His Excellency, the President constitute executive or administrative action within the meaning of Article 17 read with Article 126 of the Constitution and were done by His Excellency, the President “in his official capacity”. The Petitioner goes on to plead that the said impugned actions of “purporting to dissolve Parliament amounts to an infringement of the rights of the Petitioner recognized under and in terms of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.” In this connection, the Petitioner states that the Petitioner and every member of Parliament were entitled by law to complete their respective terms in Parliament according to law and have been unlawfully denied that opportunity by the impugned actions of His Excellency, the President and further, that the said denial violates the rights of all their electors who are citizens of the Republic and are entitled to representation in Parliament according to the law.
The Petitioner in SC FR 361/2018 pleads that the impugned actions of His Excellency, the President referred to above violate the Petitioner‘s rights guaranteed by Article 10 of the Constitution in addition to violating his rights guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. As stated later on, this Court has only granted leave to proceed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. Therefore, the alleged violation of rights guaranteed by Articles 10 and 14 (1) (a), 14 (1) (b) and 14 (1) (c) need not be considered.
The gravity and urgency of the matters in issue in these applications made it incumbent on the Court to hear the parties before Court without delay and decide the limited question of whether the Petitioners should be granted leave to proceed in the first instance and, if so, whether the issue of any interim reliefs were essential also in the first instance. Therefore, the Court ordered that these applications be supported on 12th November 2018. Accordingly, these applications were supported on 12th November 2018 before the Bench which had been listed to hear cases in Court 502 on that day in the usual course of listing of cases done the previous week.
On 12th and 13th November 2018, the Court heard submissions made by Mr. Kanag-Isvaran, PC representing the Petitioner in this application [SC FR 351/2018], Mr. Tilak Marapana, PC representing the Petitioners in SC FR 352/2018, Mr. Viran Corea representing the Petitioners in SC FR 353/2018, Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, PC representing the Petitioner in SC FR 354/2018, Mr. M.A. Sumanthiran, PC representing the Petitioner in SC FR 355/2018, Mr. J.C. Weliamuna, PC representing the petitioners in SC FR 356/2018, Mr. G.J.T. Alagaratnam, PC representing the Petitioners in SC FR 358/2018, Mr. Suren Fernando representing the Petitioners in SC FR 359/2018, Mr. Ikram Mohamed, PC representing the Petitioners in SC FR 359/2018 and Mr. Hejaz Hisbullah representing the Petitioner in SC FR 361/2018. Thereafter, the Court heard submissions made by Mr. Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, Attorney-General and by Mr. Sanjeeva Jayawardena, PC, Mr. Manohara De Silva, PC, Mr. Ali Sabry, PC, Mr. Gamini Marapana, PC and Mr. Canishka Vitharana representing the aforesaid five Intervenient-Petitioners.
Having considered these submissions, the Court made Order on 13th November 2018 allowing the applications for intervention made by the aforesaid five intervenient-Petitioners. Thus, they are now the 1st to 5th Added Respondents named in the Caption.
On 13th November 2018, having considered the submissions made on behalf of all the parties before us, the Court made Order granting the Petitioners in all nine applications leave to proceed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. In the circumstances of these cases, the Court also considered it necessary to issue Interim Orders in all nine applications staying the operation of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2096/70 dated 09th November 2018 (with the petition in the present application no. SC FR 351/2018) until 07th December 2018.
Further, the Court issued Interim Orders in SC FR 353/2018, SC FR 355/2018, SC FR 356/2018, SC FR 358/2018 and SC FR 361/2018 restraining the Chairman and members of the Elections Commission or their servants, subordinates and agents from acting in terms of the said Gazette Extraordinary No. 2096/70 dated 09th November 2018, until 07th December 2018.
In view of the need to hear and determine these applications without delay, the Court directed the added Respondents to file their statements of objections on or before 19th November 2018, the Petitioners to file their counter affidavits, if any, on or before 26th November 2018 and all parties to file their Written Submissions on or before 30th November 2018. The hearing of all these applications was fixed for 04th, 05th and 06th December 2018.
In terms of the aforesaid Order, the Hon. Attorney General and the five added Respondents have filed their statements of objections [by way of affidavits], the Petitioners have filed their counter affidavits and all these parties have filed their written submissions before 30th November 2018.
A bench comprising the aforesaid seven Judges was nominated to hear and determine these nine applications.
Firstly, the 1st added Respondent has pleaded, by way of “preliminary objections” that:
(i) the Petitioner has misrepresented material facts; (ii) the Petitioner‘s application is misconceived in Law; and (iii) -His Excellency, the President has acted lawfully and within the powers conferred upon him in terms of Article 33 (2), Article 62 (2) and Article 70 (3) Proviso (ii) of the Constitution and, therefore, there has been no infringement of any Fundamental Right of the Petitioner, hence the Application of the Petitioner should be dismissed in limine.”
The 1st added Respondent has also pleaded, by way of a further “preliminary objection” that “what is before Court is not a Supreme Court special determination in order to determine upon constitutionality, but is a fundamental rights application” and, accordingly, the jurisdiction vested in this Court when dealing with these applications is “to make just and equitable orders that have to be viewed in the corrected perspective in law.”. However, the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents have not taken up this position in their affidavits.
These “preliminary objections” averred by the 1st added Respondent address the merits of the dispute before Court and, therefore, will be considered when the Court is examining the merits of the cases of the Petitioners, the Respondents and the added Respondents.
The 1st added Respondent recounts events which have occurred since the conducting of the long delayed Local Government elections in February 2018, the critical challenges faced by the economy and the events which have occurred on and after 26th October 2018 including the events which occurred in Parliament on and after 14th November 2018.
Having done so, the 1st added Respondent pleaded that, “in these compelling, unprecedented and critical circumstances, H.E. the President of the Republic, in the due exercise of the powers conferred on him by the Constitution, dissolved Parliament as a prelude to resorting to taking the matter before the People at a General Election.”.
While acknowledging in paragraph [10] of his affidavit that “a General Election cannot be called and held except in terms of the Law”, the 1st added Respondent states that “in this instance the dissolution of Parliament and the calling of elections is lawful.”
In paragraph [16] of his affidavit, the 1st added Respondent avers that the Petitioner‘s application “Is incompatible with the larger right of the people to exercise their franchise even prior to the expiration of the formal term of Parliament.”.
In paragraph [18] of his affidavit, the 1st added Respondent has also stated that, under and in terms of Articles 33 (2) (c), 62 (2) and the Proviso to Article 70 (3), the President has the power to dissolve Parliament while Parliament stands prorogued.
Finally, in paragraph [20] if his petition the 1st added Respondent has averred that “the fundamental checks and balances between the Legislature and the Executive, including inter alia the power of the Legislature to impeach the President and the power of the President to dissolve Parliament cannot be eroded into without adversely impacting the inalienable Sovereignty and Franchise of the People and consequently, the preservation by Article 33 (2) (c) of the power of the President to dissolve Parliament subject to Article 35 and as a prelude to a General Election enabling the People who are supreme and the repository of inalienable Sovereignty to exercise their right of Franchise should be upheld by Your Lordships "Court.”.
The 5th added Respondent has contended in paragraphs [17], [20] and [21] of his affidavit that: (i) the President is under a constitutional duty to uphold sovereignty of the People by ensuring that the Government and the State function without any difficulties or failure and that “In the circumstances the President shall have power to exercise executive powers entrusted in him by the people to dissolve the Parliament on permissible provisions in the constitution in order to preserve the State and the Government.”; (ii) fundamental rights are subject to the limitations specified in Article 15 (7) of the Constitution and “wherefore the decision of the President taken in terms of the Constitution in the interest of national security, public order cannot be challenged by the petitioner."
The 2nd added Respondent raises the following “Preliminary Objections”: (i) Members of Parliament are necessary parties to the Petitioner‘s application and the failure to add all Members of Parliament is fatal to the maintainability of the application; (ii) the Petitioner‘s application is misconceived in law inasmuch as the Petitioner has not established a violation of a fundamental right, and (iii) in any event, the Proclamation marked - P1 is not subject to judicial review and, further, “the basis on which His Excellency the president formed an opinion to dissolve parliament is a political decision which your Lordship’s court has no jurisdiction to inquire into”; and (iii) the alleged violation has a specific remedy provided by the Constitution because “where the President’s act is unconstitutional, a specific remedy is provided in Article 38 (2) (a) (i) and therefore, the Petitioner ought to have if at all resorted to that remedy. In any event it is my position that the president’s act is constitutional and has not violated the law in any manner”.
Mr. Udaya Ranjith Seneviratne has filed an affidavit dated 19th November 2018 in the present case – i.e: SC FR 351/2018. He has done so in his capacity as the Secretary to His Excellency, the President since he is not named as a Respondent in his personal capacity.
He states, by way of “preliminary objections” that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the Petitioner‘s application, that the Petitioner‘s application is misconceived in law, that the Petitioner has failed to cite all necessary and affected parties and that the Petitioner‘s application is not in conformity with the Supreme Court Rules, 1990.
In paragraph [12] of his affidavit, the Secretary to His Excellency, the President states “I admit that the first proviso to Article 35 (1) of the Constitution recognizes the right of any person to make an application under Article 126 against the Attorney General, in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the President in his official capacity.”.
In paragraph [16] of his affidavit, the Secretary to His Excellency, the President states “I state that Parliament may be summoned, prorogued and dissolved inter alia in terms of Article 33 (2) (c), Article 70 (1), Article 70 (2), Article 70 (5), Article 70 (6), Article 70 (7), proviso to Article 70 (1) and proviso (ii) to Article 70 (3) of the Constitution.”.
In paragraphs [18], [22] and [27] of his affidavit, the Secretary to His Excellency, the President states that “His Excellency the President has acted at all times in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution” and “His Excellency the President has always acted according to the law and in terms of the Constitution”.
The Petitioners’ applications were all taken up for hearing on 4th December 2018 - application nos. SC FR 351/2018, SC FR 352/2018, SC FR 353/2018, SC FR 354/2018, SC FR 355/2018, SC FR 356/2018, SC FR 358/2018, SC FR 359/2018, SC FR 360/2018, and SC FR 361/2018 since the questions in issue in all these applications were much the same. Accordingly, we heard submissions made on behalf of Petitioners in these ten applications by Mr. Kanag-Iswaran, PC, Mr. Tilak Marapana, PC, Mr. Viran Corea, Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, PC, Mr. M.A. Sumanthiran, PC, Mr. J.C. Weliamuna, PC, Mr. Suren Fernando, Mr. G.J.T. Alagaratnam, PC, Mr. Ikram Mohamed, PC, and Mr. Hejaz Hizbullah, respectively.
Thereafter, submissions were made by Mr. Jayantha Jayasuriya PC, the Hon. Attorney General appeared in his official capacity. Mr. Sanjeeva Jayawardena, PC, Mr. Manohara De Silva, PC, Mr. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC, Mr. Gamini Marapana, PC, and Mr. Canishka Vitharana who appeared respectively for the 1st to 5th added Respondents.
