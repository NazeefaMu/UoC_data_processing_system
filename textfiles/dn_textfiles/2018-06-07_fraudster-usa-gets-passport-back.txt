Fraudster in USA gets passport back

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday ordered to release the passport belonging to a suspect who had been charged for preparing fake documents to obtain visas to the United States of America (USA).
The magistrate had ordered to impose the travel ban on Hiripitiyage Wilson Samarasinghe regarding the alleged preparing of fake documents to obtain visas to the United States of America (USA).
The suspect had fraudulently prepared letters as a former participant at an athletic event and another letter purportedly issued by the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Athletics Association, saying that he had participated in athletics and submitted it to the US Embassy to obtain a visit visa.
The US Embassy officer Ann Florence Nicholas had found that they were fake documents.
Earlier, the suspect had given a statement to the police that his first name was Hiripitiyage Premarathne and later had legally changed his name as Hiripityage Sugath Priyantha in 1999. After changing his name, he had been in the US in 1999 and worked at a fuel station and in 2004 had returned to Sri Lanka.
