Smoking claims three lives every hour

Today ,even though a lot of people talk about the number of deaths due to dengue, three smoking related deaths occur every hour, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the awards presentation held at the BMICH, Colombo recently for the winners of the literary competition held among schools to mark World Diabetes Day, Minister Dr. Senaratne said that annually the Government spends Rs. 142 billion to treat patients with Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and Rs. 72 billion spend on treating patients falling sick as a result of smoking. According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, 70 percent of hospital deaths occur in Sri Lanka today due to NCDs and people spend money to fall sick.
To address this issue steps were taken to increase tax on tobacco up to 90 percent. Today a Sri Lankan needs to spend Rs. 1000 to smoke a packet of cigarettes .
The Sri Lankan Government receives Rs. 100 billion as tax from tobacco but spends Rs 142 billion to treat people falling sick with NCDs.
The loss is Rs. 42 billion. Even if we calculate the difference between tobacco tax income and the money spent on treating patients with smoking related diseases, the difference (profit) is only Rs. 28 billion, he said.
No new liquor licenses had been issued and strict laws have been implemented on liquor.
All liquor shops have to close down with the expiration of their time because no new liquor licenses will be issued hereafter, he added.
