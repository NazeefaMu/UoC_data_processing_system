Exercise lower Alzheimer’s risk

Researchers at Vanderbilt assessed the heart and brain health of 314 people. They found those with the poorest heart health had brains that seemed up to 20 years older than they should be. Those with poor heart health had poor blood flow to the brain region where Alzheimer’s pathology starts. It is the clearest indication yet that exercise does help lower dementia risk
Exercise does lower your risk of Alzheimer’s, scientists claim after finding a link between poor heart health and memory issues. Experts warn the findings of the new study should be a red flag to everybody to exercise at least 30 minutes five times a week to improve their chances of avoiding the crippling neurodegenerative disease.
‘We currently know a lot about how to prevent and medically manage many forms of heart disease, but we do not yet know how to prevent or treat Alzheimer’s disease,’ said Director of the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer’s Center, Dr. Angela Jefferson.
“This research is especially important because it may help us leverage our knowledge about managing heart health to address and treat risk factors for memory loss in older adults before cognitive symptoms develop,” she added.
‘One way to put these results into a meaningful context is to define how one year of aging relates to blood flow in the brain,’ Dr Jefferson said.
“Then, we compare the effect of one year of aging to the effect of lower cardiac index. When we do that, we find that the effect of cardiac index on blood flow in the temporal lobes corresponds to 15 to 20 years of age.” she said.
Dr Jefferson said the study suggests that as we age we need to do more to aid blood flow in the brain, and the more exercise we do the lower our dementia risk appears to be.
‘It is now clear from a growing body of research evidence that there is a strong connection between heart health and brain health,’ said Alzheimer’s Association Chief Science Officer, Dr. Maria Carrillo.
‘We are pleased to have provided the initial seed funding for this intriguing science that is beginning to identify and investigate the mechanisms behind that connection.
Those mechanisms, once confirmed, may hold the key to effective treatments and prevention strategies for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias,” she added.
