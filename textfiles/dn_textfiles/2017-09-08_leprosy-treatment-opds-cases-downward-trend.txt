Leprosy  treatment  at OPDs : Cases on downward trend

The Health and Indigenous Medicine Ministry has launched a programme to treat leprosy patients at the Out Patients Departments (OPDs) of government hospitals since the incidence of leprosy has shown a decreasing trend.
Since leprosy is a skin disease, quick treatment at an OPD within 48 hours of contracting the disease can prevent it from spreading, the Anti-Leprosy Movement said.
The number of leprosy patients recorded in 2016 was 1,954, but the number had decreased to 974 patients in 2017. This was disclosed at a meeting presided by Minister Rajitha Senaratne at the ministry recently to resolve problems encountered by the Anti-Leprosy Movement.
It was also decided to develop the Hendala leprosy hospital situated on 7.5 acres as a hospital to teat elders.
Ministry Acting Secretary J Gunatilleke, Anti-Leprosy Movement Director P. S. Karunaratne and other officials were also present.
