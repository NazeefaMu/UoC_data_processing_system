National Film Corporation back in business

The government has decided to break the 18 year private sector monopoly of exhibiting local films and hand it over to the National Film Corporation once again. The government had given approval to reactivate the local cinema protection Act No 49 of 1971 once again on June 18.
President Maithripala Sirisena has given approval to reactivate this Act with amendments on the intervention of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. The amendments had been made in consultation with intellectuals in the field after several rounds of discussions. National Film Corporation Chairman Sithendra Senaratne addressing a special press conference held at corporation premises yesterday hailed this as a special victory attained by the corporation and the local community. Artistes Ravindra Randeniya Malani Fonseka, Veena Jayakody, Sumana Amarasinghe, Damith Fonseka, Sangeetha Weeraratne and Film directors Somaratne Dissanayake, Benette Ratnayake and several others artistes attended the conference.
