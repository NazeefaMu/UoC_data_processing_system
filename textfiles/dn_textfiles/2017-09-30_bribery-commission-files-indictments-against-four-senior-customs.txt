Bribery Commission files indictments against four senior Customs officials

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption yesterday, filed indictments in the Colombo High Court against four ex-senior Customs officials in connection with the largest ever recorded bribe nabbed by the Bribery Commission.
The Director General of the Bribery Commission filed indictments against Assistant Customs Superintendent Upali Gunaratne Perera, Customs Superintendent Wasantha Wimalaweera, Customs Superintendent Upali Wickremasinghe and Customs Superintendent Sudeera Jinadasa for allegedly being involved in accepting a bribe of Rs.125 million to release a consignment of spare parts worth Rs.1,500 million, imported to be used by the SLTB, by evading duty.
The Bribery Commission filed indictments against the accused on 14 counts. The prosecution further alleged that the four accused had committed these offences on or around June 26, 2015, under Section 11 of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994.
