SOS Children’s Village, Sri Lanka celebrates 35 years of service

SOS Children’s Villages, Sri Lanka will mark its 35th anniversary with a cultural show showcasing the talents of toddlers and teens from all 6 SOS Children’s Villages.
The cultural show will be attended by Siddharth Kaul, International President of SOS Children’s Villages International, Shubha Murthi, Continental Director and Deputy Secretary General for Asia - SOS Children's Villages International together with many dignitaries. Pooja Umashankar and Roshan Mahanama will grace this occasion as they play a vital role as the SOS Ambassadors.
During their one-week long visit, the International President and Continental Director will attend the 35th year celebration which is scheduled to be held on January 7, 2017 at 6pm at the Bishop’s College Auditorium and also will visit all five SOS centers spread across the country. “It is our moral and social responsibility to ensure that the children of our country are cared for and have access to a conducive environment to thrive in.
The aim of our work is to respect, promote and stand up for children's rights. The need to raise funds and build awareness is imperative in order to keep building on SOS’s legacy and to make sure that vulnerable Sri Lankan children are given an equal opportunity to grow,” commented Ananda Karunarathne, National Director of SOS Children’s Village, Sri Lanka. Founded in 1981 in Sri Lanka, SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka has served more than 41,000 Sri Lankan children in 6 Children’s Villages and Family Strengthening Programmes.
The work of SOS Children’s Villages has also been tightly intertwined with the country’s narrative.
The SOS Children’s Village in Nuwara Eliya initiated in 1984, succeeded in building a tightknit community which transcended ethnic barriers, despite the convoluted political climate which existed in Sri Lanka during its inception.
Furthermore, the organization has also been closely involved in safeguarding the rights and wellbeing of the country’s children in the aftermath of exigent events such as the 2004 Tsunami and the conclusion of a 30 year long war in 2009.
