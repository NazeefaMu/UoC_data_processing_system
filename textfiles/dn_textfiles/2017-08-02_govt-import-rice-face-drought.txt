Govt. to import rice to face drought

The Government will import rice in response to drought. Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen is finalising the orders to purchase rice from Thailand and Myanmar in keeping with recommendations by President Maithripala Sirisena and the Government’s Cost of Living Committee, a spokesman for the Industry and Commerce Ministry said.
He said Minister Bathiudeen had negotiations with rice authorities in India, Pakistan, Thailand and Myanmar to procure rice tranches.
The ministry will import 100,000 metric tons of Nadu and 25,000 metric tons of white raw rice from Thailand. About 30,000 metric tons of white raw rice will be imported from Myanmar and 100,000 metric tons from India to ensure sufficient rice in the market, he said.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe participating in a pinnacle unveiling ceremony at the Sri Mamgalarama Temple in Galnewa, said the drought is threatening the country’s rice production. If the drought continues it could bring down rice production by 50 percent, he said.
Industrial and Commerce Ministry sources said Pakistan agreed to supply rice to Sri Lanka from September.
The sources said paddy stocks in Government warehouses are being taken out for milling to face a possible shortage.
The milled rice will be sold to consumers lower than the market price. The ministry expects 187,000 metric tons of rice to flow into the market soon. With the rice supplies from India, there will be 287,000 metric tons for each month. There will be an excess of 87,000 metric tons of rice for consumption, the sources said.
