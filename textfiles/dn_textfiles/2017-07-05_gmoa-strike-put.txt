GMOA strike put off

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday postponed their strike which was to be launched today on the SAITM issue.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge addressing journalists in Colombo said they decided to postpone the strike by one week taking into consideration several new developments. Aluthge cited ‘positive’ proposals put forward by Minister Lakshman Kiriella at a special meeting held on Monday, the request made by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith to postpone the strike considering the dengue outbreak, a decision by the government to make a special announcement on the issue which was conveyed by Minister Kiriella to the GMOA, discussions held with the Maha Sangha of the Asgiriya chapter and the seriousness of the dengue outbreak as the new developments.
Aluthge also praised President’s efforts to solve the issue and added that however some other powerful individuals were trying to scuttle a settlement.
He said discussions with Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella on Monday was very positive and both sides had agreed to carry forward talks in the next few days as well.
He said the GMOA will also meet the Archbishop shortly following his request to halt strike action.
Several leading Cabinet Ministers informed the GMOA that both the PM and the President have one stand on the SAITM and their stand will be announced through a statement soon. The current dengue outbreak is another reason to postpone the strike, he addded.
