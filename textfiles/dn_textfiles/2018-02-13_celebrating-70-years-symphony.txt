Celebrating 70 years with a symphony

Retired Indian Foreign Secretary and Ambassador Srimati Nirupama Rao had a vision for South Asia. And that was to do her part in creating unity amongst South Asian nations through the power of music. Rao correctly identified that this ‘awakening’ is essential for South Asia at this juncture in time.
The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka is an internationally acclaimed orchestra with the ability to make Rao’s dream a reality. And that was what exactly happened last week at Ladies College Auditorium when the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka (SOSL) presented the concert ‘Music Beyond Borders’.
The concert, combining Sri Lankan and Indian musicians was astounding. The music created by internationally acclaimed American Conductor Viswa Subbaraman and the highly talented pianist Marialena Fernandes was this awakening. Their music was spellbinding. Fernandes really got the crowd going with her prodigious skill at the Piano and Subbaraman was at his best.
You could sense the euphoria of the crowd. It was almost tangible. Ambassador Rao’s quotation before the concert remained in our minds – ‘We as human beings are essentially wired to love and not to hate’. That is the true power of music, and that was what we all sensed that day - The transformative power of music.
Because you could appreciate the music that they made. You might be into jazz, R&B or rock, but you could appreciate their music, because you could see their passion. And seeing that passion gave you a positive vibe. Seeing that passion and commitment struck a chord in you.
For me, the type of music that the Symphony Orchestra put out is an acquired taste. Having watched many of these concerts I can appreciate this love. Unity. You fall in love with its uniqueness. You fall in love with this genre of music. Once you witness a performance like what took place last week at Ladies College, you will never turn down a chance to make another visit.
It is this awakening. You may have watched a hundred concerts but everyone is different because at every concert you become a little more aware of life and yourself. That too is the power of music that took place last week. Every song is different because when you sit down at a concert, you sit down with your life experiences. And when you listen to music like this, you begin to reflect upon your life experiences while watching the concert, and it speaks to you. It has a message for you. The music speaks to your heart. It is an awakening.
All in all it was well put together. It showed a lot of hard work and desire. Because, if you don’t have the desire you cannot do anything. And I saw that desire in the performance last week. They wanted to please us. They wanted to make us happy. They wanted to give us a fabulous time and for this we must salute them. It was a fine evening.
Ambassador Rao, pointed out that what was seen that day was the beginning of a journey that is underscored by the vision that we in South Asia can work together in harmony.
“We can now put all contention and conflict behind us, and bring together the vast number of talented people and through the power of their example, show the way forward towards a future of peace and harmony for this vast region that we belong to. Our common culture and shared history unite us. We also face common challenges which we will surmount together,” said Rao.
She commented that the germ for the idea came from her years of diplomacy and understood there is so much potential for peace in this region that we are living in.
“But we have to break the shackles and overcome the obstacles to reach that goal. So I began to think of the idea of bringing together musicians of our region to form a South Asian Symphony Orchestra. Of course the SOSL has created a wonderful example for their presence in the industry for 60 years. But we really need to strive towards synergy in our region,” said Rao.
Recently Rao was in Sri Lanka to deliver a lecture on Mahatma Gandhi and happened to be here on the inaugural day of the world choir games that was held here.
“I was sitting next to the honorable Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, at that function. I mentioned the idea I had to the Prime Minister for a South Asian Symphony Orchestra. He was very enthusiastic and since both Sri Lanka and India are celebrating 70 years of Independence, we thought it would be ideal to bring together musicians of the two countries, to perform in a concert to mark the 70 years of Independence,” added Rao.
Rao extended her heartfelt gratitude to all those from India and Sri Lanka, who contributed with sponsorships and made the event possible.
“So as the next step we want to more sponsorships, we look for more support, we plan to create a trust here in Sri Lanka, and we would like to create an endowment which will permit us to have more activities of this nature. We want to get musicians together. We want to conduct master classes and workshops. We want to bring in other countries because this is not about only India and Sri Lanka. I dream of seeing Afghans, Bangladesh and Maldivians, Bhutanese and many more to come together and show their prowess,” explained Rao.
Rao recalled a statement made by Lakshman Kadirgamar who said that South Asia is meant to be one. It is meant to be united. We are meant to communicate better with each other.
“Music becomes that Universal language. Nelson Mandela once said that – ‘We as human beings are essentially wired to love and not to hate.’ So we need to put our divisions behind and move forward and the youth are key to this,” pointed out Rao.
Chairperson of the Board of Governors of The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka, Sharmini Wettimuny, spoke about the exciting synergy that is the launch of the South Asian Symphony Orchestra. Wettimuny pointed out that music needs no translation and does transcend borders.
“The SOSL is honored to host the launch to the South Asian Symphony Orchestra as the musicians from Sri Lanka and India Collaborate in today’s concert.
“The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka has been performing regular concerts for 60 years. Ambassador Rao made a request from me, that the SOSL become the nucleus of the South Asian Symphony Orchestra so that the musicians of Sri Lanka and India can collaborate. To this we said yes! And that we will agree to support the forming of this new Orchestra. We are very privileged,” said Wettimuny. Wettimuny pointed out that in an Orchestra, people of different regions and different cultures come together as a unified force, as they work towards a common goal of harmony and balance.
“Music Beyond Borders exemplifies this unity as the musicians from India and Sri Lanka, who come from across many borders and speak over six languages, perform together in perfect harmony through the common language of music and their shared passion for music,” stated Wettimuny. Wettimuny stated that it was no easy feat getting all of this together, but with the help of Ambassador Rao they accomplished all of this in a short time and put together a concert of this magnitude.
“We were able to get musicians from many ethnicities and we are now able to stage this highly successful concert. I appeal to you diplomats, to help us establish contact with musicians in other countries. On behalf of the SOSL I wish to extend my thanks to Ambassador Nirupama Rao for her commitment and her untiring efforts to making this concert a reality.
I wish to thank Conductor Viswa Subbaraman and pianist Marialena Fernandes and the musicians from India who have traveled many miles to be here. I would also like to acknowledge the support given by his Excellency Taranjit Singh Sandhu for his support as well. As the SOSL, we deeply value the support of all our sponsors to sustain this genre of music in Sri Lanka. Tonight we have musicians performing as one unit. They are bonded by the common language of music and their shared passion of it,” explained Wettimuny.
The concert took place on Wednesday February 7 at 7.30pm at the Ladies College Hall.
