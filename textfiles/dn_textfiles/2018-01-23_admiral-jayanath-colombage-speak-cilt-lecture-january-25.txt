Ocean brings unknown wealth and potential. It is evident that 95 % of the underwater remains unexplored. The ocean is also the largest habitat for marine life with more than three billion people depending on it as a primary source of protein.
The ocean becomes the focus of attention in the field of development and sustainable development both nationally and internationally. The world is, in many ways, a turning point in your economic priorities in the ocean.
Indian Ocean, which has been nourished for thousands of years by many rivers and tributaries, contains large quantities of commercially exploitable hydro carbons; gas and oil, and seabed minerals in addition to a rich diversity of living resources such as fish and exotic marine life.
In current context, the Indian Ocean which surrounds us poses both opportunities and threats. It is viewed by many as the most strategically vital ocean in the 21st century. As India and China struggle to gain dominance, Sri Lanka can play a role to its benefit. CILT provides a professional identity to those in the ever-expanding Logistics and Transport industry. It is astrong, active and a unified professional body that is able to speak with authority on strategic issues affecting businesses and people in the industry and support their careers.
