‘Delimitation Review Committee incomplete’

The report of the Delimitation Review Committee is incomplete and contains a number of errors, the Government has been informed.
The report has not indicated whether the number of seats in Local Government bodies has to be increased under the new electoral system and if so what steps should have to be taken in that regard. It has also not dealt with the changes necessary to the electorates as of the population ratio.When Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris handed the report over to Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha on Monday, he refused to accept it on the grounds that two Committee members had not signed it.
