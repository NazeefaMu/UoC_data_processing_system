The decline of the English novel

At last month’s award ceremony for the inaugural Republic of Consciousness Prize for small presses, I experienced a flicker of déjà vu. Of the four novels recognized by the judges – one winner and three runners-up – only one, Paul Stanbridge’s Forbidden Line, was by an English author. It had only been a couple of months since the Goldsmiths Prize for innovative fiction was awarded to Mike McCormack for his novel, Solar Bones. That prize has been going for four years, and in that time its winners have been either Scottish (one) or Irish (three). I found myself wondering about the state of the English novel. Are English fiction writers, readers and publishers more risk-averse than their counterparts in Ireland and Scotland? Solar Bones won a runners-up prize at the Republic of Consciousness awards, as did another book by an Irish novelist, Anakana Schofield’s Martin John (which had also been shortlisted for the Goldsmiths Prize). Why did it fall to two tiny independent publishers – Tramp Press in Dublin and the Buckinghamshire-based And Other Stories – to publish these two formally challenging novels?
In the broad historical sweep, the decline of the archetypal English novel, with its descriptive realism, unilinear narrative and conventional sensibility, may be traced all the way back to the middle of the last century. In The Prose Factory: Literary life in England after 1918, the critic D. J. Taylor attributes this partly to the formal innovations of literary modernism, and partly to the horrors of the Second World War: “To put it bluntly . . . Belsen, Auschwitz and Katyn need something more than the traditional patternings of character, irony and sentiment to be done justice by art”. But if the traditional English novel is no longer the pre-eminent force it once was, its hold on the collective psyche remains strong. The author Neil Griffiths, who founded the Republic of Consciousness Prize, believes there is a fundamental difference in mindset between English and Irish literary cultures when it comes to creativity and experimentation: “The three pillars of Irish modernism – Joyce, Beckett and Flann O’Brien – pretty much give anyone following permission to try anything as long as the writing is of the highest order. That’s both a liberation and a challenge. The bar is very high indeed, but that can only be good for ambition. Whereas in England, after Virginia Woolf there was a reaction, and the three pillars became Waugh, Powell and Amis – who wrote short novels about the middle and upper classes, ironizing anything approaching high emotion or deep feeling. It had a kind of deadening effect on anyone not of the same sensibility. And anything stylistically challenging was felt to be pretentious”.
Local appeal
It is certainly true that much of the most exciting and innovative work seems to be happening on the fringes, away from the mainstream.
Laura Waddell, a writer and a board member of PEN Scotland, reckons outsider status can have an invigorating effect on literary culture. “A lot that happens independently in Scotland and Ireland is a necessary response to geographical distance from London-centric literary press and culture”, she told me.
“When a literary culture is positioned as external but in relation to a bigger and more centralized one – distinguished for all kinds of reasons, including local appeal sales, press and national funding bodies – it may give rise to work that is different in style from its bigger neighbour and conceives itself, in part, as ‘different’.
The indie publishing scene is thriving at the moment, and innovation often emerges in that context. Literary culture here is self-aware in national identity, and it is the other.”
Lara Williams, whose collection of stories Treats was shortlisted for the Republic of Consciousness Prize, lives in Manchester but is published by the Glasgow-based indie press Freight Books. She recalls: “When I first began sending my collection out – at that point, without an agent – publishers with open submission policies did seem to be confined outside of England: Doire Press in West Ireland, Seren Books in Wales and Freight Books in Scotland. So I think there is some more obvious risk-taking and less formalism happening beyond the English publishing scene. That said, I live across the road from the offices of Comma Press, who are putting out works I can’t imagine finding a home anywhere else”.
The literary critic David Collard has been an enthusiastic supporter of the Republic of Consciousness Prize. He maintains that innovative English fiction is alive and well; the trouble is that small publishers are under-resourced and so it is harder for their novels to get the coverage they deserve. “I’m not sure that too much emphasis should be placed on prizes and prize-winners when it comes to diagnosing the state of the anglophone novel. For my money the best recent novels are Paul Stanbridge’s Forbidden Line, Harry Parker’s Anatomy of a Soldier and Eimear McBride’s The Lesser Bohemians, which is set in London. The latter two both came from Faber, who seem to have rediscovered their modernist mojo. But most of the books that snag my attention and admiration seem to come from tiny independent publishers.”
“With small presses it’s not all about marketing, and focus groups, and risk aversion. While small presses may be a way ahead in that sense, the writers don’t get much out of it – tiny advances (if any), modest sales and little financial support. I’ve sometimes made the perhaps glib analogy with other hipster enterprises – artisan cheese, vinyl records, craft beers – in that indie publishers are operating on a shoestring for a very savvy and encouragingly substantial audience.”
Indeed, there seems to be a direct correlation between scale and risk-taking. Joanna Walsh, the award-winning author of experimental fiction (Vertigo) and creative nonfiction (Hotel), told me: “It’s chiefly small-scale indie publishers and imprints such as And Other Stories, Galley Beggar, Fitzcarraldo, Influx, Tuskar Rock, that consistently publish the most innovative fiction in English. Of these, only Galley Beggar and Influx publish mainly English writers, with the others devoted largely to literature in translation, and from other English-speaking countries”. In a similar vein, Eileen Battersby, the literary correspondent of the Irish Times, observes that “the novels of ideas tend to be the novels in translation”.
She cites Mathias Enard’s Compass, which was longlisted for this year’s Man Booker International Prize, as one of a number of bold, adventurous works that have come to the attention of anglophone readers in recent years.
“The imaginative storytelling and narrative artistry of these books are well able to deal with the demands of having to move between two languages.
We should acknowledge the ability of gifted literary translators such as Celia Hawksworth, Anthea Bell, Don Bartlett, Sam Garrett, Frank Wynne and Sophie Hughes, and also look at what’s coming from China, Korea and Japan. Istros in particular is publishing outstanding work from the Balkan region.
These books are exciting. They’re not predictable or formulaic, as is so much of the hyped fiction coming from the big American and English publishers.
You’re really talking about imagination versus banal commercialism.”
