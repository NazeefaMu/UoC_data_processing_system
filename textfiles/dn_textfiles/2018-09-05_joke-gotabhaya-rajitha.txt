Joke is on Gotabhaya - Rajitha

It is a joke that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has invited people to take part in today’s protest because he replied protestors with bullets during the previous regime, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said incidents such as the shooting at Rathupaswala protesters who agitated for drinking water, shooting at fishermen, and shooting at Free Trade Zone workers during the previous regime took place with the knowledge of the former Defence Secretary.
The Minister was speaking after an inspection tour of Kegalle General Hospital.
Minister Senaratne said the former Defence Secretary is shameless to invite people for the SLPP protest. Now murders and large-scale financial fraud that occurred during the previous regime are gradually being revealed and the law is being implemented perfectly. The persons who committed crimes are scared now. But the people have not forgotten the crimes committed by the previous regime.
The people are with this government which gave them freedom. The entire country is watching what will happen to the criminals next year, the Minister said.
