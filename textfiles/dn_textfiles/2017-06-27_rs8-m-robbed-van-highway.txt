Rs.8 m robbed from van on highway

 A group of armed men had fled after robbing nearly Rs.8 million belonging to a clothing store while the money was being taken from one of the shop’s branches in Wattala to another branch in Kadawatha in a van.
The incident had taken place in Ragama at around noon yesterday where the armed men had blocked the van with their own vehicle and had taken the money after threatening to shoot.
After taking the money two gunmen had shot at the van’s tyres before fleeing the scene in a car.
No casualties were reported in the incident. Police have launched an investigation to apprehend the perpetrators.
