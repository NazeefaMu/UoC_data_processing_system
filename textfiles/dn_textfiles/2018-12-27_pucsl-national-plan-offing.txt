PUCSL national plan in the offing

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator and the shadow regulator for the lubricant market, held public consultation sessions in nine provinces this year to formulate a national plan for the sectors.
The PUCSL received public views and suggestions on streetlight management and issues of electricity, drinking water and petroleum sectors.
Over 1,500 people participated in the final session held in the North Central Province at the Golden Mango Resort Auditorium recently.
Over 8,000 public and government officers, institutions, business community and non-government organisations participated in year-round sessions and about 2,500 people representing government, non-government, social group and individuals submitted their written views and oral formats.
The PUCSL launched the sessions in March this year from the Southern Province.
“Now we are developing a plan along with Provincial Councils, Local Government Authorities, representatives of consumers and other institutions. We received many valuable comments from every social platform and group,” PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said. “We will implement the plan in all provinces with the approval of the Government,” he said.
“The PUCSL will expand the public consultations to other provinces,” its Chairman Saliya Mathew said.
“The PUCSL carries out the sessions in accordance with the Act of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka under section 17 (b) and the Electricity Act. We will make regulations considering the submitted views.” Mathew said.
The PUCSL along with the Sustainable Energy Authority has drafted a national plan for managing street lights. The regional public consultation gave the platform for the public and other stakeholders to comment and submit their suggestions on the proposed national plan.
The regional public consultations also identified the recommendations to prepare mechanisms for the issues of electricity, drinking water and petroleum along with government institutions. The PUCSL will upgrade the regulatory tools that were already prepared for the electricity sector.
