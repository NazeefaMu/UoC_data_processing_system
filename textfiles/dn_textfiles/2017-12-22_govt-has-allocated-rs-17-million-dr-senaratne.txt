Govt. has allocated Rs. 1.7 million: Dr. Senaratne

The government has allocated Rs. 1.7 million for next year, to provide free eye lenses to all patients who undergo eye surgeries at State hospitals in the country, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, according to the latest calculations, a total of 150,000 eye lenses are required for next year. In this year, a total of 100,000 eye lenses were imported to be offered free-of-charge. All eye surgeries will be performed without any issues next year.
In Sri Lanka, a total of 1.7 percent of the population above the age of 40 years suffer from various types of eye diseases. By 2026, a total of 26 percent of the elderly population will be blind in the country. The Health Ministry will take all possible steps to prevent this, he said.
Performing all eye surgeries will be accelerated during next year in order to cut down long-waiting lists existing in the State sector. Eye surgeries will be performed in private hospitals (in addition to the State hospitals), and the required bills will be paid by the government on behalf of patients, he added.
