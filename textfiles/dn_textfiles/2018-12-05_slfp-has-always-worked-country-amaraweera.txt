SLFP has always worked for country- Amaraweera

Sri Lanka Freedom Party Vice President and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has always taken decisions for the sake of country.
He said that the SLFP fought within the National Government against corruption and fraud. “We raised our voice against Central Bank Bond scam and emphasised that perpetrators should be brought to book.
Addressing the special convention of SLFP at Sugathadasa Indoor stadium yesterday he added that the Central Bank bond scam is something that they never expected but the government started investigations due to the pressure exerted by the SLFP members in the government.
“The president took a bold decision to leave the National Government, as various conspiracies were being hatched against the country,” he said.
He reiterated that he will never leave the party and he will never betray it to any other party. “There are number of political parties in the country but no party has an identitity as the SLFP and the party has left an indelible imprint in the heart of people, he said .
