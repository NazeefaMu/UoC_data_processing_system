Gang attacks occupants in Chavakachcheri

Three men visited a house on a motorcycle late Sunday night in Madathadi, Chavakachcheri and attacked its occupants with swords and sharp objects.
The Police Media Spokesman’s office said the attackers had knocked the door and when the door was opened, they had attacked the chief occupant of the house.
The 68-year-old victim was admitted to the Jaffna hospital.
No suspects were identified and Police believe that the attack may have been a result of a personal feud between the two parties. Chavakachcheri Police are investigating.
