IFIP and SEARCC partner with CSSL for ICT event

The Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) has assembled an impressive line-up of speakers for the upcoming NITC 2017 (National IT Conference), which is being held in conjunction with the IFIP General Assembly and SEARCC Conference.
With around 100 prominent experts visiting Colombo for the international events, CSSL has taken the opportunity to draw on the significant pool of international talent to offer delegates unprecedented access to thought leaders from around the globe.
CSSL President Yasas Vishuddhi Abeywickrama is predicting record attendances at the combined events, eclipsing the 1,000 ICT professionals, researchers and academics who attended NITC last year.
“Given the calibre of international speakers we’ve been able to attract and the significant opportunities to network and form valuable business connections, we expect this event to be a significant focus for the local ICT community,” he said.
International speakers include: President of SEARCC and Adjunct Professor at the University of Queensland, Dr Nick Tate; Vice President of the British Computer Society, Professor Tom Crick of Cardiff Metropolitan University; IFIP IP3 Chair and former Australian Computer Society President, Brenda Aynsley; IFIP Vice President, Dr Yuko Murayama of Japan; Dr Gabriela Marin Raventos of the University of Costa Rica; Professor Kai Rannenberg of Goethe University in Frankfurt, and many more.
The five-day program includes the two-day NITC/SEARCC (South East Asian Regional Computer Confederation) conference on 14-15 September, preceded by three days of invitation-only meetings for the IFIP General Assembly, its various committees and SEARCC Executive Committee.
“The confirmed guest list currently includes representatives from almost 50 nations so this is really an opportunity to showcase Sri Lankan ICT to the world,” said Abeywickrama.
“We’ve scheduled several networking and social events such as the International ICT Gala Dinner and presentation of the CSSL Awards, SEARCC International Awards and International Schools Software Competition Awards, along with various lunches and morning/afternoon teas to give delegates numerous chances to connect with our international visitors,” he said.
“This is definitely going to be the biggest ICT event, in terms of the breadth and diversity of representation that Sri Lanka has even seen. The Sri Lankan Government has been quick to recognise the significance of this opportunity with both the ICT Agency and Sri Lanka Tourism coming on board as partners.
“We’re delighted to have that level of support and involvement from the Government and are optimistic this event will bring important new knowledge and connections to Sri Lanka.”
