JO protest a success, says MR

Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa speaking to the media during the Janabalaya Kolambata protest yesterday said that it was a success and would go on till dawn. He said despite obstacles, a large crowd had gathered in Colombo and said more obstacles will only further strengthen the JO. He said the JO will organise similar protests in the future as well.
Meanwhile, a section of the crowd gathered in the Fort area for the protest started a Satyagraha last night.
