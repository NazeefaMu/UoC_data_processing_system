[CITIZENS' Mail - (08-01-2018)]

Think before you point the finger
It may be recalled and also conveyed the public that it was the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in Parliament, who first referred the Bond issue. He was open-minded enough to appoint a JVPer, who normally are against the UNP, as Chairman of the COPE committee.
We must not overlook the fact that it was the Premier Wickremesinghe who appointed a three-member committee to inquire into this Bond issue and then was on the verge of referring it to the AG. Then due to a demand by public, the President referred it to a Presidential Commission for a report.
After a full circle of eight months the report is out and I am sure it will be referred to Courts by the AG, if there is a Prima Facie case. Only then will the courts give a verdict and point out the accused parties. The media, however, have been quick to name the accused after repeating false headlines.
