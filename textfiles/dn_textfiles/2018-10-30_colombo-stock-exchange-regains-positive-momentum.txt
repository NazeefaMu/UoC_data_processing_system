Meanwhile Colombo District Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Amila Kankanamge said that the speech made by President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday explaining in detail as to how and why the new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed and the reason he decided to do so too has given a confident factor for them to move forward in a more positive manner.
