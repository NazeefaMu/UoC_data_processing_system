Forty two Indian fishing boats to be released on several conditions

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said, the government has decided to release 42 Indian fishing boats on several conditions.
The Minister made this announcement at the fisheries advisory council meeting held at the ministry auditorium on Thursday. Over 140 Indian fishing vessels were taken into custody by the Sri Lanka Navy for fishing in the Sri Lankan territorial water using bottom-trawling.
All attempts made by both governments for over 35 years to solve this issue have been futile.
Minister Amaraweera added, these fishing vessels are released on the condition that they will never enter country’s territorial water again.
The number of Indian fishing vessels trespassing Sri Lankan maritime boundary has dropped by 50 percent, following a number of measures adopted by the Indian government, he said.
Minister Amaraweera said, India has suspended issuing of licences for fishing boats. “Over 200 fishing boats which were engaged in bottom-trawling have been converted to multiday fishing boats to fish in the deep sea,” he added.
