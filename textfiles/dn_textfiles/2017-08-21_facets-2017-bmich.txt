FACETS 2017 at BMICH

For the past 26 years the FACETS International Gem & Jewelry Exhibition has featured the best of Sri Lankan design and craftsmanship. The previous year saw the addition of the Premier Jewelry Pavilion to the list of the exhibition’s main features.
Having won the admiration of President Maithripala Sirisena himself, the Pavilion went on to attract a large number of local and international visitors.
As a result of this tremendous success the FACETS Organizing Committee has made arrangements for the return of the Premier Jewelry Pavilion at the 27th edition of the exhibition, which will take place from August 31 to September 3 at BMICH.
