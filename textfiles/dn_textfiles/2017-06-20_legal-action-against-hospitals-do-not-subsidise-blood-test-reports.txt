Legal action against hospitals that do not subsidise blood test reports

 
The Health Ministry will take legal action against private hospitals and laboratories that do not implement the new reduced charges for the blood tests use to diagnose dengue fever, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
The Spokesman said Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had instructed National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA) officials submit a report to him on if people are receiving the benefit of reduced prices for blood tests.
All private hospitals are required to implement the new prices and issue the blood reports to the patients within half an hour.
The reduced price of a Full Blood Count is Rs. 250 and Dengue Antigen Test (NS1) is Rs. 1,000.
These reduced prices are valid until further notice, he said.
