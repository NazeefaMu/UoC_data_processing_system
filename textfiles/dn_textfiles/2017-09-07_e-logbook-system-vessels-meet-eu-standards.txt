E-logbook system in vessels to meet EU standards

Fishing in high seas:
The Fisheries Ministry conforming to EU requirements of recording and reporting fishing activity in high seas, has provided electronic logbooks for skippers of 2,400 multi-day fishing vessels.
The government has spent Rs. 80 million for the provision of electronic logbooks, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
He said it was by reason of not taking into account and ignoring international requirements such as this that prompted the European Union to impose a ban on Sri Lankan fish under the previous government.
The e-logbooks have been distributed among skippers of multi-day boats through district fisheries officers, ministry sources said.
In keeping with recommendations of the European Union, the electronic logbook software system was made by the Information Technology Unit of Colombo University, the sources said.
The skippers of vessels are to report their fish catch, landing and transshipment declarations through the e-logbook.
“One can carry it in one’s hand like a phone, but it is rougher than a phone. It is like a phone as anybody can use it without difficulty. The item is user friendly and water proof,” an official said.
E-logbook is for transmitting and keeping fish catch and activity data. It is transmitted via satellite technology to international monitoring authorities.
“The use of E-logbook is compulsory for vessel skippers. It will be helpful for them to carry out their fishing activities on a scientific footing," he said.
