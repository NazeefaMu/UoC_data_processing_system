‘Sri Lanka spends over 50 hours on single import, export task’

World Bank Statistics say Sri Lanka spends more than 50 hours on a single import or export process while Singapore spends only one to four hours for the same task, Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne said.
The State Minister said an E-Signature mechanism would be implemented to minimise the time taken for manual signing procedure in imports and exports related tasks.
He was addressing the media at Sirikotha, United National Party (UNP) Headquarters yesterday.
“The payment platform executes jointly between the Customs, Bank of Ceylon and People’s Bank will be further expanded to allow its access to every commercial bank to ease the transactions of the Customs,” Wickramaratne said.
