Thiruketheeswaram excavated

Earlier during the prehistoric period, Thiruketheeswaram temple was called Mahathuvadapuri. With the passage of time, it was named Matota. But later Matota was known as Mantota. Yet the Sinhalese called it Mahatitta. It was generally believed that before the arrival of King Vijaya in the 5th century A.D, numerous trading activities took place between India and Lanka.
It is worthwhile to note that numerous references have been made about the historical developments. Another historical reference reveals that in the 4th century A.D, the sacred tooth relic was brought from Kalinga Desha to protect it from hostile forces.
Portuguese historian Do Couto mentioned that during an excavation project in 1575, the workers found a chain under a foundation. It was made out of iron. He further said that such type of chain was not seen anywhere else even in India.
Pali Dathavamsa
The bearer of the Sacred Tooth Relic landed at Mathota and spent the night at a Hindu temple. It was generally believed that the above mentioned Hindu temple must be Thiruketheeswaram. But the name of the temple was not at all mentioned anywhere else in the history. However, it is worthy of mentioning here that ‘Pali Dathavamsa’ did not directly mention the name of the port where the bearer landed with the Sacred Tooth Relic. It is simply mentioned as Lankapatuna.
Portuguese capture
Another important evidence regarding this temple could be found in ‘Sambavakkurippu’ by Vishvanartha Sastriyar of Jaffna. He mentions how the temple area was engulfed by the sea on numerous occasions. In 1540 the sea caused damage to the temple. According to him, the poojas continued till 1589. The historical evidence further proves that the Portuguese captured Mannar in 1591. As soon as they captured Mannar, they built the Mannar fort. The Portuguese conquered the Jaffna kingdom in 1591. The ancient Thiruketheeswaram temple was demolished in 1591 A.D. As soon as the friars saw the valuable Hindu images, they buried them within their church premises.
The Portuguese needed a bell for their newly built church in Mannar. They did not have any metal to make it. They asked the local people to find a metal for the bell. And they were informed that in lieu they would be given clothing. A few days after the announcement, somebody informed them that a piece of metal was found on the surface of the ground. When the ground was dug they found nearly 18 pieces of different images of deities. Out of the valuable treasure, they made the bell.
Mahadevan Kovil
An inscription found in Mathodam indicated that another temple named Thiruvirameswara Udaiya Mahadevan Kovil had existed in the past. It was further learnt that Rajendra1, made an endowment to the temple. During the period, Thiruketheeswaram was named as Mahadevan Kovil by the Chola regime and Mathodam was named Rajarajeswaram. The Chola regime occupied Sri Lanka during the 10th and 11th century A.D. During this period Thiruketheeswaram temple was maintained well and the port city was beautifully preserved. According to a Chiddambaram inscription in the 13th century, the Thiruketheeswaram was built by a Pandyan king known as Sundara Pandyan 1 in typical Pandyan style.
In the 19th century, an eminent scholar indicated that in the city of Manthai numerous Romanian coins of different period’s specimen of pottery and gold and silver chains were found. The original temple site was razed to the ground. All the valuables of the temple belongings were buried including the ancient Siva Lingam. During the period the coastal towns were robbed by pirates. Once even Kanniya Kumari temple was robbed. In Sri Lanka in 1847 Javanese also pirated one of the Hindu temples in Thambalagamam.
After a few decades, the Archaeological Commissioner the late E.M. Hocart made a massive excavation on Manthai and the surrounding areas in between 1925 and 1928. He found a handful of findings. Again in 1950 numerous excavations projects were carried out. From the earlier excavation, valuable materials were found.
Different countries
The interesting materials including a variety of pottery that belonged to different countries, such as China, Rome and Arabian were found. Former Archaeological Department head Sanmuganathan began the excavations in 1950, but unfortunately, he passed away.
In 1950 some of his works were published. According to him when Anuradhapura was the capital Manthai was one of the important ports. One of the historical facts indicates that the city was encircled by a parapet wall and a ditch around a fortification. Periodically numerous excavations had taken place in Manthai.
It is stated that initial excavations took place 1rom 1887 to 1928. Even the 7th-century Tamil hymns of Saiva saints, especially Thirugnansamanthar and Suntheramoorthy Nayanar beautifully mention Thiruketheeswaram.
Again another excavation took place on the 18th of April 1950. It revealed a 40 feet Eastern pathway. Besides this, another parallel narrow pathway was also found. Moreover a few decades ago a big Sivalingam was found in the close vicinity surrounded by centuries-old buildings.
