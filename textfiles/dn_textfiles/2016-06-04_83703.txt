JO to reveal many malpractices

The Joint Opposition (JO) would reveal many malpractices committed by the Finance Minister and his supporters which were unknown to the country as well as to the UNP during the No Confidence Motion (NCM) debate to be taken up against him in Parliament on June 8, Joint Opposition member Bandula Gunawardena said.
He added that the not only the SLFP and UPFA members who joined the government but also many of the UNP members would be compelled to vote for this motion with the revelation of these facts.
Gunawardena made these observations yesterday at a press conference at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella.“Ravi Karunanyake is a Finance Minister who had given wrong facts to the Parliament and had allegedly amended tax outside the budget proposals even against the pledges by the President,” MP Gunawardena said.
“He had amended vehicle import tax in a manner that India would benefit more than other countries like Japan.We don’t know if it was pledge fulfilled to India for the support the government got during the elections,.”MP Gunawardena said
He added that the land business is also among the bankrupt businesses due to the government’s economic mismanagement.
Joint Opposition Members Bandula Gunawardena, Keheliya Rambukwella, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena and Udaya Gammanipla also spoke at the occasion.
