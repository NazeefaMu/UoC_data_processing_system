Silent protest opposite Akkaraipattu Municipal Council

Akkaraipattu Municipal Council officials and other employees organised a silent protest opposite the Municipal Council condemning the false allegation made against the Municipal Commissioner on September 18.
A group of people scolded Municipal Commissioner A.L.M.Azmi and intimidated him to the effect that the Commissioner did not make arrangements to lay the foundation stone for the Akkaraipattu public play ground development project launched by the SLMC recently.
