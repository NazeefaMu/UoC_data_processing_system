WP Civil Appellate HC Judge interdicted

The Judicial Services Commission (JSC) yesterday decided to interdict Western Provincial Civil Appellate High Court Judge Mohan Seneviratne.
Sources said the decision to suspend his service has been taken by the Commission last evening after inquiring into a complaint made by a litigant in the Galle District.
