Free education system will be strengthened to benefit all children: President

President Maithripala Sirisena says he will take steps to create a society of intellectuals by strengthening the free education system and providing equal benefits to all children in the country.
He made these remarks at the centenary celebrations of the Visakha Vidyalaya at the school premises on Monday.
The President was warmly received by the schoolchildren as he arrived at the venue.
The President addressing the gathering commended the great journey of 100 years of the Visakha Vidyalaya.
President Sirisena said the challenges of new technology, commercialisation and competitiveness, as well as the powerful social evils, pose great challenges for the future and in that context, our children should be ready to move forward while protecting our values and culture.
In 1917, Jeremias Dias founded the Visakha Vidyalaya. It is the oldest Buddhist Girls’ College in Sri Lanka. The commemorative coin was presented to the President by Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
Ministers Ravi Karunanayake, Gayantha Karunathilaka, Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi, the staff of the Visakha Vidyalaya, including its Principal Sandamali Aviruppola, parents and past pupils participated.

A Commemorative Coin of Rs. 2,000 denomination was issued to mark the Centenary of Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo on January 23.
Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy presented the first coin to President Maithripala Sirisena during a ceremony at the school premises.
The obverse of the coin depicts the portrait of the founder Jeremias Dias with the words ‘1917 Visakha Vidyalaya Centenary 2017’ in English on the periphery and ‘Selestina Jeremias Dias’ at the bottom edge. The reverse of the coin depicts a lamp in gold at the centre. The face value of Rs. 2,000 in large numerals with the words of Sri Lanka currency name in Sinhala, Tamil and English and ‘Year 2017’ appear just below the words. The words ‘Pannaya Parisujjhati’ in English on the periphery at the top edge of the coin and the country name in Sinhala, Tamil, and English are depicted at the bottom edge of the coin.
Visakha Vidyalaya is the first girls’ school to launch a Commemorative Coin - a significant achievement for the school.
The school was founded on January 16, 1917 by Jeremias Dias as an institution of learning for Buddhist girls at a time when such institutions were rare. It was initially called ‘Buddhist Girls’ College’ established at a house called “The Firs” at Turret Road, Colombo. It later moved to its present premises at Vajira Road on November 21, 1927 and renamed ‘Visakha Vidyalaya’ by the spouse of then Governor Sir Herbert J. Stanley.
From humble beginnings, it has risen to the position of the most sought-after school for girls in the country.
