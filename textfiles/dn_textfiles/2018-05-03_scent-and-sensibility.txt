Scent and sensibility

A scent speaks much about your persona. The trail of fragrance that you leave behind will determine how you spend your day to a large extent. Get a little nosy about the subject with these pointers and make your scent make your day!
Choosing the right perfume
A fragrance is very physical so if it is ‘love at first spritz’, it means you have found your confidence-boosting scent. Spritz one of your favourite scents to your skin, let it settle and see if it still feels right at the end of the day. Test it on people you love and hear what they say. But most importantly, check if does boost your confidence and makes you feel fabulous.
Perfume, deodorant or body spray?
Using a deodorant is a definite must as a deodorant is a substance applied to the body to prevent body odour caused by the bacterial breakdown of perspiration. Perfumes are a mixture of different aromatic extracts and oils that give pleasant odours. On the other hand, a body spray is just a milder form of perfume. Perfumes are costlier than body sprays. The body sprays that are more like scented alcohol are less concentrated and lighter.
Testing a perfume
Test the perfume on blotting paper or a tissue or apply a few drops or the lightest spray to your wrist or the back of your hand. Don’t sniff it right away. Wait a few minutes. Give the fragrance time to bloom on your skin.
Skin type and perfumes
Perfume experts cannot stress this enough: what smells good on one person may smell different on another. It is not just a matter of taste or preference or a matter of how the nose perceives a certain smell. Rather, it’s a matter of how the body and skin reacts with the ingredients of a certain fragrance. The truth is that a brand of perfume can be the Number 1 best-selling fragrance across the globe but it is not going to smell great on everyone because of each person’s unique body chemistry.
Differences between Eau de Parfum, Eau de Toilette, aftershave and cologne
The main difference between types of fragrance lies in the concentration of essences. The order of highest to lowest concentration is first perfume, second, Eau de Parfum, third, Eau de Toilette, and fourth Eau de Cologne. Perfume is very expensive because it can have up to 40 percent concentration of essences.
Niche perfumes
Boutique artisanal perfume studios whose production is on a much smaller scale and whose presence in mainstream retail stores is minimal or non-existent are thus referred to as niche. These are the scents you might likely find at a perfume specialist or high-end fragrance boutique.
Perfumes for daytime and perfumes for nighttime
There are no rules that some perfumes should be worn at daytime while others are reserved for nighttimes. Basically, wear a fresh light perfume in the day time, and strong and dark tone smelling ones at night time. This is because day time is usually warmer than night time, and vice versa.
The amount of perfume one should spray on oneself
Fragrances latch onto fibers, which is why the strands of your hair will carry the scent of perfume for a long-lasting effect. Spray your scent of choice behind the ear lobes. This area is a pulse point, where the body is warmer, which will serve to enhance the fragrance. However it is not advisable to wear more than one perfume at a time.
Fragrance and mood changes
Fragrances can both affect and change your moods. Not only does fragrance affect the mood, but it can actually enhance work performance and behaviour in various ways.
Making a perfume last long
The best time to spray on a perfume is after a shower or bath. Well-hydrated skin holds fragrance the best, so spritz a fragrance after getting out of the shower and applying unscented body lotion.
