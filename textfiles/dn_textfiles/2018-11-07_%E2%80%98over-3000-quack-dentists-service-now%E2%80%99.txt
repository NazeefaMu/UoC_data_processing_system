‘Over 3,000 quack dentists in service now’

Former President of the General Dental Practitioners Association Dr. Hilary Cooray said 3,000 fake dentists operate in the country and they use forged registrations numbers to prove their credentials.
He was addressing the media at the Dental Awards 2018 organised to honour and recognise professionals in the dental industry at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre,
“Over 3,000 dentists have registered with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) but only 2,500 dentists are active,” he said.
Many now in the field were not real doctors but those who served as assistants to the dentists. “The real ones need to be registered with the SLMC and have to display the registration numbers.”
“Even the registered number was printed on their prescriptions to state that they are qualified doctors,” Dr. Cooray said. He said the quack dentists could also display a number to claim that they were registered with the SLMC. He added that the best way to check is to see if their names were registered at the SLMC. He added that it was very hard to pursue legal action against them.
He said he was aware of these issues after seeing a stream of patients who had gone to these dentists.
“They have come to police stations to lodge complaints against these dentists,” he said. Patients complain that they cannot go to courts and waste their time and money. Our association advises people to be aware of quacks,” he said
