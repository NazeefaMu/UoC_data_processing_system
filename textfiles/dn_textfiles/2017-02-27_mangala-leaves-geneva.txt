Mangala leaves for Geneva

Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera left for Geneva yesterday to attend the 34th regular session of UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) which will start today.
The sessions will go on until March 24.
The Minister was accompanied by several officials from the foreign ministry.
Minister Samaraweera is slated to address the UNHRC and brief the Council on the latest developments in Sri Lanka during the high level segment of the session on February 28.
Meanwhile, it is said that the UK plans to sponsor a new consensus resolution on Sri Lanka at the council sessions. The resolution is expected to give more time to implement the systems needed to be in place to take the reconciliation process forward.
