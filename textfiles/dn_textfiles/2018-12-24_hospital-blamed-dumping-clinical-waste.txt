Hospital blamed for dumping clinical waste

Clinical waste from the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital are scattered in the hospital premises, people visiting the hospital said.
They said those wastage will cause a severe health hazard and pollute the environment if the issue is not addressed fast.
The waste of the hospital is dumped improperly and animals consume many of them, while a large quantity contaminates water sources in the area, they said.
The hospital blood bank and the kitchen lie near a location where a part of the waste is dumped, they said. A high quantity of bandages with blood stains are scattered in the compound and unbearable smell permeates from them, the residents said.
The waste has been dumped for many weeks and several heaps are now covered with wax clothes because of the rain.
The company that received the contract for removing the waste has stopped their service temporarily due to a legal snag.
They will commence the service very soon once the issue is settled, Hospital Director Arjun Tilakaratna said.
She said that many of the hospitals in Sri Lanka face this issue and temporary containers are placed at many locations to put waste until they are removed.
