Lanka shines at Travel Turkey Izmir 2018 Expo

The Sri Lankan pavilion attracted large crowds with interest in both tourism and trade, when Sri Lanka showcased her unique offerings at the Travel Turkey Izmir 2018 Turkey’s oldest trade exhibition recently.
In its 12th edition, the Travel Turkey Izmir is one of the leading tourism and trade shows in the Middle East organized by the TURSAB, the Association of Turkish Travel Agencies and held under the patronage of the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
The exhibition hosted 1,284 exhibitors from 36 countries and saw a footfall of nearly 45,000 professionals and travellers from over 63 countries.
Sri Lankan Ambassador to Turkey, P.M. Amza, participated at the event which was attended by many Sri Lankan tour operators and stakeholders in the tourism and hospitality sector.
A congress was held concurrently with the travel fair which served as an ideal platform for countries like Sri Lanka to create and renew business and trade ties with Turkey.
Tourist arrivals from Turkey have increased significantly over the last few years. Tourist arrivals grew up 19% in 2017. The Colombo to Istanbul route is also serviced by daily flights by Turkish Airlines which increases connectivity and enhances destination promotion. By participating at ITI 2018, Sri Lanka was able to present unique holiday experiences to its potential travellers.
