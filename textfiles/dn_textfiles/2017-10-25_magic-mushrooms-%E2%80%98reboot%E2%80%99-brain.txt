Magic mushrooms to  ‘reboot’ the brain

A new study now reveals that magic mushrooms could one day be used to treat depression. According to scientists, they plan to conduct a study that investigates illegal drug’s ingredient, known as psilocybin, in patients with the mental health condition who have not previously responded to treatment.
If the trial is successful, the substance could be approved for treatment of depression.
The study will be conducted by the London-based start-up company Compass Pathways and will assess psilocybin in 400 depression patients who do not respond to existing treatments.
The trial will be conducted in eight European countries over three months. Digital technology will be used to determine patient response to the substance. The study's design is still subject to regulatory approval.
George Goldsmith, one of Compass Pathways' founders, said that they plan to take forward 21st century science with digital innovation and medicines now that we understand how they work, reported The Financial Times.
Experts are reportedly reassured psilocybin is safe due to the magic mushrooms' widespread recreational use.
A positive study outcome may lead to the substance's approval. The Scientist
