PM slams GL and Dayan

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he was surprised to see Prof G.L. Peiris objecting to the Resolution in Geneva and asked him to state why he was against it.
He was speaking to a group of Trade Union representatives at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday.
"Is he against the establishment of democracy, protection of sovereignty, giving media freedom or setting up a domestic mechanism? This problem was created by them. The people asked us to take over the Government, as the previous regime failed to solve it. No wonder, some extremist elements are against this move" he noted.
Commenting on the recent remarks by TNA's Northern Provincial Council member Anandi Saseetharan and former EPRLF member Dayan Jayatilleke criticizing the Resolution, the Prime Minister observed that all those elements were in the same group, and that they want to divide the country.
Hitting out at Jayatilleke, the Prime Minister stated that he(Jayatilleke) was the only Sinhala Minister in the NPC who stood by Eelam.
