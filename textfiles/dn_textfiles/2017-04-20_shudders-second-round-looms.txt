Shudders as the second round looms

The new Singer schools season has had its fair share of thrills and spills ..taking games all down to the wire and more intense rugby in the middle for a thumping 2nd round steps up next weekend.
Many questions between the schools remain ...and will probably blow their horn loudly till the sunsets on this season, with the answer to the questions still unanswered?
Will Patana be stronger to stay a contender, is Royal a realistic threat to upset the top...or is that great escape in Kandy v Dharmarajah (last min Askey drop goal) a sign of things to come? Can Joseph’s take more than courage from their win against Peter’s ...and become contenders? Thomas’, Peter’s and their backroom staff have their work cut out to pull things around and finally can Trinity hold on thru the next round, stamp consistency and change Sri schools rugby history 8 weeks from now .....
I believe in the basics ..and the work required ... teams are most vulnerable when nursing injuries and trying to get their 1st choice back on the park.
The concept of final round rugby is always a tough place to live and predict success from, especially for our resident experts and self appointed pundits?
Teams that find themselves fighting relegation have different priorities in comparison to the top 3 contenders ..one is about survival, the other all about stamping your class, skills and domination with the title in sight.
The art of management and styles already under pressure and tested to the hilt. It’s a grand pace and better oxygen for those who have lived there before?
Kandy showed us the value of sensible investments and long term business planning, specifically targetting a number of Sri Lanka rep players to bolster up their firepower.
Schools have long been marking players in smaller suburban stables for transfer once they hit their O level turbulance - some of these players are very fortunate to have the skills to upgrade and get on the online radar. I understand they get invited to play for the bigger stables plus customary incentives. Varying schools of thought on the topic ...with passionate arguments for both seats of learning.
Trinity deserve all they get , especially with the level of performance week after week ...it’s all down to the team in the middle ..under pressure, after months of planning and now half a dozen starts way from the 2017 Singer League champions.
What a fantastic place to find yourself ...the months of pre season now justified and the mind ready to hit hard and go beyond all expectations. Round 1 was kinder to Patana and Royal, a little less for Wesley, Thomas’, Peter’s and Joseph’s...who find themselves with a degree of pressure to absorb on the way.
Maximum stats and bragging rights to the Trinity Lions for skills and commitment, thru the full 80 mins all round 1 matches - their fans believe this is their year and it is theirs for the taking. The icing on that cake (with a cherry) will be winning the Bradby Shield back and the league title in the same stride...the hills would come alive should a Raikebula inspired 15 do just that over the next 2 months.
Planning needs to be at its efficient best ...with facilities and understanding for player wellness their maximum focus - injuries need to be top priority and carefully sorted as these are young gladiators just starting their careers ..some will shine and graduate for their national duty ..either way all will learn the art of team, trust pain and pride for sure ...but the best lesson of all, the mind to accept both victory and defeat, hopefully in the same stride.
I cannot emphasize more concern about the abundant use of supplements and proteins to boost muscle weight and enhance performance as part of the standard methods of match conditioning .
The fashion option to grab a jar, and more priority for that chemical powder to ingest ..than agility and rugby intel conditioning for the player to sharpen his ability and thinking under pressure.
But let’s leave this swelling concept for a dedicated expert to dissect and analyze in specific detail..its too critical to dismiss...I am positive that there are child and parental rights that must be considered here and absolutely sure that schools and management cannot insist as a player, you must eat the team supplement?
We hear all sorts of horrid stories from fellow players how they had no choice ...and the post match reaction to the chemicals that may last days ...alas the technology of progress needs proper scientific and legal proof, so it’s as simple and legal as getting a B12 shot to boost energy for a percentage better performance on the day, in the middle.
Sri Lanka Anti doping have a task to detect and deter all who knowingly aim to bend the law or use players by clouding their judgement with winners medal syndrome!
Sevens is our pressing national rugby priority for the next 5 months with the Asian series and windows of opportunity which demand high performance from management and players all round.
Our trip to the Hongkong 7s world series qualifier ..put us under the microscope a bit and really shed light on what is required of players and teams to meet the world class cut off... head on. Skipper Ranjan would need to work and think hard what muscle they need for the Asian series and how efficient we need to be at the breakdowns. Possession is the fundamental key to life in the middle ..very little scope if we are defending for a bigger percent of the 15mins and little petrol to finish once we do get decent ball.
Looking forward to better news for both men and women on our Asian quest for upper rankings ..men as no. 2...and women in the top 4 to challenge Japan, Hongkong, China, Kazakstan and Thailand for a top 4 slot. Blessings to all who wear the national shirt with pride.
Cheers islanders and pure rugby hearts ...bula bula SRI!
