Land Bank for housing facilities to low, medium income families

A cabinet approval had been given to establish a Land Bank as a part of a programme proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to provide housing facilities for low and medium income families.
A Special Task Unit will be established under the Treasury of Sri Lanka, to carry out this housing programme as a national priority. The Land Bank will be established for all lands allocated for this Special Task Unit.
The government is planning to provide 620,000 houses by 2019 for low and medium income families, under this project.
