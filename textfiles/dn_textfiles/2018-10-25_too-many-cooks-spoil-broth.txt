Too many cooks spoil the broth

There are many men and every stone is not a gem. No two men can be the same. They differ in one aspect or the other. If both are talented, they may not be equally so.
When we take up a project we need a team of workers. To avoid confusion, we divide responsibilities. Otherwise there is bound to be confusion. There should be one hand at a job.
If the boat is rowed by more than one boatman, they should have a perfect and clear understanding. Otherwise each one will do so differently and cause a mishap.
In a kitchen if more than one cook prepares the same dish, there is the possibility of the dish being spoiled, if all are allowed to have their say.
Every one’s work is no one’s responsibility. Each person does the job the way he or she likes. The result is nothing but a big chaos.
In an ancient folktale the pigeons who were caught in a net tried to let each other carry the burden of the net. The net came down to earth because of this. They all needed to fly according to a certain rhythm for them to make their escape and free themselves from the net.
In a house with too many servants or masters, there will be no order. Similarly too many cooks in the kitchen will spoil a meal. Therefore know your task and work together. Then you will be able to produce good results.
