FR filed by Kumara Welgama re-fixed for support

The fundamental rights petition filed by former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama was yesterday re-fixed for support on March 5 by the Supreme Court.
The Court was informed through the Attorney General that the FCID is conducting further investigations into the alleged financial fraud said to be taken place at the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB).
Kalutara District UPFA Parliamentarian Kumara Welgama had sought an order preventing the FCID from arresting and remanding him in connection with alleged financial fraud said to have taken place at the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), while awarding several tenders to two private companies to supply bus spare parts between 2011 and 2015.
Through this petition, Welgama sought the intervention of the Supreme Court to exercise the fundamental rights jurisdiction to prevent his imminent arrest over the magisterial inquiry at Colombo Magistrate’s Court.
In his petition, the former Minister had cited FCID Chief Inspector C.I. Ranasinghe, ASP P.K. Serasinghe, DIG Ravi Waidyalankara, police chief N.K. Ilangakoon and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner further sought an order and declaration that the collective acts of the first to fourth respondents cause an imminent infringement of his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1), 12(2), 13 (1) of the Constitution.
President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Navin Marapana appeared for the petitioner.
