Pan Asia Bank hosts “Pan Asia Intellectuals 2017”


Winners of the Avurudu Kumuri and Kumara.
Pan Asia Bank held its inter-branch and department quiz competition for the third consecutive year, named “Pan Asia Intellectuals 2017” at the Golden Rose Hotel Boralesgamuwa recently.
More than 100 teams representing branches and departments participated in this event and after an intense battle for intellectual supremacy, the Bank’s Maharagama Branch team emerged as champions while Internal Audit Department and Kollupitiya Branch teams claimed second and third places respectively.
Pan Asia Intellectuals 2017 was followed by New Year celebrations organized specially for the Bank’s staff.  
Subsequent to the quiz competition, Pan Asia Bank also held a special Avurudu celebration organized for the Bank’s staff.
This event saw the participation of approximately 700 enthusiastic staff members and was a true reflection of the bank’s commitment to sharing the spirit of the Sinhala and Hindu New Year with its valued staff members.
Both these events were organized by the Human Resources department with the intention of fostering team spirit, enhancing knowledge and celebrating unity amongst the team members and was held under the patronage of Nimal Tillekeratne, CEO of Pan Asia Bank, and the members of the corporate management.
