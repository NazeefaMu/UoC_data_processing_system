Edible fashion

Fashion isn’t just about what you cover your skin with anymore. Offering delicacies to your beloved stomach, in style and inspired by fashion is the budding trend now! The concept has existed internationally for a while now, with the Edible Fashion Awards and designers such as Ami Goodheart and Joelle Mahoney wowing audiences with their unique dresses made out of edibles, but it was spotted recently at an event held in the city where the culinary spread was inspired by various fashion accessories, and city folk seem to vouch for the fact that edible fashion is here to stay.
Food and wine enthusiast Jyoti Balani, who was hosting the event, claims, “I got this inspiration while working on an article on high teas. In a lot of upscale hotels in London, high teas are held to announce the new fashion season and all the food created is in sync with fashion. It is always a great idea to create and curate an event where all the elements are perfectly in sync with each other. According to me this trend is here to stay and I feel everyone should create food which is line with the theme of the event.” Edible lipsticks made up of white chocolates, sumptuous cakes designed in the form of shoes and mesmerising perfumes made of Cointreau mist – name it, and city-based Chef Padala Mahesh had it whipped for display!
Designer Seema Anand opines that edible fashion is the height of imagination and experimentation – the two pillars which have always been the backbone of the fashion industry. “Fine dining has always been a fashion in itself. The fact that youngsters are accessorising with edibles is the latest up and coming thing. It’s a brilliant trend but it still has a long way to experiment when it comes to the longevity of these items.”
In an attempt to attest this unique craze, fashion blogger and enthusiast Smita Roy Majumdar believes, “Edible fashion is such a rapidly spreading craze because who doesn’t like cakes and chocolates? And once you incorporate interests of the fashion fraternity, like cake resembling a showstopper wearing a red Valentino as the centre piece with makeup items beautifully decorated around, all made of edible chocolates. it’s a dream come true.” Be it a war of taste or a submission to what your taste buds crave, Bengaluru sure loves serving it in style!
