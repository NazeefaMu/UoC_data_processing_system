Whales and dolphins  grieve for their dead

Whales and dolphins have trouble letting go of their loved ones and hold 'vigils' for the deceased.
That's according to a new study that claims these majestic creatures mourn the death of their friends and family in a similar way to humans.
In the wild, they have been being spotted clinging to the lifeless bodies of their offspring for days while protecting them from predators.
Researchers from Dolphin Biology and Conservation at Oceancare in Cordenons, Italy, analysed 78 records of aquatic mammals' treatment of their dead between 1970 and 2016. More than 90 per cent of the dolphins studied were attentive to their dead, with grieving females making up three quarters of these interactions.
Seventy five per cent of the incidents were of adult females looking after their dead calf, with some of them carrying decomposing bodies for up to a week.
The behaviour often involved one or more individuals attending to the deceased.
They attempted to keep the dead creature afloat if it sank or pushed it down if it was too buoyant, even performing 'resuscitation' attempts.
Researchers spotted mothers seeming to grieve for other females in the group. They also observed this touching behaviour in one pod of whales with the corpse of a male adult who may have died after a fight. Researchers wrote in their paper, published in Zoology, that an explanation of this behaviour could be 'strong attachment resulting in a difficulty of "letting go"-possibly related to grieving'.
They said the practice of postmorten attentive behaviour (PAB) could be because individuals had failed 'to recognise or accept that an offspring or companion has died'.
PAB was documented in 20 of 88 cetacean species, of which only one was a mysticete [whale].
Researchers believe it is more common in dolphins as they have more 'excess brain mass' and higher levels of sociality than whales.
'Mysticete species had a particularly low occurrence of PAB and, perhaps more tellingly, none was reported toward calves', researchers wrote in the paper.
'The only observation of mysticete PAB was in the... group of humpback whales which an adult male that died possibly during a competitive interaction'.
Humpback whales are known to protect their calf and fight back when attacked by killer whales.
In 2016, scientists found several cases where mammals clung to the bodies of dead compatriots, and kept vigil over a dead companion. At the time, they said the most likely explanation was mourning.
'The present study helps to corroborate that adults mourning their dead young is a common and globally widespread behaviour in long-lived and highly sociable/cohesive species of mammals,' the researchers from University of Milano-Bicocca in Italy wrote in the Journal of Mammalogy. The study compiled observations from 14 events.
They found mothers often carried their dead young above the water, often flanked by friends.
In many cases, the dead offspring were decomposed, indicating they had been held for a long time.
'We found it is very common, and [there is] a worldwide distribution of this behaviour,' study co-author Melissa Reggente told National Geographic's Traci Watson.
'They are in pain and stressed. They know something is wrong.'
