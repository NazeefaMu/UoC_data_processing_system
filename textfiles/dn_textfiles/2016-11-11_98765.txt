FFSL to conduct inquiry into Sri Lanka’s poor display in Malaysia

An inquiry will be held into the poor display of the Sri Lanka Soccer team at the Asian Solidarity Soccer Tournament which is being held in Malaysia and on the steps to be taken to develop football in Sri Lanka at a meeting of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka.
All committee members of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka will attend this meeting at which decisions will be taken regarding on how to improve the standard of the Sri Lanka’s Soccer team in view of the forthcoming Asian Football Tournament according to the Media Director and Finance Committee Chairman of FFSL Ranjith Rodrigo.
In addition, reports will be called from the Manager and the captain of the Sri Lanka Soccer team and vice presidents of the FFSL Brigadier Dhammika Kariyawasam and Robert Peiris. The Football Federation of Sri Lanka is disappointed at the way the Sri Lankan Soccer team played in this tournament and are determined to build a strong team for the Asian Football Tournament in 2017.
However the coach of the Sri Lanka team Dudley Steinwall said that the Lankan soccer standard has improved slightly. He also said that the reason for Lanka’s poor display was that they lacked international exposure as they did not play sufficient international matches before this tournament. He also hoped at least two matches per month will be played by the national soccer team in the future.
He also said that we have to change our tactics to attacking and defence whereas earlier we were more concerned in defending our goal. He said that he was happy with the team’s performance in the last game against Macau. AFP
