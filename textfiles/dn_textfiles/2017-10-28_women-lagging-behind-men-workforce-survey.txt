Women lagging behind men in workforce: survey

The recent labour force participation survey carried out by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) shows that women in the rural and urban areas continue to lag behind men in the workforce.
Although women make up over 50 percent of the population and in education, many underlying issues pertaining to gender inequality in Sri Lanka have led to them not being able to increase their labour force participation.
The annual report of the survey released recently, showed that female unemployment rate remained the highest at seven percent with men doing much better at 2.9 percent. The overall unemployment rate stood at 4.4 percent in 2016.
In addition to the total unemployment rate, the highest number of 21.6 percent was reported from youths between the ages of 15 to 25.
