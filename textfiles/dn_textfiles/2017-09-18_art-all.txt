Art for all

A recent headline in the Los Angeles Review of Books (LARB) caught our attention: “Is Cultural Appropriation Ever Appropriate?” Cultural appropriation is an offshoot of post-colonial studies which holds that it is a form of oppression for members of an identifiably dominant social or ethnic group to make use of the history, personages and/or habits of another, for the purposes of literature, music, art, entertainment, fashion. In short, for culture.
Many recent objections to cultural appropriation have been about white people making use of black history and black life. The classic literary example is William Styron’s novel The Confessions of Nat Turner (1967), in which the socially privileged Southern novelist invented a narrative – and a voice: the tale was told in the first person – for the insurrectionist slave Nat Turner, who led a revolt against slaveholders in Virginia in 1831. The history of Styron’s novel, and the travails he endured as a consequence of having written it, are frequently mentioned in tandem with the fact that he was supported in his endeavour by James Baldwin. “He has begun the common history”, Baldwin said. “Ours.”
Angry fizz
Times have changed; the common history turned out not to be as common as hoped. Cultural appropriation was recently given an angry fizz of energy by the Black Lives Matter movement, and the events that led to its formation.
The article in the LARB, “Is Cultural Appropriation Ever Appropriate?” by Arthur Krystal, concerns a screenplay he wrote some years ago about Tom Molineaux, “a freed American slave who turned up in London in 1809 and quickly proved himself a boxer capable of wresting the title from the British champion”. Mr Krystal saw in the story an opportunity to range over black and white American territory, as well as Regency England. Having had no success in selling his screenplay to Hollywood, he turned it into a treatment for a television series.
It is currently making its rounds of studios, “eliciting both enthusiasm as well as regretful demurrals”, he writes. “Nothing unusual about this, but this time something new had been added to the mix. As one well-known producer put it, the fact that neither the director nor the writer is black is ‘a huge red flag’.” People in the film and television industry, he was told, “are going to be wary”. The director Lee Daniels is straightforward: “I hate white people writing for black people. It’s so offensive. So we go out and look specifically for African-American voices. Yes, it’s all about reverse racism”.
The subject is complex, but in one respect quite simple: the headline in the LARB should have read: “Is Cultural Appropriation Ever Inappropriate?” It is hard to think of a well-read, disinterested person breaking off from Anna Karenina or Heart of Darkness or A Passage to India or The Sound and the Fury or The Grass Is Singing, to pen a letter of outrage to author or publisher. If the art is good, it justifies its own creation. If bad, it predicts its own oblivion.
Eric Clapton might be guilty of cultural appropriation for having devoted a lifetime to the blues, but isn’t the world better for it? You’d have to be Lee Daniels to say no. The Rolling Stones are equally culpable. The blues, as it happens, are an amalgam of plantation life, African rhythm and British folksong.
The cultural appropriationists recently turned on a white painter who depicted the teenage lynching victim Emmett Till in his coffin. If you are tempted to sympathize, then lock up your Picasso paintings and Matisse sculptures, the ones that borrow from African art. The appropriationists will burn these, too. Many examples may be found of white biographers writing of black musicians and dancers. Baldwin himself appointed as his biographer a white American, David Leeming, who was denied access by the Baldwin Estate. Who’s appropriating whom?
Selling point
We asked Mr Krystal about the evolution of his article at the LARB. “I knew I was up against it”, he told us, “when the phrase, near the beginning, ‘I thought this particular story had a strong selling point’, worried the editors because selling point might evoke the idea of a slave auction.”
He was happy to make the change to “a decent hook”, but there were “a half-dozen other phrases that I had to excise or tone down before they would run the piece”.
Mr Krystal, who lives in New York, concludes his account sweetly: “If a black writer or a Chinese writer or an Egyptian writer wants to write about the Holocaust, which decimated my family, then may the Muse be with you”. Cultural appropriation is culture. The rest is philistinism.
It is “the year of Chatwin”, according to the publishers Vintage. In Patagonia, his first and most famous book, published in October 1977, is reissued in a fortieth-anniversary edition with a slim dossier of “archive material”.
It includes Chatwin’s three-page proposal to Jonathan Cape for a book to be called “O Patagonia”, a telegram from his agent to the effect that an American house has paid $5,000 for US rights – not bad for a first-timer in the 70s – and a letter to his Sunday Times colleague Francis Wyndham: “I have done what I threatened. I suddenly got fed up and ran away to South America”.
In a previously published introduction, Chatwin’s biographer Nicholas Shakespeare broaches questions of veracity that have pursued In Patagonia down the decades. Some of the people Chatwin encountered “were unused to scrutiny and they resented his treatment of them”, Shakespeare writes.
He “turned them into stories as tall as . . . the legendary Indians 11 feet high” who once populated Patagonia. The daughter of the British consul wrote letters to the press about his “disgraceful” book. It contained “some elements of truth”, she said. But in places it is “pure lies”.
Boom years
Shakespeare defends his author – “He was not writing a government report” – but the problem has dogged travel writers from the boom years of the 1970s and 80s to the present. The reader assumes that this is a true story; the writer sheepishly admits that it isn’t entirely.
It was to cope with this sort of objection that the term “creative nonfiction” was born. “Few guessed what he was up to”, Shakespeare says of the people Chatwin encountered on his journey. “When they read about themselves in his book, it was as though they had been blasted by the Patagonian wind.”
