Heavy rain forced an early end to the schools Under 19 cricket tournament match between St. Anthony's College, Katugastota and St. Thomas College, Matale which ended in a draw at Bernard Aluvihare Stadium, Matale yesterday.
This was a historic match of a sorts as this was the first time that these schools met at a senior cricket match perhaps in any teams sports. Thomian promotion to higher level and Antonian demotion to tower division was responsible for this.
Though conceding first innings points the Matale Thomians look major honours as they were 44 runs ahead and 9 wickets in hand when rain stopped play at 1.45 pm.
The Antonians could have found themselves in deep trouble if not for two face saving knocks by Mohamed Afler 73 (10 fours) and Suresh Jayasinghe 45 (6 fours) who together were responsible for 119 of the 167 runs scored by St. Anthony's College. Then their off spinner Kavindu Yapa Bandara took 7 for 34 in tantalising spell to restrict the Thomian. For the Matale school off spinner Dimantha Senanayake took 5 for 30.
St. Thomas College, Matale 127 all out in 45.4 overs (Pubudu Chathuranga 30, Liyanga Jayasundera 22, Kavindu Yapa Bandara 7 for 34, Pradeep Darshana 2 for 24) and 74 for one in 19 overs (Lihanga Jayasunera 34 not out, Pubudu Chathuranga 30, Kavindu Yapa Bandara 1 for 23).
St. Anthony's College 162 all out in 37 overs (Mohamed Afler 74, Suresh Jayasinghe 45, Dimantha Senanayake 5 for 30, Sashika Bandara 2 for 23).
