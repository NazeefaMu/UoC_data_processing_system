Printcare clinches ‘Sri Lanka Master Printer 2018’

Printcare Sri Lanka, a leading exporter of packaging, renowned for its innovative printing and packaging solutions, triumphed as the overall winner and ‘Sri Lanka Master Printer 2018’ at the biennial print competition conducted recently by the Sri Lanka Association of Printers to recognise excellence in print.
Consistently ranked among the top export brands serving a prestigious global clientele in FMCG, tea, confectionery, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and apparel industries, Printcare was selected the winner from over 1000 entries in 28 categories and over 60 printing companies in Sri Lanka. Printcare also received seven Gold, four Silver, and two Bronze awards, in addition to the ultimate Master Printer Award, considered an acknowledgement of the best in the country.
The bi-annual mega event dedicated to the country’s print industry includes a conference, exhibition and awards ceremony. The award ceremony marks the grand finale of the event where all members of the printing fraternity gathers to celebrate and honour the industry’s best. The Chief Guest for the gala ‘Collate 2018’ event was Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.
The entries were evaluated on criteria such as the quality of print, design, concept, finishing and innovation. The judging panel consisted of international experts from varied technical segments in the printing industry.
Commenting on receiving this honour, Krishna Ravindran, General Manager of Printcare Plc said “We are truly honoured to receive this recognition from our colleagues in the print industry, and are very fortunate to partner with an incredible set of customers who demand the best, and work with us to push the boundaries of what is possible with modern print technology.”
“In fact we were at a slight disadvantage during the awards as we were unable to enter some of our newer higher end labels and gift boxes in order maintain customer confidentiality. However, despite this we were fortunate to win,” he added.
Printcare has invested over six million euros over the past few years to upgrade its state-of-the-art plant with cutting edge equipment.
