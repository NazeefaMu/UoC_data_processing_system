One pint of kindness

As new blood flowed into their veins, Sampath Niroshan watched in amazement at the transformation in her premature twin girls. From being floppy, pale and lethargic, the babies became suffused with a rosy glow. When every day was bringing new complications, seeing them respond so immediately to blood transfusions was the most hopeful experience of their first precarious weeks.
“They were born at 28 weeks and for a while we were not certain either would survive,” says Sampath. “They needed many blood transfusions, and I remember how much better they were immediately afterwards. You could see the blood going through them. They were pink and active, in fact more alive.”
The babies arrived just as Sampath and his wife, Ganga, had settled in for a traditional family gathering with his parents in Gotatuva. When Ganga experienced cramps, she had no idea she was in labour. She described her symptoms to a midwife who summoned an ambulance.
Ganga is not alone. There are many others who needs generosity of a fellow human. Yours could be only one pint, but it still matters in saving someone’s life.
A blood donation campaign organised by Thurunu Asipath Sansadaya will be held at Chandana Vihara, Gotatuwa, on January 29 at 8.30 am. Anyone interested in donating blood is welcome to take part in the campaign.
Take part in this noble, worthy, cause and offer that large hearted generous hand to someone in need.
