Traffic signals at main junctions in Jaffna

Traffic signals will be installed at major junctions in Jaffna to minimise the rising number of road accidents. This was revealed during a programme organised by the National Council for Road Safety to raise the awareness of the people of Jaffna on the rising rate of road accidents.
National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said the major causes for road accidents in the Jaffna Peninsula were a lack of knowledge of highway rules among the people due to the 30-year-long conflict situation and lack of traffic signals to regulate vehicle movements. He said although there are 64 major junctions in the Jaffna Peninsula, only three had traffic signals.“Traffic signals should be installed at key junctions in the Peninsula to reduce road accidents.”During the programme, schoolchildren, drivers, pedestrians, motorcyclists and cyclists were made aware on road accidents and traffic signals while cyclists were instructed to install reflectors at the rear of bicycles to make them visible at nights.
