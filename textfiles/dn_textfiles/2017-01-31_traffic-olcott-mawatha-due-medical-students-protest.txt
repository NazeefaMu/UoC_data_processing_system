Traffic at Olcott Mawatha due to medical students' protest

 
Heavy traffic congestion was reported from Olcott Mawatha, Pettah and Colombo Fort, owing to a protest by medical students, a short while ago.
The demonstration is against the Court of Appeal’s decision to register South Asian Institute of Technology and Management (SAITM) Medical graduates under Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
