Abuser of female inmates in children's home arrested

The Nugegoda Magistrates Court has entrusted the National Child Protection Authority with the responsibility of ensuring the security of 18 girl inmates of a children's home who had been subjected to sexual abuse.
The Court has also ordered that this security be provided according to the provisions of Protection of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act no 4 of 2015, said National Child Protection Authority chairperson Marini de Livera in a press release yesterday.
The release said, the Authority has also launched an investigation against the Directress of this particular children's home who had issued a statement to the media about the living conditions of the children relevant to this incident. The 18 children have now been transferred to three other children's homes under the supervision of the Authority and a special programme was being implemented to bring them back to a proper mental status.
The children are reported to have been abused by the husband of the children's home Directress who had functioned as the driver of this children's home and he had been taken into custody to frame legal action against him. Marini de Livera said, any act of child abuse should be reported to the nearest police station or to the National Child Protection Authority on hotline 1929.
