Sellist organizes sale for Women Entrepreneurs

Sellist, a professionally designed networking platform designed for multi-tasking, organized a sale at Queen’s Hotel recently.
The event was organized to help the Women Entrepreneurs as Small Medium Entrepreneurs (SME) of the Central province.
It was a successful venture for Women Entrepreneurs to showcase a range of goods from food items, clothing, jewellery and much more. This also gave them avenues to gain customer base with customer and business ventures.
Sellist is a promoter of the digital economy, this is a concept where the economy is thriving through digital technologies and is mainly reliant on business transactions taking place through the internet.
These product and services are less costly than the same from traditional businesses, as customer could have directly access from the suppliers instead of the middleman.        
Users could reap the benefits of Sellist by simply registering through a quick procedure of submitting a specific username and password. With access to their user account, user are immediately transferred to an environment where multiple activities take place all at once.
Entrepreneurs who become a user of Sellist, will have the chance to project themselves through this platform while interacting with other users.
This is beneficial to those who are self-employed and are looking to promote their goods or a company that is looking for a credible marketing space.
Sellist has also created a discussion forum to bring together people and engage them in dialogues and promote social wellness. The participants can facilitate and promote topics that are ethical and interesting. Sellist also supports its users to promote social gatherings, educational forums and social meetups.
Sellist helps to play a role in supply and determine prices in a competitive market.
