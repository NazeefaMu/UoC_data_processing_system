Political parties should  reveal their stand  on election  postponement: CaFFE

The Campaign for Free and Fair Election (CaFFE) yesterday said that all political parties should divulge their stand on the postponement of elections by the government.
According to (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon, the Incumbent President can hold the office until December 9, 2019.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the Presidential Election is the only election in the country that cannot be postponed.
Nominations should be called for the next Presidential Election on December 9, 2019 according the law. He said the government is trying to postpone all elections until October 8, 2019, the day, the term of Uva Provincial Council ends, Tennakoon said.
People's Action For Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said the previous government took an advantage by holding elections part by part. The present government is postponing elections with a well formulated plan.
The Elections Commission said democracy is being heisted. Holding the Local Government election is in the hands of the Political party Leaders, he said.
Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) National Coordinator Manjula Gajanayake said the postponement of elections is one of the main signs of the destruction of democracy. The government said it postponed the Provincial Council elections to hold them within one day. It takes two days to pass the amended Act in Parliament, he said.
National Coordinator of the National Polls Observation Centre (NPOC) Rasanga Harischandra said when a government folded the elections map, the country became a pool of blood. Local Government elections of over 60 LG bodies can be held without any issue. The Prime Minister presented a Cabinet paper to postpone the PC Elections.
Shashi de Mel from Transparency International Sri Lanka said her organisation is disappointed over the postponement of PC elections by the government stating that it needs to allocate a quota for women candidates.
Public engagement is essential for such a move. If the government had a sincere wish to increase women's representation, it could have been started the process just after January 8, 2015.
Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternative (CPA) Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said elections should be held as scheduled.
The people should have the right to select their representatives through elections. The country had bad experiences when elections were postponed, he said.
