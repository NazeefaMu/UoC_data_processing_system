“I request all Sri Lankans living overseas not to be misled by false propaganda. The government is committed to ensuring freedom and democracy in the country. We have declared 2017 as the Year for Poverty Alleviation,” the President added. The President stated that Social Media and several websites are spreading false information that the government is dividing the country and the foremost place given to Buddhism would be removed from the Constitution. The President pledged to protect the country’s sovereignty and Buddhism.
President Sirisena urged Sri Lankans to be united to rebuild the country irrespective of religious and ethnic differences in the post-war period.
