Alleged assault on PCs:
Thamankaduwa PS Chairman, two others arrested

The Thamankaduwa SLFP Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Premasiri Munasinghe, and two others were arrested on Monday night over an assault on two Police Constables on duty at the Somiyel Junction in Kaduruwela.
The Police Media Spokesman’s office said the two constables attached to the Polonnaruwa Police Station, had asked the driver of the cab that was parked on the pavement, obstructing the pedestrian crossing, to move the vehicle.
However, the PS Chairman and two others who were in the vehicle had defied Police orders to move the vehicle and instead, got off the vehicle and verbally and physically attacked the two constables.
The suspects had also snatched the weapons and mobiles from the Constables. The Constables who were injured in the attack were admitted to the Polonnaruwa Hospital.
The suspects were to be produced in the Polonnaruwa Magistrate’s Court.
