Siri Gunasinha was one of the ablest Sinhala literati of Sri Lanka. He was born on February 15, 1925, at the remote village named Bulatkohupitiya in Ruwanwella. His father moved from Southern province to Ruwanwella for business activities. He got married and settled down in Ruwanwella.
The eldest son of the family was Siri Gunasinha.
Some relations of Gunasinha’s father accompanied this child to Galle. He entered the Nagabodhi College in Akmeemana for his primary education. Later, this student was lucky enough to enter the Mahinda College in Galle. While Gunasinha was studying at the college, he attended to writing short stories and poems. In addition, this pupil showed his colours on painting. Guansinha became the first at the island-wide Pali examination held during this period. The College Principal E A Wijesooriya encouraged Gunasinha for higher education.
Having gone through the University Entrance Examination, Gunasinha entered the Colombo University in 1945. He selected Sanskrit as the main subject and got ready for an Honours degree. In addition, he learned Aryan subjects such as Pali, Sinhala and Buddhist Civilisation. In that era, Professor Gunapala Malalasekara was the head of Sanskrit Department. Gunasinha followed Malalasekara’s character tremendously. This talented youth was able to obtain a first class division for his degree.
He received the scholarship which was to be conferred to the student who gained the highest marks of the Faculty of Oriental Languages. This capable student was recruited to the same university as an assistant lecturer. Within a short period, Gunasinha left for Sorbonne University in France to read for his PhD. Upon obtaining the doctorate, Gunasinha returned to Colombo University. He was later attached to Peradeniya University Sanskrit Department as a senior lecturer. In 1970, Gunasinha joined the Victoria University in Canada. Since then, Sri Lanka was deprived of his service.
Sinhala literature
Gunasinha was a novelist, revolutionary poet, literary critic, film director, painter, multilingual scholar, archaeologist and a make-up designer. He has done a great service to Sinhala literature and to other fields.
Most critics, therefore, accept Gunasinha as a great literary man who has contributed much to the progress of Sinhala literature, towards the latter half of 20th century. This article expects to consider the service rendered by Gunasinha to enrich Sinhala poetry field. In 1949, he wrote a class of poem titled “apasuwa” which was published in the magazine named Aruna. Although Gunasinha has shown his abilities on various aspects in Sinhala literature, he became popular as a poet who has given a new colour to Sinhala verse.
Actually speaking free verse system is not a new thing to Sinhala literature. Free verse system was introduced in a short story book of another famous Sinhala writer, G. B. Senanayake. In fact, Senanayake could be named as the first Sinhala writer who brought in free verse system to Sinhala literature. However, Gunasinha identified the free verse genre really and popularized it throughout the country. This poet for the first time in the history of Sinhala poetry literature composed a collection of poetry introducing the new style.
Poetic revolution
Gunasinha’s book Mas Le Neti Eta which was written in 1956 is a landmark in the history and it affected a breakthrough in the conventional system of poetry in the country. With the introduction of Mas Le Neti Eta, Gunasinha became the most controversial poet of the day. At the same time, he became the pioneer of a new direction of Sinhala poem with this book. Gunasinha created a new era in the history of modern Sinhalese poetry. Really speaking, it was a revolution in the field of poetry. Many poets afterwards began to follow him.
After Mas Le Neti Eta, Gunasinha wrote three other poetry books. In 1958, Abinikmana was published. A few years later this poet composed Ratukekula (1962). After a considerable period, Alakamandawa (1998) was published. Out of these collections, Mas Le Neti Eta is the best. It created a poetic revolution in the field of poetry. There are significant new features in his work. Many modern Sinhala poets have imitated them.
The influence of Gunasinha’s work on the successive generation and Sinhala poets is remarkable. Siri Gunasinha’s poems are beneficial to those who are interested in modern Sinhala poetry.
Gunasinha’s knowledge of Sanskrit, English and French Literature seems to have influenced his work. He gained the free verse form from French literature and subject matters from our own literature and foreign literature. As a result, foreign features, as well as local features, could be seen in his poems. Towards the end of the 19th Century, French poets like Malame, Walane, and Rimbor were very influential in French literature. They used symbolism in their creations. This symbolism influenced Gunasinha in his writings. In his all collections of poetry, western, as well as eastern influence, could be noticed.
This versatile artist passed away on May 24, 2017. His departure is a tremendous loss.
