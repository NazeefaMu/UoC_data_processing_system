‘Neglected lands in NWP brought under plough’

Neglected lands spanning 44,334 hectares have been brought under the plough once again in the NWP, said Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S. B. Nawinne in a media briefing conference held at his residence at Wariyapola, Malwana, yesterday.
Minister Nawinne said up to this moment, special projects were started in the dry zone areas of Galgamuwa, Giribawa, Ambanpola, Nikaweratiya and Palukadawala.
He said the government has allocated Rs. 2.067 million for the fertilizer subsidy and had encouraged farmers to cultivate abandoned lands in the NWP.
He added, the government has made arrangements to construct two fertilizer stores at Galgamuwa and Mahanenneriya for the convenience of farmers.
"In addition to this, we are planning to rehabilitate the Polpithigama Dagama Wewa.
It was allocated Rs. 7.1 million. This tank has been neglected for the past 20 years," he said.
The minister said, the forest department has initiated a programme to plant 'kithul' on the hill-slopes of Dogamgaslanda and Rideegama Divisional Secretary areas which have been devastated by illicit clearing and by kasippu distilleries.
Former PS chairman Upul Jayalath, PC member Manjula Bandara and Nilantha Rajapaksha also partipated this event.
