Withdrawal of family report for Cabinet consideration

A proposal to withdraw the Family Background Report which is required by women going abroad to work as housemaids has been submitted to the Cabinet, Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said.
“The number of housemaids who go abroad illegally has increased as a result of the new rule requiring a Family Background Report. This situation has badly affected the security of most of the families,” said the Deputy Minister.
According to the Deputy Minister, the Ministry plans to implement a special programme to ensure the security of the families of housemaids.
“We are always advise housemaids to register at the Foreign Employment Bureau (FEB) before leaving the country since there are several benefits for them and their families,” he said. “The FEB will never let the mother of children below five years go aboard.”
“We firmly believe that it is our responsibility to ensure the protection of children as well as the women who go abroad as housemaids,” he said.
