Fraudulent share transaction: Udaya Gammanpila, Sydney Jayasinghe indicted

 
The Colombo High Court indicted MP Udaya Gammanpila and Sydney Jayasinghe who were alleged to have misappropriated Rs. 21 million following a fraudulent share transaction that took place in 2000, a short while ago.
Two accused Udaya Gammanpila and Sydney Jayasinghe are currently out on bail.
The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila has cheated Rs. 20 million and misappropriated another Rs. 21 million along with Sydney Jayasinghe, the second accused when selling shares of Digital Nominees to a businessman called Dhammika Perera.
The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent power of attorney to sell shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shadick.
