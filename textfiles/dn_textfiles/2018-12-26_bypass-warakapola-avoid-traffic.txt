Bypass Warakapola to avoid traffic

The Police have asked the public to use alternative routes to pass the Warakapola town to avoid traffic congestion in the town.
The Police Media Unit releasing a statement yesterday reported that as a result of the December school holidays and the festive season, a large number of vehicles were moving through the Warakapola town to other areas of the island causing severe traffic congestion in the area.
