Creative wisdom of Ajahn Chah

Most teachings of the great Buddhist monk, Ajahn Chah, who lived in Thailand, are found scattered in various places. As they were delivered as Dhamma talks in Thai language, they came to be translated into English later in the form of essays of much interest. They contain quite a number of literary and prophetic insights that broaden the social and spiritual vision and insights of the reader.
I had the chance of obtaining one such source indicated as Bodhinyana, a collection of Dhamma talks translated into English and published several times. In all there are eight short talks followed by questions and answers with a glossary of Dhamma terms.
Inner wisdom
Although the great priest passed away in 1992, the training which he gave and established is still carried on by his disciples at Wat Pah Pong and its branches in several countries. The reader of the book cited as Bodhinyana gets the chance of knowing the broad perspective of such concepts and ‘letting off’, ‘self discipline via meditation’, ‘achieving an inner wisdom as versus the working knowledge via mere information’, ‘the practice of concentration training’ and ‘the uncertain and shaky nature of material prospects’.
As far as possible, the spiritual teacher gives the listener (in this case, the reader), the opportunity to think in terms of example from folk literature that is orally transmitted down the centuries in the Orient as well as the Occident. There are quite a number of creative insights.
Even some of the Abhidhamma or the higher forms of Dhamma concepts are simplified. One good example could be drawn from the talk titled as ‘Dhamma Nature’.
“We should consider that our merit and good fortune are very valuable. All we need to do is look around to see how much other creatures are possessed of ill fortune; take dogs, pigs, snakes and other creatures for instance. They have no chance to study, Dhamma, no chance to know Dhamma, no chance to practise Dhamma. These are beings possessed of ill fortune who are receiving karmic retribution. When one has no chance to study, to know, to practise Dhamma, then one has no chance to be free from suffering.”
Ill fortune
What does the great monk deliver to us the laymen? In short, as human beings we should not allow ourselves to become victims of ill fortune deprived of manners and discipline. On further analysis we tend to ask what are the manners and discipline.
The discipline of one’s body and mind culminates in the development of one’s manners. This is denoted by the term ‘Seela’ or restraint that needs perhaps guidance from those who have achieved that state. The development of god manners as Ajahn Chah states lead to a state of happiness.
The state of being happy in many ways is the only profitable way of life. The material riches may not bestow happiness. Humans have the habit of making more and more riches in order to bring about happiness. As Ajahn Chah points out in the Dhamma talk, titled as the two faces of reality, “mental objects arise in the mind. They are born out of desire; desire for valuable possessions, desire to be rich and just restless seeking after things in general. This type of greed is not allt hat deep or strong, it is not enough to make you faint – or lose control. However, when sexual desire arises, you are thrown off balance and lose your control.”
Hunter’s snare Then what happens?
“You would even forget those who raised and brought you up – your own parents!”
Ajahn shows the reader as to how the Buddha taught the objects of our senses as a trap. This is compared to a trap laid down by Mara or the death. As such, it is a death trap. The trap is something which binds us, the same as a snare. Ajahn Chah says that it’s a trap of Mara’s, a hunter’s snare, and the hunter is no other than Mara. The discussion that ensues develops into a parable. As Ajahn Chah says if animals are caught in the hunter’s trap, it is a sorrowful predicament. They are caught fast and held waiting for the owner of the trap. Then a question is raised. Have you ever snared birds? The snare springs and boop – caught by the neck. A good strong string now holds it fast whichever the bird flies it cannot escape.
It flies here and flies there, but it’s held tight waiting for the owner of the snare. When the hunter comes along, that’s it – the bird is struck with fear, and there is no escape!
In this manner, the discourse is further developed by the extension of the snare and the hunter. As pointing to the humans, there is the trap of sights, there is the trap of sounds, smells, tastes, touch and other mind objects. They catch the humans, and bind them fast. The metaphor is further developed into a fish caught on a hook. When the fisherman comes, struggle you want, but you cannot get loose.
Ajahn says that actually you are not caught like a fish, but it’s like a frog. A frog gulps down the whole hook right to its guts it caught in his mouth.
Furthermore, a person thirsting out for sensory happiness is compared to a man who is thirsty for water. The simple example is laid down creatively as follows.
Overpowering desire
“A man comes walking along a road. He is very thirsty from his journey and is craving for a drink of water. He stops at a place beside the road and asks for a drink. The owner of the water says: You can drink the water if you like, the colour is good. The smell is good. The taste is good. But if you drink, you will become ill. I must tell you before hand, it will make you sick enough to die or nearly die.”
What happens to the thirsty man? He does not pay any heed to what the owner says. He drinks the water. It is the same with a person thirsting after the senses. The death occurs to the thirsty man because of overpowering desire to drink and gets so sick that he cannot resist. These Dhamma talks of Ajahn Chah are creative, resourceful and intuitive. Perhaps a reader is inspired to observe that each talk is packed with creative wisdom in the expression as well as the contents I noted that Zen narrative plays a vital role int eh presentation of Dhamma interpretation. As such, the collection of talks is a compendium of Buddhist doctrines enveloped in a creative wisdom.
