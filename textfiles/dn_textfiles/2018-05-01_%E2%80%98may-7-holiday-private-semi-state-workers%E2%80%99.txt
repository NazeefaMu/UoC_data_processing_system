‘May 7 a holiday for private, semi-state workers’

Labour Department Commissioner General A. Wimalaweera had issued a circular informing the general public that May 7 would be a public holiday for employees of private and semi-state sectors countrywide.
May Day was postponed until May 7 due to this year’s state Vesak festival which was held on April 29 and 30 in the Kurunegala district, W. E. Jayathilake, a Kurunegala Senior Divisional Secretary said when he was contacted by the Daily News on Sunday.
