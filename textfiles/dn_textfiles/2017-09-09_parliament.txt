Sabaragamuwa PC Secretary procures incorrect facts to present in Parliament
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapa yesterday, suggested that Parliament should take action against the Secretary of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, for procuring incorrect facts to the Minister to be presented in Parliament.
He made this proposal yesterday when Kegalle District UNP MP Sandith Samarasinghe brought to the notice of Parliament that the Secretary of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council had procured some nonequivalent statements along with the Auditor General's report and forwarded it to the Minister to be presented in Parliament.
Sandith Samarasinghe stated that according to the Auditor General's report, the former Sabaragamuwa Provincial Transport Authority Chairman had deployed five buses to transport commuters without route permits and another 19 buses without log entries. He also questioned as to what measures the minister would take in this connection.
Minister Musthapa said that he did know only what the Secretary to the Provincial Council procured for him and he only could inform the matter to the Governor.
When Speaker Karu Jayasuriya observed that the Minister could at least make his (minister's) Secretary to investigate into the matter, the Minister responding positively, suggested that Parliament could take action against the Secretary to the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, if he had procured incorrect facts to the Minister to be presented to Parliament.
