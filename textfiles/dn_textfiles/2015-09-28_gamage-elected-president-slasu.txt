Captain Jayantha Gamage
Captain Jayantha Gamage of Sri Lanka Navy was elected President of the Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union (SLASU which is the controlling body of aquatic sports in Sri Lanka at the Annual General Meeting held recently.
Captain Jayantha Gamage is no stranger to swimming as he was a member of the Royal College, Colombo swimming team of 1985 which included the legendary swimmer Julian Bolling. They were the winners of several championship titles during that era.
Captain Jayantha Gamage has been in the field of swimming for nearly 30 years both as a swimmer and administrator and therefore he knows his onions.
He said that his main objective will be to bring back swimming to its pristine glory by holding more local competitions which help our performance at international competitions.
More emphasis will be laid on regular training which could bring to light the latent talent of swimmers and they could be evaluated. Among the other thing that has been envisaged is to obtain the restoration of the member status with FINA – the Controlling body for Aquatic Sports so that country could participate under the National Flag.
He also hopes to send a contingent of 75 swimmers to participate in the 8th Asian Swimming and Diving Championship to be held in Bangkok, Thailand next month. Training for this championship is under way and also for the SAF Games to be held in New Delhi, India next year.
