Former President’s spending needs investigation: Athukorala

Former President’s arbitrary behaviour of allegedly utilizing Rs. 400 million of public funds to construct a tombstone for his parents is still not investigated by the Financial Crime Investigations Division, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said. She was speaking at the memorial ceremony organised in commemoration of late President Ranasinghe Premadasa’s 93rd birth anniversary in Piyagama on Friday (23).
The Minister said that they as the present government should be responsible to pay attention to investigate into such corruptions and take legal actions immediately. Athukorala also said that late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was unlike those politicians who utilize public funds to satisfy their own personal needs and wants. Instead, he had worked to uplift the living standards of the poor.
She further said, “Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was not an engineer or a doctor.
He was not even a degree holder. But he was a great leader to create over 800,000 employment opportunities with an average salary for them between Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000.
After 25 years, today, that salary will be equivalent to at least of Rs. 100,000. He also implemented the “1,000,000 houses” project and immensely contributed to declare 1979 as the ‘Housing Year.’
United National Party (UNP) MP Ashoka Dhanawansha De Silva and Southern Province Councillor Jayasiri Nanayakkara also participated.
