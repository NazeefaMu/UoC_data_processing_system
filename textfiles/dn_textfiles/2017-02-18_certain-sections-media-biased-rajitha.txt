Certain sections of media biased: Rajitha

Certain sections of the media, including some journalists are biased and only see the negative side of things, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
They never report the positive measures taken by the Government. They never double check to see the accuracy of their facts, the Minister said.
“Some health officials think that the Health Service is their private property and that they can remain in the service for ever.But,all these people including the Health Minister will have to leave the service one day,” the minister said.
“I ordered all relevant health professionals only to use medical devices of the highest quality for patients.
“This is because I believe that only the best the people deserve the best medical attention and the high quality medical equipment, Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Ministry Auditorium yesterday, the Minister said althought the current Acting Director General of Health Services, Dr.Jayasundara Bandara was selected as the most eligible person in 2013 for the Health Services Director General post, the post went to the third most qualified person on the list. The persons who accuse SPC Managing Director Dr.Rumie Mohamed are connected to a private company which lost a Tender recently due to its corruption and malpractices.
“The company changed the name and re-registered as a new company under a new address after being involved in various misconducts in the past under the previous (different) name. The company was about to import 600 vials of the cancer drug from India. But, when inquired, there was no drug company in the said address in India and there was a flower shop at that location. All those were part of the drug mafia and now lost their huge profits made during the past,” he added.
