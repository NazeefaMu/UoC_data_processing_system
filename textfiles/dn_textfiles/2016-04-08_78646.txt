Establishment of a Buddhist Revival Fund
Sri Lanka has about 12,150 Buddhist Temples and 750 out of them maintain Pirivenas. There are about 150 Forest Hermitages island-wide as well. These temples render an invaluable service to protect the cultural heritage related to Buddhist religious traditions and to promote the knowledge of the priests as well as laymen throughout the Pirivena education. However Bikkhus face many difficulties in rendering their social services and many of the expenses are unbearable by temples. Though the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Department of Buddhist Affairs and the Ministry of Education make a substantial contribution towards the management of physical resources, it is restricted to annual budgetary allocations. The Venerable Sangha have pointed out the need to establish and maintain a Fund that could be utilized under a formal methodology, to make use of various income and donations in addition to the direct contributions made by the government. The proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena, to establish the above fund as a "Buddhist Revival Fund" and to facilitate selected Buddhist monasteries on a common policy, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
