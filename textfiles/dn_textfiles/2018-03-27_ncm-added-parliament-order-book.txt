The No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was added to the Parliament Order Book yesterday.
Issuing an Addendum to the Order Book, the NCM against the PM carrying 55 signatures has been printed to be taken up for debate on April 4.
JO MP Prasanna Ranaweera proposed the motion containing 14 allegations and many of the charges are connected to the Treasury Bonds issue.
The NCM was submitted to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on March 21.
The Party Leaders who met on next day decided to give priority to the NCM and facilitated a full-day debate from 9.30am to 9.30pm for the NCM.
