What Trump got right about foreign policy

You gotta give the man credit. Like a viral video you just can’t stop watching, President Donald Trump knows how to hold on to our attention. His administration may be losing appointees faster than a sheepdog sheds in the summer and his approval ratings may be tanking, but his train wreck of a presidency has still got us riveted to our TV screens and Twitter accounts. If only this were just a summer stand-in series and we could look forward to returning to the regular lineup in the fall.
One overlooked feature in this ongoing tragedy is that Trump isn’t wrong about everything. Some of his critics won’t admit it, but several of the themes he sounded during the 2016 campaign — such as the need to rebuild America’s deteriorating infrastructure — were correct (if far from original), and some of his foreign-policy instincts were sound even if his command of details was not. A minimally competent president could have made substantial progress on most if not all of these fronts, thereby leaving the country better off and enhancing his prospects for a second term. Sadly, “minimally competent” are not words that apply to the current resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
Many of the illegal drugs flowing into the United States come by air or sea.
Still, it is worth remembering what Trump got right and exploring how he has managed to miss so many 2-foot putts.
Relations with Russia
Trump believes a better relationship with Russia is in the U.S. interest, and he has resisted the foreign-policy establishment’s reflexive tendency to demonize Vladimir Putin. He’s not wrong here: Russia is not solely responsible for the deterioration of relations (see: NATO expansion), and Russian help would be valuable in Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, and, over the longer term, with China. Whatever his tangled personal connections with Moscow might be, Trump’s desire for a more constructive relationship with Russia is correct.
Unfortunately, he has handled this issue in the worst possible way. His stubborn refusal to release his tax records inevitably led to questions about whether there are in fact skeletons lurking there. His reluctance to denounce Russian interference in elections here and in Europe reinforces those same suspicions. Even worse, it is now clear that some of his close associates (including his son Donald Jr.; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and his first national security advisor, Michael Flynn) met with some suspicious Russian characters, yet they have been unable to tell a straight and consistent story about these dealings. Then Trump fired FBI Director James Comey for doing his job and refusing to halt the FBI investigation into these matters. Whatever the truth may be, Trump & Co. have consistently acted like people who really do have something to hide.
The upshot is that Trump can’t mend fences with Moscow now, even if he really wanted to and even if it were the right thing to do.
The upshot is that Trump can’t mend fences with Moscow now, even if he really wanted to and even if it were the right thing to do. Instead, Congress has imposed new sanctions on Russia over Trump’s opposition, plunging relations with Moscow even further into the deep freeze. Trump’s instincts on Russia were sensible, but his blunders helped betray them.
The need to reform the world trade order
One of the central themes of Trump’s campaign was his claim that bad trade deals had allowed countries like China to “steal American jobs.” Trump also railed against other states that run persistent trade surpluses with the United States (such as Germany and South Korea) and seems to think these imbalances are due to clever skullduggery on their part rather than to broader macroeconomic behavior (such as America’s chronically low savings rate).
Details aside, Trump’s core belief that existing trade arrangements need work is correct. China isn’t manipulating its currency anymore, but it does engage in widespread industrial espionage, and its aggressive efforts to obtain advanced technology from U.S. companies have led the Trump administration to launch a Section 301 investigation of these practices. Similarly, while Trump is wrong to see the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, as a net loss for the United States, it is nearly 25 years old and badly needs updating.
In short, Trump was not wrong in saying some aspects of U.S. trade policy and some features of the international trade regime needed to be improved. The problem is that he had no good ideas for fixing what was broken, and he has repeatedly acted in ways that undercut U.S. leverage and complicated efforts at reform.
He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his third day in office, even though it would have helped American businesses by creating a more level playing field in Asia. Instead of playing hardball with the Chinese on trade issues during his first six months in office, he held off in the naive hope that he could sweet-talk them into cracking down on North Korea. So much for the “art of the deal.”
