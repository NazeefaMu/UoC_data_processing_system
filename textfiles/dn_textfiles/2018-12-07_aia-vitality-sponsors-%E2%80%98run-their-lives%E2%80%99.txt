AIA Vitality sponsors ‘Run for Their Lives’

AIA Insurance’s health and wellness app, AIA Vitality is happy to be the Gold Sponsor for this year’s ‘Run for Their Lives’ (RFTL), making it the second consecutive year of this partnership. RFTL which is an annual charity run to create awareness on and raise funds for Cancer, organized by the Rotaract Club, is aptly aligned with AIA’s brand promise of helping people live healthier, longer, better lives.
For AIA, creating awareness on Non- Communicable Diseases such as Cancer, which is a huge issue in Sri Lanka, is important. With today’s advances in science and medical technology, many types of cancers are detectable and curable. That is why AIA encourages Sri Lankans to support those impacted by Cancer and share their good wishes through AIA’s facebook campaign; Voice of Hope.
AIA invites you to join the RFTL event on Sunday, 09th Dec (8.30am- Racecourse Grounds, Colombo) and show solidarity to this worthy cause. Don’t forget to visit the AIA Zone to win exciting prizes and take part in the AIA plank challenge, try out the Vitality Juiceter and snap at the Vitality photo booth.
