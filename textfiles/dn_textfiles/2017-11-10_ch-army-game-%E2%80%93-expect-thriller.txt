CH-Army game  – expect a thriller

The confrontation between two top rugby clubs CH and FC and Army SC in the Dialog ‘A’ division inter-club league rugby first round match for the 2017/18 season at Racecourse grounds, Reid Avenue today should turn out to be a thriller. The match will kick off at 3.45 pm.
CH and FC who has been really down and out some seasons ago came back to their normal pattern of play in their last match against Kandy under the coaching of dedicated and hard working former national coach Thavita Thulagaese “Laga”.
The CH side has been training hard under their new captain Rohitha “Chichi” Rajapaksa last few weeks and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win.
Army on the other hand started training two to three months back under the watchful eyes of their coach Nilfer Ibrahim who was also the national sevens head coach some time back.
Army will have to be at their very best if they are to beat the rejuvenated CH team in their home grounds at Racecourse.
Going by the two team’s starting line-ups a close tussle for supremacy can be expected.
The forte of CH & FC has been their power-packed forwards. The CH ‘eight’ especially their ever green flankers Yoshitha Rajapaksa and Sasanka Ariyaratne, along with Sathya Ranatunga, Terence Henry and Sajith Saranga have always given a terrific display in the loose but today they will be given a torrid time by the Army forwards spearheaded by burly Asoka Jayalal, Abeynayake, last year’s skipper Manoj Silva, Chameera Silva ably supported by Rosa.
In the set scrums CH hooker Kavinda Amarakoon should get the better of his vis-a-vis Sameera Wickramanayaka while the line outs should be shared between the CH duo of Saranga and Matheesha Sarathchandra and Army’s Maduranga and Rosa.
With the halves combination of Avishka Lee and Shamry Burah having clicked very well in the last match the CH side will hope that Avishka will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in Lee Keegal and Chula Susantha.
In addition they have two experienced wingers in Anuradha Herath and Heshan Maduranga who have stood out with their powerful runs down the flank with full back Samuel Maduwantha often joining the line to form the overlap.
