Jayalalithaa, Karunanidhi behaviour shows UNHRC session favourable to SL - Mahinda

Skill Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said when considering the behaviour of Jayalalithaa and former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, it is clear that the outcome of the United Nation Human Right Council (UNHRC) session is favourable for the country.
The minister said so after calling on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapter Maha Nayake Theras yesterday.
"The two Indian politicians have told the media that the UNHRC report cannot be accepted since it is totally favourable to Sri Lanka.
Malwatte Maha Nayake Thera Most Venerable Tibbotuwawa Sri Sumangala Thera highlighted that certain local politicians say that the UNHRC is not favourbale to the country even though Indian politicians strongly opposed it.
The minister said while certain Tamil extremists claim that the report is favourbale to the country, certain Sinhala extremists claim that it is not so and it is a threat to the country.
