Reserve Jan 22 to combat dengue

Colombo Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith yesterday appealed to all priests in the Colombo Archdiocese to dedicate January 22 for combating the spread of dengue.
The Archbishop made a very special appeal to all priests in the Archdiocese to spend time on January 22 as a special day of prayer and activity to help curb the spread of dengue among the people.
Following is the full text of the Archbishop’s appeal: “Given the number of increasing casualties and the people affected by dengue, I am making a very special appeal to all my priests in the Archdiocese of Colombo to please spend time on Sunday, January 22, as a special day of prayer and activity to help curb the spread of this disease among our people.
I would very much encourage them to organise voluntary cleaning programmes in their churches, schools and institute premises and the surroundings as well as the areas within and outside homes, removing all factors that may contribute to the breeding of dengue carrying mosquitoes.
I appeal very specially to the youth to spearhead this programme in the neighbourhoods and surroundings on that particular day.
I myself will be taking part in this campaign personally at St. Lucia’s Cathedral, Kotahena on the same day.
It would be also significant if the priests could speak to the leaders of the other faiths and get them to join in this campaign.”
