President proposes stable legal order to prevent drug trafficking by sea

 
President Maithripala Sirisena today urged members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) to adopt a comprehensive framework to prevent the trafficking of illicit drugs by sea.
The President, in his address to the IORA Leaders Summit said it was necessary to examine the dangers setting off from the sea such as piracy and terrorism.
The President observed that the trafficking of illicit drugs by sea has become an industry of sorts.
"Although various counter-trafficking measures have been implemented, there is no satisfactory end result," the Sri Lankan President said.
"It is universally recognised that all littoral states possess a maritime area bordering their coasts within which they exercise complete authority. However, beyond this limit comprise high seas and are not subject to the jurisdiction of any state. Most of the illicit drugs are smuggled into the country from the sea beyond the territorial waters," President Sirisena added.
"I suggest the IORA work out a stable legal order to confront these concerns in conformity with the principles of the freedom of navigation."
The President said it was in this context that the IORA Concord and the Action Plan was signed by member nations, strengthening the organisation's role as an active forum for dialogue.
He also said the national unity government had undertaken measures strengthen to Sri Lanka's position in the Indian Ocean region. The President revealed Sri Lanka's ambitious plans to enter the global value chain by becoming a regional hub for trade, tourism, transport and logistics.
The President stressed that it was necessary for IORA to initiate a dialogue between SAARC and ASEAN leaders.
"As our current Chair, Indonesia is also a member of the ASEAN and it may be useful to consider a initiating a dialogue linking IORA member states, its dialogue partners and all the interested major and middle powers."
The President, in his speech,  welcomed Indonesia's commitment in bringing together all member nations of the IORA and its dialogue partners.
The Sri Lankan President was greeted by his Indonesian Joko Widodo upon his arrival at the Jakarta Convention Centre (JCC) to attend the IORA Leaders' Summit.
