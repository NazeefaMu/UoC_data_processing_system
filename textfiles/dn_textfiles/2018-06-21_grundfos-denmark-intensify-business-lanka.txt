Grundfos Denmark to intensify business in Lanka

Singapore. ---- Grundfos, the world’s largest pump manufacturer based in Denmark plans to intensify its business in Sri Lanka, taking the advantage of the island’s growing construction, tourism and apparel industries.

The company already has a representative office with eight employees, at the World Trade Centre in Colombo.
A senior official of the company said the Sri Lankan economy is projected to grow over the next few years and that can create more opportunities for a company like Grundfos – which manufactures pumps for domestic, industrial and agricultural segments to expand business in the country.
“We are an innovative manufacturer which is following manufacturing concepts in the line of ‘intelligence’ with the advent of new technologies such as artificial intelligence. We are concentrating on intelligent pumps and systems which are energy efficient,” Grundfos Asia Pacific Regional Director, Business and Product Portfolio-Water Utility, Tan Chee Meng said.
These products can be controlled and monitored to optimize their use. Speaking to a group of Asian journalists visiting Grundfos assembly facility in Singapore, Meng said, some of the key development projects in Singapore including Sentosa Integrated Resort, Marina Integrated Resort, Wings of Time project, Marina Bay Financial Centre, Orchard Central, The ION Orchard and Changi Airport Terminal 3 were completed with Grundfos pump solutions.

In Sri Lanka Grundfos has also worked with the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) and supported its capacity building projects. “We are looking at projects under Megapolis and Colombo Flood Control projects and discussions in this regard are underway. Besides we are also looking for utility partners in Sri Lanka,” he added.
