Geriatric Care Nurses to get training in Germany

Foreign Employment Ministry Secretary G.S. Withanage and the 2017-2018 GFMD German Co-Chairmanship Ambassador Dr. Götz Schmidt-Bremme, signed a Joint Declaration of Intent on principles of fair recruitment of personnel for training as geriatric nurses in Germany.
The signing ceremony took place at the German Federal Foreign Ministry in Berlin, during Secretary Withange’s visit to Berlin, leading the Sri Lanka government delegation to the 10th meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD) hosted by the German government.
Ambassador Schmidt-Bremme, expressing his satisfaction that the agreement could be concluded following a brief consultation, said, it was a sign of enhanced cooperation for the future.
Thanking the Government of Germany for providing the opportunity for the Sri Lankan health sector's professionals to work and live in Germany through this programme, Withanage said, it will be a win-win situation for both countries and will be a path to further strengthen the relations between the two countries.
The Agreement envisages training to commence in Sri Lanka from 2018 and the trainees will be provided with a comprehensive German language training (B2 level) and the professional training in the geriatric care on par with the requisite standards in Germany with the assurance of working and integrating in Germany.
The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Berlin and the Permanent Mission in Geneva coordinated with the Foreign Employment Ministry in getting this agreement off the ground from an initial stalemate due to the pressing priorities faced by Germany due to the European migration crisis.
Sri Lankan Ambassador to Berlin Karunatilake Amunugama, the Sri Lankan Deputy Permanent Representative to UN in Geneva Samantha Jaysuriya, Sri Lankan Foreign Employment Bureau General Manager Devseth Fernando, Additional General Manager (International Affairs) W.M. Wansekera, and the Third Secretary of the Sri Lanka Embassy in Berlin Gamini Wijayarathna joined the event.
Senior officials of the Federal Foreign Office joined Immigration Law and Migration Policy Officer Sebastian Damm, Migration Issues, Global Forum on Migration and Development Senior Policy Advisor Katharina Bosch and South Asian Division First Counsellor Dr. Gerhard Almer were present.
