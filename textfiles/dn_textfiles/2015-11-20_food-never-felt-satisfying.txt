Food never felt this satisfying

Like I always said when travelling, if the company is good then you know the journey is going to be an epic one too. So getting on a bus on a random Friday and that too happened to be those 5-seater ones where you are just crammed in. Word of advice: do not take those buses if you have extra luggage and if you want to sit somewhere where you just got to keep on getting up and suck your stomach in, put your luggage above your head when people want to get in and get out.
This random getaway took me to Shinagawa Beach Resort located in Balapitiya. With the weather being topsy turvy I didn’t expect it to be all sunny side up over there. But I think the weather god took a shine to us because she did give us a very beautiful weather to enjoy the weekend in a true Sun-Sea-Sand manner.
You can get off at the Balapitiya town and it’s just a 10 min taxi ride from there to the hotel. We checked in and were immediately shown to our rooms. Every room has the view of the beautiful Indian Ocean and my first reaction as I went to the balcony to take pictures (and upload to instagram) was that it reminded of the beautiful location in Bali Island that I remember seen in Rogers & Hammerstein’s South Pacific.
As we were hungry and basically didn’t have breakfast we straight off freshened up and went to the restaurant. Salt Restaurant allows guests to dine in or outside by the poolside and looking over the ocean. I must add that the dining was the BEST part of my trip. You usually tend to get lost in the beauty of the property, room or just the surrounding. But in this particular trip the food really took me away.
There were only a few guests on the day I went so the property felt almost like yours alone. So the dining also becomes exclusive where you get to choose from their day to day to a-la-carte menu. I love my Sri Lankan rice and curry so I opted for that while my friend decided to have the Pasta. From the entrée to soup to salads to the bread and their day’s specialty butter – it was exquisite. We ended up eating the bread and butter more than the others and since we are both foodies – we quite didn’t expect what the weekend was about to unfold to us – food wise :).
The always smiling and very attentive staff explained to us that on the days they have few guests they serve the a-la-carte menu and on the days they hotel is happening or have guests who bring their staff for the weekend, then they opt for buffet so that hungry guests are not kept waiting for too long for their food. And they keep changing the menu every season so you’re always having a taste of something new, unique and fresh. They have already changed the menu for the coming season so if you are making your way over there – you are in for a surprise.
As they had a few more guests arriving in the night, the culinary team organized a BBQ with everything you needed from meat to seafood. Since I had a heavy lunch I went slow on my dinner and it was a good thing too. When we went in for breakfast we got the a-la-carte menu again and it was a page full of things to eat. And yes, I did try out everything on the menu – and I do advice you’ll as well to have a light dinner and really try out everything at breakfast. From toast to cereal to waffles to pancakes and fruits and so much more – how can you resist it?
They are totally different from the other hotel menus. It’s no wonder, when the Resident Manager started off as a bartender in his beginning days. “Our beverage menu has a lot of creations. And all the recipes given to make them are all my recipes - from the milkshakes to cocktails and even to the selection of the wines.
We have a very premium selection of wine as we are particular about the premium quality of things and we make sure to keep maintaining them. This is why people like this property so much and is very much known on TripAdvisor”, Susantha Bernard added.
Everything that is served to the guests is homemade from chocolates to cashew nuts, even the bread is made in house along with the ice cream. One can truly feel the difference in taste when they take a bite of these delicacies.
The a-la-carte menu will include more local dishes especially with seafood dishes as Balapitiya is famous for their seafood collection. Their fish supplier stays very close to the property so everything is bought from fresh from him and nothing is kept in the deep freezers for long. They were awarded 7 medals as well from the Chef Guild’s Culinary Awards 2015 – 2 Silver, 4 Bronze and a Gold.

Susantha who has been with the property from its inception has seen the improvement and popularity of the hotel taking place day by day. All 24 Deluxe rooms and the two Suites give you that spectacular beach view and of course is the perfect location to catch the sunset. And since you can basically dine in your room or the balcony, sometimes you wish to never leave the room.
But if you do decide to leave the room then there are plenty of stuff to do. You can lounge by the pool or the beach. Or you can unwind at their Spa which gives all the treatments from ancient healing to aromatherapy sure to give you that relaxed weekend. If you like to venture out of the hotel then you can try out their Water sports, river safari on the Madhu Ganga, check out the Turtle hatchery in Kosgoda, go get some souvenirs from traditional mask workshops and museums in Ambalangoda, go deep to a moonstone mine, visit the Kande Vihara ancient temple and even Whale watching in Mirissa.

And with Christmas and New Year around the corner the hotel has come with a few plans. Christmas will be all about an action buffet while for 31 they will go on the lines of seafood. They are hoping to get a boat and spread the seafood for people to pick and choose and get it done by their talented chefs. Tables will be set out in the grass. And at midnight they will have the fireworks as well as give each guest a wishing lantern to send off into the sky.

Sometimes, the random getaways are the best trips you can have. And since Balapitiya is not far from Colombo, you really don’t feel far away from home.
