Battle of the Golds : Mishen excels for Sebs

Prince of Wales College drew with St. Sebastian's College in their annual 67th Big Match the Battle of the Golds worked off at De Soysa Stadium Moratuwa and with this result now the series tally stands at Cambrians five wins Sebs three and 58 drawn.
Anyhow Cambrians were able to get a slender first innings lead of nine runs in this encounter. In reply to the Cambrian total of 230 runs on day one Sebs scored 221 runs with their skipper and Sri Lanka Under 19 Cap Mishen Silva scoring a breezy knock of 77 runs, which consisted of eight hits to the ropes and four over and he was associated in a valuable partnership of 87 runs for the sixth wicket with Tharusha Fernando who scored 40 runs.
Earlier v ice captain Nimesh Bandara had a patient knock of 43 runs and Kaumal Nanayakkara was the pick of the bowlers for Cambrians with a good spell of 5 for 46 while Tharuka Fernando too claimed 3 for 50 who was responsible for the early breakthrough. Cambrian captain Vishva Chaturanga the Sri Lanka Under 19 team’s glove man set a record for Cambrians with six victims behind the stumps in a single innings and perhaps it may be a record for both schools in this big match series.
When rain intervened the game came to a halt and Cambrians were 41 for 1 with Vishva Chaturanga unbeaten on 26 runs.
