SLC sows the seeds to win next World Cup

Sri Lanka Cricket is certainly on a mission. That mission is totally focused on winning the 2009 Cricket World Cup in England. The last few weeks has seen SLC spearheaded by its energetic president Thilanga Sumathipala making their intentions clear in no uncertain manner.
The decision to invite former Pakistan captain legendary left-arm fast bowler Wasim Akram to help weed out potential fast bowlers was one such move. Although the visit was brief Akram who was the chief guest at the Dialog Cricket Awards spent a day with the Lankan squad of fast bowlers and what he saw impressed him.
After spending several hours with the national team’s main established strike bowlers and promising youngsters, Akram said there was no lack of raw pace, but they needed to develop their ability to swing the ball.
“Most of the bowlers had a pace of 130 to 140 kmph,” said Akram, who himself bowled at a similar pace in his prime in the 1990s. “The idea is to teach them how to believe in themselves and how to fox out the batsmen.”
According to the SLC chief, Akram was invited to mentor local players in the next two years and visit the country at least twice a year.
“We have invited him to be with us in the next two years as our consultant in pace bowling,” said Sumathipala.
Two Sri Lankan legends Aravinda de Silva and Chaminda Vaas who played against the Pakistan swing king have already been designated roles by SLC towards building up a team to win the World Cup.
De Silva, one of the greatest batsmen produced by the country heads the SLC Cricket Committee where important decisions pertaining to the national team is taken and Vaas, a former left-arm seamer and Sri Lanka’s leading fast bowler was recently tasked with identifying fast bowling talent across the country.
In a recent development, former Test captain and solid middle-order batsman Hashan Tillakaratne and former all-rounder Upul Chandana who was an outstanding fielder during his playing days were drafted into the SLC’s Skill Development Program which is run under the supervision of High Performance Manager Simon Willis, the former Kent coach.
Willis was of the opinion that Sri Lanka has a lot of talented youngsters and this development program has identified 20 fast bowlers to be trained under a long term plan. “Our plan is to have a back up to be used as the requirement of the national side,” said Willis.
De Silva who is playing a pivotal role in this operation said on the recruitment of Tillakaratne and Chandana, that SLC has launched a long term program to develop cricket and the two former cricketers have joined to educate and share their vast knowledge with young cricketers.
De Silva said that he intends roping in former greats like Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Asanka Gurusinha and Muthiah Muralitharan in the future.
De Silva has been responsible for SLC recruiting former South African wicket-keeper Nic Pothas as the national fielding coach in July to improve the national team’s fielding standards which had dipped over the years to lower levels.
Commenting on that appointment Sumathipala said, “It is the focus of my administration to build Sri Lanka’s next world champion team. We will deploy the necessary resources and invest in the infrastructure to make this happen.
“We always believe in engaging the best professional advice and technical support for our national team, and this appointment is one such positive step. Our last few outings are showing a marked improvement in the batting and bowling both, however our fielding has been letting us down and Pothas joining the support team already in place will give the necessary boost to this important area.”
With Sri Lanka Cricket going out hammer and tongs by recruiting the best possible support staff to enable the national team to bring back the World Cup which they last won 20 years ago, it is the duty of the national cricketers to make maximum use of the facilities that are being provided to them by the controlling body to raise their performances to a level that should see them achieve their ultimate goal.
SLC have already acquired the services of De Silva, Vaas, Tillakaratne and Chandana – all four of whom were members of Sri Lanka’s 1996 World Cup winning squad. With more to follow SLC are not leaving any stone unturned towards achieving their goal.
The World Cup is another 30 months away but SLC has already started to sow the seeds that could make winning the most prized possession in cricket a reality.
