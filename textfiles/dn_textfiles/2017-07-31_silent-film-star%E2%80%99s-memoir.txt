Silent Film Star’s memoir

Once a famous beauty, by the late 1950s Dagmar Godowsky found herself subsisting on caviar, cake, and tales of the past. Typecast as a vamp in the silent-screen era of the early 1920s, she had “hissed her way through a thousand scenes.” She had died by blade, bullet, poison, or strangulation. Yet the demise of silent cinema ended her own film career. Now she performed at the dinner tables of New York’s beau monde. Dagmar Godowsky knew how to busy herself. She always had.
Born in 1897 as the daughter of the pianist and composer Leopold Godowsky—known better for his paraphrases of Liszt’s or Schubert’s pieces than his own—Dagmar grew up in Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Los Angeles, and New York. Wherever they made their home, her father—a near-maniacal host—collected celebrities. On an ordinary day, Dagmar claimed, she might return home from school to encounter “Jakob Wassermann, Gerhart Hauptmann, Hermann Sudermann. Thomas Mann. Every Mann.” She inherited, not only her father’s seductive charm—her conquests numbered, if not “every man,” plenty of men and women, too—but his wit and skill as a raconteur.
Remarkable error
It was her storytelling that lured Sandford Dody. A struggling playwright, Dody became witness to Dagmar’s spiel one night at a party. In a remarkable error of judgment that launched an entire, regrettable career, Dody offered to ghostwrite Dagmar’s autobiography—an endeavor that, he was sure, would be both profitable and easy. It was neither.
Published as First Person Plural in 1958, the memoir takes us from the present day into her childhood, and then back, replete with cameos from the Fitzgeralds, Dorothy Parker, Adolf Hitler, Emperor Franz Josef, and just about all of golden-era Hollywood. Yet even those chapters devoted entirely to her time as an actress, her codependent relationship with her father or her dalliances with Charlie Chaplin, Arthur Rubinstein, and Igor Stravinsky pale in comparison to the madness of the first, which takes us right into the mayhem that is the life of the aging Dagmar Godowsky.
The phones are ringing; the miserable old dog bites the handyman; her dress fitter comes in, leaving her “draped in yards of fabric from India, looking like the Taj Mahal camouflaged for an air raid.“ She flutters and stumbles about, dropping names and food all over the place while making dinner appointments and musing on her former glory, her past lovers, and her long-lost figure:
It is my tragedy that the years have deprived me of my bad reputation. At one time, my notoriety assured me of a marvelous evening. Now—Euclid would be fascinated to know—my circle has been squared.
I love life anyway. I enjoy it even when I’m unhappy. I have a million friends from years ago but it is difficult to compete with their grandchildren—and so I see less of them. Of course, there are always admirers and parties and theater.
The phones don’t stop ringing all day. I just loathe them. I have three.
One for incoming, one for outgoing, and one for my bedside. I wouldn’t have a moment’s rest if I didn’t have a telephone near my bed. Now I can hold court, read Dostoyevsky and eat sturgeon sandwiches while I watch terrible old movies on television. I am devoted to terrible old movies, and sit like the Empress Carlota in catatonic awe of them. Why shouldn’t I like terrible old movies? Some night I might materialize in one of the monstrosities I made in those dear dead days when I was a vampire, dedicated to the destruction of all men. Now things are different.- Paris Review
