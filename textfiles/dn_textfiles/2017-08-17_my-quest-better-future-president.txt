In my quest for a better future: President

Slander and defamation are not issues:
President Maithripala Sirisena said baseless slander and defamation are not issues for him during his journey towards making a better future for the country and the people. He was speaking at a religious ceremony to unveil the marble Buddha statue at the Sri Dharma Vijayaloka Maha Viharaya in Pannipitiya on Tuesday. The Buddha statue has been brought from Myanmar to Sri Dharma Vijayaloka Maha Viharaya.
“Even the Buddha was insulted during that time. There is no wonder that I also face insults and slander in this society, which is deteriorating due to commercialization,” he said.
The President recalled that Mahathma Gandhi who was leading the struggle for freedom in neighbouring Maha Bharatha as well as Srimath S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, a pioneer political leader in this country, were also insulted.
He pointed out that today, modern technology is used for disgracing people rather than using it for gaining knowledge, social development or building a better society. He said the young generation should be spiritually developed in order to save them from this harmful social condition.
The President, who laid a floral tribute to the Buddha statue, opened it for worship of the people.
Chief Incumbent of the Vipassana Meditation Centre in Yangon, Myanmar Ven. Badantha Saddhamakiththisara Thera presented a souvenir to the President at this occasion.
President Sirisena looked into the wellbeing of the Maha Nayaka of the Kotte Chapter of Shyamopali Maha Nikaya Ven. Rukmale Sri Dharmavijayaloka Thera and Maha Viharadhipati Most Ven. Dr. Iththepane Dhammalankara Thero. Maha Nayaka of the Ramagna Maha Nikaya Most Ven. Napane Premasiri Thera, Anu Nayaka of the Malwathu Chapter Ven. Dimbulkumbure Vimaladhamma Thero, Ven.
