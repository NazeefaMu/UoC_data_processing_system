Over 2,000 complaints on election law violations

The Sri Lanka Police Headquarters has presently received around 2,054 complaints over violations of election laws related to the forthcoming LG polls – 2018.
Accordingly, about 25 candidates and 238 suspects, who had violated election laws, have presently been arrested countrywide by Police, said Kurunegala District Senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake, speaking at a meeting of Grama Niladharies of the Kurunegala district held at Bingiriya, Kurunegala, yesterday.
The marking of postal votes was initiated yesterday, and public servants attached to District Secretariats and Police Stations, countrywide, were to cast their postal votes yesterday. Other government servants who are to be engaged in election duties, could cast their votes between January 25 and 26.
