Akila Dananjaya leaves for Brisbane for Bowling Action Assessment:
Lanka include uncapped off-spinner Nishan Peiris for Third Test

Sri Lanka included 21-year-old uncapped off-spinner Nishan Peiris in their Test squad for the third and final cricket Test against England beginning at the SSC grounds on Friday.
Peiris replaces Akila Dananjaya who was due to leave for Brisbane last night to have his bowling action assessed after it was reported at the end of the first Test at Galle.
Dananjaya had 14 days to have it tested which allowed him to play in the second Test against England at Pallekele where he recorded career best figures of six wickets for 115 runs.
His Bowling Action Assessment test will take place at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane on November 23 which prevents him from playing in the third and final Test at the SSC. Pieiris who has been added to the 16-member squad will join experienced spinners Dilruwan Perera. Malinda Pushpakumara and Lakshan Sandakan.
A product of St Peter’s College Negombo, Peiris who has 38 wickets (avg. 29.52) from 12 first-class matches played three warm-up matches against the touring England team representing the Sri Lanka Board XI in a one-day limited-over match and two two-day fixtures.
He took three wickets for 108 off 26 overs in the first 2-day warm-up at the NCC claiming the wickets of Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali. He has also represented Sri Lanka under 19 and Sri Lanka ‘A’ in the past.
