British Tamil activist arrested by UK police

A British Tamil activist has been arrested and detained by UK police after protesting the visit of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in Oxford, on Monday night.
Sockalingam Yogalingam also known as Yogi, a member of the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE), was arrested last night by Thames Valley Police, along with at least three other protesters.
The activist’s home in London was searched, while he was detained, by seven officers of the South East Counter Terrorism Unit (SECTU).
The search notice stated that Yogalingam had been arrested for “belonging to a proscribed organisation.”
Officers seized two phones, bank statements, a USB stick and TGTE leaflets.
Yogalingam has since been released from police detention.
