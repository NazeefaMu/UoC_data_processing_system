Herbal healing!

Kola Kanda is a nutritious homemade potion with remarkable healing properties. Garden Talk speaks to District Agriculture Instructor, Office of the Deputy Provincial Agriculture Director, Ratmalana, Thanuja Jeewandara on this healthy concoction which is easily brewed for daily consumption.
“For a healthy lifestyle, mental and physical fitness is important. But this is not only limited to the food we consume. We need clean air, clean water and nutrients. We get these nutrients through food. With the lifestyles of today’s society we must not be too concerned about its prices or availability. We must choose food that is high in nutritional value – protein and vitamins. For this we can use a home garden.
We can grow vegetables and fruits right here in our home gardens. If we grow vegetables and fruits in our home gardens it will be free from poisonous chemicals and it will be fresh. For the daily consumption a woman needs 1500 – 2000 calories. For a man it is slightly more. This can be done by growing fruits and vegetables in the home garden. Kola Kanda can be made using these home grown plants,” said Jeewandara.
