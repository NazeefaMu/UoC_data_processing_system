Where Tigers roam

In her newest research work on Tiger mechanism across the world, Priyanka Kurugala attempts to present a sharp analysis on the people of Sri Lanka who had faced the LTTE terrorism that destroyed the heritage of the country whilst grabbing rights of the majority leading to declined human ties. She tries to bring out something about the Buddhist struggle on rebuilding their grossly vandalized heritage beyond the period highlighted by LTTE terrorist activity.
Unpalatable bitter truth would naturally lead to hyper criticism and is expected to be controversial in the present day. Nobody generally raised their voice against Buddhists and their heritage in Sri Lanka, but on the other hand, she talks about the victimized Hindus in Sri Lanka who have undergone a struggle of their own to protect tangible and intangible cultural values amid turbulence. Influences on mainstream Catholics, Christians, Muslims and other ethnoreligious minorities practicing their cultures have also been discussed.
To surface this message, Priyanka Kurugala was able to use her exposure in the local and foreign stages and knowledge that she had accumulated through books, newspapers and internet. It has been Sri Lankan Tamils such as Thramalingam Logeswaran whom she met in Europe, who still prefer living in the sovereign unitary island that paved the way to the development of this product.
Migrations of Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus have not only led to transforming the local culture, it has also influenced the European culture, not forgetting the political landscape.
The author has brought in thoughts of political leaders, leaderships of organizations, scholars and politicians who contributed to prevent every episode of the country’s tri-decade of terror. This book is an investigative piece of literature that is a genuine attempt to reflect each event of relevance, experience and dialogue leading to separatism and surrounding gloomy realities.
