Ratmalana Audiology Centre celebrates 10 years of excellence

The Ratmalana Audiology Centre, which was gifted to the nation by Dialog Axiata Plc in May 2007, has provided affordable hearing and speech therapy over the past decade to over 60,000 children and adults, celebrated its tenth year anniversary as a Centre of Excellence in Hearing and Speech.  
The Ratmalana Audiology Centre (RAC) was initiated as collaboration between Dialog Axiata PLC and the Ratmalana School for the Deaf with the shared goal of creating a Centre of Excellence in hearing and speech therapy empowering, integrating and rehabilitating people of all ages with hearing and speech difficulties.
The partnership laid the foundation in developing a vibrant, professional client-focused Centre with a caring environment serving the wider community.
The Centre provides free annual hearing tests and speech therapy services for the students of the Ratmalana School for the Deaf. The Centre also provides free workshops for parents, teachers and matrons of the School for the Deaf and provides assistance to other schools for the deaf around the country. As a Centre of Excellence the RAC also provides placements for the Clinical Training Programme for Audiology offered at the University of Kelaniya. 
The RAC provides free neonatal screening tests for newborns at Government hospitals in its vicinity; mainly the Colombo South Teaching Hospital and Kethumathi Maternity Hospital in Panadura.
Hearing tests can be obtained free of charge with due recommendation from a Government ENT doctor or Grama Niladhari confirming low-income status. The Centre also provides hearing tests, high quality hearing aids, speech assessments and speech therapy services at affordable rates, which support the Centre’s social mission. 
“Our experienced staff create a friendly atmosphere and provide independent advice and therapy in hearing, speech, and language related issues,” Renuka Fonseka, Manager of the Ratmalana Audiology Centre, said.
“Dialog is humbled to have partnered with the Ratmalana School for the Deaf to provide services to Sri Lankans with hearing and speech challenges free of charge, which undoubtedly will help in their journey to overcome their challenges”, said Supun Weerasinghe, Group Chief Executive of Dialog Axiata PLC.
“Collaborations such as the Ratmalana Audiology Centre embody Dialog’s approach: focusing on long-term sustainability, early interventions greatly enhancing the lives of those affected, and partnering with outstanding Public and Community organizations to achieve large-scale impact.
Through community investments such as these, Dialog embraces its role as a responsible corporate citizen, in line with our Vision of enriching Sri Lankan lives and enterprises, focusing on creating not just economic value but also social end environment value.
