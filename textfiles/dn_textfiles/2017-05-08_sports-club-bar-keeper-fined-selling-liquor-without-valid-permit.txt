A Rs. 50,000 fine was imposed by Panadura Additional Magistrate Calhari Liyanage on a bar keeper of a sports club situated near a main girl’s school in Panadura when he pleaded guilty on May 4 to a charge of possessing 67 litres of arrack and foreign liquor without a valid permit.
He was imposed an additional fine of Rs. 190,960 according to the value of the stock of liquor seized and ordered to release the productions back to the sports club.
