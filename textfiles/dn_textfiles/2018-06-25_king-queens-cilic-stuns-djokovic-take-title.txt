King of Queen's! Cilic stuns Djokovic to take title

London, Sunday: Marin Cilic was crowned Queen's Club champion for the second time as the Croatian stunned Novak Djokovic with a dramatic fightback in his 5-7, 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 victory on Sunday.
Cilic was on the verge of a third loss in the Queen's final when Djokovic held a match point in the second set.
But the world number six survived that threat and then stormed back from 4-1 down to take the second set tie-break.
Inspired by that escape act, Cilic powered through the deciding set to leave Djokovic shell-shocked as he won the Wimbledon warm-up event for the first time since 2012. AFP
