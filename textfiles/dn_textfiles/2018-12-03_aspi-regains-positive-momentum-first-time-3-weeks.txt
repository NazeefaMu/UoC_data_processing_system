Point of view
Sri Lankan equities regained positive momentum for the first time since early November, with the ASPI gaining ~89 points (or 1.5%) during the week to breach the psychological 6,000-mark for the 1st time in 3-weeks.
Although the Index recorded an initial sharp rise (+4.5%) immediately after the political developments on Oct’26th, these gains were wiped off over the subsequent weeks as the country’s political standoff worsened over the period.
The Broadshare Index lost ~2.7% in the last 3 weeks, but gains on all 5-days of this week helped the Index record a weekly gain of 1.5%, to end ~19 points above 6,000 for the first time since early November. Activity levels on the market also improved during the week, with average daily turnover amounting to Rs.0.8Bn cf. just Rs.0.5Bn last week.
Local HNI and institutional investors were also active throughout the week, with crossings accounting for 48% of the total weekly turnover (cf. YTD avg. of 42% so far this year). Local HNI and institutional buying interest were mainly focused on bluechip JKH (~39% of the total crossings) particularly with the approach of the entitlement date for the 1 for 20 share repurchase next week (JKH’s share price has increased ~10.7% to Rs.160.50 since the announcement of this share repurchase). Foreign investors meanwhile, continued to remain net sellers this week as well, with the sell-off on domestic equities amounting to Rs. 796Mn relative to last week’s net selling of Rs. 188Mn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to continue to look for direction from further political developments stemming from the outcome of court cases on the current political crises and next week’s parliamentary session.
Sept quarter market earnings decline 10% Y-o-Y
Corporate earnings for the total market1 declined over the Sept’18 quarter, falling 10% Y-o-Y to Rs.55.0Bn (cf. Rs.61.1Bn in Sep’17) amid declines in most sectors, including major sectors such as Diversified and F&B which typically account for ~25-28% of market earnings.

Although earnings in the Financial Services sector (which t ypically accounts for 40% of total market earnings) gained 29% Y-o-Y helped by a 13% Y-o-Y growth in Banks, 32% Y-o-Y growth in Finance and 146% Y-o-Y growth in Insurance (amid one-off adjustments stemming the change in insurance industry valuation rules), the earnings growth in the segment was not enough to offset the losses of most sectors.
Earnings from Diversified fell 21% Y-o-Y while earnings from F&B fell 8% Y-o-Y offsetting gains in sectors such as Financial Services (+29% Y-o-Y), Construction (+58% Y-o-Y) and Land & Property (+29%). Weak earnings performance in sectors such as Manufacturing (-44% Y-o-Y), Telco (-36% Y-o-Y), Hotels (-179% Y-o-Y), Motors (-102% Y-o-Y) and Healthcare (-17% Y-o-Y) also contributed to the overall decline in market earnings.
Cumulative earnings2 for the 6-Months to Sept’18 meanwhile, remained flat, rising 1.0% Y-o-Y to Rs.115.7 (cf. 5% Y-o-Y growth in 6M’17 and 15% Y-o-Y growth in 6M’16). In terms of trailing 12M earnings however, market earnings rose 7% Y-o-Y to Rs. 288.4Bn aided primarily by Banks, Finance & Insurance (+34%), F&B (+27%), Telco (+25%) and Construction (+15%). Sri Lanka’s PER level consequently fell to 8.7x (9.3x in Sep’17) allowing Sri Lanka to remain one of the cheapest markets among its Frontier and Emerging regional peers which trade between 11x to 12x.
