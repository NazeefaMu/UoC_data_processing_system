A simple life

All our prophets tell us to lead a simple life. A life of a simple person is more pleasant than the life of rich people. “Simple life” says the prophet Mohammed, “Set my heart on high thoughts.”
It is a good thing that so many people in Europe, America and elsewhere have, during the recent years, come to see how much more pleasant and sensible the simple life is than one, which is given over to much spending, much show and much vanity. Men and women who have enough money to buy expensive things waste their riches by buying things they don’t even want. They enjoy luxurious clothing and adorn their houses with rich looking furniture. People who work hard are the best servants of humanity. They live in a quiet frugal manner which keeps them in better health and enables them to take more active part in the world’s work.
I consider it a sin to waste money on personal pleasures. Whoever, spends too much on luxury is wasting money which can be used for the feeding, clothing and maintaining of his or her poorer neighbours. We should make our functions simple and on all important occasions we should remember the suffering humanity, and give a part of our money to charity. Great people have taught the value of austerity by living a simple life. It would be nice to develop courage to lead a simple life and determine to do good work.
