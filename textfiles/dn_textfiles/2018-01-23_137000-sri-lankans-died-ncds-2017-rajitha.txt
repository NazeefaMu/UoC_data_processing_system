137,000 Sri Lankans died from  NCDs in 2017 - Rajitha

Last year (2017), a total of 137,000 Sri Lankans had died from Non Communicable Diseases, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the number of NCD deaths had been reveled through 2017 health statistics. NCDs have become a challenge for Sri Lanka and most of the NCDs are caused due to lack of exercises and unhealthy life style. He was addressing the gathering after launching Life TV Channel, the National Health Channel in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that a social dialogue should be commenced on the prevailing NCDs condition in the country. NCDs are rapidly increasing in the country. A lot of steps had been taken to tackle the issue. A total of 1,000 state hospitals will be included in the e-Health Programme by 2020.
Accurate health information should be communicated to the public. Complaints had been received on overdosing certain injections given to gain fair skin. Some creams available to apply on skin contain mercury which is cancerous. Such treatment should be properly managed and accurate information should be communicated to the public. The launch of this channel was planned several years ago, he added. SPMC Chairman Dr. Sayura Samarasundara and many other Consultant doctors were present during the launch.
