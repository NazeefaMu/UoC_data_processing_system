007 Spectre coming in November

James Bond returns and he's welcome back to Sri Lanka anytime! "Spectre" opens in cinemas in Sri Lanka on November 6 same day with USA.
Audiences in Sri Lanka have always loved James Bond ... from Sean Connery in Dr. No to Moonraker with Roger Moore right up to Skyfall with the ever so dangerous and seductive Daniel Craig. There's been a following on this island that would rival anywhere else in the world! As 007 returns, you know "Spectre" will play out to packed theatres of Bond fans around the island.
This movie is brought to you in Sri Lanka by Liberty Lands and Development who have been appointed by Tanweer Group, a leader in theatrical content distribution.
"We always go to any lengths to get the best of international movies for our audiences in Sri Lanka. We believe it's crucial to have these movies in theatres on same dates as international launches so as to keep our enthusiastic viewers happy", Liberty Lands and Development Managing Director Imthiaz Cader stated.
Cader elaborates that the movie going culture in Sri Lanka is one that craves every next global release with the hype for Spectre already evident on social media.
Spectre promises to be brimming with excitement. A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond played by Daniel Craig to Mexico City and Rome, where he meets the beautiful widow played by Monica Bellucci of an infamous criminal. After infiltrating a secret meeting, 007 uncovers the existence of the sinister organization SPECTRE. Needing the help of the daughter of an old nemesis, he embarks on a mission to find her. As Bond ventures toward the heart of SPECTRE, he discovers a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks.
As with every Bond movie, expect those nail-biting elements that keep you frozen in front of the screen from cracking great chases on difficult terrain to treacherous enemies that use every weapon to terrorize and loyalties that won't die. As he destroys the most daunting threats, James Bond, this character of Ian Fleming's imagination surpasses any other we have ever known.
