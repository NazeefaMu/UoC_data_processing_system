‘Speaker directed by Sirikotha’

Former MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said President Maithripala Sirisena has protected the supremacy of the people by dissolving Parliament and declaring a general election without letting the country slide into anarchy.
Now the people have a real opportunityto democratically elect their representatives to Parliament and those who respect democracy will never reject the President’s decision, he said.
There would have been an instability in the country had Parliament convened due to the partiality of the Speaker. The Speaker cannot engage in politics. But, in this instance, the Speaker was directed by Sirikotha, Abeygunawardena said.
“The President who knew this situation well dissolved Parliament and gave the people an opportunity to elect a new Parliament. I like to ask UNP MPs who always pretend that they protect democracy, if they want an election or not. If they have worked for the people, they can go before the people without any fear,” he said.
