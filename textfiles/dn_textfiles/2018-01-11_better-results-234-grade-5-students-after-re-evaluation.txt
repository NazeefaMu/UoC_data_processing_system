Better results for 234 Grade 5 students after re-evaluation

The marks of 234 students who sat the Grade Five Scholarship Examination last year have changed after re-evaluation.
The Examinations Department had received nearly 20,000 applications for re-evaluating.
The names of the students whose marks have been changed will be sent to the Education Ministry while the names of the other applicants whose marks have not been changed, will be sent to the relevant principals.
Meanwhile, Ministry has advised the relevant parties to complete the process of enrolling students to popular and national schools based on the Grade Five Scholarship Examination cut-off marks within this month.
