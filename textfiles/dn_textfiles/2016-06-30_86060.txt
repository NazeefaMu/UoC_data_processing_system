Rugby refereeing  standards must improve

 
It’s easy to become a referee and start refereeing! Officiating as a referee in rugby football games is largely a responsible job. There are a whole host of reasons why one might take up the whistle, to remain active in the sport following injury or retirement, to make new and lasting friends within the game, or to gain a sense of achievement by providing an invaluable service to players, coaches and spectators alike. But according to statistics rugby players who have retired from rugby are not contributing towards the advancement of the game globally.
These players should take up rugby refereeing with their knowledge and experience after hanging up their boots. Why? Learning to referee rugby football games is largely a trial by fire. There is only a single referee on the field and that referee cannot change a decision once it is made, and no-one else can help although they can complain.
As far as rugby is concerned, it is a part and parcel of our culture and lifestyle that will never diminish. What is happening now is that the game is fast developing with most of the schools playing at the highest level and encouraging their players. Schools in the urban and rural areas too have taken up the game.
Rugby will go on regardless but it will also gain a great deal from the new facilities provided by the schools and their old boy’s rugby wing, exposing rugby at grass root level and the sponsors showing great interest to support the game.
The drawback of this fine game that is going from strength to strength is the unprofessionalism and poor quality of refereeing by some of them who control the game. It is unfortunate that although the Sri Lank Rugby Referees Society is well over 60 years in existence it is sad to say today that the referees governing body do not check the standard of refereeing in the domestic front and that is disappointing. This was very clearly evident in some of the school matches. Therefore, the Referees Society must improve in this area and lift the standard of refereeing so that referees and ruggerites enjoy the game. The present Referees’ boss was one of the top class referees that rugby has produced in Sri Lanka -Nizam Jamaldeen. He and his team should be given the necessary backing by the controlling body.
In some instances players and spectators have abused and threatened to assault the referee or the linesmen. Also today, touch judges seem to be interfering too much. Referee handles the whistle, and then the touch judges do their job from the side lines. Then there is a match commissioner and a citing officer, now they have TMO, to accept that referees make errors but often the TMO can change the referee’s opinion even though the referee can see the replay footage on the screen just as the TMO sees. TMO should be mostly treated – as a replay technician with no input to on-field decision-making.
Today rugby has had a rapid growth in our country, both in terms of number of participants and status over the past two decades is being reflected by the ever increasing spectators and media interest. All this progress and development will halt if the standard of referees does not improve with immediate effect. Today what referees need are fitness, speed and a wide knowledge of the game. The areas where our referees have to improve, is the knowledge of the advantage rule, especially in defence inside the twenty-two meter mark. There is no need to play the penalty advantage. Today referees, show that they are not relaxed in the field when they officiate in a game of rugby. That’s because they are inexperienced and do not have much exposure to handle a game of rugby.
The laws of the game of rugby are complicated because it’s more a game of chess than a game of draughts. It’s Test cricket versus One-Day or T 20. With the complexities of the game come the complicated rules, and so the many and varied ways of interpreting them. It’s the complexities that make rugby great.
It is important for the referee to establish control of the match early on. This does not mean blowing up for ten penalties in the first five minutes, but it does mean that you must establish your parameters for the game early, ignore the sideline advice, and enjoy the game.
In the good old days it was questioned whether football can learn from rugby union’s attitude to referees?
