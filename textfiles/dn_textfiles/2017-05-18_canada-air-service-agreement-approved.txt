Canada air service agreement approved

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved an air service agreement between Sri Lanka and Canada on Tuesday.
The Cabinet approved a proposal submitted by Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva for an air service agreement between the two countries which has been agreed at official level.
Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry sources said that no such agreement is in force between the countries though a large number of Sri Lankans are living in Canada. Officials of both countries had agreed to sign an air service agreement to promote tourism and bilateral trade.
