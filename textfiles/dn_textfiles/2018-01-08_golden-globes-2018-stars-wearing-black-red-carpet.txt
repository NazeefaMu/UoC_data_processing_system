Golden Globes 2018: Stars wearing black on the red carpet

 
The red carpet at the 75th Golden Globes has been dominated by one colour - black.
Actresses wore black gowns in support of the Time's Up movement, standing in solidarity with victims of sexual assault and harassment.
Many men wore Time's Up pin badges or black shirts with their suits.

Outlander star Caitriona Balfe, Will and Grace's Debra Messing and The Handmaid's Tale's Yvonne Strahovski are among the many wearing all black.

Some chose to wear a splash of colour - including singer Kelly Clarkson, singer turned actress Mandy Moore and Get Out actress Allison Williams.

Many celebrities are sporting lapel pins and badges in favour of Time's Up and 50:50, campaigns intent on fighting sexual harassment and gender inequality in the entertainment industry.
Above, Stranger Things actor David Harbour and William H Macy are seen sporting Time's Up lapel pins, while The Crown's Claire Foy wears a 50:50 button on the cuff of her striking tuxedo jacket.

Classic options were chosen by nominee Jessica Chastain, Gillian Anderson and Millie Bobby Brown on the red carpet.

Kate Hudson was joined in wearing black by Swedish actress Alicia Vikander and Downton Abbey star Lily James.

The Greatest Showman actor Zac Efron, actress and rapper Abbie Cornish and Baby Driver star Ansel Egort also showed their support for the campaign.
