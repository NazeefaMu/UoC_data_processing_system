Men rush for a brush with a lush blush!

It’s official. Men are now wearing makeup. Believe me I am not making it up. I was a disbeliever too until I witnessed it with my own pair of gaping ‘peepers.’ Actually, it was observed only recently when I arrived to fetch the wife home from her regular beauty parlour in town.
It is certainly a chic place, as far as clinically chic places go. A personable young receptionist with black and blue spiky hair informed me that the missus was still undergoing her therapy. His head resembled the dishevelled spikes of a porcupine which had just emerged after a raging battle.
Young ‘Porcu-spikes’ then turned to me and with utmost politeness asked: “Would you too like a haircut, while you wait sir?” I shook my head as I made a tactical retreat fearing that if he got any closer he could poke my eyes out with his tonsorial bristles. He was joined by a petite beautician with a surgical mask at half mast who tried to convince me to try a facial, a pedicure and manicure. I declined as graciously as I could.
But she was persuasive and asked me to visit the cosmetics section, where entire shelves were now dedicated to male vanity. My curiosity aroused I followed her. Oh, I thought, the twits who start eliminating their zits have become the latest trend in boys behaving girly-like. These dudes have gone from secretly filching some of their women’s moisturizers to owning enough beauty products to make most transvestites blush.
Beyond swanky moisturizers and creams, there was on offer a scandalous assortment of toiletries that tailor to the new male vanity. I am talking about foundations, skin-toners and bronzers, nail varnish and even lipstick, words that until now have been nonexistent in the male lexicon.
I asked her: “But aren’t these services and products traditionally aimed at women, such as eye-liner, fake tan, face-toner and spot or blemish concealer?” She looked at me pityingly and I was made to understand that long gone are the days when lipstick and eye-liner were reserved for women. From eyeliner, sorry, ‘guy-liner’ to mascara, begging your pardon again, ‘manscara’, thousands of males have taken to wearing make-up regularly.
A decade ago men wearing make-up were an oddity as a macho culture stressing men’s rough, tough image was prevalent everywhere. Masculinity was clearly defined when men were men and would rather be dead than caught patronising a beauty parlour which was strictly a feminine preserve. But the debate goes more than just skin deep. Now, I have always understood that cosmetics are a woman’s means for keeping a man from reading between the lines.
But some men appear to have taken to makeup as a sort of religion and are born-again cosmetic users. It seems men are not just content to indulge in a little beauty therapy they want to be the ones dishing it out as well. There were many young hip-hopper therapists and some older ones as well sashaying around in tight pants while preaching the dangers of loose jowls.
There was a time when guys started filching a dollop or two of the other half’s concealer to cover up those bags after a night on the tiles. But they had the grace to do it furtively. Before their partner knew it, they made a quick dip into her mascara or face cream. Most dudes used to wear makeup in secret and were basically makeup thieves. Yes then the long arm of gender equality had extended its reach past the boardrooms and into women’s bathrooms and medicine cabinets.
So it seems they all keep reaching for the blusher but quite openly now. No, not me, I blush naturally when I think of my male peers dipping into skin-care creams. Times sure are a-changing with the young and not so young urban male all set to take over the traditionally female bastion of beauty parlours and cosmetics. They certainly take care of their appearance in a way that would have had their grandfathers spluttering into their happy hour highballs.
But there were some ageing regulars as well. The clientele was a mixed hodgepodge of the young, the middle-aged and even an oldster on the wrong side of 90 who came tottering out with the aid of a walking stick.
The geriatric limper with his ubiquitous walking stick emerged from his ministrations like a spectre out of a horror movie. He actually looked like Dracula’s twin, his face completely overshadowed by the eyeliner which must have cost a bomb. I could easily have given the old duffer two black eyes for free, gratis and for nothing.
The beautician enlightened me that the application of face masks has not yet picked up to the expected level of acceptance among men as yet. While most other forms of grooming that had been women only territory till late has turned unisex. Usage of face mask has yet a long way to go. I suggested that a good many of them should be advised to actually wear permanent face masks – both before and after make up – to spare the world the horror of their appearances.
By becoming attuned to the beauty industry, men are now openly availing themselves of the same opportunities afforded to women.The transformation of many males from macho to makeup has also been propelled by competition for jobs and romance. It represents a new revenue stream for global cosmetics makers grappling with the saturated women’s skincare market.
Perhaps it would do men good to hang on to a few traditional concepts of manhood so we do not lose sight of who we are. How long will it be until men start going to the bathroom in pairs to touch up their foundation? Or gossip about their partners while sitting under the perm hair dryer, their feet soaking in soothing skin toner?
My toilet shelf contains a razor, a can of shaving cream and a bottle of astringent after-shave. There is something admirable about the man who takes his imperfections with grace and carries on with his life.
Maintaining a good image is fine, but let’s draw the line at face paint.
It’s sounds funny to some of us but not everyone. That is because no one even bats a false eyelash or raises an artificial eyebrow these days about male make up, it seems.
