What chances for constitutional reform?

Is the proposed new Constitution to be pushed into the political garbage?
Progress on the new Constitution is certainly the major issue the government will have to face in the coming weeks and months, while the garbage issue remains an explosive social and political matter that transcends the attachments of party politics, posing a danger to peace in society.
The Government has to now deal with a major opposition to the new Constitution that has come from a prominent section of the Buddhist clergy, reflecting the opposition to proposed constitutional changes that have been announced by the government’s political opponents in the Joint Opposition (JO), and strongly backed by nationalist and communal, ethnic and religious forces that are stoking fears of the proposed constitutional changes leading to federalism, and challenging the position of Buddhism in the country.
The statement by the Sangha of the three Nikayas that there is no need for a new Constitution or any amendments to the present Constitution, raises the issue of how the government could remain committed to implementing the pledges given to the people to bring in a new Constitution that will abolish the Executive Presidency, in the campaign for the Presidential Poll in January 2015.
This major issue of government policy made President Maithripala Sirisena to meet members of the Sangha who informed him of their decision arrived at the Sangha Sabha held last Tuesday. This meeting at Kandy will certainly be important on matters of constitutional change, as well as other matters that has been addressed by this section of the Sangha, such as the SAITM issue with a call for a settlement soon, and opposition to the Bill on the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, which has already been presented in Parliament.
Goodwill
Possibly as a gesture of goodwill to the position of the Sangha and other critics, the government did not go ahead with the debate on this Bill in Parliament, which was due on Tuesday, but held it back. With such a gesture, President Sirisena will certainly seek to reach some understanding with the representatives of the Sangha on the major issue of constitutional reform. But, the politics within the government, and among opposition forces in the country will certainly make this no easy task.
The statement by Cabinet spokesman, Minister Rajitha Senaratne, that it is the responsibility of the government to fulfill the people’s mandate – given by 6.2 million of voters, does not readily meet the issues raised by the Sangha on the issue of constitutional change. It is correct that the proposed constitutional changes will have to be adopted by Parliament, before it goes for endorsement by the people at a referendum. But, the issues of constitutional changes, especially the abolition of the Executive Presidency, and the very matter of a referendum, have been matters of important rivalry within the government itself.
There is a considerable number of SLFP members in the present coalition of ‘National Unity’ who are opposed both to a referendum and the abolition of the Executive Presidency. They have been falling in line with the JO on this matter and showing support for the new tactics of the Mahinda Rajapaksa strategists on the emerging political situation. These SLFPers, the sections of the Sangha, and nationalist groups who are now opposing any constitutional change, and especially the abolition of the Executive Presidency, were all supportive (or never opposed) the removal of the Executive Presidency when it was in the three election manifestos of Mahinda Rajapaksa, and proposed even earlier by President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
The change in the nature of the presidency, from that of Executive status to a more ceremonial one, is a matter that was before the public of this country for at least three decades. It has been and remains one of the key aspects of opposition to the constitutional changes introduced by JR Jayewardene in 1977/78 that brought in the right wing authoritative rule, which has shown increasing signs of dictatorial rule, the worst aspects of which were seen in the final years of the Rajapaksa Regime.
The opposition by this section of the Sangha, no doubt from all three Nikayas, raises important questions for the government on how it is to implement at least one key proposal of the manifesto that saw the election of President Sirisena in January 2015, and later led to forming the ‘National Coalition” after the General Election in August that year. It is the promise to abolish the Executive Presidency, and bringing a new and more democratic constitution.
The government certainly has itself to blame, to a very large extent, for the opposition to constitutional change that is making a major impact on the politics of the country. This has to do with the absence of a people’s campaign led by the government, and supported by the civil society organisations that helped its victory in January 2015 on constitutional reform. The UNP-SLFP divisions within the government may have led to this lethargy on necessary political action. It is now faced with a situation that may even compel it to abandon these constitutional changes, which would lead to a major political setback to the coalition of National Unity, but much more to the section of the SLFP that is within the government and not playing games with the JO and the Rajapaksa strategists.
SAITM and GMOA
Referred to by the section of the Sangha that has opposed constitutional change, SAITM remains a pressing issue for the government. The GMOA was compelled to take a step back from its threatened continuous strike due to public concern, protests by sections opposed to its continuous strike weapon, and the call by the Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjth, asking doctors to give consideration to the spread of Dengue among the people. But, the issue of SAITM has clearly become one of political opposition to the government, much more than an issue of the education of medical students.
While awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court on the SLMC’s objection to the Court of Appeal’s decision on registering SAITM students (which petition is now being supported by the GMOA), it is necessary for the government to decide on a clear action on dealing with the SAITM issue, and the entire issue of the role of the private sector in medical education. The GMOA, in claiming that its interest in opposing SAITM is because of its interest for the future safety of patients, is caught in the midst of many contradictions on the selection of students for state university training in medicine. The need for more doctors, and the need to give a fair opportunity to all students who qualify to enter state universities, to be admitted for such training, even in different institutions, is an issue that cannot be delayed any further.
This reality of serving the interests of the student population who are qualified to enter university medical facilities (without the District Quota advantage) is the key issue of the SAITM-GMOA dispute, and it is best if the government takes this up as a public issue, which will make the public at large understand the growing crisis in medical education, the role of doctors in state hospitals and their role in private hospitals, too. This is an important issue for public debate that could well expose the wrong or unfair lines that the GMOA has been following on this matter so far.
The garbage bin
If any lessons are drawn from the debate in Parliament earlier this week on the garbage issue, it is clear this is a matter that cannot be pushed aside with political slogans, and promises of speedy action. Colombo city alone is a major location of a garbage crisis. There are ministers making rival claims on how it could best be solved, and about who would or could solve it. Judging from what Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on the matter, there are also signs of a possible clash between the Executive and Judiciary on the matter of garbage. This is certainly to be avoided.
Although this crisis that has come down from the last regime, there is little benefit in continuing to blame it on the previous government. The public caught in the midst of all this garbage, and the necessity to fight Dengue, is certainly not prepared to listen to the tossing of blame from one to another. What are needed are quick and clear action, with the public informed of the plans being made, with community discussions on the actions that could be taken, and a clear timetable on future action.
The statements of Ministers and public officials, especially from local government bodies, on reasons for the failure to address the crisis are not sufficient, and not useful. The public needs better proof of action, if this crisis is to be contained and resolved with a proper plan of action. The Government will of course have to face criticism over the continued delay in local government elections, which is part of the political garbage of today.
