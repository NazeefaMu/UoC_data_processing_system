Lankan refugees ready for repatriation

A special UNHCR camp held in Trichy, India, to guide Sri Lankan refugees on repatriation to their home received a good response from the refugees, with many of them expressing their desire to go back.
Earlier, refugees were skeptical on repatriation due to uncertainty of their future, but the UNHCR allayed their fears and provided them the guidance required to clear the formalities for their repatriation.
As a part of the programme, two officials from UNHCR in Chennai conducted the two-day camp at the district collectorate on Monday. On the first day, some of the refugees expressed their willingness to be repatriated.
"A total of 16 members from nine families attended the camp. They are interested in returning to their hometowns in Sri Lanka. Most of them who came today are natives of Jaffna and Vavuniya," Indian Regional Special Deputy Collector S. Natarasan told TOI.
The officials verified the documents to authenticate their Sri Lankan origin and their passports. UNHCR would even help them apply for passports in the Sri Lankan embassy in Chennai if they had not obtained the same.
UNHCR would also take care of the travel expenses to Sri Lanka and provide financial assistance for their survival until they are accustomed to the situation to earn on their own.
"We will provide financial assistance to maintain their daily needs for at least three months in Sri Lanka," said Natarasan.
More refugee families attended the second day's camp yesterday.
As far as Trichy district is concerned, the refugees have been residing in the two camps in Kottapattu and Vazhavandhankottai. At present, 1,389 refugees including 701 males and 688 females are residing in Kottapattu, while the other camp has 1,420 refugees including 725 males and 695 females.
In 2016, 20 refugees were repatriated with the help of UNHRC, while two of them went back on their own from Kottapattu camp.
A total of 21 refugees left for Sri Lanka with support from the UNHRC and 17 left for Sri Lanka by themselves from Vazhavandhankottai camp. In February, two refugees from Kottapattu were repatriated.
The repatriation of the refugees from 112 camps in Tamil Nadu is progressing after three decades of their stay in India following the end of the ethnic war. (Times of India)
