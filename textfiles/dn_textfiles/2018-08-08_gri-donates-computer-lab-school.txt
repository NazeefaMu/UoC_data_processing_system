GRI donates computer lab to school

Global Rubber Industries (GRI) donated ten complete computer units with power backups, recently to Nalawalana Kanishta School in Makandura, with over 370 students. GRI also spearheaded the refurbishment of the computer laboratory.
GRI, being pioneers in producing tyres, took on the challenge and aided in addressing this learning gap by launching initiatives to support its advocacy by providing access to quality computer education, to the children of Nalawalana Kanishta School.
“GRI, as a technology-based company, we understand the importance of evolving with modern day trends and are pleased to support the development of our nation,” said Prabhash Subasinghe Managing Director of GRI.
“We are enthusiastic to help our local communities and as we continue to expand our global operations, we hope to touch more lives and more people. Now that we have opened our new Tyre Factory in Badalgama, we wish to do something for the community of our country, thus, leading us into meeting the bright and creative minds of Nalawalana Kanishta School,” said Shanaka Gunarathne, Senior General Manager of GRI.
