Tone, and Slang

Kingdom Cons is a novel with music at its core, and there’s no doubt that Yuri Herrera calls the tunes. On the surface level, the book is “about” a singer-songwriter—a corrido-writing accordion player, to be precise. The protagonist is a young man who is known, at different points in his life and career, as both Lobo and The Artist. He learns early on that school is not a place for him and that songs will save his life (despite later learning that they may also jeopardize it).
Transformation
Abandoned by his parents, Lobo takes up his accordion (“Now hold it good… This is your bread,” says his father the day before upping sticks) and begins to compose. Much of the novel chronicles the transformation he undergoes after getting a gig at the Palace where he is employed to write and play corridos (ballads) in praise of the King’s infinite valor, power and general badassery. The Artist’s songs are all the rage with the general public and music to the ears of the King himself—and therein lies his limited clout.
Like all three of Yuri Herrera’s novels to date, Kingdom Cons presents us with a central character who is tough and yet sensitive, lives in a cruel and violent world yet finds tenderness, and—most importantly—is aware of the fact that he wields a form of influence which derives from words and the power of communication.
Also, although it is in Kingdom Cons where literal music-making takes center stage, musicality is central to each of Yuri’s novels. And when it comes to translating the book, as central as the tune-filled plot is the rhythmic prose (or poetry, arguably), which is full of chords that are deceptively difficult to strike.
Staccato
Herrera’s tone can be lyrical, stentorian, strident or staccato but always manages to seem improvised, almost offhanded and utterly natural. Descriptions are often in a higher register, full of sonorous finery whether reflecting The Artist’s early awe and naiveté at the splendor surrounding the King or his later disillusionment and resolve.
Reflections
These descriptions seem almost to glide, their flow smooth; in musical terms, reflections of this sort might be seen as legato. Much of the dialogue, on the other hand, leans slangward and is short and clipped. Kingdom Cons is full of thugs, and they speak like thugs, their cadence more staccato.
