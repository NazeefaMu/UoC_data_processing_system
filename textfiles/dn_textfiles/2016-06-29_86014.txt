Thomians line-up semi-final clash with Royal

Milo knockout Trophy contenders S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia thrashed Zahira College Maradana by 43 points (7 tries, 4 conversions) to 10 (1 try, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) in their quarterfinal match played at the Royal Sports Complex, Reid Avenue yesterday. The Thomians led 19-7 at the breather.
It was an awesome performance orchestrated by Thomian speedy left winger Naveen Henakankanamge and dazzling number eight turned full back Danuja Wijeratne where each of them scored three breathtaking tries in each half.
The Thomians amply demonstrated why they should be considered one of the front runners for the Milo knockout title by putting on a fabulous display of fast open rugby through their fleet-footed three quarters. Zahira on the other hand struggled with their tackles and were totally dominated in the set pieces by the Thomians.
Even though the Thomians could not win their own throws in the line outs, their entire three quarter line totally dominated the game simply overrunning the opposition at every given opportunity.
S. Thomas’ opened scoring in the 13th minute, when off a penalty tap their full back Danuja Wijeratne went over the line for a try. Ashvantha Herath missed the conversion and S. Thomas’ led 5-nil.
In the 21st minute of play Zahira grab the lead, when off a turn over ball their hooker Mohamad Elyaz crashed through for a try which full back Nirhan Gunawijaya converted to make it 7-5 in favour of Zahira.
Off a ruck in the 28th minute Thomian fly half Hans Walpola gave a beautiful off load to Wijeratne who dummied his way over for a try. Herath made the conversion for Thomians to regain the lead 12-7.
In the 41st minute off a penalty tap the Thomian number eight Shanive Ahangama send a timely pass to Wijeratne who once again touch down for a brilliant try fending off eight Zahirian defenders to score mid left. Herath made the conversion to increase the tally to 19-7 at half time.
After the turn around in the 49th minute, Zahira scored off the boot of Gunawijaya who slotted a 35-metre penalty to reduce the lead to 19-10.
In the 60th minute off a sweeping three quarter move Henakankanamge scored a brilliant try under the post after a breathtaking 80 metre run. Herath made the conversion to extend the Thomian lead to 26-10.
Henakankanamge scored again in the 72nd minute through another 30-metre run to touch down for a try mid left. Herath slotted the conversion to increase the score to 33-10.
In the 76th minute off a scrum inside their 22 Thomian scrum half Shenal de Silva made a superb chip kick into the hands of winger Henakankanamge who collected the ball and darted down nearly 70 metres to score his third try of the match near the right corner flag. Herath missed the difficult conversion but S. Thomas’ enjoyed a hefty lead of 38 points to 10.
The Thomians sealed the match in injury time, when off a ruck, replacement player Abeetha Pilapitiya crashed through for a try near the left corner flag. The difficult touch line conversion was missed by Herath but it did not make much of a difference as the scoreline read a runaway 43-10.
The win secured the Thomians a semi-final clash with traditional rivals Royal College on July 3.
Referee D. Nimal had an excellent game with the whistle.
