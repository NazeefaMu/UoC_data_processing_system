Super Sun SC holds New Youngs FC to a draw

Super Sun SC recovered after trailing 0-1 to a force a draw against New Youngs FC 1-1 in the Dialog Champions League curtain raiser played at Alfred Duraiappah Stadium, Jaffna on Sunday.
B.S. Nimo headed into a 22nd minute lead in for New Youngs FC and O. Daniel scored a goal in 78th minute, equalising before the half time for Super Sun SC. Early in the first half it was New Youngs who looked the dominant team with few of the national poolists among their ranks, including Duckson Piuslas – skipper for the Wennappuwa side.
Super Sun goalkeeper Janaka Kosala was put under immense pressure and looked shaky between the posts.
New Youngs capitalizing on this struck first with a long kick into the Super Sun box which was misjudged by Kosala and B.S. Nimo chipped it over him to score the first goal of the league.
The poor ground conditions affected the players as none of the players were able to play fluently as the ball kept wobbling all over the field.
The second half was somewhat subdued from start as both teams struggled.
The pace of the game was pedestrian for the most part of the second half. New Youngs FC’s Mohamed Fawzan and Oluwatosin Daniel of Super Sun SC were shown yellow cards during the game.
