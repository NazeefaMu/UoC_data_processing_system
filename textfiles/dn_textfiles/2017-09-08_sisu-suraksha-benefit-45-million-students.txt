Sisu Suraksha to benefit  4.5 million students

Following in the footsteps of free education pioneer C.W.W.Kannangara, the government yesterday launched free medical insurance scheme “Sisu Suraksha” for the 4.5 million students in the country.
The scheme will be effective from October 1 in parallel with World Children's Day covering all students in government schools, non-aided or aided private schools, Pirivena schools and international schools.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said this health insurance scheme will further enhance free education in the country.
"Under this scheme, if a student is hospitalised at a government hospital, Rs.1000 will be paid daily for upto 30 days and each student would be entitled to this benefit twice a year. If hospitalised in a private hospital, each student will get upto Rs.1,00,000 to settle the bills.
In case of death of a parent,a student would be paid up to Rs.75,000 to complete his/her education, while in the case of the death of a student, Rs.100,000 would be paid to the immediate family. The scheme will also provide Rs.10,000 per day for OPD treatment," the Minister said. "We are also looking at the possibility of getting 20 percent discount for students consulting private doctors and specialist consultants at private hospitals,” Minister Kariyawasam added. He said that school principals have responsibility to implement this scheme in a successfull manner. Relevant circulars in this regard will be sent to schools in due course.
