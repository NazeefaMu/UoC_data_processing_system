President helped MR, son to re-enter politics- Devapriya

Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya yesterday said it was President Maithripala Sirisena, a democratic leader who created the necessary environment for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his son MP Namal Rajapaksa to re-enter politics after their defeat on January 8,2015.
However, they do not want to accept the fact that some of the problems faced by them were solved by the President.They think it is a matter of shame for them.
“When the Rajapaksa family wants to get something done, they will not hesitate to directly call the President and seek his help,” Devapriya alleged.
“However, they are trying to show the people that the President had got together with the UNP to destroy the Rajapaksa family and the SLFP.But, the people have understood the dual policies of them,”he said.
President Sirisena has categorically stated that he does not have any deal with the Prime Minster, but only an agreement for the betterment of the country. However, the truth is that those who have insulted him have deals with the Prime Minister.
“President Sirisena wanted the two main parties to join for the country’s benefit. It was also the request wish of several genuine SLFPers in the Joint Opposition(JO). During the final discussion between the SLFP and SLPJP, Minister Susil Premajayantha had made all arrangements to register the SLPJP and jointly contest under the Chair symbol which was one of the SLPJP’s conditions. But, they did not agree to that later,” he said.
“The JO is beset with many problems. Many minority parties have been divided into various groups and they are fighting each other. But, they are reluctant to admit this to the public,” he added.
