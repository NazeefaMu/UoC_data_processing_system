Lankan in illicit drug case jailed for three year in Doha

A Doha Criminal Court has sentenced a Sri Lankan man to three years in jail and subsequent deportation for illicit dealing and consumption of drug.
Local Arabic daily 'Arrayah' reported that the court also ordered the defendant to pay Qatari Riyal 200,000 as fine for the offence.
The matter came to light after the Drugs Prevention Department at the Ministry of Interior (MoI) received information from a source that the defendant used to consume and sell the illicit drug, marijuana. The suspect was walking near his accommodation when a police patrol officer searched him and found some marijuana hidden in his clothes. More of the illicit drug was found during a thorough search of his room, while a blood test indicated that he had consumed marijuana.
During interrogation, the defendant admitted to dealing in the contraband.
