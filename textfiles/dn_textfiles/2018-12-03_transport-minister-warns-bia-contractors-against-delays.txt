Transport Minister warns BIA contractors against delays

Delaying and failing to complete airport development projects on time would necessitate cancellation of contract agreements and cessation of payments, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva told contractors on Friday.
The Minister was speaking to contractors during an observation visit to the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) where he looked into the progress of ongoing airport development projects.
He said the projects were scheduled to be completed by mid-2019, but construction has been delayed by the contractors.
The Minister visited the construction site of the new apron of the airport and also inspected renovation work at the passenger terminals. These projects are being carried out through a Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) concessionary loan.
According to Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited (AASSL), the new apron of the airport is being constructed at a cost of Rs. 1.006 million. With the completion of the project, parking facilities for additional 25 aircraft will be provided, easing the prevailing congestion.
The renovation of the arrivals and departures passenger terminals is being done at a cost of Rs. 1.001 million. The project will develop the emigration and the immigration areas, passengers’ lobby, check-in areas, vehicle park and cafeteria.
The BIA development projects commenced in 2016.
The Minister said after completion of the projects, the BIA would conform more to international standards. They had identified the need for a second passenger terminal. Necessary steps are being taken in this regard too, he said. A special progress review meeting was also held under the Minister’s patronage on Friday.
