Mobile eye hospital to see the light soon

A mobile eye hospital will start soon under the guidance of former Health Services Director Dr. Palitha Mahipala. One million Sri Lankans have to undergo cataract surgeries in the next five years, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, the funds for the project were collected through fund raising events such as musical shows and bicycle races. Local private companies and NGOs have also donated funds for the project. The mobile eye hospital consists of high tech medical equipment and other facilities to conduct eye surgeries, the sources said. The mobile eye hospital will be used to perform cataract surgeries in rural hospitals under Vision 2020 Programme headed by Dr. Mahipala. The programme has conducted over 100,000 cataract surgeries free of charge and distributed over 300,000 free spectacles among needy schoolchildren, the sources said.
About one million Sri Lankans suffer from eye problems. The blindness of Sri Lankans is 1.7 percent. The main reason for the blindness in Sri Lankans is cataract, the sources added.
