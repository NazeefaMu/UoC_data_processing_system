Soldier trying  to get fresh  with girl  arrested

A soldier who tried to outrage the modesty of a school girl travelling in a Galle bound bus to attend a tuition class, was arrested by Galle Police yesterday.
Police said investigations revealed that the soldier seated on the bus next to the girl, had tried to feel parts of her body despite her objections.
After getting down from the bus, he had followed the girl and tried to be funny with her. The girl who was unable to prevent the advances made by the man, had quickly spoken to her tuition master on the mobile phone and informed him about her predicament.
The tuition master had instantly alerted the Police which arrived at the spot and apprehended the soldier.
Investigations are continuing.
