‘Singapore Convention Hall should be vested with government’

The Singapore Convention Hall at Siribopura, Hambantota should be vested with the government to make it more beneficial to the public, Hambantota District Parliamentarian Nihal Galappththy said. At present, it is managed by the D.A.Rajapaksa Foundation.
The Parliamentarian was addressing the Hambantota District Development Committee meeting held at the Hambantota Administration Complex recently presided over by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister MahindaAmaraweera and the Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa.
Galappththy said the hall remains closed and it is used only for wedding functions. He said the hall must be used for other functions as well for a nominal fee.
