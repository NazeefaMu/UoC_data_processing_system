Feast of St. Joseph today

The feast of St. Joseph, the Worker, will be celebrated today at Ja-ela, Kanuwana with the participation of the two newly-ordained Rev. Frs. L. D. Sanjeewa Appuhamy and W. Suraj Gayashan Pieris as chief celebrants.
The two newly-ordained to priesthood on April 29, had served the Kanuwana Parish Church as Deacons.
The Church also marks the 30th anniversary of being carved out and blessed as a new Parish in 1987 by Archbishop Emeritus Most Rev. Dr. Nicholas Marcus Fernando, with late Rev. Fr. D. S. Joseph Perera as the first Parish Priest of the new Mission.
The new Parish was created by taking Kanuwana area away from the Tudella Parish, that was part of the Mission since 1950s and by adding Vishakawatta church Community which formed a part of Ekala Parish.
