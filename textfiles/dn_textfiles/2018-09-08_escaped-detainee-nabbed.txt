A suspect who escaped from police in Kadugannawa, Kandy while being detained for questioning about possessing heroin, was caught again by Minipe-Hasalaka Police, in the Minipe Irrigation Development Zone.
The suspect escaped on August 8 while in detention.
He was caught following a tip-off to IP J. P. Chandana Nishanta that a suspicious person is roaming around in Hasalaka.
The suspect was sent to Kadugannawa Police through the Department of Prisons, after producing him before the Mahiyanganaya Court.
He is a resident of Minuwangama, Uda Dumbara, on the Kandy-Ampara/Batticaloa road, an officer of Minipe-Hasalaka Police said.
A police sergeant at Kadugannawa Police had been dismissed following the suspect’s escape.
