‘Glyphosate ban lifted only for tea, rubber’

The ban on glyphosate can only be lifted for tea and rubber plantations, the Health Ministry Spokesman yesterday said quoting Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
Minister Senaratne said Cabinet approval has been granted to lift the glyphosate ban only for the two plantations - tea and rubber.
Observing recent media reports on the glyphosate ban, Minister Senaratne had stated the Registrar of Pesticide cannot lift the glyphosate ban for all crops disregarding the Cabinet approval, the Spokesman said.
The gazette notification to rescind the order made under Section 11 of the Control of Pesticide Act No.33 of 1980 and published in Gazzette Extraordinary No. 1937/35 of October 23, 2015 was issued last Wednesday (11).
The 2015 gazette cancelled every licence issued in respect of pesticides containing glyphosate.
