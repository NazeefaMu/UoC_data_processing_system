Kusal Mendis’  century was the  turning point - Mathews

 
Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews credited young Kusal Mendis for his brilliant century (176) in the first Test at Pallekele for the series turnaround of his team that enabled them to complete a comprehensive 3-0 whitewash of the Australians at the SSC grounds yesterday.
After Sri Lanka was shot out for 117 in the first innings, Mendis’ knock in the second innings lifted the spirits of the team to go and complete a stunning 106-run win which was just the ideal tonic to dominate over Australia for the rest of the series.
“It was a great turn around. The key point was Kusal Mendis that was the turnaround for the whole series,” said an elated Mathews after laying his hands on the Warne-Muralitharan trophy for the first time.
“After getting all out for 117 at Pallekele it was a special effort by young Kusal Mendis getting us on track and to a winning track. From there on it really kicked off. The confidence levels were sky high. We worked very hard and actually we worked harder than the first two Tests ahead of the third Test as we were desperate to finish this series 3-0,” he said.
“The credit should go to all who supported us from SLC president to office bearers, the selectors for having the patience, the support staff and the team they were fantastic. Not to forget the fans. We have had a tough few months and we thank all of them.”
Mathews rated the win over Australia on par with the series victory they achieved in England two years ago.
“I would say that England and this series where we created history are marked very high. Those series wins are the standouts for me as captain so far. A captain is as good as the team. The credit should go to the team for their fantastic effort,” said Mathews. “As a team we played better cricket than Australia. Regardless of them having a bad record in Asia they are still the number one ranked team. To beat them it has to be a special effort and I can tell you we had to work really hard. They are going to come hard at us in the one-dayers.”
Mathews paid tribute to young players like Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva and Kusal Perera who made a big impact in the series.
“It's just pure talent. They have not played that many first-class games. Dhananjaya has but not Kusal. You have to take that chance with some players at some time. It paid off,” said Mathews. “You saw how they played in extreme conditions. It was turning square. They had Lyon and O'Keefe and then Mitchell Starc, who has been outstanding in the series. They are an outstanding lot and we have to work harder. The calmness and the composure shown by Dhananjaya batting at number seven was great. He handled pressure well. With Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera our future is bright.”
Paying a tribute to his match-winning bowler Rangana Herath, Mathews said, “He was fantastic. As I said at the post match interview, he was bowling off one leg. He got hit while batting and then he had a groin strain. He couldn't run and he couldn't jump. He was just landing the ball on one leg and he is unbelievable.
“He has taken 28 wickets in the series, one of the best I have seen. The batsmen are having a nightmare facing him no matter how well they play spin. Credit should go to this man. He has been a great team man as well.”
Mathews said that his team will be partying in a get-together organized by Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday night. “We will have a drink just after the press conf as well. It is unbelievable. The feeling is great.”
