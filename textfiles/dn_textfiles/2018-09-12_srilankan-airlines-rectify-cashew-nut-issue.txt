SriLankan Airlines to  rectify cashew nut issue

SriLankan Airlines management has taken steps to rectify the issue where President Maithripala Sirisena was served with some Cashew nuts which were not fit for human consumption.
Speaking at an event held in Hambantota on Monday, the President said that SriLankan Airlines served him Cashew nuts, while travelling from Kathmandu to Colombo via New Delhi, but, he simply could not eat the poor quality cashew.
“Who authorised the purchase of these Cashew nuts which no human being can eat; even a dog will not eat this,” the President said.
