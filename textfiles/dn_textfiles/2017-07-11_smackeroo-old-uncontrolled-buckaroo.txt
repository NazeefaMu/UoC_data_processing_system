Smackeroo for an old uncontrolled Buckaroo!

I never imaginedthat the mention of my birthday on Wednesday the fifth of July would evoke such a huge response. Being a rather modest scribbler I would never have contemplated that my name had become a household word among so many readers. That would have been a laugh as far as I am concerned. My name isn't even a household word in my own home!
As age sneaks up on me, sure I get older and also bolder. After all I have nothing to lose on the final lap of life. When I was an adolescent my mother used to tell me to act my age. My father wanted me to act older. Now, as a baby boomer, I would like to act any age I want to.
As you see, I have been subjected to conflicting parental advice, not all of it bad, but conflicting nonetheless. As we are all aware, adolescence is that period in your life when parents become more difficult. To make my point clearer, my mother fretfully thought that I was darn too precocious for my tender years.
Now I am not saying she considered me among the intellectually gifted child freaks of the time. Far from it. But she seemed to believe that I was developmentally advanced in language and thought. You know what I mean. It is the kind of adolescent mindset that defies classification, where grown-up ideas and ambition coexist with childish will and bravado.
My father’s perception of my frame of mind was altogether different. He wanted me to be wise beyond my years and stop playing the role of the insufferable wise guy. My Dad accused me of being impertinent when I told him that: “Boys will be boys and so will a lot of middle-aged men”.
Imagine the ridiculousness of having an old head on your young shoulders. Now some 50 years later I enjoy the prospect of having a young head firmly placed on my ageing shoulders. But then again here is where the trouble begins. As an older guy, I am expected to be quiet, stay in the background and stop being my old, or is it young rambunctious self? Being blessed with youthful energy and exuberance I am having some difficulty fitting into this unaccustomed role.
The older I grow the more I distrust the familiar doctrine that age brings wisdom. Setting an example for your children and grand children takes all the fun out of ageing. It is not that I am a sky-diver, sword-swallower or fire-limbo dancer, but I am not ready to be consigned to the ‘haansi putuwa’ or old aunt Nino’s rocker on the verandah.
Oh no! No not me. You will still see me sliding down the banister of life while praying and muttering every ‘gaatha’ that all the splinters are pointed the other way. Having said that, I think it would also be apt to remind you of the old adage that there’s no fool like an old fool, except of course a young fool, which I still long to be.
But the young fool has first to grow up to be an old fool to realise what a darn fool he was when he was young. Which leads us to the logical conclusion that life is certainly an ‘All Fools’ paradise in Sri Lanka.
For all of us, old age is the awkward period when Father Time starts catching up with Mother Nature. And of course there is nowhere to run. Certainly, some men talk of killing time, not realising that it is time that quietly kills them.
Many of you who claim to be of my vintage need not worry about avoiding temptation as you grow older. That is because temptation starts avoiding you. I for one have never stopped believing in the apt axiom: ‘You don’t stop playing when you grow old. You only grow old when you stop playing!’
Now look, we all did silly things when we were young. Some of us still do. You don’t have to blatantly court disaster but then a few risks are permissible if you have to ‘live your dream.’ Ah yes, and most of my dreams are in technicolour.
And when you dream in colour, it’s not just a pigment of your imagination. In addition, I am not the type to begin lusting after my lost youth when mine was mostly misspent enjoying a life with a crazy immoderation and writing what I like. Two things I’m pretty darn good at, even if I do say so myself. As you can see I am still enjoying this privileged lifestyle while retaining my youthful spirit and debonair air.
What’s more, as we are all aware, age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter. And even if you do there is nothing you can do about it. I like the way my childhood friend Barbara, the ‘Dowager Duchess’, the widow of four husbands put it: “ It’s not the men in your life that count, it’s the life in your men.”
But there are times when the shadow of old age can lurk up on you in the manifestation of people who claim to be your age, in particular your decrepit former schoolmates. And before you know it, you wonder whether you have been transformed into those mirrored reflections of the golden age of geriatrics. They may have been my schoolmates but I tell you I’m too young to be this old!
Wrinkled? Who me? No it’s something other old fogeys have similar to my character lines. Besides, age imprints more wrinkles in the mind than it does on the face.
For all you conventional oldsters and unadventurous young punks out there I believe it would be a capital idea to take me as an example of an age-appropriate role model. I really don’t know about you but at three score and something more I still live life to the fullest. You see moderation can be a fatal thing. So why rein in your impulses when they are rarin’ to go. Nothing succeeds like excess.
Come on. Chappies, do it my way. Life is too short for regrets and recriminations. Just do what you like doing best regardless of the calendar. Now that would be really acting your age!
I appreciate your warm birthday wishes and specially those stunning ‘smackeroo’ kisses for an old, bold and uncontrolled buckaroo. I really appreciate it so much from the bottom of my heart and the bottom of my whisky glass.
