[APPRECIATIONS - (14-08-2017)]

Chandrakala Ratnayake
She was a strong-willed woman
Three months ago, on May 12, at around 1.05 pm, my beloved mother departed this world after fighting an ailment that persisted for three months. Even after three months of her passing, her abrupt leave-taking from life continues to be an unacceptable, indescribable, atypical feeling in my life. The only consolation of my mother’s unanticipated demise that I bear in my heart is the fact that the duration of her anguish was minimal.
Over the last three months of ammi’s life, the extent of emotional suffering my father Ananda Ratnayake and I underwent, along with my mother’s closest relatives, cannot be woven into mere words. Likewise, it was even the more startling to witness such a strong-willed woman, who was once robust, courageous and good-looking, bearing void of complaint, all the complications involved with an ailment of the nature. Yet, what amazed me the most was the fact that she did not give up until her very last breath, in the Kurunegala hospital’s coronary care unit. That was after undergoing treatment in the hospital’s oncology unit for two months. The last two beings her deteriorating eyes perceived from her deathbed merely before her very last breath, were that of mine; her only child and that of her much-adored brother Harischandra. “Life breaks everyone, but some people heal stronger in the breaks,” they say and my mother was one of those who healed stronger in the breaks.
My mother lived a complete and dynamic life. Amongst the seven siblings of the Senanayake family from Kurunegala, she was the fourth. Having obtained her education from Maliyadeva Girls’ College in Kurunegala, she joined the Hayleys Group back in the 1960’s, where she served for nine years. While in school and in later years, she played basketball under the guidance of All-India Basketball Coach P. Chelladurai, and also represented St. Anne’s College, Kurunegala in a trainee camp held in St. Anthony’s College Courts in Katugastota back in the 1960’s. After tying the knot with my father in 1973, she pursued a career at Marhaba Travels in Sharjah, U.A.E., where she served for several years before returning to Sri Lanka. Later in her life, she lived with me in California, U.S.A. and in Sri Lanka until her passing.
Ammi was divergent in every possible way from her siblings and all others in her family circle and friends. When her three sisters who served as teachers wore sarees, ammi chose mini-skirts and slacks over the traditional Sri Lankan attire. She always pursued for the finest, even in trivial entities. Having been the detailed, oriented person she was, everything had to be well-defined and clear-cut to earn her acceptance, or else, entities were rejected unswervingly. She dressed uniquely and matching jewellery was a key. All her jewellery sets, handbags and shoes that matched her elegant attire, now deposited in her almirah brings back memories of her unique attendances and unforgettable appearances during her life and times. She always kept the ball rolling and at functions, she illuminated the table with her chuckle and adorable smile.
She loved me dearly, regardless of the mother-daughter disagreements in various matters; a common domestic scenario. Even all the lovely verses in the entire universe knitted into a single tapestry shall still not explain the boundless feeling I hold in my chest, with every passing day of her absenteeism. Ammi, I love you and I always will!

Peter Casie Chetty
A loveable rogue
It is with sadness that I report the passing away of Peter Casie Chetty aka Peter Christie. He had not answered his phone for a couple of days when his sister Rachel had rung him. So she had a friend check up on him and found that Peter had passed away in his sleep. Peter rang me on Wednesday, this week at about 11:30 am Melbourne time, which came as a surprise as it was 3:30 am in Manchester, UK. His death comes as quite a shock to me though I am grateful he passed away in his sleep and his soul is resting peacefully.
We had a long chat and he told me that recently he had been having a number of falls due to his neuropathy in his feet due to Diabetes. He was also labouring in his speech and rang me to apologise for the recent spate of emails on the subject of 'Blazer fabric.'
Peter was a loveable rogue who expressed his views without fear or fervour in a colourful language unbecoming of a gentleman. But that was Peter. Love him or hate him for his caustic views on the Church, religion and the pretentious people in our society, he always spoke his mind.
Some of us were offended by his commentary on various subjects and elected to reject his emails. But I know that deep within his soul was a kind and generous person; but a troubled man whose character had been moulded by his life experiences.
The voice of the Wesleyite alumni community is finally silent. He will be missed. His body will be cremated in the UK and his ashes will be interred in Sri Lanka.
May the road rise up to meet you.
May the wind be always at your back.
May the sun shine warm upon your face,
The rain fall soft upon your fields.
And until we meet again,
May God hold you in the palm of his hand.
Rest peacefully my dear friend.
Ora et Labora

Prof. Piyadasa Ranasinghe
He provided an exemplary service
Professor Piyadasa Ranasinghe, who served as a Senior Professor in the Department of Library and Information Science at the University of Kelaniya, passed away on August 4, 2016 and this small comment is given in memory of his enormous academic and personal contribution to society. The demise of this learnt gentleman is a great loss for the country, especially for the Library and Information Science community of Sri Lanka. His contribution to society can be illustrated in many ways.
On October 10, 1949, he was born in Tabbowa, Puttalam, a typical village. There, he grew up and learnt not only his primary education, but eco-friendly living as well. Once he said that he assigned particular names for the trees and animals living in the suburban jungles whenever he used to visit. This particular behaviour must have supported Professor Ranasinghe to have a balanced education and growth during his life. Behaviour and habitation in such type of a natural environment must have nourished his competence in languages like Sinhala, English, Pali and Sanskrit. He received his primary education at Tambapanni Vidyalaya, Tabbowa, in 1953 and his secondary education at Delgoda Kalyana Pradeepa Pirivena in 1965. In 1967, he entered Vidyalankara University and earned a BA honours degree in Sinhala and received his Master's Degree in Library and Information Science at the University of New South Wales, Australia in 1994.
He then join as an Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Sinhala at the University of Kelaniya in 1971. Later, he served as an assistant editor at the office of Sinhala Dictionary, where he associated with people like Prof. D.E. Hettiarachchi. Later, him joining the university library service as an Assistant Librarian at Sri Jayawardenepura University in 1979, was a milestone in his life.
He made an exemplary contribution in serving as an acting Librarian at the University of Kelaniya, the founder Librarian at the Rajarata University of Sri Lanka, Head of the Department of Library and Information Science and its Professor, Senior Professor, former President of Sri Lanka Library Association, ex-Director of Yakkala Ayurveda Institute attached to University of Kelaniya and founder director of Palm Leaf Manuscript Study and Research Library at the University of Kelaniya. Prof. Piyadasa Ranasinghe has authored several comprehensive books on library and information science and they are used as masterpieces of the subject by many students as well as scholars. We appreciate his family by remembering and honouring their very closest relative, erudite scholar, teacher for a many like us, beloved brother and sincere colleague of all.
May he attain Nibbana!

D.I.G. Lalith Gunasekera
A pragmatic officer
I first met Lalith Gunasekera in 1965 when I was serving at the Badulla Police Headquarters as a young Sub-Inspector just passed out from the Police College at Kalutara. He was two batches senior to me enlisted in 1963, albeit we both were Probationary Sub-Inspectors attached to the Crime Branch. This was the beginning of our friendship. We developed a very close friendship which lasted up to the time of his passing away on the night of August 5, after a brief illness.
In 1967, I succeeded him at the Lunugala Police station as the Officer-in-charge and he was transferred to the Wellawaya Police Station which was graded higher than Lunugala. He got married to Dayanthie in 1969 whilst serving at Wellawaya and I was his best man. He always professed that his best man was not confined to the wedding photograph as that of many people. I was with him during his bad and the good times and was not a fair-weather friend.
Having served as the officer-in-charge of several police stations, he was promoted to the rank of A.S.P. in 1983, S.P. in 1989, Senior S.P. in 1994, and D.I.G. in 2002. During his tenure of office as Director at the Police College in Kalutara, he extended his fullest cooperation to me to train a batch of Sub-Inspectors and Police Constables directly recruited to the National Intelligence Bureau(NIB) presently known as the State Intelligence Service. I was the Director of the NIB, functioning under Secretary/Ministry of Defence.
He was a strict disciplinarian best-suited for the post of Director at the Police College responsible for the training and moulding recruits for all ranks before they are passed out to maintain law and order in the country. He was also the Chief Lecturer at the Police College before he was appointed as the Director. It was a charming and winsome sight to see him on horseback, taking the salute at the Aluwihare Parade ground at the Police College.
He always maintained humane qualities like simplicity and humility and was constantly and consistently pragmatic and practical in his approach to the problems he faced with during his Police career. He was willing to seek out and accept solutions whenever they could be found, even from his subordinates. He could think clearly, logically and incisively.
He was one of the polished, persuasive and hard-working police officers whose methodical and meticulous preparation of the work or task entrusted to him, was an exercise in unbounded patience, total dedication and maximum assistance to people, his subordinates and friends. In fact, he discharged his duties and responsibilities with unsurpassed distinction and unsullied honour.
He was, by any standard, an exceptional Police Officer. An attribute he realised in ample measure throughout his career was a sense of absolute commitment to any task he was entrusted with. He was content with nothing less than perfection and devoted himself in his own quiet and unobtrusive way to attain that standard.
His time was spent generously at the disposal of any friend who stood in need of his help or support. This was one constant characteristic which was shown through the whole of his career in the Police and in his personal life. The courage of his conviction and the firm refusal to compromise on what he believed in, was an area in which Lalith showed unremitting rigour.
In the year 2000, he was selected for an assignment to serve in East Timor for the United Nations peacekeeping force as Head of Academics for the East Timor Lorosa’e Police Training College. He significantly contributed to the United Nations Transitional Administration’s mandate in East Timor.
Police Commissioner in East Timor commended his Law Enforcement Management skills and his efforts produced the finest and most disciplined officers in East Timor.
Lalith always professed with great pride that ours is among the noblest professions. It had always been regarded with great respect and even reverence. But, we have to note with sadness that this one-time revered image of the Police Force is today much tarnished with the arrests of Police officers, including Senior D.I.G. , D.I.G.G. , Senior Officers, for grave crimes.
It must therefore, be the responsibility of the I.G.P. and all Senior Officers to purify the image of the Police Force of whatever blemishes that have tarnished the one-time glorious image.
He liked spending his weekends and holidays whenever he could, joining our family and our close friends on trips to Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Nuwara Eliya, Wakarai and Beruwela. We enjoyed his company and interesting stories during his days as the OIC of Police Stations. During one of our visits to Nuwara Eliya, he held the floor from the time we left Colombo, relating stories up until we reached NuwaraEliya. One of our friends asked me whether Lalith had swallowed a tape-recorder and come.
My two sons Suren and Sajith are great admirers of Lalith and they treated him like our own family member. Sajith, who was a State Counsel at the Attorney General’s Department, wrote an essay on Lalith when he was in Grade 5, as he was a legend to him. Lalith’s wife Danyathie always calls me the twin brother of Lalith; our two families maintained a very close relationship and my wife Kamani treats Dayanthis as her own sister. The Ceremonial Police Funeral accorded to Rtd. D.I.G. Lalith Gunasekera by the Police Force with the presence of the I.G.P. Pujith Jayasundara, was a fitting tribute to the honourable Police Officer who brought so much credit and honour to the Police Force. I, with several serving and retired Senior Police Officers, went up to the IGP after the funeral and expressed our gratitude and thanked him for the inclusion of a firing party and the full Police band for the ceremony.
The large gathering at Borella cemetery on August 9 was a clear testimony of the respect given to late D.I.G. Lalith Gunasekera by all Police officers both serving and retired, Senior Government Officials, his friends and relations.
In the midst of life’s challenges and upheavals, Lalith’s close friendship will ever remain for me and my family, a shining memory.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!

Commander Suraj Ahamed
A committed man
The late Commander Suraj Ahamed (Retd. SLN), endearingly known as 'Bunny' amongst family and friends, left us all grieving on August 16, last year. A much-loved, adored and admired personality, he was the fifth in a family of seven siblings (a sister died very young), but was the first to go to that land beyond. This Maristonian was the holder of a B.Sc degree from the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya Campus. He and my spouse Anver, who did a Chemistry honours degree, passed-out together in the same year.
Immediately after graduation, he had a short spell teaching at my old school Ave Maria Convent, Negombo. The handsome guy that he was, he was quite a 'heart-throb' and had many silent admirers. He subsequently joined the Sri Lanka Navy as a Commissioned Officer and was sent to Valsura, India, for intensive training in Electrical Engineering.
The Naval Headquarters in Dockyard, Trincomalee, where his wife Rehanie and he moved to after marriage, had an excellent ambiance and was a popular holiday home for us. Bunny and Rehanie's warm hospitality was legendary and we always had an open invitation to their beautiful bungalow overlooking the ocean.
Many still recall the wonderful times they had. He retired prematurely to take a posting at the American Naval Base in Midway Islands. On his return to the island, the Navy recalled him to revamp and strengthen the Artificer Training course, which bears testimony to his dedication and commitment.
Bunny was a voracious reader, a lover of music and had a good singing voice. He was passionate about gardening and kept an immaculate lawn. Even during his illness, he derived a lot of joy spending hours tending to his plants. As kids, the three youngest siblings; he, Ronnie and myself, got on famously and were up to all kinds of mischief.
Although the Doctors gave him only six months, for five long years he fought a tough battle with courage and determination. His dedicated wife Rehanie stood beside him like a rock, nursing him and showering a lot of love. His illness drew me very close to him.
Whenever he visited the doctor, he would always keep me updated, giving even the minutest detail, and discussing the pros and cons of the course of treatment.
Together, the family fought a trying battle and finally had to let go with wrenching hearts. When he finally breathed his last, his older brothers Aniff and Selwyn were by his side, praying and easing his departure.
He leaves his beloved wife Rehanie, loving sons Nirfaan and Imraan, daughters-in-law Krisha and Sabeena and an adorable grand daughter, Alina.
