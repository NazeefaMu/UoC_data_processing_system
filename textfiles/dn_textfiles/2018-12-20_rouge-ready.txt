ROUGE ready!

Festive season, the busiest time of the year with countless events and parties, has arrived! With Christmas just around the corner and the New Year too looming ahead it is a good time to start thinking about your party looks and makeup kits that will help to make you sparkle all through it.
 
 Attire for the season 
Colours like red, green dull gold and silver always makes things so much more Christmas-like, and it’s a great pick-me-up as well for this season. A red shoe, a scarf or a necklace is all you need to dress with holiday spirit. Or go all out in a red satin sheath dress or sparkly red cocktail dress.
For a more casual holiday gathering, a satin wrap top is the perfect choice when you want to be festive but not too dressy.
A three-strap, cutout detail in a classic V-neck top creates a stylish, asymmetrical effect. Wear this for your office holiday lunch or out for cocktails with the girls. For casual holiday outings, a cross body bag will keep everything in its proper place with plenty of interior organization. 
 
Festive make up 
They say the festive season is the most wonderful time of the year, and that’s especially the case when it comes to your beauty routine. If ever there’s a time to experiment with sparkling eyes, bold lips, and a major glow, the holiday party circuit is certainly it. Take inspiration from Instagram and start practicing the flick of your wrist for your cat-eye and get searching for your shade of new berry coloured lipstick.
 
Trendy looks for a diva 
Matte red lips and winged liner: A few things are as timeless and classic as a winged liner-red lip combo. If you love being the life of the holiday party, go full out with a red glitter lips. To recreate an eye-catching pout, swipe a red lip color over your mouth and then top it with superfine, crimson-coloured glitter.
Define the outside corners of your eyes with a black kohl liner, then use a blending brush and black eye shadow to smudge it out for a smokier cat-eyed look. Use your finger to dab a gold, glittery shadow on the middle of your eyelids and the inner corners for the finishing touch.
If normal holiday colours aren’t your thing, try copper and bronze shades instead.
 
Hair styles that are in this season 
Holiday hair doesn’t have to involve sparkly pins and headbands but that’s half the fun. There are plenty of simple party-ready styles out there.
When you want unfussy, not-trying-too-hard hair with subtle volume at the crown, a loose, looped knot at the nape of the neck works best.
Crown braid is one of those effortlessly elegant updos that says stylish, not stuffy.
The best part about half-up hair is that you only need to worry about the bottom. Secure the top center section of your crown into a miniature bun, then take a curling rod to the rest.
 
Accessorize your nails 
It’s not the most innovative nail art idea ever but a punchy Christmas red goes with everything.Chrome nails too will never get old.
The easiest way to inject a little festive shimmer into any ensemble is to don holographic silver nails which are in vogue right now.
Give your regular French manicure a festive update with taupe nails and silver glitter tips.
Get your Christmas nail art on with rose gold and black glitter ombré.
 
Handy hints for socialites 
From sequin dresses to velvet jumpsuits, there isn’t one right way to do Christmas or New Year’s Eve in style. You can find something fun and sparkly or give your go-to LBD a jumpstart with a new pair of over-the-knee boots or floral pumps. No matter what path you take, the point is not to hold back.

Tips to choose your  festive accessories 
In most situations, choosing jewelry and accessories is mostly a matter of finding pieces you love and pairing them with the right clothing. However, selecting holiday jewelry can be a little more complicated. For one thing, the selection of seasonal jewelry is huge and constantly expanding. You’ll find everything from coordinated necklace and earring sets to novelty items like themed pins and necklaces. All these choices make shopping fun, but so many options can also make it challenging to figure out how to wear these pieces. These guidelines will help you figure out how to incorporate holiday jewelry into your look.
 
Know your style 
Your everyday style generally reflects your personality, so if you get to zealous with the holiday pieces, you may feel uncomfortable.
 
Consider the occasion 
The type of occasion should be a factor in choosing any type of jewelry, and this is just as important during the holidays. Even if a piece has a holiday theme, it may not be appropriate for your event. For example, avoid wearing flashy Christmas buttons and brooches to a dressy cocktail party.
 
Less is more 
When it comes to holiday jewelry, it’s easy to get carried away and end up looking like a Christmas tree. One way to prevent this fashion disaster is to remember that less is more. You want each item to attract attention, not blend in to create a cluttered appearance.
