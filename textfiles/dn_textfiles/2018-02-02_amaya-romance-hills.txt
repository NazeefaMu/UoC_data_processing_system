Amaya 'romance' up in the hills

The F&B team has laid out a unique dinner menu just for February 14 at Amaya Hills Kandy followed by a dance at the one and only Le Garage Club. The Dumbara Bar will serve up a variety of Valentine's cocktails from 6:00pm to 7:00pm so make sure not to miss out them.
The Pool Terrace will be all decked up and ready with a Violinist to set the romantic mood for all the happy couples. Two glasses of sparkling wine, a rose for the lovely lady and special gift for the gentleman await as they dine with Amaya Hills.
Soon after dinner, couples can head to Le Garage to continue their night of romance and groove to some the best hits of today.
