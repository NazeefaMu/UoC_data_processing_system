WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY ABOUT OUR CRUSHING WIN OVER AUSTRALIA

Roshan Mahanama (former Sri Lanka Test cricketer and ICC Match Referee)
We have shown the world what we can do. It’s a clear indication that we cannot be taken lightly and that we cannot be just written off. It’s a young team and to beat the Aussies in this manner is a great achievement. It is also good for the Aussies to have a taste of their own medicine. We don’t one or two teams dominating cricket and this win by Sri Lanka is good for the sport and makes the competition healthy. No one expected this young inexperienced side to turn things around like this I am very proud of them.
Michael Tissera (former Sri Lanka captain and manager)
It is quite an unbelievable performance. To tell you quite frankly I didn’t expect this result. The fellows have played brilliantly and a lot of the credit should go to Kusal Mendis for his 176 that turned the whole series. In that game nobody else got a fifty on either side from thereon we just took the upper hand and our fellows bowled brilliantly I thought. Great win. I have never seen an Australian or any international side who was so bad against spin they just didn’t have a clue. It will take another year or so we can’t judge the team just on this series they are going to South Africa we’ll see how they fare there, but I feel that a lot of the youngsters have the talent if they are handled properly. In a year’s time we should be a very good side.
Ana Punchihewa (former SLC president when Sri Lanka won 1996 World Cup)
‘The best performance we had in Test match, the first was when we won a Test abroad. This win should rank among our top three. At least we showed we have come to the party at last. We have shown we have the talent and with our under 19 cricketers also performing well in England at least we have made the pathway to get there. It’s a great performance and all credit should go to the cricketers who performed under difficult circumstances, hats off to them and the SLC officials.
Lalith Kaluperuma (former Sri Lanka Test cricketer and selector)
It’s a great win. To beat the world number one side is one helluva achievement. We were in bad positions several times but we managed to overcome them. That shows the talent of our cricketers. Good to see the youngsters improving fast and displaying their talents in difficult conditions. The standout players for me were Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva with Rangana Herath bowling superbly at this age, his main weapon was his accuracy.
David Heyn (former Sri Lanka cricketer)
The guy who impressed me most was Dhananjaya (de Silva) he was fantastic a 24-year-old he was sort of not concentrating fully on his debut in Pallekele and where he came to the fore was at the SSC. He seems to have so much time he doesn’t sort of go right forward but waits for the ball. With Kusal Mendis, Chandimal coming through, Angelo can always get runs and with Dhananjaya and Kusal Perera we got a good batting line up with the two openers which is something they got to look and a very good side to go forward on subcontinent wickets can give India, Pakistan and Bangladesh a bloody good run. Good test to see how they perform in Australia and South Africa. The first test for this new side will be in South Africa. I am highly impressed with all those guys. It was not impossible conditions we had if you go through the past Australian sides they have performed well in Sri Lanka we had other sides also doing well. In a nutshell this Australian side did not have a good enough technique to play spin.
Ranjith Fernando (former Sri Lanka cricketer, manager and commentator)
To me it was either our best effort as a team if not the best no question about it. Absolutely over the moon with the way the young fellows have not only performed but I found that guys like Dhananjaya and Kusal Mendis they have a type of swagger of their own and there is an air of confidence I haven’t seen in a lot of players in a long time. The main thing is that Sri Lanka’s domestic cricket is not dead and our under 19 cricket has not deteriorated as a lot of people have been saying. These fellows have come through the under 19 system. To me Australia is not that they can’t play spin but they have ingrained in them over the years that they can’t play spin and now they have come to a stage that they really cannot play spin. They don’t have the confidence. This is the same things that people our saying about our cricket. Once people start believing it, to get them out of it is very difficult. Next year is going to be the tough years because the opposition will get to know the newcomers but this performance is absolutely brilliant no question about it. I am sort of short for words to describe it. Credit should go to Mathews and also coach Graham Ford.
