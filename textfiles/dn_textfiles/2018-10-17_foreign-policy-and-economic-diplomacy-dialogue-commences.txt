Foreign Policy and Economic Diplomacy Dialogue commences

The Sri Lanka Foreign Policy and Economic Diplomacy Dialogue, organised by the Foreign Affairs Ministry, commenced on Monday with the participation of mid-career diplomats from 23 countries from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Australasia.
The two-week long programme is held as part of the Economic Diplomacy Programme (EDP) of the Foreign Ministry and will primarily focus on Sri Lanka’s Economy, with special emphasis on its emergence as a ‘Hub of the Indian Ocean’ and as a trade, investment, and tourist destination, while showcasing Sri Lanka’s international brands, entrepreneurship, as well as important strides in research and innovation.
It will also explore Sri Lanka’s history and culture, aspects of foreign policy including positions on international politics, and thematic issues: good governance, sustainable development, and right to information, social media and cyber security. Sri Lanka’s key government officials, academics, scientists, and business leaders will participate in the discussions, and a three-day field visit will follow.
At the commencement of the session, the participants called on Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana, who welcomed them and wished them a productive and enjoyable stay in Sri Lanka.
State Foreign Affairs Minister Vasantha Senanayake, who inaugurated the Dialogue, said Sri Lanka had always been a melting pot of diverse cultures and ethnicities as well as different religions, and its strategic geographical location had made it a unique international player since ancient times.
Outlining the trajectory of Sri Lanka’s foreign relations and the challenges the country has faced through history, he said Sri Lanka was well-positioned to be a knowledge centre for international relations. In their interactions with each other and their Sri Lankan counterparts, he encouraged the visiting diplomats to be forward-looking and to collectively seek to anticipate future trends and how to deal with them, in the region and the world.
Acting Foreign Secretary Ravinatha Aryasinha said their presence was a reflection of the importance their respective governments placed on relations with Sri Lanka. He expressed confidence that through this Dialogue, Sri Lanka will not only be informing them about how Sri Lanka is straddling the many politico-economic and social challenges of our times, but that in turn would also be informed of the perspectives their respective countries and regions have on each of these subjects. He said their remaining engaged with Sri Lanka—both professionally and personally—would be a tremendous support to the efforts by our respective Missions in or accredited to their capitals, as they seek to strengthen bilateral relations between the countries. Under the EDP, having analysed patterns of recent economic flows and the potential within each target market, the Foreign Ministry has set specific performance targets to be accomplished on exports, investment, tourism and foreign employment for each Mission.
In collaboration with the relevant line ministries and the private sector, 10 Sri Lanka Missions abroad in emerging markets are being supported in carrying out targeted campaigns that would enhance Sri Lanka’s global footprint and bring tangible economic benefits to Sri Lanka.
Projects are being initiated to promote ICT products and services and also organic food products in Sweden, apparel, textile and footwear in South Africa, fresh and processed food in Bahrain, gems and jewellery in Turkey, spices and apparel in Brazil, wellness tourism in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), inward investment from South Korea and Japan, and outward investment in Myanmar and Nepal.
State Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Grace Asirwatham and Additional Bilateral Affairs Secretary Sumith Nakandala were also present at the inaugural session. The programme is being conducted in collaboration with the Bandaranaike International Diplomatic Training Institute (BIDTI) and the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute (LKI). LKI’s Executive Director Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja delivered the inaugural lecture on ‘The evolving Asian Economic Outlook and implications for Sri Lanka’, while BIDTI Director-General Pamela J. Deen and Foreign Ministry International and Technical Cooperation Director Kapila Fonseka also addressed the participants.
