Duminda Silva pleads guilty to non-declaration of assets

 
Former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva plead guilty today to allegations filed against him for non-declaration of assets and liabilities.
He was fined R.s 3, 000 by the Colombo Additional Magistrate.
The Bribery Commission had alleged that the former parliamentarian had failed to declare his assets and liabilities in accordance with the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975, for a period of three years since 2011 to 2013.
Duminda Silva is currently serving a death sentence for the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra.
