 The veteran athlete couple from Kuruwita in Ratnapura district, K.G.G. Menike and R. A. Chandradasa once again created history by setting up two new meet records during the recently concluded fourth Masters' Athletics Championship at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium, Diyagama.
The Sri Lanka Masters' Athletic Association conducted the event as a selection trial for the forthcoming 20th Asian Masters' Athletics Championship in China.
Menike won a triple crown in all three participated events with a new meet record of 16.1 seconds in 65-70 age category 100metres, erasing her own previous record of 16.8 seconds set up in last year. She also won the same age category 200m gold and clinched her third gold in 5km race walk. Menike has an illustrious Master's athletic career and was named as the 'Golden Lady of the Meet' by Hindu news paper when she became the only women athlete to win six gold medals (100m, 200m, 80m hurdles, 300m hurdles, 4x100 relay and 4x 400 relay) at the 2006 Asian Masters' Athletics Championship in India.
Her husband, Chandradasa competing in the 75-80 age category toppled a seven-year-old meet record in 80m hurdles event with a timing of 19.1 seconds. The previous record of 19.3 seconds was established by R. A. Gunasekara in 2010. Chandradasa also won the silver medal of 200m and went on to grab the bronze medal in 100m event.
As an appreciation and encouragement for Menike's sporting excellence, Sabaragamuwa Province
Social Welfare, Probation and Child Protection, Rural Development and Rural Industries Minister Ranjith Bandara presented a spikes shoes pair to her during a felicitation ceremony at his office recently.
The sad part of the story is that even though the veteran husband and wife qualified for the Asian event in China with their record braking performances, both will not included in the national squad for China due to financial constrains.
"We are sure of bringing glory to motherland if compete in China, but we couldn't find sponsors to cover the tour expenses and missed the July 10 deadline to submit entries for Asian event. We have missed many international events due to the same reason over the years and quiet used to it now. Both of us shown a constant career progress, but as we are from a rural area with no connections to wealthy sponsors, we rarely get a chance to shine in international scene, " the couple explained. Chandradas and Menike are the oldest active Lankan athlete couple and has a sports museum, named 'Javana' at their residence showcasing trophies, cups and memorabilia of their long sporting careers.
Chandradasa said that the Sabaragamuwa Province Sports Ministry has allocated a land to construct a new building for the 'Javana' museum, but the construction work has stranded after laying of the foundation stone.
"Our house is very small and congested, so can be harmful to valuable memorabilia. We do not want to spend money on foreign tours, but will be very grateful if some one help to build the museum. Our only dream is to see the 'Javana' museum in a new proper premises, before one of us die," he revealed.
