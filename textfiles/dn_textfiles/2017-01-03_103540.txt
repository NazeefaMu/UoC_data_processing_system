Just chill out!

Music and acting has always been a part of his life. The nickname Thilanka Vidusha says that the nickname 'Chillie' has been his lucky charm.
His songs 'Obagen Tharam' and 'Mage Sitha Ridawa' topped the charts recently. He has also ventured into the acting arena and had acted in several movies. A few of his films are ready to be released in theaters soon. He hopes to begin work on a new movie next year and is composing a some new songs as well. 
Q: What is your take on criticism?
A: I have been in this field for a long span now. As artistes we get bouquets as well as brickbats. That is the nature of this profession. We too are human beings and can make mistakes. I have been praised for my work at one time. The next instance I get criticized for something. This is the price of fame. I have learnt to face such situations by now.
We too are human beings and we can become emotional when we are faced with various situations. Since we are public figures whatever we do get highlighted in the society.
Q: We hardly see you acting now.
A: There are several films due to be released. They have been on queue at theaters for some time. There are ongoing discussions for a new movie too. I am not into teledramas especially because of the time factor. That is why I am not constantly seen on screen.
Q: Describe your music style. 
A: My music is a mixture of Sri Lankan tunes and modern RnB. It used to be quite westernized when I stepped into the industry but now I have Lankanized my music a lot more to suit the modern music enthusiasts' tastes. Now it is more towards the classical side. I am a pop singer as well. 'Heena Tahataketa' became immensely popular because I moved away from my usual style.
Dancing is also a part of my act. This coupled with my singing is my success formula.
Q: What is the best and worst thing about being Chillie?
A: (Laughs) There is more of the best than the worst... The best thing is that there are many people who are not known to me who love me immensely. They feel sad for me if I face some misfortune and also cry on behalf of me. I believe that they began to adore me not only because of my songs but also because of the way I behave. They would sacrifice a lot for me.
The worst thing is that you are consistently on the hot seat because you are a public figure. Since my fans love me so much they also notice my faults. They forget that I am also a normal human being like them. They keep judging me and this can be hurtful.
I am a simple human being. I have built a lifestyle which is convenient for myself. Though I engage in acting and singing I do not let these hamper my freedom. I take criticism in a positive manner and try to amend my faults.
There are also some who cannot reach the position that I am in the field today. Such people tend to act out of jealousy. Some follow me and try to be like me too. It is nice to be admired but it is best to make your own mark by absorbing the positive qualities of the people you admire. I have had idols but I am above them now.
Q: Who is your role model?
A: There is no such person at the moment. I used to admire Bollyowood stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Hollywood actors like Russell Crowe, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio while I was schooling but I never tried to make myself be like them. Chilie is his own person. I do not want to become an imprint of another!
Q: Are you an outdoor person or an indoor person?
A: Though I have to spend a lot of time outdoors my heart is at home with my family. I love spending whatever free time I have with them. I also love to spend time alone by myself. I would either read a book or watch a movie then. I am also a good planner. I plan everything before stepping out of the house.
Q: If you could give life to any historic character in a film, who would you like to portray?
A: Gosh. That question needs some thought... (Thinking hard for a few minutes) I would love to give life to the Indian emperor Ashoka. He was one of the most powerful rulers in history but he gave it all up and took up Buddhism. That was quite a selfless act because he dedicated himself to popularizing Buddhism later. He was also a fearless warrior.
Q: What was your worst experience on stage?
A: (Laughing) There are quite a few instances. I have lost my voice on stage a couple of times. I once fell on stage during an act. However such moments cannot keep me down. I was back on my feet and performing again. Since we perform at late night shows we lose sleep so all this happen due to that reason.
Q: What is your favourite and least favourite food?
A: I love tasting new dishes from other countries. My favourite is the Thai cuisine. I am also a great fan of biryani. I love food but can control my appetite without any difficulties. (Laughs) I am not into sweet stuff much though.
Q: Three things you cannot do without.
A: Money, my phone and a vehicle.
Q: If you were given a chance to write your autobiography, what would the title be? Why?
A: Huh? Oh I need to think that over... (Thinks for ages) Probably 'A Simple Man' because that is who I am. I do not like to crowd my mind with unnecessary issues. I like to chill out. I do not want to be 24 hours on the sets acting for movies or 24 hours at the studio composing music. However I do not let such characteristics hinder my journey. I make steady progress in my own pace.
Q: What is the nicest thing that someone had said about you?
A: Some elderly aunts and uncles have told me that I am a very good son. Those comments really touched me.
Q: Is there something you do as a habit?
A: Not really but I do hit the gym quite a lot. If I cannot make it to the gym I workout at home.
Q: What is the best advice you have gotten?
A: It was given to me by my parents during my childhood. My father had advised me to face life in the best possible way I can without envying others. That has been my motto in life.
Q: Fifty years from now, how do you like to be remembered?
A: I would like to be remembered as someone who has been much loved by the society. They would treat me like a hero then and as a genius in the field. I want to be known a rare character. I wish to be remembered as a very different person from all the rest even after my death.
Q: Isn't it about time you tied the knot?
A: (Grinning sheepishly) I do have a fiancée but I think I am not ready for marriage yet. I want to remain single for at least two or three more years.
