No political influence in future, Govt. assures CBSL

The government has given an assurance to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka that there would be no political influence over any of its functional responsibilities, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy yesterday said.
Dr. Coomaraswamy was speaking at a press brief held at the CBSL premises yesterday evening.
Responding to a question on the delay of the regulatory performance by the Central Bank over certain matters, Dr. Coomaraswamy said most of its failures are not a fault of the institution, but the prolonged political influence over it.
“Often in this country, delays are caused by political factors interfering into the workings of the authorities. That had happened in the past, which we have pointed out,” Dr. Coomaraswamy said.
“We have been criticized for our regulatory performances. We have made a point that the main problem was not the CBSL regulations. In response to that, we were told that politics would not be a problem anymore and that we should go ahead and do our work,” he pointed out.
Asked when this reassurance was given, Dr. Coomaraswamy said that they received it “Over the last four or five months.”
