FEATURE: Fighters in the forefront

Sri Lanka will celebrate its 69th anniversary of Independence today. It was on February 4, 1948 that Sri Lanka gained Independence from the British. Freedom would not have been possible without a group of heroic individuals who risked their lives for the sake of liberation. So it's time to reflect upon some of the ‘Freedom Fighters,’ who worked hard to free the country from the clutches of the colonial masters.
The secret of happiness is freedom; the secret of freedom is courage - Carrie Jones
