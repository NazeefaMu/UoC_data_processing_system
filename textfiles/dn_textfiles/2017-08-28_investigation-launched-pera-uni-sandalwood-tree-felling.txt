Investigation launched into Pera Uni Sandalwood tree felling

The Peradeniya Police and Peradeniya University Marshal Division are conducting a joint investigation on cutting down of a valuable Sandalwood tree at the Peradeniya University.
The Sandalwood tree, near the Sarasawi Seya temple, was cut down by a group of thieves yesterday (23) around 3.00 in the morning.
According to preliminary investigations, the timber was transported using a three wheeler.
Employees attached to the university expressed their surprise as to how outsiders entered the university. They said about 90 workers and a large community of students are very much alert about intruders in the premises.
According to Chief Marshal Dinal Ratnayake, protecting Sandalwood trees in a land of 1,800 acres is tedious and expensive. He said a proposal was forwarded to the university administration to remove the trees.
Vice Chancellor of Peradeniya University Prof. Upul Dissanayake said a complaint was lodged about the matter at Peradeniya police.
