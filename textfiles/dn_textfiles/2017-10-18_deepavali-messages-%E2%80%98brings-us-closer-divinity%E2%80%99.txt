Deepavali Messages: ‘Brings us closer to divinity’

"Deepavali signifies the victory of good over evil, from darkness to light. The light empowers to do good things which brings us closer to divinity. On the day of Deepavali we spread light in every corner to dispel darkness," Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama says in his Deepavali message.
"It’s a festival of lights. The word “Deep” means light and the word “avali” means row; that is row of lights. It falls on the day of “Amavasya”, when moon does not rise and there is darkness all around.
"For the Hindus, darkness represents ignorance and light is compared to knowledge. Lighting lamp symbolizes the destruction of all negative forces or vices through knowledge. It is through light the beauty of the world is revealed or experienced. In the path of “bhathi” when the demons under the leadership of Naragasuran started harassing and committing lot of atrocities to the deities who made a complaint to Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna killed Naragasuran and gave victory to the deities over devils. This day is celebrated on Deepavali as a memorial of victory over the vices for the people in the modern age as well as in ages in the past.
"Deepavali is a festival where people from all age groups participate. They express their happiness by lighting lamps, decorating their houses, putting fire crackers and inviting relations to their house to take part for a meal.
The lighting of lamps is a way of praying to God for attainment of health, wealth, knowledge and peace. It is one time in the whole year that the children volunteer to leave their beds long before the day begins and have traditional oil bath early in the morning.
They get themselves dressed with new clothes and get into their festive attire, light up oil lamps and scented sticks. This express the purity level even at the path of bhakthi.
"May this festival of lights bring lots of light into your lives and along with that may it bring joy, happiness and prosperity for you and your family," the Governor stated.
