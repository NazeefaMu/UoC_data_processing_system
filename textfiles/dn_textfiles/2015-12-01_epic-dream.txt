[If I were 21]
Epic dream

At 21, I would be hopefully working with the great Film Directors of that time and learning and studying their methods and also working in various departments of the Film Studio Complex with the intention of returning to Sri Lanka and building my own studio. I would still be enthusiastically involved in the learning curve with the hope of creating my own movies. My dream since I was 16, was to create my own movies

 
Well one thing can be said of Chandran Rutnam - if he was 21 today he would live life as fully as he did when he was 21, years ago. He has had a great time in life and if he was 21 today, well life would still be adventurous and exciting as it was when he was 21, years ago. He wouldn't have missed a minute of it!
Asking Chandran, if he was 21 today would he do things differently than when he was 21, years ago, to which he answered - 'I wanted to go to Hollywood and I went and had a great time', and I don't believe for one minute that he is fibbing!
Rutnam is larger than life and seriously could we imagine Chandran Rutnam any other way? He has always been outspoken, charismatic and dynamic!
"I was 21 today I wouldn't have done it any differently than when I was 21, years ago. And a definite yes! I would still be interested in films if I was 21 today, but the difference is that I would have made my own films much earlier. With the new technology in the film industry I would have accomplished more, much sooner and entered my other two passions much earlier: Women and Aviation," said Rutnam.
Well I must say that Chandran's handsome face and confidence would draw the interest and attention of the fairer sex even if he was 21 a century from now.
I asked him what kind of dreams and ambitions he would have if he was 21 today and he answered:
"Having my own film studio, having my own airline and having my own harem. I would have only accelerated my advancement in my three passions and done things much sooner. Thank God, I have the same drive, abundance of energy and the same desires, even now."
Have my own harem! My goodness that is a bold answer. But Chandran Rutnam is a bold man with an inimitable sense of humor.
