Incredible bird-shaped fountain

In the heart of Kazakhstan’s capital lays Presidential Park, a massive public area that stretches out in front of the Ak Orda Presidential Palace. This unique landscape and architecture is part of Astana’s rebirth as the capital of the former Soviet country. Spilling over nearly 60 acres, the green oasis sits within the city, filled with eye-catching symbolism.
Central to the design of this spectacular open space is a unique fountain that takes on the appearance of a bird, when viewed from above. In reality, it’s not just any bird, but the Samruk—a mythical creature that symbolizes life and freedom. Each morning the fountain is dry, its granite basins forming a pedestrian square. Throughout the day, jets in the basin fill the bird with water that later cascades away like a river.
The Samruk fountain leads organically to another centerpiece of Presidential Park—the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation. After opening in 2006, the 252-foot-tall pyramid has become a top event venue and cultural attraction in the city. The building was designed by British architect Norman Foster of Foster + Partners, who is also responsible for London’s famous “Gherkin.”
