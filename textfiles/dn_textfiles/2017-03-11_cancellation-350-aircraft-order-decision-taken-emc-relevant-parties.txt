Cancellation of A 350             aircraft order :Decision  taken by EMC,  relevant parties

The decision on the cancellation of three A 350 aircraft ordered for SriLankan Airlines was taken by the Economic Management Committee (EMC) after discussing with all relevant parties, Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said.
Responding to a question by UPFA MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage in Parliament  yesterday, the minister pointed out the Government was left with no other option but to cancel the order for three aircraft to avert a loss of Rs.32 billion.
However, Hashim said as the subject minister he was not made aware of the procedure followed in cancelling the aircraft order, adding that steps have been taken to correct this situation and get SriLankan Airlines follow the directions of the Ministry.
The minister also firmly refuted the allegation that the cancellation was subsequent to an email message sent by the Prime Minister’s Senior Advisor Charitha Ratwatte to SriLankan Airlines CEO Suren Ratwatte. “That message was intended only to communicate the Prime Minister’s instructions to the other party,” he said.
“There is a massive scam behind the purchase of these three aircraft. The former Government has agreed to pay USD 1.4 million per month for each of the aircraft, whereas the market value only amounts to USD 950,000. That is USD 450,000 extra for each. When calculated for the entire lease period of 12 years, we were made to incur a loss of USD 644 million for the three aircraft. Had we purchased them, those would also have suffered an operational loss as those are long-range aircraft,” he explained.
The minister pointed out there are another four A 350-900 aircraft ordered by the previous Government which are not yet cancelled. “The former Government has agreed to pay USD 200 million for each of them, where as it could have been bought at USD 120 million” he said.
The minister pointed out the SriLankan Airlines, which recorded Rs 4 billion profits in 2008, recorded a loss of Rs 9 billion in the year after that, and the loss increased to Rs.32 billion in 2014. “By 2016, we were able to reduce the loss to Rs 16 billion and we convert it back to a profitable venture within this year,” he said.
MP Aluthgamage questioned if there had been financial frauds at the SriLankan Airlines as claimed, why was not a single person arrested or brought before the law even after the lapse of two years. He repeatedly charged that the powers of subject ministers had been overpowered by certain figures in the government and important decisions are made overlooking the relevant ministers.
Minister Hashim replied that the practice of overlooking the subject ministers first started during the former Government, adding that Cabinet approval had not been sought before purchasing these aircraft and that the subject minister and his deputy were in dark over these purchases.
