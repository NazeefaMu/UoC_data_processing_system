Rugby legend comes out with Risk management and safety strategy
Hafeez Marso’s plan to curb unruly behaviour at schools rugby

Former Police Sports Club triple champion winning 1989 rugby captain, Sri Lanka double international (Basketball and Rugby) legendary sportsmen cum former DIG Hafeez Marso has comes out with Risk Management and Safety Strategy to prevent untoward incidents happening at schools’ rugby matches. Speaking exclusively to the Daily News in an interview he said,
PREAMBLE
The dire need to devise a viable mechanism is inevitable to arrest the recent untoward incidents that occurred during a few school rugby encounters. Though it could be summed up the near contributory factors for such incidents to ignite; this is not the time to point fingers at anyone. In the interest of school rugby which is the future of national rugby; the way forward is to think anew how best the prevailing issues could be sorted out with the concerted effort of all stake holders.
RUGBY TRADITIONS
It is considered pertinent to reflect on the history of rugby to give some insights that paved the way for the gentleman’s game to flourish in the island nation. Rugby is a physical contact game which goes back to over 12 decades ever since it was introduced in 1895 and now played by over 100 countries with a player base of 5.3 million both registered and unregistered, according to the latest statistics. Almost all the founder member unions (countries) still uphold the great traditions of the game at all levels with respect to each other in whatever role they are involved, even the spectators; and such precept had always kept the game of rugby clean with no or very minimal hooliganism. Suffice to say that Sri Lanka with a history of over 100 years of rugby inherited and practiced those customs left by our pioneers and the stalwarts of yesteryear.
CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS
The few recent unfortunate incidents witnessed at the school rugby matches may be attributed to lack of awareness of the traditions practiced in the distant past and due to omissions or commissions on the part of some of the stake holders which may have been perceived by the concerned parties to be controversial; and this is often seen as a point of ignition to cause unruly behaviour when emotions run high intertwined with provocative remarks and gestures that invariably aggravate the situation finally ending up in fisticuffs.
The schools certainly may have its genuine grievances over some of the issues that need to be addressed by all the stake holders. In fairness, the schools expect something tangible in return for the colossal amount of funds they spent on rugby. Having said so, the unruly behaviour of the crowd to whichever team they belong to, cannot be condoned.
ZERO TOLERANCE AND THE WAY FORWARD
Depending on physical security to prevent incidents is only a temporary remedy; instead, the mindset should work to bring about a “Paradigm Shift” creating a more conducive culture. Ignorance or complacency to resolve the issue may precipitate to more serious consequences though it may appear for the time being that things have subsided as a result of some knee-jerk action.
At this precise juncture, all the stake holders namely, the Sri Lanka Rugby, Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association, Sri Lanka Society of Rugby Football Referees, other Match Officials (Match and Citing Commissioners), Judicial Officers, Disciplinary Committee, the Principals/Wardens and its Rugby Management including the Old Boys Unions, Coaches, Team Managers and their Supporting Staff need to work as a team with utmost coordination helping one and other; and such a mechanism would make things much easier towards achieving success.
In this endeavour, the stake holders should not be pressed to compromise their status-co but they should try to adapt to a collective workable approach. In similar vein, it wouldn’t be an unwise move for the school authorities to reach out to the former players and rugby administrators of repute to seek their services and expertise.
While the order of the day would be to “Keep Rugby Clean and Fair” with “Zero Tolerance”; the need of the hour would be to exercise self-restrain and not let emotions to dictate terms and leave it to the law to take its due course.
