TVS three-wheelers, reach  1,000 customers in Sri Lanka

Abans Auto, a leading automotive retailer, recently reached 1000 TVS customers in Sri Lanka just three months after introducing the new futuristic range of TVS King 200cc Three-wheelers.
The retailer has also launched 30 out of the planned 50 TVS showrooms so far while instituting over 100 authorized dealers throughout the country. These notable achievements are a testament to Abans Auto’s competence and dexterity in pinpointing the driving needs of local consumers, and introducing globally acclaimed brands that fully meet those needs.
The collaboration with TVS Motor Company, one of India’s most preeminent two-wheeler and three-wheeler manufacturers, embodies Abans Auto’s aim of providing safe, durable and high-caliber motor vehicles that are ideally suited for Sri Lanka’s weather and road conditions.
The forward-thinking lineup of TVS King three-wheelers, in particular, truly makes the common man feel that he is travelling like a King, whilst being the perfect epitome of safety, comfort and efficiency on the road.
The most striking feature present in the TVS King is the powerful 200cc, modern low-friction 7-port engine.
Other functions include the hand-operated reverse gear shifter, a truly unique feature not available in any other competitor product, which greatly enhances the comfort and security of both the drivers and occupants.
In addition, TVS King comes in three designs – Basic Model (GS), Fully Loaded Model (FLD) and Fun Bread (FB), and six stunning colour options such as Red, Green, Blue, Black, Yellow and White.
Reinforcing its commitment to excellence in service, Abans Auto has appointed over 400 authorized touch points across the country that focus on offering its consumers original spare parts and unrivalled services.
Each of these service centres is equipped with highly skilled, foreign-trained technicians who use innovative machinery to conduct complex repair jobs as well as simple tasks including oil changes.
TVS King Three-wheelers are currently available for purchase at all Abans Auto and TVS showrooms as well as TVS authorized dealers island wide.
