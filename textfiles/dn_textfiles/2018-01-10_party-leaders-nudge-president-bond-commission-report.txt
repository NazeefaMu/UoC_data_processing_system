Party leaders NUDGE President for BOND Commission report

Party Leaders yesterday in Parliament decided to formally write to President Maithripala Sirisena requesting for copies of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry report on the Bond issue and 34 reports of the PRECIFAC handed over to the President recently.
A Party Leaders’ Meeting was chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday afternoon to decide the agenda for today’s special sitting which was convened upon the request of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to discuss the bond report.
However, several Party Leaders have pointed out the Commission report must be tabled in Parliament prior to having a debate. It has been then decided to request the President to table the Bond report in Parliament along with the 34 reports of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) which were handed over to the President following the completion of investigations.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will write to the President on behalf of the Party Leaders. A Party Leader speaking to the Daily News said a date on the debate would be scheduled once the Presidential Commission reports are in public domain after tabling them in Parliament.
At the special sitting today, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is expected to make a statement on the bond issue and other party leaders and parliamentarians will join in commenting on it. The Bond report was presented to the President on December 30 and the final report of the PRECIFAC was presented to him on January 2.
