Of penguin Picassos and monkey Monets

If you’re having a bad day, stop what you’re doing and look at these photos of animals flaunting their painting skills.
Yes, we’ve come across a load of pictures showing various animals picking up a paintbrush and creating works of art.
From a beluga whale using its mouth to paint in the water to actual snails trailing around in paint – yes, that actually happened – there’s going to be at least one picture here that’ll put a smile on your face.
