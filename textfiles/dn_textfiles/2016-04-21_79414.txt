Rugby star Supun Warnakulasooriya awarded Royal Crown

 
The Royal Crown, the highest achievement at Royal College Colombo for any sport has been awarded to their outstanding rugby player and number eight Supun Warnakulasooriya for his fabulous performance for the school and for his dedication and the contribution he made during the 2015 rugby season.
Arshad Jamaldeen was the last rugby player from the school to win the Royal Crown in 2012.
Along with this award Warnakulasooriya received his college rugby colours for the year 2015 for helping Royal win five trophies namely Bradby Shield (v Trinity), Michael Gunaratne trophy (v. S. Thomas' ML), BC Anghie trophy (v St Peter's), Major Milroy Fernando trophy (v Isipathana) and becoming League champions.
Royal College also had the distinction of clinching two other trophies - D.S. Senanayake trophy for winning the Royal-Thomian cricket encounter 2016 and the Bradby Shield for winning the Trinity-Royal rugby encounter 2015-16.
Incidentally Royal College won both these two trophies together after a lapse of 20 years. It is indeed a special occasion in their sporting history. - WAI
