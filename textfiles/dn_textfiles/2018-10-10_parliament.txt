Country’s economy not unstable as JO claims:Finance Minister
In case crude oil prices in the international market reach a record hike, the government being sensitive to the difficulties of the general public, would endure the loss irrespective of the fuel price formula, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said. He pointed out that the country’s economy is not unstable as claimed by the Joint Opposition. If the economy is unstable, the Minister questioned, as to how the government had been able to grant loans worth close to Rs. 54 BN under the Enterprise Sri Lanka for young entrepreneurs across the country. He also pointed out that the government had commenced 39,666 projects under the Gamperaliya, worth Rs. 20 BN. He also pointed out that the previous regime never gave the benefit of low crude oil prices to the people even when a crude oil barrel price decreased to US$ 45.

Minister Samaraweera said that when the present government took office in 2015, they inherited an economic time bomb. “We took over a country with a depleting economy. In the 1990s, the government revenue was 21%, but by 2014, it was 11.4%. Sri Lanka was then the country with the lowest government revenue. The gap between the government revenue and expenditure reached a Rs. 601 BN. The previous regime used US$ 4.1 BN to defend the rupee in 2012, when there was a currency crisis. We only used US$ 250 MN to it. We cannot use our foreign reserves as we are supposed to pay humongous debts this year and also in the coming two years. The largest debt installment in Sri Lankan history worth Rs. 1.9 Trillion, would be paid this year. In 2020 and 2021, the government had to pay Rs. 4,000 BN as debt repayment. More than a two third of these debts have been taken by the Rajapaksa regime,” Minister Samaraweera pointed out.
Minister Samaraweera also said that in 2015, they had to take over a Central Bank which under had gone losses. “We started this journey with a Central Bank that was undergoing losses. In 2013, it was Rs. 24,264 BN and in 2014 it was Rs. 32,309 BN,” he pointed out.
The Finance Minister also denied JO allegation that the prices of goods have increased drastically. Contrary to the allegations, Samaraweera pointed out that there haven’t been serious increases in essential food items at present in comparative to the prices of the same in 2014.
Finance Minister Samaraweera also said the government would strengthen an export oriented liberalized economy in order to manage future instances similar to the present global financial turmoil.
He also denied JO allegations that loans by Enterprise Sri Lanka had been granted based on political favourations.

“You were also a part of this Government for three years. You cannot get away from criticisms concerning the cost of living, just because you switched sides in Parliament. You should be ashamed. You were part of this Government as well as the previous. You are nothing but a political opportunist,” he accused the MP.

Presidential pardon had never been misused under Yahapalana rule:Minister Rajapakshe
There had been no occasion where President’s power to pardon was misused under Yahapalana rule, Higher Education and Cultural Minister Wijayedasa Rajapakshe yesterday said. The Minister observed that this was not the case prior to 2015. Minister Rajapakshe pointed out that the present government, soon after taking office, adopted new criteria to follow when granting President’s pardon, and has deviated from the framework only on three occasions.
“The first occasion was when freeing Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka who was imprisoned by the previous regime.
The second occasion was pardoning the girl from Batticaloa who defaced Sigiriya frescoes, and the last was when President pardoned the LTTE suicide bomber who attempted to assassinate him. Aside from these on three occasions, the government has strictly abided by the criteria.” Minister Rajapakshe said.
Minister Rajapakshe pointed out that the recommendations on the prisoners who deserve pardon from the President come through a special committee of experts headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge. He denied that there has been any political or otherwise influence over the said committee.
Minister Rajapakshe made these observations in response to an oral question by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa in reference to the number of prisoners released on special presidential pardon during the period 2006-2015. Jayatissa drew attention to a prisoner who had been granted pardon by the President on March 08, 2010. It was pointed out that the said prisoner, who was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment over two deaths, is the wife of a former minister. According to him, the said prisoner was sentenced for murdering two females. Hence, Jayatissa questioned as to what steps the government would take for such misusing of President’s powers to Pardon.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake who also rose to make an observation, pointed out that there had been two more incidents where such misuse had taken place. “There is one former mayor from Kandy area, who was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for misappropriation of public money, was granted President’s pardon. And then, there Basnayake Nilame of Sabaragamuwa too received pardon.” Dissanayake said.
MP Jayatissa requested that the report including the recommendations suggesting the release of the said prisoner be tabled at Parliament. Minister Rajapakshe assured that he would inform the Justice Minister concerning the matter.
It was pointed out that 29,309 prisoners have been granted President’s pardon from 2006 to 2015, marking special occasions such as Independence Day, International Women’s Day, Prisoners Welfare Day, Vesak Day, Poson Day and the Dalada Perahera. It was also pointed out that no prisoner who had been sentenced under rape and child abuse been granted special presidential pardon.
COPE to request Speaker to summon Sports DG before EPC
The Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) yesterday, decided to request Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to summon the Sports Director General before the Ethics and Privileges Committee(EPC) due to his failure to appear before the COPE despite repeated summons.
The Football Federation of Sri Lanka was summoned before the COPE yesterday and it extensively questioned its present management over a report that had attempted to conceal the irregularities and fraudulent acts of its past President Manilal Fernando.
“There is a court case going on against former President Manilal Fernando, based on the findings of a previous COPE report in 2016. The COPE questioned as to why this case has been stalled. The Federation has come up with a new report stating that the previous findings were faulty. Those findings had already been confirmed by way of a ministerial level inquiry as well. It was the Football Federation that had initiated legal action against its former President Fernando, but now it is trying to cover him up,” the COPE sources told the Daily News.
“The Sports Director General did not turn up for the meeting despite being summoned. He had dodged the COPE on two occasions. Therefore, we have decided to recommend the Speaker to summon him to the Parliament Ethics and Privileges Committee,” the sources added.
