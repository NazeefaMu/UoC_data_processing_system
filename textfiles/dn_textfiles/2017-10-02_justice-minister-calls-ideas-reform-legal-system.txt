Justice Minister calls for ideas to reform legal system

Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale said she would welcome ideas and views from the entire legal sector to introduce legal reforms needed for the country and its people and minimise delays in the sector.
Atukorale was speaking at the three-day Junior National Law Conference 2017 at the Amari Hotel in Galle on September 29 after inaugurating the conference.
She said the inordinate delay in hearing of cases to a conclusion had became a serious problem in the courts network and legal reforms were needed to resolve the issue.
"Legal aid and equality of justice were universally accepted human rights. It was important for all courts staff from the highest to the lowest to work with dedication to overcome delays. The Government had already done much work to minimise the delays, Ideas and views of all parties in the legal sector were needed to facilitate legal reforms,” she said.
The minister said that in 2015, nearly 18,960 cases were pending in High Courts and that the number increased to 17,038 in October 2016.
“Another 3,347 cases were pending in Civil Appeal Courts in 2015. In march, 2017, 5,580 cases were pending in Commercial High Courts and another 16,574 in High Courts,” she said.
“Administration of Justice should be done efficiently and impartially. If not people would lose confidence in the legal system. As lawyers, it was important to act in a manner that create public confidence in the legal system,” she said.
She said the Government always strive to develop legal education and provide necessary facilities and training to the legal fraternity.
Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, and BASL President U.R. de Silva spoke.
