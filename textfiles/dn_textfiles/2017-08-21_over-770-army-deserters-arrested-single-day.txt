Over 770 Army deserters arrested in a single day

An island-wide combined raid conducted by the Police and the Sri Lanka Corps of Military Police (SLCMP) last Friday arrested 777 Army personnel who are Absent Without Leave (AWOL) or having deserted their posts in respective formations around the country.
The raid is the biggest ever conducted within a single day and accordingly 1 Officer and 776 Other Rankers were taken in to custody, the Army Media Unit said.
The Army said that disciplinary action will be taken against those arrested. The raids conducted by the Police and the Sri Lanka Corps of Military Police (SLCMP) will continue. The Ministry of Defence provided two General Amnesty periods last year for Tri Forces deserters to obtain legal discharge.
Since the end of the General Amnesty period that ended on December 31, 2016 authorities have arrested 1,500 deserters up to March 1.
