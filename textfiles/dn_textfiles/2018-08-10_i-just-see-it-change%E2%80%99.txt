'I just see it as a change’

Meghan Markle will take on ‘important role’ for Prince William, royalinsider explains MEGHAN MARKLE, 37, is the sister-in-law of Prince William, 36, who issecond in line to the British throne. Meghan, who is married to William’sbrother Prince Harry, 33, will take on an “important role” when herbrother-in-law is King, said an insider.
Meghan Markle is the newest member of the royal family, but she may alreadybe preparing for a major role. The Duchess of Sussex formally became a royal when she married Prince Harry on 19 May this year.
This will come with substantial responsibility, according to a royal expert. As sister-in-law to Prince William, who will one day be King, Meghan will be expected to support him, former royal butler Grant Harrold told Express.co.uk. “The Duchess of Sussex will have an important role to develop as one day she will be sister in law to the King,” he explained.
Meghan Markle will perform royal duties on behalf of Prince William when he is King
“She will take on duties on behalf of the monarch as we see the Royals do today for the Queen.”
Meanwhile, Meghan’s new sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, 36, will have a loton her plate.
“Both royal duchesses have important roles to fulfil,” Grant explained.“I imagine we will see more of the Duchess of Cambridge as she prepares forher future role as Queen.”
Meghan has already stepped into a number of royal honours since marrying Prince Harry.
She is a Patron of The Royal Foundation Forum, alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.
She also attended engagements as part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London. Finally, she regularly attends engagements on behalf of the monarchy. Sheeven accompanied Queen Elizabeth on a solo engagement in Cheshire last June.
Meghan left her acting career behind last year in favour of devoting herself to royal duty alongside Prince Harry.
She recently declined an opportunity to “say goodbye” to her former career. Meghan apparently “politely turned down” an invitation to the 70th Emmy Awards ceremony in LA next month, sources told The Sun. One source added that Meghan’s decision appeared to be “a line in the sand” between her acting and royal careers.Another source said: “We had hoped Meghan would attend as a way of saying goodbye to her Suits fans and colleagues.
“Show executives and NBC had offered Harry and her an invitation tocelebrate with the biggest stars around, meet her showbiz friends and even present an honour. But Meghan is not attending.”
Meghan addressed her career change late last year during her and Harry’s engagement announcement interview. She said: “I don't see it as givinganything up, I just see it as a change.”
