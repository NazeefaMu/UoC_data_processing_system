Pitt eyeing Angelina Jolie’s lookalike

Actor Brad Pitt is reportedly eyeing his former wife and actress Angelina Jolie’s lookalike Ella Purnell.
Purnell, 21, played the young version of Jolie’s character in 2014’s ‘Maleficent’.
Reportedly, Pitt was so “blown away” by her work in ‘Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children’ and ‘Churchill’ that the 53-year-old “jumped at the chance” to work with Purnell via his production company, Plan B, for ‘Sweetbitter’. ‘Sweetbitter’ is based on a novel about a New York City waitress.
