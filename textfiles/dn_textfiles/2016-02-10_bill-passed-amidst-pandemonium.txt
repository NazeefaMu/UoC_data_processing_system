The Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill which provides for increasing women's representation in local government institutions up to 25 percent was passed in Parliament yesterday amidst strong objections leveled by MPs of the Joint Opposition who shouted various slogans in the well of the House.
The Bill was passed with amendments within a short period and the sittings adjourned at 3.00 p.m. four and half hours before
the scheduled time despite Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe promising to grant another day for the Opposition side for the debate on this amendment Bill.
However, as the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella moved the Bill for the Second Reading about 40 members of the Joint Opposition led by MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena rose to their feet and converged on the well of the House and marched towards the Speaker's podium.
The Sergeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama Samarasekara and his deputies Narendra Fernando and Kushan Jayaratne rushed towards the Mace to protect it.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe commencing the debate said that the Bill was seeking to increase women's representation in the local government bodies and asked as to why the Opposition was trying to disrupt it.

We could continue the debate and get the Bill passed enabling the increase of the number of women members in the local government authorities," the Premier said. "Tell us if these female Opposition members including Pavithra Wanniarachchi stood against increasing female representation in politics".
