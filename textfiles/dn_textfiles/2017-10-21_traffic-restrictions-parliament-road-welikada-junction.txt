Traffic restrictions on Parliament road, Welikada junction

Traffic movement along the road from Borella to Battaramulla will be restricted from tomorrow until Monday (23) due to construction work on the Welikada flyover.
Police headquarters in a communiqué said vehicle movement will be limited along Parliament Road from Welikada junction to Battaramulla. Traffic entering and exiting Colombo from Welikada junction will also be limited to two lanes. Police advice motorists to use alternative roads as the change may cause congestion.
