Pus in the chest may cost you your life

You should not be shocked if you hear your physician telling you that you have an accumulation of pus in and around the lungs. In developing counties, the healthcare delivery system is in such a poor state that thousands of poor and middle class people commonly have pus in the chest. Neither are our citizens aware of this condition nor does the medical fraternity seem to regard the treatment of this condition seriously.
A patient who is suffering from pus inside the chest neither knows where to go nor knows anyone who can advise him correctly. The net result is that on one hand, this medical condition is overlooked, and secondly, the possibility of taking a wrong course of treatment increases considerably, and in the end, it is only the patient who suffers the most and he pays either by losing his lung or by losing his life.
Detection of collection of pus inside the chest
A patient who has pus collection inside the chest suffers from fever all the time, but during the daytime, fever is lower and increases rapidly during the evening or night. Along with the fever, the patient complains of excessive sweating all the time. There is a desire to cough, but on coughing, either nothing or a small amount of phlegm comes out. On coughing, the patient feels pain in the chest, especially on the side where the pus is collected.
If you have suffered from pneumonia one month before or you have previously received a chest injury and you find that even after one month of the infection or the injury, you are still suffering from cough and fever, immediately get the chest x-ray done. Remember that the chest x-ray in such a condition should be done in standing position. On examination of the chest x-ray, if pus collection is suspected or the lung shows whitening on one side, immediately go to an experienced radiologist and get an ultrasound examination of your chest. There are two advantages of doing chest ultrasound examination: firstly, it will confirm the presence of pus or water inside the chest cavity, and secondly, it will quantify the amount of pus collected therein, so that the correct strategy of treatment can be formulated.
Present scenario in developing countries
In a developing country like India, every year about two lakhs of new patients fall victim to this disease. Of these, about 80,000 lose their lives due to lack of adequate treatment and 60 percent of those who survive die later of complications from this disease. Among older patients, 75 percent die. The statistics themselves show how serious we are in India about treatment of this disease, which in medical terms is called ‘empyema thoracis’. This also reflects the stage in which the healthcare delivery system is in developing countries and how much importance is given to this medical condition.
What is pus collection inside the chest?
There is an empty space between the chest wall and the lung. When we breathe, the lung expands and completely fills up this empty space, which in medical terms is called ‘pleural space’. When due to any reason this empty space gets filled up with pus, this condition in medical terms is called ‘empyema thoracics’. Empyema thoracis simply means in common man’s language, ‘a collection of pus around the lung inside the chest’.
Why does pus collect inside the chest?
The most important reasons for pus collection inside the chest are pneumonia and tuberculosis (TB) in the lung. A significant amount of pus-like water collects around the lung. If this infection is not controlled effectively, the same accumulated water in the empty space converts completely into pus.
The second reason in developing countries for pus collection inside the chest is tuberculosis in the lung. During the early stage of TB, yellow-coloured water gets collected. If this water gets infected due to an outside infection, it gets converted into pus. In India, due to repeated removal of this collected water through a syringe and needle, this tubercular fluid gets converted into pus. If in a tubercular patient, the amount of collected water inside the chest is more than 500ml and if this water is not removed and is left inside the chest, the possibility of this yellow water getting converted into pus increases considerably.
Therefore, always remember, if there is a tubercular infection in the lung and the amount of collected water around the lung is more than 500ml, immediately consult a thoracic or a chest surgeon and get that collected water removed through a chest tube and continue with anti-tubercular medication.
Chest injury causing pus collection
One other important reason for pus collection inside the chest is an injury to the chest. In a road traffic accident, fracture of the ribs is a common occurrence and this leads to injury of the lung and collection of blood inside the chest. If that collected blood inside the chest is not removed in time, the possibility of infection and accumulated old blood converting into pus increases considerably.
There are other reasons for pus collection inside the chest. For example, perforation of the food pipe due to injury or cancer, infection of the backbone, or development of a condition called BPF (broncho pleural fistula) after lung operation.
Liver abscess too plays a role
In a developing country, one more reason for pus collection inside the chest which is very peculiar and specific to Asian and Arabian contexts, is a liver abscess. In developing countries, due to bad hygiene when eating, people easily fall victim to chronic dysentery and diarrhoea. In a patient after recurrent episodes of dysentery and diarrhoea, infection reaches the liver and cause pus collection inside the liver. If the liver abscess is not treated effectively and in time, the size of the pus cavity increases tremendously and ultimately, it ruptures. If liver abscess bursts upwards into the chest, the pus starts collecting inside the chest. This is a very dangerous condition. If timely intervention under supervision of a thoracic surgeon is not sought, the patient might die.
Consult a thoracic surgeon
If you have come to know about collection of pus inside your chest, immediately consult a thoracic or a chest surgeon. Moving here and there with no proper guidance will result in a waste of time and money and will increase the possibility of destruction of the lung. Sometime this delay in treatment may cost the patient his life.
If pus collection is of recent onset, consult a thoracic surgeon who will administer medication through a tube. These medicines are called streptokinase or urokinase or TPA. When pus stays inside the chest at a same place for three or four days, flimsy partition walls are formed which trap the pus within these partitions. These partitions weave a network around the lung. Because of pus being trapped between the partitions, the entire collected pus does not come out of the chest through the tube. This procedure is called ‘tube thoracostomy’ or ‘fibrinolvsis’.
If tube thoracostomy does not yield a desired result, then the surgeon would make two or three holes inside the chest, or through a telescope, partitions are broken down so that the pus can come out of the chest without any obstruction. If this telescopic method fails, a small cut is made on the chest wall and all partitions are broken, and after this procedure, the lung comes back to its original position and is thus saved from destruction. This method of making a cut and cleaning the chest is almost 100 percent effective and successful.
Mismanagement can leads to more problems
It has been observed that in developing countries when children suffer from pneumonia and pus-like water collects around the lung inside the chest, the child specialist himself tries to take out the pus-like water in small quantities through injection at repeated short intervals. Sometimes, they put a very narrow tube inside the chest to take out the pus, with the result that the pus is never evacuated from the chest completely. Inadequate removal of pus-like water from the chest cavity creates two main problems: firstly, infection is never eradicated, no matter how many strong and effective antibiotics we use, and secondly, there is a likelihood of developing a medical condition called ‘broncho pleural fistula’ (BPF). This condition will result in either loss of lung or loss of life.
Correct strategy for treatment
Therefore, always remember if your child is suffering from pneumonia or TB and pus has collected around the lung and inside the chest, you should request the child specialist or physician to consult a thoracic surgeon and follow his advice and keep on taking his advice, otherwise the possibility of lung destruction increases significantly.
If pus has collected inside the chest for more than a week, immediately contact a thoracic surgeon. This operation that will be performed is called ‘empyemectomy decortication’. This operation is effective in the majority of people. If the pus has collected inside the chest for more than eight days, never get the pus removed through thoracoscope (telescope) for there is possibility of irreparable damage to the lung as well as bleeding.
If one month has passed since the collection of pus, the partition formed inside the pus cavity becomes very hard and constitutes a thick and hard layer around the lung. This results in excessive compression of the trapped lung. This compression disturbs the breathing process and destroys the lung completely. In such a situation, be careful and consult a thoracic surgeon without any further delay and get yourself treated.
