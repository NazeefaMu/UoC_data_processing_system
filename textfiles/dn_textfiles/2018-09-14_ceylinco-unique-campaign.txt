Ceylinco in unique campaign

Right way on the highway – Over 1,700 staff members of Ceylinco General Insurance took to streets in several areas in Colombo recently with a unique campaign to educate people and road users on deteriorating civic values and to say NO to child abuse, drug use and sexual violence. The program was conducted islandwide.
