Aluthgamage sues FCID

Former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage had filed a lawsuit at the Colombo District Court, claiming Rs.50 million as damages from the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID).
He challenged the FCID’s decision to arrest and charge him under the Public Property Act, in connection with the alleged misappropriation of Rs.39 million for the purchase of carrom and checkers boards to Sathosa in 2014.
The defendant said that although he was arrested over an offence committed under the Public Property Act, the magistrate’s court had ordered to release him on bail, citing that no offence had transpired under the act.
MP Aluthgamage had named FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and several others as respondents for allegedly damaging his reputation.
