People-friendly programme for next year

A people-friendly programme will be introduced for the next year, former Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. He was addressing a meeting held at Suduwella in Maradana, recently. He said that the programme would be implemented next year. According to the former Minister, through this people-friendly programme, the Government would be able to win 2020 election which will enable the Government to continue until 2025.
The Government will be dedicated towards people-friendly programmes aimed at welfare of the citizens. Another new economic development programme which would win everyone's heart will also be introduced, he added. He also thanked everyone who supported the UNP past few days.
