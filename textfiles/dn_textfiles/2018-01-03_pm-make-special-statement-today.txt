PM to make special statement today

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will make a special statement today (3).
He is expected to make this statement during a special meeting held for candidates and electoral organisers appearing for the upcoming Local Government polls.
The meeting will be held at the Sirikotha UNP headquarters.
The UNP is the single biggest party to contest all Local Government bodies and thus will have the highest number of candidates appearing from one party at the elections.
