HNB 'B' chasing a moderate total of 151 runs set up by HSBC 'C', finished on the right side of the ledger, riding on the well compiled innings of their opening batsman, Malindu Perera, who carried his bat out after scoring 75 NO in 62 balls, hitting 13 fours in the process.
Heshan Flexe No.9 batsman, Ruwan Ranasinghe performed an unbelievable feat of remaining 68 not out in 30 balls inclusive of 06 sixes and a equal number of fours; Heshan Flexe, batting first was in spot of bother, losing 07 wickets for 115 runs in 16 overs. Ranasinghe held the tail as Heshan Flex finished with a challenging total of 209 for 8 in 25 overs.
Half centuries by opener, Krishan Rajendra (67 not out in 58 balls, with 02 sixes and 06 fours), and No. 4 batsman - Sanjeewa Silva (50 not out in 29 balls, with 04 sixes and 04 fours) guided MJF Exports to their comfortable win over EB Creasey, with nearly 05 overs to spare.
A 90 runs partnership for the 3rd wicket in 65 balls, between Opener, Tharanga Indika (86 in 70 balls, inclusive of 03 sixes and 06 fours) and Malith Cooray (40), and a stingy spell of bowling by Naveen Kavikara (5-30–4) gave Nippon Paint a heart stopping 02 –runs win over Hayleys Group 'B'.
Hayleys chasing 191 runs to win got off to a good start with opener, Thilan Pathberiya (73 in 57 balls with 04 sixes and 06 fours) setting the pace being , engaged in a 76 runs opening stand with Ranil Cooray (35) and 55 runs for the 2nd wicket with Thilina Silva (25). When the trio was back in the pavilion, Hayleys needed 60 runs to win in 47 balls and eventually needed 11 runs in the last over with the last pair standing; Malith Perera who bowled that over gave away 08 runs in his first 04 balls and then clean bowled No. 10 batsman - Shanon Lee (15) in his next delivery, thus Nippon Paint finishing the job, scrapping the bottom by 02 runs with a ball to spare.
