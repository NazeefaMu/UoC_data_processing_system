‘Navy earns Rs. 5,600 mn profit from sea marshalling

The Navy earned Rs. 5,600 million by sea marshalling after the Good Governance Government came into power, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday said.
Minister Ranawaka was addressing a press conference held at the Independence Arcade during the public mobile service organized by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry to mark the 40th anniversary of the Urban Development Authority.
He said the Avant Garde unduly gained an equivalent profit from the Navy by providing the same service before the government came into power and that money had to be remitted to the Navy’s Account.
“The authorities should investigate the persons that Aloysius gave money as well as those the Avant Garde and Entrust Company paid money illegally,” the Minister said.
The Minister said the spokesman for the Avant Garde was a henchman of a former corrupted officer. He said this spokesman said Ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Arjuna Ranatunga and he (the Minister) asked money earlier from him. “I challenge him to prove it with the telephone numbers,” the Minister said. “I complained the issue to the CID but they said it was a civil matter,” the Minister said.
The Minister said the Avant Garde was caught with illicit floating armouries. The law is not implemented against the rich and powerful, the Minister said.
Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana was present.
