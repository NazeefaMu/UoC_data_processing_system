World’s longest sea-crossing bridge

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday inaugurated apparently the world’s largest sea bridge that connects the semi-autonomous cities of Hong Kong and Macau to the expansive Peral River Delta economic zone through the Chinese mainland city of Zhuhai. China’s mega new bridge has been hailed by many as an engineering marvel while critics have reportedly labelled it as a white elephant.
Almost 700 guests, including the leaders of Hong Kong and Macau, attended the event for the opening of the $20 billion bridge. The bridge is expected to reduce the travel time between Hong Kong and Zhuhai from three hours to 30 minutes. The bridge will also aid in boosting trade activities between mainland China and Hong Kong. China opens world’s longest sea bridge connecting Hong Kong to Macau, Zhuhai.

Five interesting facts about the world’s largest sea bridge
 The total length of the bridge is nearly 55 kilometres or 34 miles, as per news agency AFP. It is a record-breaking length for any bridge and thus the Hong Kong-Macau bridge is regarded as the longest ocean bridge and tunnel system.
 Not everyone will be allowed to drive through the longest sea bridge. Only those who are wealthy or are politically connected will be permitted to drive their private vehicles through the bridge, the news agency reported. The administration will issue 10,000 licenses for Hong Kong-mainland dual-plate private cars, while the quota for licenses for Macau vehicles is just 300. People who do not have a license would have to use public transport to reach the bridge and then change to cross on private buses, AFP reported.
Drivers need to stay alert at all times when they are driving on the bridge. Special cameras installed on the bridge will keep a tab on the bus drivers and would alert authorities if they yawn too many times, AFP quoted Hong Kong media as reporting.
 Blood pressure of the drivers will also be monitored. As the bridge is considered to be Chinese territory, where people drive on the right side of the road, drivers on the Hong Kong-Macau bridge would also need to switch the side of the road when they are on the bridge.
A whopping amount of 420,000 tonnes of steel was utilised in the construction of the massive bridge. According to the AFP report, the amount of steel used in the construction of the bridge was enough to build 60 Eiffel Towers.
