Grama Seva divisions recive 500,000 for economic upliftment

The Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs will allocate Rs. 500,000 for each Grama Seva division to uplift the economy within each division, United National Party (UNP) Puttalam District MP Hector Appuhamy said at a media briefing at Sirikotha yesterday.
Referring to the allegations against former Minister Wimal Weerawansa, he said Weerawansa was allegedly involved in constructing low quality houses for health labourers in Chilaw but Rs. 945,000 had been recovered from labourers’ wages as the cost of construction.
Appuhamy said tourism and industrial zones would be established island wide and Colombo would be further developed as the financial city. The ‘Swashakthi’ loan scheme will be implemented to provide financial assistance to small scale domestic industries, he added. He said all measures would be taken to re-establish the national unity of the country.
Meanwhile, UNP Kurunegala District MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena said the Joint Opposition (JO) Members’ double talk on the SAITM incident confirmed that their main motive was not to lead the country towards development but to regain power and safeguard their own interests.
“There is nothing wrong in obtaining loans to finance the country. But, what matters is whether the obtained loans are utilised efficiently and effectively to lead the country towards sustainable development.
Therefore, the loans obtained by the previous regime were a complete waste since they were not allocated for any viable project,” said Amarasena. He said the Executive Presidency would be abolished and a new Constitution introduced as per the promises given to the public by the Good Governance regime.
