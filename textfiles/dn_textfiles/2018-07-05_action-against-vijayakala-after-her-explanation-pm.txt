Action against Vijayakala after her explanation - PM

There is no need at all to revive the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) terrorist organization, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, referring to State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran’s statement, yesterday said.
Premier Wickremesinghe also said that necessary steps will be taken against Maheshwaran after she gives an explanation to the government with regards to the matter. Premier Wickremesinghe made these observations establishing the UNP’s stance on the controversial statement made by Maheshwaran.
He also said that the Speaker of the House has already taken steps to conduct an inquiry with regards to the matter.
The Prime Minister also said that the government looked into the controversial statement made by Maheshwaran as soon as they were informed about it.
“Our political committee met immediately and discussed the matter. Maheshwaran will be given an opportunity to explain herself. Necessary steps will follow her explanation,” the Prime Minister also said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said that people and the military secured the country with their lives. Many leaders of UNP, SLFP, and Tamil parties were killed during the time of war. The Parliament also came under attack.
“We will always secure the sovereignty of this country. The LTTE is already banned. There is no need of reviving it. We are still to reach a political solution agreed upon by all communities in the country. The government under the headship of President Maithripala Sirisena is presently carrying out the land releasing process. Development is compulsory for the North and East,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Referring to the commotion made by the Joint Opposition MPs in Parliament on Tuesday, Premier Wickremesinghe said that strict action should be taken against their behavior. He also suggested that the JO made such a commotion to cover up the revelations made by the New York Times’ recent article on the Hambantota port.
“These are the very persons who gave a party president portfolio to an ex-LTTE head Karuna Amman who has killed over 600 police officers. These are the same people who bribed LTTE leader Prabhakaran to win an election. These are the very people who sent the Army Commander who won the war to prison. What right have they got to make such a big fuss about this when they have acted in such a manner?,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said.
Meanwhile,in reply to a question raised by MP Douglas Devananda, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said a Development Authority for the Northern Province was established last month. According to the Prime Minister, this institute is under the purview of the Prime Minister’s Office. The relevant officers have also been appointed to the institute,” he added. The Premier pointed out that development is a crucial component for the Northern and Eastern Provinces. He also said that the government will soon solve the issues pertaining to graduate scheme recruitment.
