Sri Warriors, Gladiators, dream makers and administrators

The modern game is certainly as demanding, hectic, intense, unforgiving and impossible to ignore.
Naturally our resident deckchair experts have plenty to wax lyrical about the current status of our global game.
Needless to say we hail their wisdom about the Wallabies skill levels and where the Bledisloe will not be going this season?
What this same lot have to share on our Asian Games campaign...is far too high tech for us islanders and quite capable of handing off world rugby with one extended appendage.
Hot off the games update from the team village in Indonesia......is alarming news about our top finisher and game changer Danushka Ranjan has a minor concern with one of his hamstrings...and will miss our opener vs UAE.
Not really much to fret...or jump nervously, but accept the decision between player and coach as a calculated risk with your no. 1 on ice and supervised stretching.
As coach I would not chew my bits to pulp...but look at practical plan B alternatives....whilst extending my mind not to dwell on it...the gut in knots that didn’t inspire smiling.
After some educated sighing...captain Muthu will be informed and expect the slightest of mental shudders as the boys warm up for their 1st match.
Day 1 opener is always a major tester....and till we secure good ball and run the nervous petrol off, absolutely vital we don’t make simple mistakes.
The process of settling will be cleared by huge impact tackles and turnover ball....some magical footwork by Sooriyabandara or Sudham to put us in space and a try to follow.
Perfect start Sri Lanka 8, UAE 0. Coach Woods equally gut nervous till the boys settle.
Our Achilles heel has been the looming colours of Korea ...who have nudged us out of too many assignments both seniors and juniors.
Best not ask Naveen H or coach Nilufer Ibrahim their opinion on Koreans in Hong Kong?
Alas the reality is very much a crocs jaw for Sri vs Korea in the middle under pressure.
I imagine maximum impact and effort from Muthu...Jason D and Gayan Weere to win the physical contest on the deck and securing solid Korean ball for us to run.
If we beat Korea on the deck, at the breakdowns...we have reason to ice bath for the quarterfinal line ups.
Dramatically once in the quarters we are on our way...the podium and medals...close enough to taste.
Vital that our focus from quarters to semi is not about the big WIN...but absolutes about playing our unit skills and doing our jobs max...
Under pressure or not ...we must be clinical to full time and satisfaction from good 7s Sri Lanka.
Let’s raise our mind energy for the 7s team at the Asian Games and the fabulous prospect of a medal on the flight home.....a huge embrace for sport fans...who had very little to celebrate from the games so far.
Perfect corner flag to direct choice insult in all 3 national languages ...ss to why the Sri women’s team missed out again ...no. 6 in Asia and not playing ...I hope the union provide adequate facts on this compelling oversight.
Fair call to ask the powers that rule what our 7s ambitions are...Asia wide over the next 3 years?
Does the plan include maximum growth in the player population…and equally important that we play matches till we are blue in the face.
What is our priority...especially since World rugbys focal point is the womens 7s.
Glad to get off my soap box and contemplate how good team spirit and morale in the camp.
From all the rugby hearts in Sri paradise ....play hard and sharpest in the middle...we believe that this is going to be new history for 7s and much to cheer from our sunny rooftops.
Bula bula Muthu and the boys...pride for Sri and fly the flag.
