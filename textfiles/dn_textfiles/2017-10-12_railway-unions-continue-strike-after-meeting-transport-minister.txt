Railway Unions to continue strike after meeting with Transport Minister

 
Railway unions have resolved to continue the strike due to the response received at the meeting held with Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, today.
The sudden train strike which was launched last evening resulted in a tense situation at the Colombo Fort and Maradana Railway stations.
All trains starting from Colombo Fort and Maradana, were cancelled due to trade union action staged by the engine drivers and railway guards.
Sources said the trade union action resulted due to talks between trade unions and higher officials breaking down over the recruitment of engine driver assistants.
