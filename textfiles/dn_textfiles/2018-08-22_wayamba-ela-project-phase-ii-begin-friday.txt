Wayamba Ela Project Phase II to begin Friday

The inauguration of the second phase of the Wayamba Ela Project would be held on Friday (24), at Polpithigama, Yapahuwa, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Addressing the media, yesterday, at the Mahaweli Centre, Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera said that water from the Mahaweli river would be diverted from the Eastern Province to the Northern Province under the scheme, adding that it would help convert the dry zone in to a wet zone.
“The Wayamba Province is one of the key provinces for paddy as well as other cultivations, and this historical project launched by President Maithripala Sirisena will make the province a bath koralaya once more,” Minister Perera said.
This project was launched by President Sirisena in 2016, with the intention of providing an adequate supply of water during the Yala and Maha seasons for farmers, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera added that with the completion of the project, the government would be able to save a considerable sum of money spent for importing of green legumes, oil crops and fruits, while also enhancing inland fisheries and creating greater employment opportunities.
Disaster Management Minister Dumunda Silva said that around eight large tanks and 353 smaller tanks were to be developed under the project, adding that was also expected to facilitate uninterrupted irrigation facilities to 12,500 hectares of farmlands.
“Around 13,500 farmer families will benefit from the project, and it will also provide indirect benefits to another 80,000 farmer families,” he added.
