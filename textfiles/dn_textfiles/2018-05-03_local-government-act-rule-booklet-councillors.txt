Local Government Act rule booklet for councillors

All newly-elected councilors to local bodies countrywide would be provided with a printed booklet containing the rules and regulations of the new Local Government Act, Kurunegala District Senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake said.
He was addressing a meeting for councillors attached to local bodies of the Kurunegala district held yesterday in Bingiriya.
All councillors are to be provided with three-day practical training sessions in order for them to have a better understanding on their responsibilities. About 8,700 councillors from 340 local bodies countrywide have been elected and most of them had commenced their official duties. Around 1,991 of them are females, Jayathilake said.
To make them aware of their responsibilities, the Local Government Ministry had made the arrangements at a higher cost, he added.
