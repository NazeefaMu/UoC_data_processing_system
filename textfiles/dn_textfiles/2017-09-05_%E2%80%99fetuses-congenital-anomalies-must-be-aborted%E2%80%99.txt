’Fetuses with congenital anomalies must be aborted’

Fetuses with congenital anomalies should be detected early and aborted, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
When a deformed is born, its entire life will be an agony, the minister had stated. The proposal to abort fetuses with congenital malformation and fetuses conceived out of rape will be submitted to the Cabinet once the Health Ministry receives the proposal in writing.
