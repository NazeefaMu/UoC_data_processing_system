Schools Relay Championships from June 24

The All Island Schools Relay Championship 2018 – is to take place from June 24 to 26 at the Vincent Dias stadium in Badulla. The opening ceremony is scheduled for 24thmorning with Chief Minister of Uva Province Chamara Sampath Dassanayake and State Minster for Education V. Radhakrishnan as chief guests.
Minister Akila Viraj addressing the media said the the Championship which commenced in the year 1984 came to halt in the year 2004 due to unkown reasons. Taking up duties as Minister of Education the ministry decided to relaunch the championship1i 2016 which was held in Kandy minus any sponsors. The first Championship was a initiative taken by the present advisor to the ministry of Education Sunil Jayaweera.
When the matter was taken up for discussion he whole heatedly agreed to commence the Championship and it is our duty to thank Jayaweera for carrying out this daunting task on grand scale in 2016 said the Minister.
Adding further he noted that at present junior athletes have come ahead of the senior athletes by winning medals at the recently concluded Junior Athletic Championships held in Japan.
This proves that if the junior sportsmen and women are nurtured well from their tender age they are sure to continue their sporting careers and winning streak bringing glory to the country. The ministry decided to recruit nearly 5000 Physical trainers few months ago and we already selected them and will posted schools that minus PTIs said the Minister. Once they are appointed all school children will get the opportunity of getting the right training from these PTIs.
I am sure once this part is completed every child will be engaged in some kind sport which will also keep them healthy throughout their lives.
Minister paid a special tribute to Nestle Lanka Ltd. for spending a huge amount of money especially for schools sporting activities. If not for support their Education Department would never be able to organize this sort of mega events throughout the country said the Minister. Sunil Jayaweera speaking said that the Championships will be conducted in five age categories for Boys and Girls (Under 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20).
Already 488 schools from all parts of the country have confirmed their participation where nearly 8000 competitors could be seen in action on these three days.
A total of 38 events are listed for competition there will be heats, quarters, semifinals and finals too are to be competed by these young athletes from both categories, said Jayaweera.
