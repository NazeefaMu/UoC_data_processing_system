Hyundai Kona crossover to arrive next year

Hyundai has just announced its new B-segment ‘Kona’ crossover, with plans for an all-electric model to be introduced in 2018.
The Kona EV, which will share a platform with sister company Kia's Stonic crossover, is part of the brand's focus on alternatively fuelled vehicles. Hyundai recently launched the Ioniq hatchback, which is available as a hybrid, plug-in hybrid (PHEV) or full electric model - the first car from any manufacturer to be offered with three different electric drive options.
Hyundai plans to introduced 30 new models in the next three years, including more fuel cell vehicles like its ix35, as part of a clean mobility strategy.
The specifics of the Kona's power systems are yet to be revealed. It's likely to use a system similar to that found in the Ioniq Electric, which uses a 28kWh lithium-ion polymer to power an 88kW motor. This generates 118bhp and 295Nm of torque, giving the Ioniq a range of 174 miles - a little shy of the Kona's 242-mile target.
Hyundai Motor Company vice chairman Euisun Chung said: ‘We are targeting a mass production of EV from next year. The Kona EV may be able to go over 390km (242 miles) using all electric power.’
