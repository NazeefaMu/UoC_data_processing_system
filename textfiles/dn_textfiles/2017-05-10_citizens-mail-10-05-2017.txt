Stinking problem
It is a matter for regret that the garbage clearing along Peradeniya road, Kandy seems to be very slow and unsatisfactory. The garbage collectors are not regular in collecting the polythene bags of household waste foods and other rotten particles kept outside the houses, hotels and groceries. As a result, the stray dogs often rip the debris bags open and scatter the rotten fruits and vegetables. Some garbage has been taken out of these bags to the middle of the main road by the dogs and birds. This unpleasant scene causes hindrance to the pedestrians and motorists.
Hence, the KMC has a great responsibility to pay heed to discontinuation of this irregular clearing of the garbage dumped here and there along the Peradeniya road which needs cleanliness and proper maintenance because of its close proximity to Kandy city which is a great tourist centre.
As a resident of this area, I fervently appeal to the Municipal authorities to take prompt action against the irregularity of garbage clearing by the workers engaged in this essential service.
