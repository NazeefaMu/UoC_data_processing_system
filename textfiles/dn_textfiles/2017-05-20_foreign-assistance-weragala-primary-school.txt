Foreign assistance for Weragala Primary School

The Weragala Primary School established in 1970 lacks teachers and other basic facilities.
The school has only one building while four classes are conducted in a temporary hut.
Principal Mahinda Senanayake and the staff have taken measures to construct a building with villagers’ assistance.
But they could not find enough money to complete the construction. The Millennium Elephant Foundation then came forward and provided them with Rs 200,000 to construct the building.
