Hound notes

As pet lovers, it is no surprise we lavish our affections, and cash, on them. But did you know dog owners spend £14billion a year pampering their hounds?
That works out at £1,730 a year each. Some blow up to £10,000 on grooming, jabs and food, the Dogs Trust charity said.
Emmie Steven, 30, has spent £60,000 on her 12 pets in seven years, including £10,000 on a “wedding” for staffie Bailey and shih tzu Coco.
Emmie, of Croydon, South London, who also has jackapoo Muffin, said, “They had full attire, a best man, bridesmaids and rings.”
Cockerpoo Lola, Helena Mueller’s pet in Cambridge, has a £100 monthly allowance.
Helena, 38, whose outfits match Lola’s, has son Harry, seven, but says, “I love Lola more.”
Nicole Lane, 30, of Coventry, whose pug Barry has been in ads, has spent £2,000 on goodies and said, “He’s my world.”
