OPPO launches entry level A83 selfie expert phone

OPPO the Selfie expert unveiled its latest entry-level camera phone – The OPPO A83. The A83 is equipped with a full screen display, a feature rarely seen in products of this price range.
Together with OPPO’s A.I. beauty recognition technology, A83 brings a more realistic and natural selfie experience to more young consumers, along with the 3GB RAM and 3180 mAh battery as a whole makes the A83 a versatile product.
The OPPO A83 is now available in black and gold colour variants across country through offline stores.
OPPO Lanka CEO Bob Li, said, “The A.I technology has become popular with our young customers. They love being able to express their individuality. The OPPO A83 is our way of bringing the same technology to entry-level camera phone users at an affordable price to let them enjoy the same benefits and find joy in self-expression.”
OPPO has planned to conduct a special promotion to encourage the customers who purchase OPPO A83 from selected stores island wide on 27th of January and chance to win valuable gifts.
The F-series and A-series products from OPPO, particularly the integrated beauty function, have proved to be especially popular among the young and trendy.
OPPO A83 is the new generation selfie expert. It comes with an 8 MP front lens + 13 MP rear lens, and uses the A.I.
In simple terms, the A.I. Beauty Recognition Technology is like a thinking photographer rather than a rigid software program. OPPO's A.I. beauty recognition technology employs a cloud database from premium suppliers that have sufficient power to support diversified facial recognition in smart terminals. For shots with moving subjects, issues such as structural and face deformation often occur.
A83 measures 5.7 inches, but the size of the screen is now 5 inches with the bezel ratio of the device being extremely narrow at 18:9, a major improvement over past models.
A83 is also equipped with face unlock. Just align the phone with your face to unlock the phone quickly. You no longer have to worry about aligning your finger or wet hands anymore.
OPPO A83 is tailored for outstanding performance and to where it matters most for young consumers. The super-large 3GB operating memory allows young people to enjoy their favorite games while three independent card slots (Double Nano-SIM cards with the TF slot) enable users to have 2 mobile numbers for phone calls, and also to extend the phone memory to 256GB.
