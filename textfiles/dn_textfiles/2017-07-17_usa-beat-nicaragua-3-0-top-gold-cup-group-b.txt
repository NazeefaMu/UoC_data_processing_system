USA beat Nicaragua 3-0 to top Gold Cup Group B

LOS ANGELES AFP July16, 2017 The United States survived two missed penalties to beat Nicaragua 3-0 in Cleveland on Saturday and reach the Gold Cup quarter-finals as winners of Group B.
Goals from Joe Corona, Kelyn Rowe and Matt Miazga lifted the Americans against a lively Nicaragua side.
Bruce Arena's men went into the contest needing a three-goal win to top the group after Panama's 3-0 win over Martinique in the opening match of the day's double-header. For a time it looked as if they wouldn't get there, but Chelsea defender Miazga's 88th minute header spared the Americans from a quarter-final date with dangerous Costa Rica. Miazga earned his third international cap as Arena changed all 11 of his starters from the side that edged minnows Martinique on Wednesday.
The United States threatened early as Rowe fired straight at Nicaragua keeper Justo Lorente in the seventh minute.
Dom Dwyer and Zusi also went close, the latter surging into the box but firing straight at Lorente.
It was Corona who grabbed the opener in the 36th minute.
Alejandro Bedoya's cross from the right found Corona, whose shot from the top of the area was deflected inside the near post.
They doubled the advantage in the 56th, when Rowe, played through by Bedoya, beat Lorente for his first international goal.
But two second-half chances from the spot went begging. Dwyer's penalty attempt, after the English-born striker was brought down in the box, was easily saved by Lorente. After Rowe's goal, a Daniel Cadena handball gave the American's another chance, but Corona's effort was also saved.
