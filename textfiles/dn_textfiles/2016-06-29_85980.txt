Desert Cubs back with more teams

UAE: Desert Cubs Cricket Academy is once again gearing up for yet another stint in Sri Lanka from July 5 to 15 as part of its annual summer tour, and on this occasion will also face up to the new challenge of playing two day games against top quality school teams.
Speaking to Daily News, Presley Polonnowita founder and Head Coach, Desert Cubs Cricket Academy said, “This year, the Academy will fly over 5 junior teams in the age categories of Under 11, 13, 15 and 18 to the Paradise Island.
“The U-18 team will be captained by the current UAE U-19 skipper Waruna Perera, who will be well supported by a few other junior UAE squad members, including two talented girls as well.”
He further said “This will be the 6th tour to Sri Lanka by Desert Cubs since its inception. The main reason for exposing the Academy’s kids to Sri Lankan school cricket frequently is because the island nation is famed for maintaining one of best junior cricket structures in the world”.
The 2016 tour kicks off in the southern part of Sri Lanka where the beautiful and historical Galle Cricket Stadium is located.
Then the kids will travel up to central hills to face the best of the Kandy schools. The two day games are all slated to be worked off in Kandy amidst the pleasant weather conditions. The Academy’s youngsters will be fortunate to pit their skills against both St. Anthony’s College and Trinity College which produced ‘Murali’ and ‘Sanga’ respectively.
The final leg of the tour will culminate with matches in the commercial capital Colombo where the kids will compete against quality opposition at first class venues or top level school grounds.’
A Gala Dinner and award presentation will herald at the end of the tour on July 15.
The Founder and Head Coach of Desert Cubs Presley Polonnowita is thankful to its sponsors for their continued support and commitment.
