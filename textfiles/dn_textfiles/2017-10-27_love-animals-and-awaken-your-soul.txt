Love animals and awaken your soul!

After having helped many stray animals through Animal Welfare Trust over the years, its founder Irangani De Silva’s current focus is on the legal side of animal welfare.
De Silva who has been an animal rights activist since 2005 says that currently court cases keep her occupied.
“It is a pathetic situation,” she said.
“I have faced very bad situations with officers from dog pounds in the past when we were focusing more on animal rescue. When my husband was the Health Minister, my daughter pressured him into speaking to the President about banning animal slaughter. My daughter was disgusted by how the strays were being treated in our country,” she recalled.
De Silva says it is indeed great to find many animal activists in the country unlike in the past.
“I thought I will carry on with addressing the problems at courts. Most of the time I have to attend many court cases, especially Cattle Cases in areas such as Badulla, Ambilipitiya, Ambalangoda, Minuwangoda,” she explained.
She argues that the existing laws are insufficient to protect animals.
“I am very happy about what I was able to do on behalf of animals. However I’m not satisfied with laws and regulations existing in our country. In 2009, an amendment was made for the animal welfare act yet still people are not acting by it. I’m the only person who spends all my time going to courts to release cattle. Even after doing so much, there is no appreciation for any of the work,” she said regretfully.
De Silva explained how Sri Lankans should work together to make the country a better place for animals.
“We have to create awareness. We are expecting the animal welfare bill to solve most of the problems. If it is published, we don’t really know how some people will react. They might have a different attitude towards it. In my thoughts the future generation has the capability to bring about a change,” she said.
However she feels Colombo is a far better place today for animals.
“Colombo is a much better place now as there are fewer problems. Many people are aware and we see many animal lovers. People read and feel for animals over here. In rural areas, they are still killing many animals. Even now many elephants and dogs are being killed. It will take many years for those areas to improve,” she added.
Stressing on the legal system and the laws regarding animal protection in Sri Lanka she says “It’s definitely not sufficient. We have included all the new laws in the animal welfare bill. After it is introduced in Parliament I think there will be an improvement. Elephant cases will have to be addressed more strictly. The fines and charges are not enough. Everyday there is a court case regarding cattle. They must raise the standards and laws and charge higher fines.”
England was the first country to implement laws to protect animals in 1911. The British Government had publicly stated that animals are important beings not merely commodities. Many countries including Germany, Switzerland, Slovania, Brazil afford constitutional protection to animals.
“We are also trying to do this in Sri Lanka. We should adapt these from other countries. Wild animals need to be protected. Even India takes strict actions against slaughter of cattle and they no longer send any elephants to different countries. Comparing to other countries we are very much behind and we need to come forward. We have to refrain from sending animals abroad,” De Silva said.
Human-elephant conflict
Elephants and humans are not getting along in Sri Lanka, it is more apparent than anywhere else. Each year in Sri Lanka 50 people are killed by elephants. At the same time, many poor farmers haven't changed their daily lives for hundreds of years but their crops and villages are being threatened. As urbanization comes into play, the elephants have no where else to go and end up in fields searching for food.
Stressing on this matter she says “Humans are to be blamed completely. The fault is ours. There should be a national policy to overcome this situation. We have been telling the government from the beginning that we need a national policy to protect the wild. People are taking up the lands elephants live and expecting the animals to be silent. I’m totally against elephants being blamed. All this is man made conflicts. We need to maintain international standards.”
“The Animal Welfare Bill is pending for over 10 years. It was recommended by the Law Commission in 2006 to replace the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance of 1907 which is a weak law that cannot deal with the enormous animal cruelty issues which are on the increase. The fine for animal cruelty in the Ordinance is Rs.100 and the Ordinance does not apply to all animal species. The Animal Welfare Bill on the other hand, has very stringent penalties and recognizes a variety of new offences and defines “animal” as any living being other than a human being – a very wide definition. The Bill also provides for a National Animal Welfare Authority with a lot of powers to prevent animal cruelty.
Its enactment has been hampered by groups with vested interests such as those in the animal slaughter industry who say that welfare provisions will affect their businesses. The poultry industry says it will even affect the economy of the country. When irresponsible statements like that are made it is very sad. What is the message this gives to the world? That Sri Lanka, a Buddhist country, is dependent on the meat industry for economic survival. We have discussed the need to get the Bill passed soon with many persons including Cabinet Ministers, Parliamentarians, and officials. A group of us has even sought relief from the Court of Appeal to get the Bill expedited. The court is monitoring its progress,” she said.
