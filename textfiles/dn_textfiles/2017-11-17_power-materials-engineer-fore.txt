The power of the materials  engineer to the fore

University of Moratuwa's materials science and engineering (MSE) department via its research and development, training, testing and consultancy capabilities is on a quest to foster an endemic engineering culture of material science and engineering in Sri Lanka.
The annual Department-Industry consultative board meeting provides a forum for meaningful interaction between the industry and department staff.
The University’s MSE Department Head, Sampath Weragoda, in an exclusive interview with the ‘Daily News’ elaborated on MSE’s capabilities and its vision of contributing towards sustainable development of the country.
Q. What is meant by materials engineering?
Materials engineering enhance materials to perform at higher level to manufacture world-class products at low cost.
MSE is a combination of chemistry, physics and mathematics that contributes towards product innovation via R&D, stringent quality testing and cost reduction.
Materials engineering basically is studying the properties and characteristics of materials to learn how they behave when they are subject to varied conditions when used in the industry. A materials engineer will know exactly how materials will perform in that structure, based on the molecular makeup of the material.
Conventionally material engineering covers three different areas that are metals, ceramics and polymers aka rubber and plastics.
In contemporary times, material engineering is more bound towards nano technology, smart materials and molecular modelling where the behavior of molecules is simulated via computer programs. Here the molecular makeup is fed into computer program to ascertain its behavior in adverse situations when the material is used in manufacturing.
Q. What is the key object of this annual event of Moratuwa University’s MSE department?
Department of materials science and engineering is the only academic body in Sri Lanka that produces engineering graduates who are specialized in materials science and engineering.
The key object of MSE’s annual event is to obtain feedback from the industry sector on performances of Moratuwa University’s material engineers serving in the sector. We ascertain the adequacy of our graduate program to operate in the industry and seek innovative thoughts from the industry to enhance our program to suit the latter.
With a deeper insight to corporate life, university lecturers too could develop case studies and real-life examples that will endow students with the knowledge of genuine industry needs.
Emphasis is made on research and development and product innovation.
Financial support if needed for research projects of the respective sectors is available via the National Science Foundation, aka NSF, whose main task is to promote science and technology in Sri Lanka.
Moratuwa University too has funds available for industry based research with state-of-the-art analytical equipment and research laboratory that could be utilized by the former.
Q. How could Moratuwa University’s MSE department contribute to enhance our country’s GDP?
Sri Lankan industry sector was traditional in orientation. It had not been exposed to newest technology and lacked knowledge on materials engineering.
It has now realized the need for innovation to rub shoulders with the international scenario. To create more volume of marketable products at a lower cost, highly technologically oriented input is needed.
The Chinese market has sophisticated low-cost products. With mass production and export markets they benefit from economies of scale. If Sri Lanka is techno-savvy we could follow suit.
Integration between the university, state sector, business community and the government is vital to reap benefits from materials engineers’ capabilities.
Q. What are the potential markets for MSE experts in this country?
Sri Lankan material engineers are yet to be fully utilized by the industry sector. Apart from NSF, our graduates are currently absorbed mostly by the construction sector. However material engineers are highly capable of contributing to the manufacturing sector too. Thus the manufacturing sector is our potential market.
Usually, Sri Lanka’s manufacturing sector contributes 16-17 percent to the GDP. In 2014, there was a value addition of one trillion rupees from this sector contributed by 16,000-odd individual establishments. Hence there is a vast untapped market potential in the country for materials engineers and a proactive approach is needed.
