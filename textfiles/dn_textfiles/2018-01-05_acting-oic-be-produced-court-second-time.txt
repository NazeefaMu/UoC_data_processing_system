Acting OIC to be produced in court for second time

Divulapitiya Police Station OIC, IP Sumith Premakumara who was arrested by the CID on Tuesday (2) evening, was to be produced before the Negombo Magistrate’s Court for the second time yesterday afternoon, having been remanded for just a day on Wednesday (3) evening.
The Acting OIC had been arrested for having neglected his duties and thus being indirectly responsible for the death of a 50 year old inmate under custody in the Negombo Prison in October last year.
Negombo Police had earlier arrested the Divulapitiya Crimes OIC, IP Saman Priyankara who was held directly responsible for the inmate’s death.
Priyankara along with two others; an IP and a constable of the Divulapitiya Police Station were also transferred to Peliyagoda Police last year as a result of the incident.
