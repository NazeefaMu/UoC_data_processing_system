Happy learning

A happy learning was started in the Grade three classes at the Addalaichenai Iqrah Vidyalaya under the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone recently.
This program was organized by the School Principal A LYazeen.
Sweets belonging to all communities were distributed among the students at the event. Students’ arts and handicraft items were also exhibited. The students exhibited items which were made using house waste and other products.
