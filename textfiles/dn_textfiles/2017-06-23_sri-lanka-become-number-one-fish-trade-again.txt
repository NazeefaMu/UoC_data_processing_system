Sri Lanka to become number one in fish trade again

Sri Lanka will climb back to number one position from the fourth place in the world fish market within a few years, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said Sri Lanka was the decider of the world fish market a few years ago. The fisheries industry received a lot of benefits when Europe lifted the ban on fish exports and with the GSP Plus facility, he said.
Minister Amaraweera said about 40 percent of fish harvest of the country get destroyed before exporting. Arrangements will be made to prevent this, he said. The minister said the fish export stands below the tenth place among exportation by Sri Lanka. It is expected to climb up to the third place by 2020. Three aquaculture parks will be constructed, he said.
A Crab City will be constructed in the Hambantota district. Around 100,000 new jobs will be generated by 2020. Around 10,000 jobs have been generated. Waterproof tabs will be provided to fishermen, the minister said. Sri Lanka imports 120,000 metric tons of fish and fish products, but exports only 18,000 metric tons.
This will be changed in the future. Importing fish and fish products cannot be stopped overnight, the minister Amaraweera said.
