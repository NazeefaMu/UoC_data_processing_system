UK aid to combat human trafficking

The United Kingdom is proposing more aid to Commonwealth countries including Sri Lanka to combat human trafficking.
The UK Home Office said Wednesday that Sri Lanka would have access to a new, more than two million pound package to strengthen law enforcement and support new legislation.
“This is a global problem which requires a global response, which is why all countries must unite to end this to make these brutal crimes will be a thing of the past,” said British Home Secretary Amber Rudd in a statement. To that end, “the UK continues to work with our Commonwealth neighbours to strengthen their response to human trafficking and child exploitation,” she said.
“Two million pounds will be allocated to strengthen law enforcement and justice systems in fighting human trafficking in India, Sri Lanka, Malawi and Zambia, the Home Office release said.
“Another 500,000 pounds will support “tough new legislation” to combat human trafficking and forced labour in Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uganda, Bangladesh, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, and Sri Lanka,the release added. Also at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting this week, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that she deeply regretted the legacy of colonial laws criminalising homosexuality. “Nobody should face discrimination or persecution because of who they are or who they love,” she said.
“I am all too aware that these laws were often put in place by my own country,” she added.
“They were wrong then and they are wrong now.”
She urged countries like Sri Lanka to update their “outdated” anti-gay laws to ensure equality for all people.
