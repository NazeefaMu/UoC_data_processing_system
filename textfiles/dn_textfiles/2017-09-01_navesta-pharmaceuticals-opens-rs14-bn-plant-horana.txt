Navesta Pharmaceuticals opens Rs1.4 bn plant in Horana

Navesta Pharmaceuticals Private Limited has set the benchmark for the local pharmaceutical manufacturing sector by opening the Country’s first sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Horana.
Navesta Pharmaceuticals is Sri Lanka’s first European Union Good Manufacturing Practices (EU-GMP) and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-Operation Scheme (PIC/S), compliant facility which will enable the Company to export their products to most global markets that accepts these accreditations.
Additionally, the facility is also equipped with the Country’s first EU-GMP compliant A and B Grade Microbiology (MB) laboratory, capable of carrying out comprehensive, advanced in-house testing methodologies. Navesta Pharmaceuticals will primarily meet the local demand of 12 products in the Penicillin category (antibiotic drugs that are a part of the Beta Lactam group of medicines) dry powder injectable that were previously imported to the Country. The plant was formally declared open by the Chief Guest, President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday.
Chairman of Navesta Pharmaceuticals, Sanjaya Jayaratne said, “We have and will continue to generate numerous employment opportunities for Sri Lankans who specialise in pharmaceutical fields such as Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Chemistry, Pharmacy and Engineering as well as Sri Lankans who are interested in developing this new industry further. Most importantly, Navesta’s ultimate aim is to provide a reliable, vertically integrated local supply chain which will provide accessibility of high quality pharmaceuticals for our citizens. All our efforts surround the idea that we as a company, have a social responsibility to this generation and the next in providing our citizens better opportunities of a livelihood through our continual industry development, reinvestment in the communities, and empowerment of our employees to carry this vision forward for Sri Lanka.”
The Guest of Honour at the inauguration was the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Dr. Rajitha Seneratne. In addition, a host of other distinguished guests graced the occasion.
