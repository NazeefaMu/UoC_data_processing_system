Army donates house for needy family

Security Force Headquarters - East (SFHQ-E) coordinated the construction of a new house for a needy family at Maithreegama, Welikanda after a request made by Meerigama ‘Gauthama Daruwo Arya Foundation’ - the sponsors for the project.
The house recipient, Anura Kumara, a father of two who does not have a permanent source of income, was earlier living in a hut made of wattle and daub.
After information was received about him, army personnel visited the location and built a new house for the family within a few weeks.
Major General Nandana Senadeera, Commander, Security Forces - East (SF-E) was the Chief Guest at the house-warming ceremony.
He symbolically handed over the keys of the new house to Anura Kumara.
Representatives of the ‘Gauthama Daruwo Arya Foundation’, Brigadier General Staff of the SFHQ-E, Brigadier Athula Hennadige and others participated.
