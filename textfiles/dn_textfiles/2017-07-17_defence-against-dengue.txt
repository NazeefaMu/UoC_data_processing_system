Defence against dengue

Around 90,000 dengue patients and around 270 dengue deaths had been reported from all parts of Sri Lanka. This time it is Type II of dengue which has more complications than the other three types of dengue. Therefore the leading dengue experts in the country have come to the fore to educate the public on how to keep safe from dengue.
The Consultant epidemiologist attached to the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry Dr Samitha Ginige:
The persons who suffered from dengue fever and get cured should take adequate rest. Otherwise, they will face various difficulties. The duration of the rest depends on the person’s condition and how she or he feels. The recovered persons should not start their normal routine until they feel normal and energetic. Especially the children should take adequate rest until they feel normal and energetic. The parents should not force the recovered children to attend sports, tuition classes etc if the children do not feel energetic.
When a person develops fever, he or she should seek medical advice immediately without getting delayed. The majority of dengue patients died due to the delay of seeking medical advice. It is very important to seek prompt medical advice for any type of fever from a qualified doctor or a hospital.
The National Coordinator of the National Dengue Control Programme Dr Hasitha Tissera:
For patients infected with the dengue virus, the incubation period for some persons can be around 15 days while some others show symptoms within three or four days. Some do not show any symptoms at all and some show symptoms such as fever. Some others show symptoms such as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF). The current dengue outbreak is Type II which has a severe impact on dengue patients than other three types. All the people should pay special attention to prevent mosquito bites and entering mosquitoes into their homes, offices, schools etc.
The people can protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing long sleeves / fully covered dresses during the day time, applying mosquito repellents (the mosquito repellent should be applied on the skin and repeat applying after few hours.
The most popular mosquito repellent is Citronella oil. It can be applied by mixing with 50 percent of coconut oil or something similar in order to reduce its mild burning sensation. Adults can apply both natural and artificial mosquito repellents. Mosquito repellents are not suitable for the infants below two years. Natural mosquito repellents should be used for the children between two and five years).
The mosquito nets should be used while sleeping both day and night. House screening (windows and doors) to prevent entry of mosquitoes, keeping bedrooms, kitchen and toilets well-lit, ventilated and airy to prevent hiding of adult female mosquitoes inside houses,
The Clinical Head of the Centre for Clinical Management of Dengue and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, Negombo, Dr Lakkumara Fernando:
Using mosquito repellents is very important to prevent dengue. The mosquitoes get infected with the dengue virus by biting dengue patients. When people get infected with one type of dengue virus, they can have life long immunity against that specific type. But unfortunately, this `immunity’ is not similar to the immunity people get when they suffer from chickenpox or measles.
The other important issue is they can get infected with other three types of dengue at any moment. If a person has the dengue virus inside his body even without any visible symptoms (fever or anything), he or she can infect mosquitoes and when that mosquito bites a healthy person, he or she gets dengue. In few days, the dengue virus grows rapidly and into a strong position inside the bodies of dengue mosquitoes.
The dengue patients should understand that a person or a substance (may be the juice of papaya leaves) gets the credit when the dengue patient’s platelets count goes up naturally when the body responds to the virus naturally. Therefore however much a dengue patient takes a certain substance or not, his/her platelets count goes up naturally when the right time comes.
Consultant Physician, Infectious Diseases Hospital and well known Dengue Specialist Dr Ananda Wijewickrama:
Seek medical advice for fever as soon as possible. The people should suspect that they suffer from dengue even when their family members suffer from a normal viral flu. Full Blood Count should be tested in 48 hours and even the result is normal, the test should be repeated in another 24 hours.
The fever patients should not ignore fever even the fever goes down in a day or two. They must do the blood tests after the fever goes down. The blood report should be forwarded to a doctor as soon as possible after obtaining it from the hospital or the laboratory.
No one needs to get admitted to a hospital immediately after becoming positive for the dengue virus (NS1). But he or she needs to follow certain pieces of advice strictly. They should not take any other medication except Paracetamol. They need a full rest.
There is no impact on the dengue patient when the platelets count goes down. Therefore nothing should be done to increase the low platelets count. It goes up naturally by the seventh day of fever no matter what we eat or drink. What needs to be focused on is the pulse rate, blood pressure, urine output, breathing, and the result of the blood test called PCV. The problem is not the low platelets count. It is haemorrhage and plasma leakage. Treatment is required only for the dengue patients who develop severe complications.
