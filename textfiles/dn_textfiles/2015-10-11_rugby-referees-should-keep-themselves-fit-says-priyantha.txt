Rugby referees should keep themselves fit, says Priyantha

Rugby Referees should keep themselves fit as they will have to do a lot of running at times more than the players as they will have to have an eye on the ball as well as the players if they are to do a good job of work, said the newly elected President of the Central Province Rugby Referees Union (CPRRU) Priyantha Gunaratne.

Priyantha Gunaratne
Rugby referees have a tough task to perform as rugby has a huge spectator following and most of them are versed in the laws of the game which are complex. But this does not mean that you should play to the gallery. You are the sole judge and you must take the decisions in accordance to the rules. Do not take notice of the spectator remarks as you cannot please all people. What is so important is to play to the rules and do not yield to pressures. Their may be complaints but do not take any notice. Above all you must be satisfied that you had done a good job. You cannot please all people.
Rugby referees should attend seminars and refresher courses regularly and keep oneself versed in the latest changes of the laws. Unlike in the good old days, at present most of the examinations are conducted in Sri Lanka by the Rugby Coach Education Department of the Sri Lanka Rugby Union. In the past this was done either in England or Australia and now we can do it locally and is recognised by the International Rugby Board (IRB). Last year we did a level 3 course in Kandy.
Both the schools and club rugby season may commence in a few months time and we must get ready from now onwards.
Priyantha Gunaratne who took over the post of President from Aruna Rankothge is a top rugby referees with experience in refereeing matches both in Sri Lanka and abroad. He has also refereed the prestigious Bradby Shield encounter and at all levels of club matches except the Clifford Cup finals in which his home town club Kandy Sports Club is always figured.
