Nemsiri Mutukumara
A purveyor of Buddhist news
The 12th death anniversary of Nemsiri Mutukumara, Associate Editor of the Ceylon Daily News, veteran journalist, writer, broadcaster, advertising consultant and international Buddhist activist, fell on September 15, this year.
His loss is deeply felt by the international Buddhist community in which he had been an active participant for more than four decades. He is still remembered for his pioneering role in the early 1970’s to organize the world Buddhist youth to be internationally active. His leadership in the movement was recognized when he was unanimously elected the founding President of the World Fellowship of Buddhist Youth in 1972. His devoted services to both this organization and its parent body the World Fellowship of Buddhists are regularly recalled with grateful appreciation as it was done at the General Conference of the two organizations held in Taiwan.
The international community misses Nemsiri’s dedicated service as a purveyor of Buddhist news in the current year. His unassuming and genial personality won him many admirers.
Whenever an issue had to be faced, he showed unusual courage and determination. He would use his excellent command of written and spoken English and Sinhala to combat all opposition. He often did in the background as a patient negotiator who would convince people of his point of view and enable important decisions to be taken in an imformed an objective manner.
Nemsiri was educated at Vidyaloka Vidyalaya in Galle and Prince of Wales’ College, Moratuwa. He has started youth work as a member of the UNP Youth league in Moratuwa in 1950 as a student of Prince of Wales’ College, Moratuwa.
He worked in the Post and Telecommunications Department as a Postmaster for nine years and served as a secretary of the Union of Post and Telecommunication Officers.
Nemsiri’s journalistic career at Lake House covered a period of 35 years. He was a outstanding writer and a journalist and rose to the position of Associate Editor of the prestigious English Daily; the Ceylon Daily News.
He adorned its poya day page with information reflective and practical articles, conveying sagacious messages.
Nemsiri, without confining his writing abilities to the newspaper, started an international Buddhist magazine ‘New World Buddhism’ for propagating Buddhism throughout the world. His work on Dr. Gunapala Malalasekera are invaluable tributes to the founder of the World Fellowship of Buddhists. He has widely travelled in Asia and Europe. He became the founder vice president of the Asian Youth Council based in Kuala Lumpur and became the President of the Lanka Taruna Mandalaya, the national committee of the World Assembly of Youth based in Belgium. He was an active member of the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress and the Sri Lanka regional centre of the World Fellowship of Buddhists. Up to the time of his death, he had served as the chairman of the international committee on Dharmaduta service of the World Fellowship of Buddhists based in Bangkok.
The ‘Buddhist News Review’ broadcasted by the English service of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting cooperation, was compiled and presented by Nemsiri uninterruptedly more than 15 years, giving current affairs of Buddhist evens anywhere in the world.
He was a eloquent speaker and an excellent instant interpreter having an excellent command of both English and Sinhala.
Nemsiri never wanted any fame or self glory for all the Buddhist activities he carried out throughout his life here and abroad. His contribution towards the growth of Buddhism has created a great impact on the Buddhist community. Nemsiri’s deep concern for fellow humans and dedication to promote Buddhism did not end with his demise.
The most admirable act by Nemsiri was the donation of his dwelling house and property at No. 7, P. B. Alwis Perara Mawatha, Katubedda, Moratuwa and all moveable and immoveable articles for the use of Bhikkhu Sangha, Buddhist Nuns and students of Buddha Dhamma. This centre will pave way for many others to promote the noble teachings of the Buddha which was the Nemsiri’s one and only wish. Nemsiri’s memories will undoubtedly be treasured for generation to come and will serve as a source of inspirations for all those who wish to follow the Buddhist way of life.
May his journey in sansara be short and may he attain the ultimate bliss of Nibbana.

Daya Jayasundera
He was a loving father
Born to a family of five children as the eldest son of Don Edwin Jayasundera and Emelia Elawathi Jayasundera, my father, Don Dayarathna Jayasundera (better known as Daya Jayasundera) was brought up in Welipotha, Galle. He got his primary education in Welipotha Sri Wijayaraja Buddhist Mixed School and moved to Mahinda College, Galle, when he was in grade seven or eight following a short period of time at Aretheusa College, Colombo 6, under care of his maternal uncles.
At the age of 16, the effect of his mother’s death due to a womb cancer made him understand several realities of life at a very young age. Thereafter, he had become a vegetarian and took up many responsibilities of his younger siblings. Being a very methodical person by nature, he has guided and looked after his three sisters and brother. As a result of the conditions maintained at home, all of them have become very methodical, capable and disciplined persons despite the fact that their father had been away from home frequently due to the needs of his profession as a conductor in the plantation industry run by the British.
Following a successful school career at Mahinda College, Galle, he had entered the university of Peradeniya then know as Ceylon University. There, apart from the academic work, he had been an active member of the Buddhist Society and had been a member of the chorus in ‘Maname,’ the historical stage play by Prof. Ediriweera Sarathchandra when he created the drama originally taking university students for its cast.
After passing out from the university in 1956, Dayarathna Jayasundera started his career as a teacher at Vidyaloka Vidyalaya, Galle, completed his diploma in education and then joined the Balapitiya Teacher’s Training College as a lecturer and later joined the Unawatuna Amarasooriya Teacher’s Training College. There he was the principal for several years until he moved to Australia on a fellowship for a period of 10 months in 1983. In Australia, he studied further on teachers’ education and despite their offers to employ him there, he came back to the island at the end of 10 months.
But to his great disappointment, he was recruited in a UN Project related to the newly-introduced field of Life Skills in the school curriculum. I very well remember him commenting on this issue with frustration and at several occasions he has pointed out that we may live in a society where we are valued according to our qualifications, skills and abilities. He always emphasised the value of education and convinced us that it is the mainstay when a person is valued in a civilized society, but education is not the mere book knowledge or the number of certificates we possess.
The first thing he wanted for us to get a good wholesome education and if we decide that this is not the society for us to settle down, he told us clearly that we should not hinder our desire or decision because of them (the parents), instead we can go ahead with our decision and they will manage to look after themselves.
At the very beginning of his career, he had joined the Sri Lanka Army in its Volunteer Force as a Captain and since our small days, I have memories of him away from home for months on mobilization in far away areas like Jaffna, Mannar, Baticcoloa, etc. from time to time. During that period, we did not have telephone facilities and the mode of communication was only through letters. He frequently wrote to my mother and to the three of us, separate letters which came in one pack. He wrote to us giving many details, advice, instructions and even made corrections regarding what we wrote to him the previous times. Each of us had certain assigned duties at home even during small days. He always instructed us that we have to help at domestic chores and that is how we learnt to do things. He himself did lot of house work, setting an example.
As a very dedicated government servant, my father went for work almost around the calendar despite the school vacations and the week ends when he was the principal at the Training College. Then the principal at Mahinda College and as the Additional Director of Education for the Southern Province. Still he was very active at house hold work whenever his duty and social work permitted.
The time that all five of us got together was at the dinner table. There we discussed the events of the day what happened in school, in the tuition classes, in the bus or what interested us. My father used to give his views on certain events, corrected our views on certain issues and explained many important aspects. Now I realize that this habit has guided us immensely in building up our attitudes on life and society. What he always discouraged was talking about or taking an interest on other people’s affairs. And a topic we almost never discussed was politics. I remember that there were certain situations that he explained taking examples from Jathaka stories. We usually slept late and those dinner table discussions went on for hours. There was a particular habit, he never missed was writing a full page of a diary documenting the day’s important events. He dropped this habit only after he developed dementia around his mid-seventies.
My father was the most simple and humble person I have ever known. He had a light blue colour vespa which was the only vehicle he used in his life. He had bought it with his own money after he started earning. He always wore the full white national dress along with a block pair of tailor-made shoes. Even for the functions in the Army and when he went to Australia in 1983, that was his official dress. He had started wearing the national dress after he has passed out from the university and to the great disappointment of his father who had worked for the British, my father had not given up this dress even when his father had insisted, especially during the time he had been looking for a partner for his son.
He practiced honesty in every deed he carried out. During the times of school admissions for my brother and myself respectively in 1975 and 1977, he had not arranged to prove our residence in a false way as it is done nowadays, although he had sent applications to schools like Mahinda College, Richmound College, Southlands College and Sanghamitta College, which are not close by schools to our residence. As a result, he had to make appeals and I remember both of as started schooling at the end of the first terms. His policy at our school admissions was that he should not practice false and wrong things at the very beginning of our lives. All there of us had not been sent to pre-school and we were taught at home by our parents. I remember when he was eligible for the Government vehicle permit as the principal of Mahinda College, he did not apply for it as he thought that he does not have an adequate income as a government servant to maintain a brand-new vehicle and decided to be content with his vespa. He also said that it is wrong to obtain the permit if he is not going to buy the vehicle for himself.
His life was so simple as he had only limited needs and had no craving for luxuries. He was so calm as he respected everyone and so had no conflicts. He was never indebted as he was so economical and used to balance his expenses with his income. He was not bothered by stress or anxiety as he had nothing to conceal because honesty and transparency in everything were his policies. He was a devoted Buddhist by adhering to and practicing what the Buddha taught rather than paying homage with various worldly offerings. I feel my father is the perfect example for somebody to learn how we can lead stress-free life by just being simple in every aspect of our lives. He never had many plans and high expectations even on us and he never had a competition with anybody. His goal was to live a simple, calm, independent and peaceful life.
I think my father was able to live such a life because he had all the support at home, especially from my mother who was a dedicated housewife and she managed the household in a way that my father need not have any worries regarding domestic issues. I am so proud to say that all three of us grew up under our parents’ shelter and guidance to become what we are today, without giving them unnecessary troubles and worries.
Dear thaththi, May you attain the superme bliss of Nibbana!
Dr. Rasanthi Jayasundera
D. M. Senaviratne
A dedicated man
Loku aiya, you left us three years ago with our hearts bleeding and our eyes full of tears and yet those memories of your presence and closeness still lingers on. When you were sick, I could still remember the times you called me like a small child from your sick bed and how I advised you to come to Colombo or seek advice from Dr. Darshini and inform family members thereafter.
I also recall how you carried me to the Gelioya town when I was a child for my haircuts, singing “ara kandath ape thamai, me kandath ape thamai” on our way to the salon.
When our father died at the age of 46 years, you were just 23 years old and an undergraduate at the Jayawardenepura University. I remember how you came home after hearing the news of our father’s death. We were waiting patiently for your arrival, when we saw you at a distance walking very calmly towards the house, clad in white and also how you wept bitterly.
Due to your political ideology, you would criticize any injustice that took place in our hometown and take appropriate action to remedy the situation. As such, you were under the impression that your close relationship with the prelates of the village temple had suffered.
It was for this reason I suppose that you brought some Buddhist monks from the university to perform the last rites for our father.
Involved in politics, besides being the Secretary of the Students Society at J’pura University, led to the suspension of your classes. When my eldest sister received the letter of suspension, she read it aloud to my mother as though you had been promoted to the next session. During the difficult period following our father’s death, as an elder brother, you took up the responsibilities to care for us, giving private tuition and working as freelance journalist. During the run-up to the General Election in 1977, you were actively involved in SLFP politics, giving leadership to the Youth Federation of the Party in the Nuwara Eliya District.
After the election, the suspension on classes were removed and you continued with your studies and obtained an Honour’s Degree in Bachelor of Arts in the year 1972, specializing in European history.
After graduation, you started your career as a divisional manager at Building Materials Corporation until the year 1977 and thereafter, you were transferred to various places due to political interferences and subsequently dismissed from service by the then government.
After the dismissal, you were heavily involved in politics, qualified yourself as an Attorney-at-Law from the Colombo Law College and worked under late Sarath Muthetugama, the eminent lawyer, for a short while in Colombo before shifting to Ratnapura
Due to your dedicated service to the poor of the area you earned the name ‘deiya,’ which made you famous. Being a Provincial Council member during the Period 1988-1998, you were supposed to succeed Nanda Ellawala in the event of his death. Even though you declined this offer, you become a Member of Parliament. You performed an eminent service for the poor as a provincial council member for nearly two decades.
Every year on the 9th of September, your death anniversary, our younger brother provides meals to the Children Welfare Society at the Apeksha Hospital in your memory. We, the family members too, give alms to the temples of our village. Loku aiya, I feel one day the sun may not arise, the moon may not shine, but the bond between us will never die.
Loku aiya, with all these merits we hope that you will attain Nibbana.
Your ever-loving sister,
Menik Randeniya

Six months remembrance
God looked down on his creationSaw a life that was a godly celebrationHeld out his hand and invited her inThe crown of life for her to win.She brought me happy days, day after dayThough I willed it, she could not stayMy need for her will never abateBut heaven’s need was not for debate.Broken I whispered, “God knows best”As she entered God’s eternal restLeaving behind a powerful legacyFollowing her footsteps won’t be easy.When the setting sun paints the canvass of the skyWith sweeping colours that enchant the eyeLingering golden memories in cascading poignancyEmbrace me leaving me lonely.At her feet the valuable lessons learntKeep me happy, wiser and unhurt“No path in life is easy and straight”Those words of wisdom reverberate.Until someday on that golden shoreTogether again forever moreIn God’s eternal home on highNever again a need to say goodbye.Forever my love,
Charmaine Madurasinghe
