International CA students’ confab closes successfully

The 32nd International CA (Chartered Accountants) Students’ Conference, organised by the Chartered Accountants Students’ Society, successfully concluded recently.
The conference was participated by over 650 CA students and 16 foreign student delegates from India and Pakistan. The theme was ‘Divergent- Common Nonsense to Uncommon Sense’ which is a forum to discuss the importance of thinking and acting differently from traditional beliefs and folk wisdom to achieve competitive success.
CA Sri Lanka Vice President Manil Jayasinghe chaired the conference while CA Sri Lanka CEO Aruna Alwis and the patron of the CA Students Society Reyaz Mihular were Guests of Honour.
CA Students’ Society President Asanka Senevirathne delivered the inauguration address. He said this year’s theme is timely and of great importance for CA students.
CA Sri Lanka Vice President Jayasinghe highlighted insights of the changing business environment and how one should adapt to these changes. He also highlighted the importance of key skills such as IT, analytics, communication, critical thinking ability and corporate problem solving as key skills required for the future.
The patron of the CA Students’ Society Mihular referred to how students should embrace an uncommon sense leaving aside the common nonsense. “Each year the conference gets better. That is something successive organizing committees must take pride in, that they have maintained the standards year on year,” said Mihular.
Director at Janashakthi Insurance PLC Ramesh Schaffter said: “In today’s context, the rate of change is even faster than what we experienced previously. Every day something new is coming up.” He highlighted the importance of being able to change to keep abreast with global dynamics.
The Society also launched the 14th edition of the Fusion Magazine, the annual magazine published by the CA Students’ Society, which would add value to the young Chartered Accountants in their journey to success.
An expert panel discussion was also held. The panel consisted of eminent personalities from the audit as well as the non-audit sectors. Travis Roche, CFO at Interblocks Limited, was the moderator while Sujeewa Rajapakse, Managing Partner at BDO Partners and Dr. Ravi Liyanage, Chairman of the Kingdom of Raigam, were panelists.
Professor Ajantha Dharmasiri, President of the Institute of Personnel Management of Sri Lanka spoke on the topic ‘Collaborating to be People Savvy.’
He highlighted how important people management is to accounting and finance professionals. Chevaan Daniel, Group Director at the Capital Maharaja Organization, spoke on building a personal brand for oneself.
