Eat dark chocolate to keep doctor away!

Rich in nutrients
Chocolate with a high content of cocoa is loaded with nutrients, including a soluble fiber while also rich in iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and potassium. Dark chocolate also contains a slight amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fats – good fats – which are shown to reduce cholesterol levels and decrease the risk of heart disease.
Improve blood flow
Antioxidants in dark chocolate stimulate the lining of the arteries creating a gas, which sends a signal to the arteries causing them to relax, enabling blood to flow easier. Having the blood flowing smoothly, it gets to all the body parts delivering the nutrients and oxygen with no complications.
Lowers blood pressure
Those same antioxidants that helps improve the blood flow are the ones that also decrease its resistance, and consequently eases the blood pressure in small amounts against the arteries. Even though it releases the pressure just a little bit, in time that is a big benefit for your heart. High blood pressure is always linked to heart diseases. So lowering it little by little is a huge help to eliminate risks.
Cuts down risks for heart disease
Eating dark chocolate a few times a week should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries and we should see a lower risk of heart disease over the long term. There are studies that revealed that eating chocolate 2 or more times per week greatly lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect. So regular consumption of dark chocolate can in fact reduce the risk of heart disease.
Raises good cholesterol and lowers bad cholesterol
The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol. It lowers the chances of LDL to get oxidized. When LDL oxidizes, it has reacted to free radicals, which makes the particle reactive and capable to damage other tissues.
Promotes weight loss
Researchers from the University of Copenhagen found that dark chocolate is far more filling, offering more of a feeling of satiety than its lighter-colored sibling. That is, dark chocolate lessens cravings for sweet, salty, and fatty foods. So if indulging in a bit of healthy dark chocolate should not only make it easy for you to stick to the small portion recommended for optimal health, but it should make it easier for you to stick to your diet in general.
