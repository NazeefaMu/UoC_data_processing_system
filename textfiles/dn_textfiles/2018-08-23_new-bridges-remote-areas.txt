New bridges for remote areas

The government has taken steps to construct new bridges in remote areas in the Kotapola Divisional Secretariat Division in the Matara district.
One will be constructed at Godakumbura in the Kotapola North area connecting Usmalgoda and Nawalahena Grama Niladari areas across Nilwala River and the other is at Waralle area across the same river.
The proposed two bridges would be constructed under the Rural Bridge Construction Project of the Provincial and Local Government Ministry. The construction expenditure of the two bridges is about Rs. 83.9 million.
The Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister and Project Management and Southern Regional Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka laid foundation stones for these, recently. Construction work will be completed and bridges will be vested with the public next year, project engineers said.
