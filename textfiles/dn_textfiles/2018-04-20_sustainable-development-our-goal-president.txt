Sustainable development, our goal - President

President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the Commonwealth Heads of Government Executive Sessions at Lancaster House in London yesterday said his Government will act with determination to usher a sustainable and secure future for the country’s people.
The President said Sri Lanka like other countries was striving to achieve a prosperous future through sustainable social and economic development and environmental protection.
President Sirisena went on to say that as an island nation, Sri Lanka was especially focusing on preserving and protecting its environment for the benefit of the future generations.
While noting that Sri Lanka occupies a strategic geographic location in the Indian Ocean, the President said his country was focusing to maximise this advantage to generate income and spur development at a time when Asia was playing an increasingly dominant role in the world economy.
He also said that Sri Lanka fully supports the Clean Ocean Alliance programme proposed by the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May warmly welcomed the President when he arrived at Lancaster House for the Executive Sessions.
Commonwealth Heads of Government Executive Sessions was held at Lancaster House in London in the afternoon following the inaugural session of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Buckingham Palace under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth II in the morning.
