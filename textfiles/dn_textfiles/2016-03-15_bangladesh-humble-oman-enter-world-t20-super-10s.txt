Bangladesh humble Oman, enter World T20 Super 10s

 
Tamin Iqbal hit the first century of the World Twenty20 as Bangladesh beat Oman by 54 runs to secure the final place in the Super 10s. Tamim made an unbeaten 103 off 63 balls - his maiden T20 hundred - and Sabbir Rahman a rapid 44 in a total of 180-2.
Oman, whose target was revised first to 152 in 16 overs then 120 in 12 after rain in Dharamsala, laboured to 65-9.
As winners of Group A, Bangladesh join India, Australia, South Africa and Pakistan’s group in the next phase.
Tournament newcomers Oman, who beat Ireland in their opening game, can take considerable credit for finishing second in a group containing three teams above them in the T20 rankings.
Earlier, Ireland finished bottom of Group B after losing to the Netherlands by 12 runs in a match reduced to six overs per side by rain.
Four of the six games played in Dharamsala were affected by the weather. BBC
