Traditional paddy varieties encouraged

The cultivation of traditional varieties of paddy are to be revived in Sri Lanka.
Under the programme, the farmer community would also be encouraged to grow more traditional high quality strains of paddy, agriculture officials said.
According to the Agriculture Ministry sources, over 3,000 acres of land in the island have already been brought under the plough through these programmes. Neither chemical fertilizer nor pesticides are utilized in these cultivation activities.
Paddy cultivators are being made aware of the significance of using organic manure and compost rather than chemical fertilizer in these cultivations.
Cultivation instructions, novel agriculture technological know-how and all other facilities would also be provided to farmers by the Agriculture Ministry. It is targeted to bring about 100,000 acres of land in the country under paddy cultivation using traditional methods soon, agriculture authorities added.
Farmers would be encouraged to grow more traditional strains of paddy using these methods by the Agriculture Ministry.
The enhancement of the production of high quality varieties of rice in the country would be the aim of these endeavours, agriculture project officials added.
