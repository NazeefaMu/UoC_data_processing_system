Ridiyagama livestock farm encroached

About one thousand acres have been encroached by some people from the Ridiyagama livestock farm, the manager of the farm Dinushika Sulakshith complained to Hambantota District Agricultural Committee.
The livestock farm has 3,200 imported cows and it produces about 3,200 litres of milk. As these encroachers have acquired these lands, there are no lands to cultivate food for these animals.
The manager said these people cultivated plantain in the land, pumping water from the main canal supplying water to Ridiyagama tank which runs through the farm as well as from the tank.
Hambantota Additional District Secretary Suneth Lochana instructed Ambalantota Assistant Divisional Secretary to look into this matter and take necessary steps.
