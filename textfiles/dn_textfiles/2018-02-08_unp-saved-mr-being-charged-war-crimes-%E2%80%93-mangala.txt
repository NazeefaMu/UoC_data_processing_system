UNP saved MR from being charged for war crimes – Mangala

It is the UNP government that made representations in Geneva and saved former President Mahinda Rajapaksa from being charged for war crimes,” Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing a public rally at Uyanwatta, Matara last evening.
“The Government was not only successful at Geneva, but we were also able to regain the GSP plus status and also had the ban on fish exports to the EU revoked,” the minister said
“Unknown to you we have commenced the construction of a state of the art theatre and the Nilwala Recreational Park on the banks of the Nilwala River. This recreational park would be completed by 2019. We commenced work on the fourth stage of the Matara Water Project a few months ago under which we would be able to provide drinking water even to Beliatta.”
“This election is not an election at which you can change this government. You will be given that opportunity after August 17, 2020. If you wish to make use of the present opportunity and bring the strength of this government and the Ministry of Finance to develop your village in the next two years, you should vote for the United National Party on February 10. We have put forward the most capable male and female candidates to represent you on behalf of the party,” Minister Samaraweera added.
