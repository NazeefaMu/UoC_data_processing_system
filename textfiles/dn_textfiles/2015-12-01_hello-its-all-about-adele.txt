Hello - it's all about Adele

Adele was on a long break from her last album 21. Now four years gone by she is all ready to set the world on fire with her long-awaited album '25'. The first song from this album 'Hello' just sky rocketed overnight beating the listenership of Taylor Swift's Bad Blood video.
This song sent waves around the world and people were all hash-tagging the song and giving their views (which were all positive). Even the biggest A-list Hollywood crowds were all about sharing it on Twitter and all other social media.
For someone who just got out of a bad relationship, this song is your power booster song. It's heartbreaking but it still allows you to get out of bed and start belching out this song. It didn't take long for the social media to start making memes out of this song or for musicians to do their versions of it. Hello just went viral.
So what is 'Hello' about? Well we let the lady herself explain it to us.
"That's reaching out to who I used to be when I was younger. And I'm curious to know if our 7-year-old selves, if they met us when we were adults, and we were like, 'Well this is what we ended up doing,' if we'd be satisfied. I love what I do, and I feel really, really lucky, but maybe our 7-year-old selves wouldn't. Maybe they'd be, 'That sounds boring. I want to be a nurse.'
"It's a hello to myself, hello to all my friends, hello to my ex-boyfriend, hello to who I'm going to be in 10 years, hello to my kid in 10 years, hello to my boyfriend in 10 years - to my fans, to everyone.
"That line, 'It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry' - that's my favorite lyric I've ever written."
Adele Laurie Blue Adkins was born on May 5, 1988. She graduated from the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in 2006. She was given a recording contract by XL Recordings after a friend posted her demo on Myspace the same year. In 2007, she received the Brit Awards "Critics' Choice" award and won the BBC Sound of 2008. Her debut album, 19, was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. It is certified seven times platinum in the UK, and double platinum in the US. An appearance she made on Saturday Night Live in late 2008 boosted her career in the US. At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in 2009, Adele received the awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.
Adele released her second studio album, 21, in early 2011. The album was well received critically and surpassed the success of her debut, earning the singer numerous awards in 2012, including a record-tying six Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year; two Brit Awards, including British Album of the Year, and three American Music Awards. The album has been certified 16 times platinum in the UK, and is the fourth best-selling album in the UK of all time. In the US it has held the top position longer than any album since 1985, and is certified Diamond. The album has sold 30 million copies worldwide.[9]
The success of 21 earned Adele numerous mentions in the Guinness Book of World Records. She is the first woman in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 to have three simultaneous top 10 singles as a lead artist, and the first female artist to simultaneously have two albums in the top five of the Billboard 200 and two singles in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100. 21 is the longest running number one album by a female solo artist in the history of the UK and US Album Charts. In 2011 and 2012, Billboard named Adele Artist of the Year. In 2012, Adele was listed at number five on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music, and Time magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world. In 2013, she received an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for her song "Skyfall", which she wrote and composed for the James Bond film of the same name.
Adele's third studio album, 25, was released in November 2015. The lead single, "Hello", debuted at number-one in the UK and US, and became the first song to sell over one million digital copies within a week of its release in the latter.
