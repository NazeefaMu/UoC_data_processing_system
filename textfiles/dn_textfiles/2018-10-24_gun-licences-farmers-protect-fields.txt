Gun licences for farmers to protect fields

In order to uplift the living standards of the rural people in the Kegalle district, urgent solutions should be found to problems relating to agriculture which is their main livelihood. The main agricultural problem they face is crop damage caused by monkeys, torque monkeys and other animals, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Dr. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He was addressing a meeting of the Kegalle District Development Committee held at the Kegalla kachcheri, on October 22.
“We have discussed this problem and arrived at the most plausible solution. In future, we would issue gun licences to farmers to protect their daily grub. Doing so would be a great act of merit,” he said.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said this problem needed a technical solution.
“There is no purpose in giving firearms to individuals in the village. But when we give a shot gun to a farmer, we are doing it to help him safeguard his livelihood,” he said.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said as people’s representatives, it was their duty is to look into people’s problems. The main problem of farmers in the district was crop damage caused by animals. It was the small-scale farmers who are hit hard by this problem. There were instances where even monkeys consumed their bowl of rice on the hearth by invading their kitchens.
