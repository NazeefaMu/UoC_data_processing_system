Ceylon Tea back to Russia

The Russian Federation revealed that its historic longing for Ceylon Tea has not wavered and even vowed for bigger trade with Sri Lanka, calling to despatch a strong delegation to the trade meet scheduled in Moscow this year.
“Yes, we imposed a ban on Ceylon Tea, but it was nothing to do with our asbestos but was only about an insect found in a Tea package from Sri Lanka” said Ambassador of the Russian Federation Yury Materiy on 9 January after meeting the Minister of Industry and Commerce of Rishad Bathiudeen in Colombo.
“If we connected Ceylon Tea exports issue with Sri Lankan imports of Russian asbestos as widely speculated, then our tea ban would have to continue even now, isn’t it?” asked Ambassador Materiy.“We are not speaking about asbestos in general but only about Russian Chrysotile which is not harmful. Lots of investigations have been done on it.”
“Russian workers who have been working in the chrysotile industry for the last thirty years are doing fine-not one worker was reported to have had cancer in the last thirty years. There are many workers who handle chrysotile in the mines with bare hands, and they are fine.”
Sri Lanka has been among the leading buyers of asbestos in the world. In 2015, the four leading asbestos importers in the world were India, Indonesia, China and Sri Lanka (buying from all asbestos exporting countries). Sri Lanka absorbed 6% of global asbestos imports in 2015. According to the Department of Commerce, ‘Iron & steel’, ‘wheat’ and ‘asbestos’ have been the three leading imports from Russia to Sri Lanka in recent years.
Sri Lanka’s recent asbestos imports from Russia has been at low levels and has shown a declining trend -$ 33.87 Mn in 2014, $27.92 Mn in 2015 and $28.80 Mn in 2016. From January to August this year, Sri Lanka’s asbestos imports from Russia was only $ 13.57 Mn.
“We want to strengthen relations with Sri Lanka further. Bilateral trade between both countries is still low and it is time we expand our trade with diversified products. We in Russia like to support Sri Lanka in development cooperation in sectors of energy and agriculture.”
Sri Lanka’s total trade (both imports and exports) with the Russian Federation which was at US $ 435.83 Mn in 2015 declined to $ 381.71 Mn in 2016. This year in the January to August period, it reported a total of US $ 260.78 Mn.
