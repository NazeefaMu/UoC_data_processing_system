Road upgrade programme

The Wayamba Road Development Authority will modernise roads that run through Kurunegala town. Rs. 10.4 million has been allocated for the project.
More than 310km of roads in Kurunegala will be developed under this programme.
The RDA has instructed officials to complete the work soon. The main roads in Kurunegala town have not been maintained properly since sufficient funds were not allocated.
