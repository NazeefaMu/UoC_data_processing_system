Sensible decision to send Kusal Perera to  England early

 
Sri Lanka Cricket and the selection committee headed by former captain Sanath Jayasuriya should be commended for taking a sensible decision to include Kusal Perera in the Sri Lanka Test squad currently touring England.
When fast bowler Dhammika Prasad was forced to return home following an injury to his shoulder the normal practice was to replace him with another bowler in the team. But instead, the national selectors have reviewed the balance of the team and the area that needs to be strengthened and gone for a batsman.
In a media release from Sri Lanka Cricket, chief selector Jayasuriya explains, “There is no specific need to replace Prasad with another bowler; we have enough bowlers in the squad … Kusal will join the team as soon as possible and acclimatize so he can do some serious work with the bat.”
It is in the batting that Sri Lanka faulted badly being dismissed for totals of 91 and 119 that led to their innings and 88 runs defeat inside three days in the first Test concluded at Headingley, Leeds last Saturday.
Perera may not yet be ready for the second Test starting on Friday at Durham, but he certainly is a good bet to play in the final Test of the series at Lord’s beginning on June 9. By joining the squad Perera will come under the scrutiny of the national team’s trainers and physio who can get him into match fitness and in shipshape for the Lord’s Test.
Also by arriving early he will be able to get acclimatized to the conditions especially against the swinging and seaming ball which are key ingredients for survival in England.
It was only last week we spotlighted the necessity to include Perera in the Test squad for Lord’s in this column.
The presence of Perera, a wicket-keeper/batsman at number seven in the order will not only strengthen the Lankan batting line up but will also relieve Dinesh Chandimal of wicket-keeping duties and allow him to concentrate on his batting at number four position.
Chandimal is a vital cog in the batting and is one of the few batsmen in the top order who can deliver once he gets his mental frame right on how to deal with the swing and seam of the English attack. The key is to judge which balls to leave and which ones to score runs off. It is often advisable to try and play the ball as late as possible by going onto your back foot so that you may be able to encounter any late movement the ball might make.
The big mistake the Lankan batters made at Headingley was they were more committed to playing off the front foot and eventually did not have enough time to adjust to the late lateral movement which resulted in the ball finding the edge of their bat.
Perera in his rather unorthodox and aggressive way of batting could even upset the England bowling, but one must not expect too much from him. If he delivers it’s well and good, but if not we should be patient with him.
However Perera’s very presence will make the opposition wary of what type of damage he can do to them in his own destructive way if he is allowed a free reign. That much England will know and try to stop him. His inclusion in the Test squad will have England thinking and altering plans at least for the Lord’s Test.
Past England greats like David Gower, Sir Ian Botham, Michael Atherton and David Lloyd were not too critical about Sri Lanka’s performance and accepted the fact that an inexperienced team was facing two of the most potent new ball bowlers in ideal English conditions for swing and seam bowling in James Anderson and Stuart Broad.
They also drew reference to the Trent Bridge Test last summer where Australia (with a much experienced team than Sri Lanka) were shot out for a total of just 60 by a rampaging Broad who went onto take eight wickets in the innings.
Getting the ICC ban on Perera lifted is the best thing that has happened to Sri Lanka cricket in the recent past. It has in some way given Sri Lanka a leeway to strengthen their unstable batting which is still struggling to come to terms with the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, two of the greatest accumulators of runs in all three formats of the game.
