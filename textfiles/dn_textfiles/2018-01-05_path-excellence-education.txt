Path to excellence in education

The year 2017 has come to an end and with the dawn of another New Year, if you are looking for a smart start for your child Sujatha Vidyalaya is the place. Established in the heart of Colombo and later in Nugegoda Sujatha Vidyalaya is known island wide and across the globe. Originally surrounded by lush greenery now consisting of intellectual high rises is a perfect educational institution in true sense of the word.
The quality branches, pre-school etc. showcase the how students are geared to excel in their education right from the very beginning. This is truly a place prone to family education filled with discipline.
Sujatha Pre-School
Sujatha Pre-school is situated in a welcoming, safe environment providing a solid foundational education, paving the way for successful study, work and progress leading to academic excellence.
Entire Sujatha Vidyalaya from Pre-school onwards is rated as the best in the area. However, admission to Sujatha has certainly become a major concern. There are many schools to choose from, in the vicinity. But the rush is for Sujatha Pre-school and Primary is nothing strange and now it has risen to the position of the most sought-after school in that area.
One can recall the wonderful education Sujathians received in Primary, Secondary and beyond with a very competent knowledge in English Language – a very rare feature of the day.
Starting with just 30 students way back in June 1965 Sujatha Vidyalaya was founded by late Linton Kuruppu, Pioneer and Architect joined by late Clara Motwani as the Principal both of whom devoted their lives for the task of setting up a school for Buddhist girls at a time that International schools were not even heard of.
It heralded the beginning of English medium education after the departure of Imperial Masters from then Ceylon.
The challenges faced by the duo was what made Sujatha Vidyalaya unique, to be carried forward by his son Lakshman Kuruppu who took over.
The demise of his father meant a lifetime commitment culminating in a wide awakening in education par excellence.
New Era
Being young and vibrant soon after his foreign education highly qualified, when he took over it opened the door to a new era.
Sujatha Vidyalaya has the cream of intelligentsia in large numbers on her roll today with a professionally qualified, wide academic staff with devotion and loyalty. With the dedicated service from top to bottom, it is at the top of all schools in the vicinity and the prestige is indeed a fitting tribute to the present Management. In his mission for quality education he has succeeded and Sujatha Vidyalaya today has made a mark in all round performance too numerous to be mentioned in detail.
It is with great pride that the old Sujathians remember their Alma-Mater. The name Sujatha is spread around the world, many serving in all walks of life. The past pupils are found leading the way in every field. Wherever they are, in any part of the globe, on top of their busy lives, to say that I am a Sujathian mean so much and it is kept up by them with utmost respect.
