DMU to ensure uninterrupted fuel supply to flood affected areas: Arjuna

A Disaster Management Unit (DMU) will be established to ensure an uninterrupted supply of fuel to the areas affected by the prevailing bad weather conditions, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
Speaking at a discussion yesterday, he said the main aim of the DMU would be to identify and solve the issues related to the uninterrupted supply of fuel to the affected areas and to co-ordinate all the organisations so as to ease the supply.
The Minister said the entrances to some filling stations are blocked while some are completely flooded.
The Ministry has identified the need to supply fuel to the affected areas through alternative sources.
Ranatunga said a joint plan would be implemented with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to supply fuel to the affected areas and a committee was appointed in this regard.
Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) Distribution Manager W.M.T.W.A. Bandara said there were fuel shortages in Walasmulla, Middeniya, Matara, Kirama, Hakmana, Agunukolapalessa, Ambalanthota, Galle, Ruwanwella, Horana, Kithulgala, Daraniyagala, Thalangama and Kolonnawa. “CPSTL was able to distribute adequate fuel to those areas yesterday,” he said.
