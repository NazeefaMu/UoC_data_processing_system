Kitchen Confidential

It always feels so good to come home to the smells of chili, garlic and spices mingling in the air, the sounds of a pressure cooker whistling or a pot on the stove bubbling, and the sight of my mother, moving from the sink to the cutting board to the cupboard, while my cat Podi sits on the chair in the corner of the kitchen, with half-closed eyes, in mindful meditation.
I confess, my mother is the chief cook in our family. All of us, including my father, chip in to help her, but almost never do we find the courage to make a full meal on our own. On days my mother is not at home, we unanimously agree to buy lunch packets from the 'kade', order pizza or go out for a snack.
Yet we all know (and I know you do too)that eating out all too frequently, is bad for us. Even as I write this a lot of junk food is probably clogging our collective arteries and making our nation a land of overweight people. Soft drinks are giving us diabetes and even that innocent restaurant salad can have three times as much fat as a cheeseburger.
Isn't it time we (guys and girls, young and old) start to brave the kitchen, battle the dirty dishes and deal with siblings and offspring who would rather eat pizza or string-hoppers and spicy dhal curry from 'indiappa akka's kade' every night instead of the home-cooked red rice you made, with the rather bland dhal curry, and a burned mallum.
Happy family
Sure, home-cooked meals might not be as tasty at the beginning of your journey into the land of culinary delights, as the food you find on the streets. Yet, there are so many reasons to cook at home, it's surprising that we aren't all doing it at least some of the time. For starters, research shows that regularly eating home-cooked meals as a family is linked to healthier and happier children, and teenagers who are less likely to use alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes.
As Laura Newcomer points out in her article, ' The Health and Social Benefits of Home Cooked Meals' adults also reap considerable benefits from eating at home. Research finds that people who eat home-cooked meals on a regular basis tend to be happier and healthier and consume less sugar and processed foods, which can result in higher energy levels and better mental health. Eating home-cooked meals five or more days a week is even associated with a longer life.
As if all that weren't enough, home-cooked meals can also benefit the environment - and all of us, by extension - by saving money and reducing our carbon footprint. Experts say home cooking gives us the opportunity to choose component ingredients over processed meals, which cuts down on packaging. Buy those ingredients from the Sunday fair or grow your own, and you will make an even bigger impact on the environment by significantly reducing the amount of transportation required to get food to your plate.
Not enough time
So, given all these benefits of home cooking, why aren't we all cooking for ourselves?
The most common excuse is that there is not enough time. In fact, people who work more than 35 hours outside the home each week do tend to cook less.(Although in reality, many of us spend more time watching TV and on Facebook than we do cooking for ourselves.) Other reasons for avoiding the kitchen include having to spend long hours on the road traveling back and forth from work, the widespread availability of food options outside of the home, and the notion that convenience should always be our ultimate priority.
But the benefits of home cooking are just too good to give up. And given that supermarkets offer a larger variety of ingredients than they ever have and the number of organically grown food stalls is increasing, there's no better time to develop the habit of cooking meals at home.
Newcomer advises if you fall into the trap of thinking you are too busy to cook, you should evaluate whether that's really the case. Take a week to write down how long you spend browsing the internet, watching TV, or counting the number of 'likes' on one of your Facebook posts. Tally it all up, and you will probably find you have more free time than you realized. Use some of that down time to cook delicious meals.
Love cooking!
To do so, you must fall in love with your kitchen, says Newcomer. "A functional and cared-for kitchen is a much more appealing place than one that's grimy and uninviting. Create a space you feel good in by investing in some basic cooking equipment and developing an organizational system that works for you." It will also be helpful to know that cooking feels much less daunting if you don't have to run out to the store every time you need a single ingredient. Stock the pantry with your most commonly used items (such as rice, spices, and coconut oil) so you can always cook something without needing to shop.
Each weekend, set aside time to plan meals and make shopping lists for the week ahead. Take your weekly schedule into account: For example, if you know Tuesday will be busy, then plan for a meal that's quick and easy to make. With a little forethought, you can tailor home cooking to even the busiest weeks.
Eating home-cooked meals on a regular basis, however, doesn't mean you need to cook every night. Give yourself a break by cooking large batches of every meal you make so you can reheat it throughout the week. Also consider making items that can be reused in different ways - for example, a bottle of seeni-sambol can be used in sandwiches, with rice, or with roti to make multiple different meals over the course of a few days.
In addition, growing your own produce and herbs will be a sure-fire way to feel more connected to the food you eat. There's nothing more satisfying (or nutritious) than making a salad from greens and vegetables you grew yourself. While you are at it, consider learning how to preserve food too, and compost leftovers.
Whether you have never cooked a meal in your life or you want to stop being your mother's assistant cook and wants to take up the challenge of preparing a meal on your own (I will, this weekend), give a few of these tips a try, and commit to a few small lifestyle changes.
You will be on your way to living a healthier, happier life.
And, if you are brave enough, do drop in at our place on Saturday night to taste my home-cooked meal.
Bon appétit!
Home Cooking Benefits
Nutritious - Restaurants, both fast food and otherwise, are known to be notoriously high in calories sugars, fats, sodium and carbohydrates, and it is also likely they may contain low nutritional content. Even the healthier, low-cal options can contain a very high level of sugars and fats. Eating at home, on the other hand, allows you to cut out what you may deem unnecessary in your diet. You're in control of the food you cook and the food you consume.
* Increase knowledge of food - Food is much more than just something that tastes good and fills up your stomach. What you eat can heal, cause sickness, or even inflict pain. Cooking your own meals can teach you what foods are high or low in certain vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.
* Savor your food - The physical act of preparing your own meals will lead to a newfound appreciation for the food you consume. This is very important since mindless munching and emotional eating can contribute to unhealthy weight gain because you are not fully conscious of what you are eating. Being more aware of what you consume when you prepare it will make you less likely to overeat.
* Appropriate portions- Restaurants are notorious for their extreme portion sizes, which may contribute to the vast overeating culture and obesity in the modern world. Preparing meals at home gives you the ability to exercise portion control and help curb the temptation of overeating.
* Encourages family bonding - Family dynamics can greatly improve with more at home, family meal times. Children greatly benefit from the ritual of preparing and eating meals together.
* Cleanliness - Cooking at home can give you the clean conscience of not only knowing what's in your food, but how clean your food is. Naturally, you will want to make sure your kitchen and dinnerware are sterile and your ingredients are prepared thoroughly before eating.
* Saves money - Eating dinner out is expensive! It is a lotw more cost-effective to purchase groceries than ordering take out every night. While there is much controversy as to whether or not an individual meal is cheaper made cooking in-home than eating out, with nutritional intake and serving size accounted for, you will save a lot more money by eating in!
