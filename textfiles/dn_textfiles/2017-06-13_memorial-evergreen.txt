A memorial evergreen

Despite that the civil conflict ended over eight years ago, there are somewhat few memorials to those killed in the war who were not part of the armed forces or police. Beyond that, there remain thousands of missing persons who lack graves or monuments of commemoration.
Chairman of the Center for Humanitarian Affairs Jeevan Thiagarajah hopes to ameliorate both of these situations through the planting of a massive forest in the Poonakary Division in the Kilinochchi District that will commemorate the dead, missing, and missing in action on both sides of the conflict.

Thiagarajah, who has decades of experience working on issues related to good governance, security, and human rights, was deeply affected by the horrors people suffered during the war. His boss was blown up in the late 1990s, and he was appalled at the violence of the war in general, and not least of the southern insurgency.
But what bothered him most were the cases of the missing and of children who were conscripted.
During the war, he would go to the UN Human Rights Council, and on one of his visits, he received information on 11,000-12,000 complaints from families of missing persons.
“As I remember, not more than two of these families had received a response as to what had happened to their missing relations,” he said.
Furthermore, just after the war ended, Thiagarajah attended a conference in the United States where a man told the harrowing story of a woman grieving over a gravestone.
“This man said that the woman was crying over the gravestone of her daughter, who was officially a combatant who had perished.”
“All of these conscripted kids started as schoolchildren. They lost their childhood and their schooling life. If they happened to survive, they are known as former combatants, not as former schoolchildren. That narrative about children who had perished unsung, unknown, and unmarked, is what I want to bring awareness to. If you can find a grave, which is unlikely, it is usually unmarked,” he said.
A forest memorial
Though he has been thinking about these issues ever since the end of the conflict, it was only in the past few weeks that Thiagarajah settled on planting a forest as a memorial to the dead and missing.
He owns 40 acres of land in the Kilinochchi district, and he intends to plant up to 100,000 trees on the plot that will act as memorials to individuals. He plans to allocate 50,000 slots to members of the armed forces and Police and the other 50,000 to anyone who was not in the government forces, but was killed or is missing.
It is unclear whether 40 acres would be enough space to harbour 100,000 trees, but Thiagarajah said that he would have access to at least another 40 acres that are owned by a family member.
To plan and develop the forest, Thiagarajah has enlisted the help of internationally-renowned analog forestry expert Ranil Senanayake. Analog forestry does not rely on chemicals and aims to foster ecological functions that would allow a natural forest to grow. Senanayake will decide which species of trees to plant and how and where to plant them.
While he owns the land, he is well-aware that such a massive and ambitious project requires outside help. Over the past two weeks, he has written to Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Karunasena Hettiarachchi and to Chairperson of the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to guage their interest in the project.
“I have effectively asked the armed forces if they want the 50,000 slots. If they say yes, I would like their technical and planning support. Likewise, I have asked ONUR if they would be willing to help find 50,000 families who want to plant trees in remembrance of their relations who are dead and missing,” he said.
Though he has spoken to Hettiarachchi, he has yet to receive an official response from either the Ministry of Defence or the ONUR.
It is his aim to have members of the public buy a tree in the name of a dead or missing relative. Thiagarajah wants the trees to be impersonal in that there will be no names or other special markings or symbols on the trees. The only means of identification will be a number for both the slot and the tree.
He also wants to give people who have purchased a tree the option of receiving a second tree that they would be able plant in their garden or in their town. This way, they might have a memorial closer to home.
“They could also treat that tree as a kind of fixed deposit that, for a very modest startup cost, would become very valuable down the road,” he said.
Though the plans for the forest are not yet finalized, Thiagarajahhas several rules concerning the organization of the trees. Because the forest is slated to be a memorial to both soldiers from the armed forces and people were not in the armed forces, it will not be cut into special sections based on ethnicity, religion, or government affiliation. Instead, a computer will determine the plot people receive.
Yet another aspect of the plan is the inclusion of a floored, roofed, and open-walled structure within the forest that would serve as a place of worship for any religious service at any time of day.
In this respect, Thiagarajah was inspired by Beirut’s Garden of Forgiveness, a symbol of national unity, which lies in the city center and is surrounded by various places of worship for multiple religions.
He hopes to make the forest meaningful and accessible to everyone. Therefore, people of any religion would be able to worship amidst the trees that would memorialize Sri Lankans from every ethnicity and faith. Through this project, perhaps, those from the North and East and the government forces can find some common ground.
Funding, environment aspects, and challenges
Funding for the project, however, has yet to be sorted out. Thiagarajah is hopeful that people could buy a tree for Rs. 1,000, but that would not pay for the forests’ upkeep. Therefore, he is also looking into the possibility of offering trees as carbon credits to those who are environmentally-conscious or the corporate sector.
But perhaps the most promising and ambitious funding plan is to align this project with the forestry drive that President Maithripala Sirisena recently announced.
“My goals for the forest match up well with the forest project that the President is leading. We wish to enhance forest cover and plant more trees, so it could be good for both parties to work together,” Thiagarajah said, while noting that he is excited about the positive environmental impact that the project would bring about.
“I’m a recent convert to environmentalism. I work very hard to improve the environment. I’m looking at the issues of water security, deforestation, floods, and climate change. That’s weighing heavily on me and influencing me,” he said.
There are still significant obstacles that must be overcome if the project is to succeed, however.
First off, it is expensive to keep up and irrigate a new forest: “In the first 20 years or so I would need to be able to provide drip irrigation. So I would need to find and use some water to get things going, but after I will the forest would be self-sustaining,” he said.
Ranil Senanayake, for his part, noted the following challenges: “ The soils and water flow in the northern areas differ from most of the country, as they lie on a limestone bed. This feature brings great potential as well as danger as all the surface water drains into the vesicular formation below.”
He also remarked on the high concentrations of agro-toxins and artificial fertilizers in the area as potential challenges to be overcome. But outside of the potential problems the planting of the forest would present, Thiagarajah said that it would be very difficult to alert 50,000 families of the dead or missing to the project and to convince them to buy plots.
“Getting the message out to the unknown, the unsung woman or man or child; that’s the challenge. Another issue is getting messages to remote places and convincing people it’s worth it to buy trees. And that has to be done very carefully, because it might stir up memories which would cause trouble and damage,” he said.
Furthermore, these people would have to be able to prove that their relatives are dead or missing, and that could be difficult in and of itself.
There is no doubt that this project offers a new method of integrative memorialization that also stays away from erecting massive structures that, for better or worse, glorify war and, by extension, suffering. It remains to be seen, however, if and when the project is implemented.
