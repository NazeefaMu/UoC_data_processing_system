O’Keefe (10/64 & 78 n.o.) presses for Test place : Pathetic batting hands Australia crushing win

 
“Pathetic” was how the Sri Lanka Board President’s XI coach cum manager Piyal Wijetunge described his team’s woeful batting performance when they were bundled out for a paltry 83 runs in their second innings to hand out to the touring Australians a crushing innings and 162 runs win on the third morning of the 3-day practice match played at the P Sara Oval yesterday.
“The pitch was turning alright but no one batted well. It was not a track where you can be bowled out inside a session of play,” said Wijetunge. The chief destroyer of the Board President’s innings was once again left-arm spinner Steve O’Keefe who finished with another five-for haul to end the match with impressive figures of 10 for 64.
The Malaysian-born New South Welshman has turned this match into one of his own by excelling not only with the ball but also with the bat as well.
Australia added another 43 runs to their overnight total of 431-9 to be all out for 474 with Jackson Bird being the last wicket to fall for 32 leaving O’Keefe as the top scorer of the innings with an unbeaten 78 scored off 139 balls with nine fours. The two frustrated the home team bowlers for nearly an hour adding 58 for the last wicket.
O’Keefe’s all-round contribution in the match is a kind of performance that the Australian tour selectors would find hard to ignore ahead of the first Test against Sri Lanka at Pallekele on Tuesday week.
O’Keefe proved quite a handful for the Board President’s XI batters as they surrendered meekly to be dismissed before lunch on the final day.
Their total capitulation in 20.5 overs was something that was hard to swallow. If this is the type of performance some of the future Sri Lankan players in the team can come up with then we have a serious problem ahead of us in terms of national team selection.
They were in fact one batsman short with opener Madawa Warnapura ruled out of the match with a dislocated left shoulder, but that was no excuse for this substandard batting performance.
Only two batsmen got into double figures – Shehan Jayasuriya (29) who was promoted to open in the absence of Warnapura and Asela Gunaratne (23), the rest of the batting was swept under the carpet by O’Keefe after Mitchell Starc had given Australia the initial breakthrough with two early wickets.
How much turn the pitch offered cannot be judged by the Australian batting performance because they were exposed to only 54 overs of spin of the total of 132.3 overs their innings lasted.
