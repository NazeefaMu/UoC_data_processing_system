SLFP will reach decision on NCM by April 4: Duminda

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would inform the nation regarding its final decision on the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by April 4, SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing a swearing-in ceremony for new SLFP local government (LG) members of the North Central Province who were elected at the LG polls held in February. The ceremony was held at the Anuradhapura Provincial Council Auditorium, recently.
Minister Dissanayake said no SLFPer had directly declared the stand of the party in relation to the No-Confidence Motion. Few stalwarts including Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S. B. Dissanayake, had spoken their personal opinions regarding the matter to the media.
‘’It shall be our political motive and strategy, to form an SLFP government with President Maithripala Sirisena, if he is re-elected as president at the 2020 elections. We will focus our attention to provide practical solutions to problems faced by the citizens of the country, while curbing the attempts of any one person or party that attempts to mislead the public,” he added. The minister said that the results of the recent local government elections had revealed that the current regime had failed to present itself as a strong and stable government to the people of the country.
However, if anyone were to interpret those results as a loss of power of the government, that would only be an illusion, he added.
Members of local government bodies are to comply with the decisions of their respective parties. Therefore, any member who would act against such party decisions, would be dealt with accordingly, under the new Act, Minister Dissanayake said.
