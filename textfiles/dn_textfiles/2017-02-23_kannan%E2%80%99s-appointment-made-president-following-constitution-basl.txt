Kannan’s appointment made by President following the Constitution: BASL

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) yesterday said that the appointment of R. Kannan as High Court Judge was eventually effected by President Maithripala Sirisenawith the concurrence of the Chief Justice, the Judicial Services Commission and the Attorney General in accordance with the Constitution.
President of the Sri Lanka Bar Association (BASL) Geoffrey Alagaratnam in a letter to Chief Justice K. Sripavan on Tuesday in order to explain his organization’s role in the appointment of R Kannan as High Court Judge said;
“I wish to clarify that there has never been a practice of either the Bar Council or the Executive Committee of the Bar Association or Branch Associations approving persons that are to be recommended for appointment to the judiciary” .
He did say, however, that it is customary to seek recommendations from leaders of the Bar when it comes to appointing judges from the Unofficial Bar: “This I believe is a healthy tradition and it should be continued.” “I repeat that there is no requirement nor a practice that approvals be obtained for such recommendations from the Executive Committee, the Bar Coucnil of the Bar Association, or any Branch Association,” Alagaratnam wrote.
He also argued that promotions to the higher judiciary should rest not only on seniority, but also merit.
“The Bar has constantly maintained the position that promotions, especially to the higher judiciary, should apart from comprising members of the Official and Unofficial Bar and career judiciary not be on mere seniority but seniority and merit and that an adequate system of judicial audit is critical”, he said
Alagaratnam likewise called for the Judicial Services Commission to have broader input from the President of the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General, , the President of the Bar Association and relevant civil society representatives to ensure a better informed approach in the matter of appointment and tenure of members of the minor judiciary.
