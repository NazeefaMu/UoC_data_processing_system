Why can’t MR go to CID? - Rajitha

Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne asked as to why former President Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot go to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to record a statement in connection with the Keith Noyahr abduction case, if Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe could testify before the bond commission.
The Minister made the above statement at the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday, in response to a question raised by a journalist as to whether the CID would go to the former President’s house to get a statement, if he does not visit the CID office.
“Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has to be summoned to record a statement when his name is mentioned several times regarding Keith Noyahr’s abduction and assault. Further investigations will be conducted and he will have to answer questions arising from them,” he said.
