Barista serves up best values at BIA outlet

With over twelve outlets spread across the country, Barista has made its name as the largest international coffee chain in Sri Lanka. Having first been established in the year 2002, Barista is now at its peak within the café scene, with a growing number of coffeeholics patronising the fine Italian coffee served at their outlets.
Each outlet spread out within the Colombo city limits, and tourist hot spots around the country has its own unique offering and one of the latest outlets at the BIA has its own USP.
Located at the departure lounge of the airport, the Barista outlet at BIA now offers the “Best Value Meal” you can get – a cup of Barista’s signature cappuccino and a mouth-watering sandwich – a satisfying quick meal before you take off our shores for just 6 USD.
The outlet, just like all other outlets, will serve a wide range of coffee which you can combine with any of the coffee companions available to complete your meal. Barista’s outlets serve a variety of Paninis and Sandwiches on their menu along with sweet indulgences such as Blueberry Cheesecake, Chocolate Fudge Cake and the signature Lavazza Coffee Cake.
The outlet also now serves limited edition Lavazza Coffee Cream by Barista for the first time in Sri Lanka, for those who wish to feel the festivities for a nominal rate of 3 USD. This is the first of many value additions at this outlet situated at the gateway to the nation.
Speaking on this novel offering CEO of Barista Athula Yapa said, “Since the recent renovation of the BIA, Sri Lanka’s only international airport has become a busier place. Barista is offering a unique best value meal to anyone who has already enjoyed everything that Sri Lanka has to offer. It may also be a lasting memory of home before you head out of the nest or to find greener pastures. Food has a unique way of being nostalgic and this is what we want to offer.”
Barista has spread its reach across the island in convenient locations in Colombo such as the National Museum outlet near Nelum Pokuna, Laksala outlet at Thunmulla, at the World Trade Centre, Bambalapitiya, Overseas School of Colombo, Rajagiriya and Nawala.
Outside Colombo, Barista ensures their signature coffee and warm hospitality can be enjoyed at key holiday destinations such as at the Peradeniya Gardens, Ella, Unawatuna and Mirissa with guaranteed consistency.
