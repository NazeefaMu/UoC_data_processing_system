Seylan Bank’s Chamil Cooray wins the National Crown for the 13th time

Seylan Bank’s commitment to its corporate sporting culture has come to limelight yet again with its employee Chamil Cooray’s victory at the 49th National Carrom Championship conducted by the Carrom Federation of Sri Lanka (CFSL) where he clinched the National crown for the 13th time.
Chamil Cooray also captained the Sri Lankan men’s Carrom team to a glorious victory, defeating India and emerging World Carrom Champions at the 7th World Carrom Championship 2016 finals held in Birmingham, UK, last year.
Current National Carrom champion, Chamil Cooray, also won the top spot in the Swiss League category. With his performance at the Carrom Championship 2016 last year, Chamil became the only Sri Lankan to win the Swiss League on two consecutive occasions, having previously won it in 2014.
Chamil, who comes from a family background which revolves around carrom, participated in his first international championship when he was 15 years old and was the youngest player to win the national championship at the age of 17. An employee of Seylan Bank for 11 years, Chamil noted that he was grateful for the support from his family and encouragement from Seylan Bank over the years.
