‘Namal Kumara, not a PTFDP employee’

The Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention (PTFDP) which functions under the Office of the President yesterday stated that Namal Kumara of the Anti Corruption Force was not an employee of theirs and has never been one.
PTFDP Director Dr. Samantha Kumara Kithalawarachchi releasing a statement to the media explained that despite Kumara’s claims that he was hired by the PTFDP in 2015, he was only a volunteer who had joined one of their programmes among the many thousands around the country.
The PTFDP is a special project which functions under the direct supervision of the President and was launched in 2015 to curb the drug menace in the country.
Thereafter, the PTFDP; a multi stakeholder committee of experts was formed to run various drug prevention campaigns and programs around the country.
The statement explained that in order to promote their various programmes, applications for volunteers around the country were called for through the Divisional Secretariats in each region. Thus far 20,000 volunteers work in various drug prevention programs around the country.
“Namal Kumara, a resident of Warakapola too had volunteered for the drug prevention programme in the past couple of years and worked in the Kegalle district,” the statemenst added.
“He is not an employee of the Presidential Secretariat and does not work in the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention and a complaint has been made to the CID to investigate into whether he posed off as an employee in the above organisations to conduct any illegal activities,” the statement further added.
