Mangala urges friendly consular role

Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday urged his ministry’s Consular Affairs Division to render its services affectionately as well as efficiently to Sri Lankan citizens overseas and in Sri Lanka.
He said one must not forget that one must interact with the people despite all the comforts of smart technologies, digitalisation, infrastructure and new management systems, such as those available at the Consular Affairs Division.
The minister was speaking after inaugurating its re-engineered Consular Affairs Division at the Ceylinco building, Colombo1.
He said as the public service window of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Consular Affairs Division is expected to win the hearts of the people even as they provide an efficient consular service to the public.
“Even as we use novel technologies to improve our services, the people also resort to technologies to keep us under check,” the minister said.
“I received an e-mail from Saudi Arabia yesterday which had a sound file that contained a conversation that had taken place between that person and a certain person at our foreign mission there in which the person from our side is apparently blaming that person, “he said.
“He sends me the audio file requesting me to take action. This is not a one way street for technology is on everybody’s hand,” he said.
