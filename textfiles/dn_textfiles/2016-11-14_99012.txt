Battle on in youngest ever world chess championship

NEW YORK, Saturday – Reigning world chess champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway and Russian grandmaster Sergei Karyakin went head to head on Friday in the first game of a battle to determine the world's top player.
Carlsen -- who has held the title since 2014 -- made the opening move as the first of 12 games got under way in New York.
After 42 moves, the game ended in a draw. The world championship battle is billed as the youngest ever in terms of the players’ cumulative ages: Carlsen is 25 and Karyakin is 26.
It is also the first between players who came of age in the computer era, representing a generational shift in the game.
In another first, the world championship will be broadcast from its trendy Manhattan venue using virtual reality, organizers said.
The two players will split the $1.1-million (one million euros) prize, with the winner getting three-fifths of the purse and the loser taking home the rest.
The two players know each other well: They occasionally chat on Skype, although they kept contact to a minimum in the run-up to the game.
Carlsen is the bookmakers’ favorite but Karyakin -- who practices at least six hours a day -- is seen as having every chance of causing an upset.
The tournament has prompted comparisons with the iconic 1972 showdown between American Bobby Fischer and the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky, two rivals in the Cold War-era whose showdown was dubbed the “Match of the Century.”
This match comes as Moscow and Washington's relations have plunged to their lowest point since the Cold War due to disagreements on Syria and Ukraine.
The Russian president of the World Chess Federation (FIDE), Kirsan Ilyumzhinov is unable to attend the championship after being denied a visa, possibly because he has been on a US Treasury blacklist since 2015 over financial ties to the Syrian government.
“This is the first time in the history of the world championships that the (FIDE) president is not at the match,” Ilyumzhinov told journalists in Moscow on Thursday. Carlsen has been called the “Mozart of Chess”, and has inspired wide interest in the game in Norway since first winning the world title in 2013. He has picked up endorsements and deals that earn him some $2 million a year. AFP
