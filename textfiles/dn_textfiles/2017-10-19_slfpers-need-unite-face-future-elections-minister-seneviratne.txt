SLFPers  need to unite to face future  elections - Minister Seneviratne

Members and supporters of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) wonder whether the SLFP can establish its own Government in 2020 with the existing differences within the party, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
Minister Seneviratne said there is no point of blaming the Joint Opposition because they operate with the permission of President Sirisena. There are a lot of disciplinary inquiries going on against them and there is a possibility that they will not receive nominations. Therefore they will look for another political party to contest future elections. Seneviratne was addressing the SLFP District Convention held in Ratnapura recently.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said that every time the SLFP had internal conflicts, it was defeated in the past and the SLFP had to languish in the Opposition for 17 years due to those internal conflicts and issues. Therefore the party is important than individuals and families, he said.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the SLFP should get ready to face LG Polls and all like to see unity within the party. “But we cannot wait expecting unity to establish. All decisions in the Joint Opposition are being made by Basil Rajapaksa. “No matter who wins the upcoming LG polls, the remote control is in our hands,”Amaraweera said.
