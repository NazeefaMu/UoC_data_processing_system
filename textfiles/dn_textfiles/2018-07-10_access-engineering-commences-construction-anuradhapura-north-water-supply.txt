Access Engineering PLC has commenced the construction work of the Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project – Phase 1.
The project is spearheaded by The National Water Supply and Drainage Board for the purpose of providing potable water in Divisional Secretariat Rambewa and Madawachchiya. The scope of the project includes the construction of an intake facility, flow control structures, Water Treatment Plants, 03 ground reservoirs, four elevated water towers and associate building works and electro-mechanical works.
