Calls for collective decisions at Cabinet - Rajitha

President Maithripala Sirisena has asked that all decisions be made collectively at Cabinet and not outside, so that all could work together as a government, clarified Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday, as he quelled rumours of a rift between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Cabinet this week.
The media this week had reported that the PM earned the President’s ire when he had asked for more time to abolish the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) as requested by the President. The President for a second week in a row had submitted a Cabinet paper asking that the CCEM be abolished and all economic decisions be taken through his National Economic Council (NEC).
“The President simply asked the PM to quickly take all steps necessary to come together as one team and work for the future,” added Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, at the weekly Cabinet media briefing held at the Department of Government Information.
Any subjects which need special attention can have a Cabinet sub-committee appointed under the Prime Minister to look into that, explained Minister Senaratne further.
