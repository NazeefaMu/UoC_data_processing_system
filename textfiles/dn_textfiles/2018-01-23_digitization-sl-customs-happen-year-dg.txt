Digitization of SL Customs  to happen this year - DG

In keeping with the government’s vision for a digital economy and the World Customs Organization mandate, a series of plans will be implemented in 2018 to digitize the Sri Lanka Customs, Director General of Customs P.M.S. Charles, said yesterday.
As a part of the move towards paperless trade, Sri Lanka Customs will implement the use of digital signature from February 1, 2018, DG Charles said. The introduction of an e-signature will be a giant leap in improving Sri Lanka’s trade dynamics.
Responding to the Daily News, DG Charles further said that plans are afoot to implement an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) at the Sri Lanka Customs that will standardize its international trade performances. The EDI is an electronic interchange of business information platform which promotes paperless business communication.
She also noted that SL Customs has already introduced the online payment system 24/7.
“We are moving towards paperless office and pre-arrival documents. We are also in the process of developing the National Single Window, Trade Information Portal and the trade facilitation unit. There are a series of plans to be implemented this year to uplift the standards of the services provided by SL Customs,” she further added.
DG Charles made these observations while inspecting an event held to destroy counterfeit and pirated goods, at the SL Customs, Orugodawatta, yesterday.
