Malinga taught me how to use yorkers: Jasprit Bumrah

Jasprit Bumrah wouldn't have made his India debut if Mohammed Shami stayed fit for the Australia series. But the 22-year-old Gujarat pacer made best use of the opportunity that came his way and now he is an integral part of the Indian set up for the ICC World T20 2016.
In an exclusive chat with TOI, Bumrah, who has made a name for himself with his unorthodox action and ability to bowl yorkers, says he is ready to prove that he is not a one-series wonder. Excerpts:
Did you expect to be so successful in your first series for India?
Jasprit Bumrah in action.
JB: I knew if I bowl to my strengths I will make an impact. But at the same time, it was crucial for me to hold my nerves and not be over-enthusiastic. I won't deny that there was pressure but I enjoyed myself and fortunately I contributed in India's win.
You got very little time to prepare for the tour as you were called in as a replacement for Shami...
JB: I was in the India 'A' side when we toured Australia in 2014 and had bowled to a lot of their Test batsmen. That experience stood me in good stead. The pitches in Australia have also changed and are no longer pacy.They are conducive to batting. So my mind set was to bowl line and length effectively like the way I would perform for Gujarat.
You are one of the rare Indian pacers who can bowl yorkers at will. How did you develop this art?
JB: I used to bowl yorker from an early stage with tennis balls. But it was at Mumbai Indians (MI) nets where I learnt to develop it as a lethal weapon. Lasith Malinga is a proponent of the art and was impressed with me. He taught me how and when to use orker . He would tell me how to vary the pace of the yorker and not to be predictable. In fact, I learnt to bowl the slow yorker from him.
For a fast bowler, you have a very unorthodox action. Do you think that gives you an advantage?
JB: It certainly does because the batsmen remain confused and they take some time to figure out my release. It gives me the freedom to catch batsmen by surprise and bowl anywhere. But the action also has its own weakness. With this action, I need to focus a lot on my fitness because it puts a lot of stress on my knees.
Biomechanic tests have proved that if you use your left arm more to generate more pace...
JB: See, I never received proper training as such and learnt my cricket by watching TV. This action came to me naturally and as long as it is giving me results, I am happy. I also feel if I can bowl accurately, the pace is not mandatory.
Do you fear that one day the batsmen might pick read your action and play you easier?
JB: Back in 2014, I injured my left knee badly. I feared I will never be able to bowl fast. But I made a strong comeback.That phase made me mentally tough. I know that there might be a day when batsmen would figure out my action. So then, I will be ready to make adjustments. But now, I am not thinking much about the future.
With you making a name for yourself, focus will be on you in the upcoming series against Sri Lanka and ICC World T20. Have you started your preparations?
JB: By playing in the IPL, I have a fair idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the batsmen. So I will be ready to prove myself. Playing in India will be a different challenge and there will be pressure on me. So the aim is to cement my place in the side by performing to my strengths. I am only going to let the ball do the talking. - TNN
