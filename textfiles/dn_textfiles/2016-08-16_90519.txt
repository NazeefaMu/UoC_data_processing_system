Katy Perry ready for pop comeback

Katy Perry is ready to regain her status as the “biggest thing” in pop music.
The singer released her fourth album Prism in 2013, which offered up dance hits such as Roar and Dark Horse. Following the end of her headlining world tour in 2014, which grossed $204 million (£157 million) worldwide, Katy has been enjoying an extended break, carefully selecting her appearances, such as the NFL Super Bowl halftime show in February last year (15).
But the 31-year-old has been working on music since May (16), and is apparently ready to get back into the spotlight full time.
“Katy loves performing, so a large part of 2017 is already put aside for a huge world tour,” a source told Britain’s Heat magazine. “She’s ready to be back and be the biggest thing in pop.”
While Katy recorded an anthem for the 2016 Summer Olympics called Rise, which was released last month (Jul16), it will apparently be a standalone track, and won’t feature on her upcoming album.
But fans shouldn’t have to wait too long to get their dose of pop tunes from the megastar. “Her new album will be out in October or November, and the industry is really excited about it,” the insider added. Meanwhile, Katy is apparently on a high following a relaxing getaway with her actor beau Orlando Bloom. The Firework singer and the 39-year-old star were spotted enjoying some time together while on vacation in Sardinia, Italy, recently. The two were spotted laughing and holding hands during their beach day, the latest destination date for the couple who began dating earlier this year (16). And being with Orlando has greatly benefited Katy, who has had tumultuous relationships in the past with the likes of John Mayer and ex-husband Russell Brand. - Music-News
