Arjun Aloysius to desist giving evidence  at Bond Commission hearings

Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius yesterday officially informed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue that he will not give evidence before the commission.
Aloysius yesterday appeared before the commission with his legal representative President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana to make the official statement.
On 13 September, the Treasury Bond Commission ordered Aloysius to testify before the commission while pointing out that it will not compel his to give evidence. After receiving legal instructions, Aloysius decided not to give evidence before the commission.
Meanwhile, Steven Samuel, the Personal Assistant to Aloysius came to the commission to make a statement to the CID officers assisting the commission.
