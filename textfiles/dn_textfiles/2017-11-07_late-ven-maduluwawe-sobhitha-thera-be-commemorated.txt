Late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera to be commemorated

The second commemoration of late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera will take place on November 8 at 9.00 am at Ape Gama, Battaramulla, with the presence of President Maithipala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Addressing a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) in Colombo, yesterday, Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) Chairman and Attorney-at-law Ravi Jayawardana said that a monument will be constructed near the Parliament and Ape Gama to commemorate the late Thera. The government will spend the funds required for this purpose.
The President and Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone for the monument at 9.00 am on November 8. Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya will deliver late Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera’s commemoration speech.
According to the SLRC Chairman, the monument will be different from the other monuments in the country and the surrounding of the monument will keep open for the public to move around freely in a calm and quiet environment.
The late Thera worked hard for a new constitution and to abolish the Executive Presidency ignoring his ill health. He was an excellent communicator and dedicated his entire life for the betterment of the country and the people.
The Commemoration Foundation Secretary Palitha Lihiniya Kumara said that the Commemoration Foundation will continue all social welfare activities carried out by the late Thera and as the first step, 153 new houses will be constructed with the assistance of the Indian government for the people living at Alapathgama village which was established by the late Thera with 153 houses during the terror period and at that time, the village was considered as a border village. This village and its villagers were discriminated by the previous regime.
Alapathgama has already been developed up to a certain extent with a fully carpeted road, two useful tanks, etc. A CTB bus has been provided for the use of the villagers. A pre-school, health centre, library, an economic centre and many more facilities will be provided for this village soon and it will be fully developed beyond the level expected by the late Thera by the time of his third commemoration, which falls on November 8, 2018. The Indian government assists development projects, he added.
