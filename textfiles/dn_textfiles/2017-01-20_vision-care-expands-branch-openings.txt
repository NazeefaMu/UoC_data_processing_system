Vision Care expands with branch openings

With a core focus on expanding Vision Care’s range of optical services to a wider majority of areas covering all major districts in the country, the eye care solutions provider has embarked on yet another feat of branch expansion.
The newest branches opened are in Gampaha, Kuliyapitiya, Negombo, Matara and Monaragala, totaling to 39 branches scattered strategically across Sri Lanka.
Vision Care has continuously concentrated on disseminating their range of optical products as well as notable awareness about the company’s services through their expansion scheme. This has been done with the hope of penetrating all 25 districts within Sri Lanka and ensuring that every nook and corner of the country receives the opportunity of experiencing the brands being marketed under Vision Care.
Vision Care General Manager Harsha Maduranga commented, ‘Vision Care has come upon the realization that every citizen has the right to enjoy a fundamental necessity when it comes to eye care solutions and that approach has led us to establish the mobile facilities. Under Vision Care’s own systemized training centre, we have embarked on providing today’s youth with the opportunity to experience and understand an all-important segment of prospects in the field of eye and hearing care.”
Vision Care has also embarked on the exercise of initiating two mobile services where a selected range of products and services would be arranged and made aware of through the mobile service and taken into remote areas of the country, taking Vision Care and its services to prospective customers.
Another emphasis about Vision Care is the company’s ability to provide fully-fledged services relevant to both, eye and hearing care solutions for Sri Lankans. The potential customer can be availed with a number of solutions that would fit their budget as well as be rest assured of the quality of the products that is available under Vision care.
Vision Care has also secured a name as one of the best eyecare solutions providers in Sri Lanka that has embarked on importing and distributing branded and quality-based products on par with international product ranges and technologically driven to infuse an innovative and modernized approach to ensure that their customers receive the best of services.
