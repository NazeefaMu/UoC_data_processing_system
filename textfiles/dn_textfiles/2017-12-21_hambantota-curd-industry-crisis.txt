Hambantota curd industry in crisis

The curd industry in Hambantota district is facing a crisis due to an array of reasons, including prolonged drought, lack of fodder and water, lack of grazing lands for buffaloes and cattle, theft of buffaloes and cattle, trap guns laid to hunt wild beasts by unruly elements and transportation of these animals to distant towns by cattle thieves, and lack of high breed cattle and buffalo. All these factors have contributed greatly toward the destruction of the traditional curd industry.
Wildlife officials say that stray cattle enter the national parks and consume fodder meant for wild beasts. Meanwhile, representatives from the farming community complain that stray cattle destroy their paddy cultivations and home gardens.
Cattle and buffalo herd owners say that complaints lodged with certain relevant authorities regarding the issue remain unattended because paddy field owners are mightier than the cattle and buffalo herd owners.
The lands were allocated several years ago for grazing but are now being converted to farming lands with the blessings of certain politicians. During periods of drought such as the present, finding fodder for these animals has posed a burning problem, the cattle owners say. Further, they claim that the price of poonac given to cattle to increase their milk production has increased sixfold.
They have many other grievances but feel there is no one willing to adopt remedial measures for them.
