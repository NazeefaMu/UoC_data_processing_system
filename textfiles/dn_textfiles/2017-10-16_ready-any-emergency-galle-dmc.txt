Ready for any emergency: Galle DMC

All rescue and relief providing establishments are on alert and precautionary measures have already been taken to face any emergency that may arise due to heavy rains prevailing in the region, Galle District Disaster Management Centre assured.
Galle DMC Assistant Director Colonel Dhampath Rathnayake said three rescue units of the Sri Lanka Army were dispatched to the Hiniduama, Neluwa, and Thawalama areas with boats on Saturday. Several Navy Rescue Units were also on alert, he said.
The people at locations threatened with potential landslides were warned and instructed to move to safer places, he said.
Eighteen canoes and 25 boats were deployed at Baddegama, Elpitiya, Bentota, Habaraduwa, Karnadeniya, Imadiwa, Nagoda, Neluwa, Niyagama, Thawalama, Welivitiya-Divitura and Yaakkalamulla since these areas were identified as vulnerable to floods and landslides. Steps were taken to evacuate them in case of floods, he said.
Heavy rains inundated many areas day before yesterday but by yesterday morning, the water receded, Galle DMC said.
Galle District Secretary S.T. Kodikara said the rescue units were ready for any emergency and all Divisional Secretaries and Grama Seva Officers were instructed to take immediate steps in the event of an emergency. The Southern Province Irrigation Director’s office announced that the increased water level of the Ginganga was gradually receding.
