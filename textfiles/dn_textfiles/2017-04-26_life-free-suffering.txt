A LIFE FREE FROM SUFFERING

Is a life free from all physical suffering possible? I came across a statement “Physical pain is inevitable but the suffering from it optional”. What a statement!! Unfortunately, the writer does not tell how one could arrive at such a state. Physical suffering is something which we all have to undergo at some stage in our lives and we all know only too well the agony of such suffering. I will try to present some ideas on this issue.
I think we all accept that all physical suffering occurs to our bodies. When that happens we say “I am in pain”. If you connect the two statements, you will see that there is an underlying assumption “I am the body”. Please note that, it is an assumption. As such, the entire question of physical pain rests on the validity of this single statement. If it is true, no matter who says what, there is no escape from physical suffering. The inquiry into the validity of this statement has been generalized by framing the question “Who am I?” which is the corner stone of a meditation known as Atma Vichara or Self Inquiry. The culmination of this inquiry apparently is, the total “disappearance” of all thoughts and consequently the body and the world which are creations of the thought process leaving, the sole reality “Pure Consciousness”. My interpretation of the beautiful statement “BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM” is just that.
In ancient time, the wise men of India got together and posed themselves this question “What is it when known, everything else is known?” The answer they came up with? Yes, the answer to the question “Who am I?”
You may say, “Ok, so it is all very nice but has anyone ever come to a state free from all physical suffering?” The answer is “Yes!! As far as I know only one man has come to such a state. He is Ramana Maharishi. The incidents that happened in this context in his life are so incredible that one would never believe them if not for the fact that he lived only about 70 years ago and every incident in his life is documented almost on a daily basis and is available for anyone to see at his Ashram at Tiruvannamale.
Personally speaking, no matter how much you know, with all due respect to scientific knowledge, as long as you don’t know the answer to the only relevant question, experientially verified of course “Who am I?” so long you will be living a life on a false basis and suffer untold physical pain as a consequence.
As the ultimate prize, the realization of the answer to that one single question would, in my view, terminate the Rebirth Process and lead to the ending of Samsara and consequently to the ending of all suffering forever.
