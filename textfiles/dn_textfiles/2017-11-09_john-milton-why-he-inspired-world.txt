JOHN  MILTON:  WHY HE INSPIRED  THE WORLD

He was responsible for the brilliant and fierce pamphlets that included the famous defence of literature in Aeropacitica (1644) when poetry was pushed back into doledrums during the Civil War. He dared the system to do so, he who rose to write his monumental work for which he is best remembered, Paradise Lost.
John Milton (1608-74) always had luck on his side especially on his writing efforts based on religious and political convictions. One such, On The Morning of Christ's Nativity zoomed his early popularity. As luck followed him, he had the signal honour bestowed on him by an audience with Pope Urban VII arranged by the most powerful man in Rome, Cardinal Francesco Barberini who was the councilor and uncle to the Pope. Milton being a strong Protestant made no difference to the Pope who was amazed at his credentials. Young Milton was only thirty years old and conversant in Latin and Italian as well as in English that impressed the Pope.
FATHER'S INFLUENCE John Miton's father was a composer that made his son with a lifelong embrace for music though he did not peruse a career in music that his father afforded but led him to associate with composers of his time especially Henry Lawes. Milton senior's prosperity was delectated at providing his son with an eminent tutor, Thomas Young who was a Scottish Presbyterian from the University of St. Andrew's. Researchers are of opinion that Young may have influenced the tender Milton to religious radicalism that resulted him becoming a strong Protestant which made his devout Catholic father, Richard Milton disinherit him.
Let on his own, Milton attended St. Paul's School in London and studied Greek and Latin and most of the classical languages found in his poetry. Not second to his English poetry, he also wrote in Italian and Latin.
Milton attended Christ's College, Cambridge and graduated in 1629 and ranked fourth of 24 honour graduates. Obtaining his Masters of Arts in July, 1632, Milton stayed on to become an Anglicam priest. As shadows cast on coming events, this must have been a precedent to him having written the first datable compositions on two psalms at the age of 15 when he was at Long Bennigton.
Lady of Christ's College He came to be known as Lady of Christ because of his delicate fair complexion, grace and infinity when he was sixteen years old. As he matured, he was not happy being called by this term and quickly asked the church and call to refrain from it because of his loyalty and reverence to Mother Mary whom he adored.
'What slender youth, bedewed with liquid odours,
Courts thee on roses in some pleasant cave,
Pyrrha? For whom bind'st thou
In wreaths thy golden hair,
Plain in thy neatness? Oh, how oft shall he
On faith and changed gods complain, and seas
Rough with black winds and storms
Unwonted shall admire!
Who now enjoys thee credulous, all gold;
Who always vacant, always amiable,
Hopes thee, of flattering gales
Unmindful. Hapless they
To whom thou untried seem'st fiar ! Me, in my vowed
Picture, the sacred wall declares't have hung
My dank and dropping weeds
To the stern God of Sea.'
If I say Milton’s work inspired and fired the imagination of William Wordsworth, no one will dispute. He had sweeping powers not only on writers but his followers and all those engaged in poetry and prose writing during his life time and continue to do so,
What made Milton the icon poet of England? Many talent put together; his disposition, toward life , trust and faith in god, love for humanity, simplicity and the will to do the right thing.
Not lyrical at all, he shunned nature in writing but chose characters in people and places. Unlike Wordsworth, he appealed more to the serious reader, especially after the resounding success of PARADISE LOST , divided into several books. This masterpiece was followed by PARADISE REGAINED.
Book no.1 begins with Argument :-
This First Book propose, first in brief, the whole subject,-
Man’s disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise, wherein he was placed ; then touches the prime cause of his fall – the Serpent, or rather Satan in the Serpent; who, revolting from God, and drawing to his side many legions of Angels, was, by the command of God, driven out of Heaven, with all his crew, into the great Deep. Which action passed over, the Poem hastens into the midst of things ; presenting Satan , with his Angels, now fallen into Hell – described here not in the Center (for haven and earth may be supposed as yet not made , certainly not yet accursed ), but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest called Chaos. Here Satan, with his Angels lying on the burning lake, thunderstruck and astonished, ofter a certain space recovers, as from confusion; calls up him who, next in order and dignity, lay by him: they confer of their miserable fall. Satan awakens all his legions, who lay till then in the same manner confounded. They rise: their numbers: array of battle: their chief leaders named, according to the idols known afterwards in Canaan and the countries adjoining. To these Stan directs his speech; comforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven; but tells them, lastly, of a new world and new kind of creature to be created, according to an ancient prophecy, or report, in Heaven-for that Angels were long before this visible creation was the opinion of many ancient Fathers. To find out the truth of this prophecy, and what to determine thereon, he refers to a fully council. What his associates thence attempt. Pandemonium, the palace of Stan rises, suddenly built out of the Deep; the infernal Peers there sit in council.
JOHN MILTON was born on 9 December 1608 in Bread Street, London into an effluent Roman Catholic family, was considered a man of letters and, English poet and a polemicist. An angry young man who defended the freedom of the press among many other atrocities. His condemnation of pre-publication censorship is among history's most influential defense of free speech.

O' Nightingale that you bloomy spray
Warbl'st at eve, When all the wood are still
Thou with fresh hope the lovers' hearts dost fill
While the jolly hours lead on propitious May
Thy liquid notes that close the eye of day
First heard before the shallow cuckoo's bill,
Portend success in love, O, if Jove's will
Have linked that amorous power to try soft lay….
(To The Nightingale)
