Tree planting campaign at Crow Island to mark International Day of Forests

A tree planting campaign will be held at Crow Island in Mattakuliya to mark the International Day of Forests, which falls on March 21 with the participation of senior ministers and government officials. The international community celebrates this day for the 6th time with the theme “Forest and Sustainable Cities”
The Forest Conservation Department had organised many campaigns to develop the forest plantation in every district in diversified ways. Plans to grow tress beside roadways and in populated places in cities are already underway. The department plans to extend the forest cover of the country to 32 percent which is currently at 28 percent.
The Forest Conservation Department with the Department of Wildlife Conservation had invested Rs. 900 million for the conservation of trees. Another two projects are underway in parallel to the tree planting campaign to increase the catchment areas of the Moragahakanda and Victoria reservoirs to 25,000 hectares each.
This is funded by the international community following the proposals made by President Maithripala Sirisena at the UN Environment Assembly held at Nairobi on December 4, 2017. The UN had awarded a grant of 38 million USD from the Green Climate Fund to the Department.
The Forest Conversation Department is confident in their newly implemented campaigns in controlling catastrophic environmental fluctuations if the campaigns prove their success.
Only three percent of the Earth is occupied by large cities and half of the world population resides in them. These citizens use 75 percent of natural resources of the world and 60 – 80 percent of the world energy along with a high carbon emission rate of 75 percent.
Therefore, it is vital for these cities to contribute in the highest possible way for the growth of natural forest covers.
