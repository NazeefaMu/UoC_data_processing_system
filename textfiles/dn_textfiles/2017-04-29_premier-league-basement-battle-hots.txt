Premier League basement battle hots up

LONDON: While the race for the Premier League title has become a contest solely between leaders Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, the battle to beat the drop is a more complicated affair.
With a maximum of five rounds left, the identities of the bottom three who will be relegated into the second-tier Championship come the end of the season have still to be confirmed.
Sunderland have excelled at staying up in recent seasons, but even their reputation as the Harry Houdini of the Premier League may not be enough to save them this time. Wednesday's 1-0 defeat by northeast rivals and fellow strugglers Middlesbrough left bottom of the table Sunderland 12 points adrift of safety with a maximum of 15 still available to them this season.Defeat completed a wretched day for Sunderland manager David Moyes, who has been charged by England's Football Association for telling a female reporter she might “get a slap”.
But the defiant Scot, whose side are at home to Bournemouth on Saturday, insisted he had no intention of walking out on the Black Cats.
“No, I'm here, I'm the manager, you take it on the chin. I am used to winning, I'm not used to losing and I don't want to get used to it either.” Marten de Roon's ninth-minute strike gave Steve Agnew his first win since replacing Aitor Karanka as Middlesbrough boss and the club's first in the league since December 17, although they remain six points shy of safety.
“We hadn't won a game since December, so we needed to win the game,” said Agnew, whose side now face a daunting trip to Manchester City on Sunday.
Clement confidence
Swansea too had the morale boost of a win, a 2-0 victory over Stoke, last time out but they remain in the bottom three, two points from safety, ahead of their Sunday match at Manchester United.
“I am very confident that we will stay up,” said bullish Swansea coach Paul Clement.
“Maybe I would not have been if we had not got that good result and good performance against Stoke.” Hull, just above the relegation zone, have earned 19 points out of 21 at home since manager Marco Silva was hired but they now face a potentially awkward trip to Southampton. -AFP
