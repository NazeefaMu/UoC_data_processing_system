Ranjit Fernando much admired Cricketer, Coach and Commentator

RANJIT FERNANDO looked every inch like a West Indian cricketer, more like an Everton Weekes, but while he had the West Indian batsman’s batting genes in him, he added more charm to it by being a wicket keeper of sheer class. Starting his leather ball cricket as an under-12 player, he served notice of someday sporting the Sri Lanka cap with all coaches he came under predicting it. And it was not long when those predictions came true.
Learning all aspects
Learning all aspects about the game as his career grew from under-12-under-14 and under-16 and then automatically making it to the First X1 under the writer’s captaincy in 1960, his first big game was against St.Peter’s College, Bambalapitiya where he batted in the middle and being unfortunate to miss a debut 50. That was also the game where SBC beat the Peterites for the first time in the history of these encounters. FERNANDO made waves when regular wicket keeper Alan Gunasekera shed gloves in favour of the youngster. And thus began his way to stardom as a wicket keeper batsman of international class. From that memorable moment there was never looking back.
His rise was meteoric and his best remembered innings that he played was when he mauled a Royal College attack to score a belligerent 112 before the milk interval in 1962. In those days scoring a century before the milk interval was rarely heard of or scored. Inter-school matches then began at 12 noon and there was a break of 10 minutes after 110 minutes of play. In that 110 minutes he made a blistering 112 that had the full house of spectators cheering wildly and it had the batting of an Everton Weekes writ on it.
So from one of Asia’s Best Wicket keepers, Dr.H.I.K. Fernando, who I featured last Thursday, its logical for me to move on to another Fernando who shone in the pre Test era, EDWARD RANJIT FERNANDO who hailed from that green, white and green school in Kotahena St. Benedict’s College.
FERNANDO was also from my neighaborhood and although being a little junior to me, we moved together during our growing up days and started as usual playing softball cricket at St. Lucia’s Cathedral Church yard from which yard emerged many brilliant Benedictine cricketers.
After a glittering school career where he led the school in 1962 and after being adjudged the ‘schoolboy cricketer of the year’ he joined the Nondescripts Cricket Club where H.I.K. Fernando was the permanent keeper and his chances of gloving for the club was remote unless H.I.K. suffered some injury. FERNANDO had the talent and was in big demand by other clubs but he chose right and joined the NCC and came under Asia’s Best wicket keeper who had heard much about the young man.
Taught him good wicket keeping
H.I.K. immediately took a fondness to FERNANDO and taught him the nuances of good wicket keeping and FERNNDO was quick to learn from the great man and once H.I.K. joined the Army, he took over the glove work and performed admirably in the big league and coming under the astute leadership of Michael Tissera his keeping improved tremendously and his place in the national team was not long in coming.
He was in the Sri Lanka team as a schoolboy when the country under Michael Tissera toured India in 1964 as second wicket keeper to H.I.K. Although he did not play in that famous unofficial four-day Test which ended in a historic win for Sri Lanka, being in the swim of things and the atmosphere in the dressing room helped FERNANDO in his career that blossomed from there onwards. Under Tissera at the NCC Fernando says it was different, organized and enriching experience.
FERNANDO won his first unofficial Test cap against Colin Cowdrey’s England touring team in an unofficial Test in 1969 and that game was the stepping stone for more representative honous in unofficial Tests and ODIs both at home and abroad until he put aside his cricketing gear in 1979. FERNANDO sported NCC colours from 1963 to 1979 and played Sara trophy cricket for over a record 16 years and captaining the club he led them to winning many trophies.
Refused Cowdrey’s offer
A little known fact was that after the unofficial Test against England, Captain Colin Cowdrey a stalwart of Kent County Club highly impressed with FERNANDO’s excellent work behind the stumps invited him to join his county club. But as FERNANDO says after much deliberation did not pursue it on the advice of his parents because by then he had hit upon a very steady job with a future at Mackwoods.
FERNANDO, I guess, remembers and regrets the wasted opportunities when a scheduled tour to England to play three day games against all the counties and a game against MCC was called off. The tour squad trained on fitness and skills for months and then an incident that was not cricket took place when two selectors picked themselves and hey presto the tour was cancelled. It was heartbreak. It was a waste says FERNANDO and it took our cricket back a few years.
No doubt what FERNANDO will remember most and a memory that he would still dreads is when he had to face the thunderbolts of that venomous opening pair of Australian bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson when he opened batting for the country in the 1975 World Cup in England when no head gear was in vogue.
Facing Lille and Thomson
He opened with Sunil Wettimuny and when at the non-striker’s end he used to always give the two pacemen broad smiles so as to soften them so that they would not let fly at him. But smiles or no smiles they were devastating to face.
A wicket keeper’s job is a tough ask because the keeper has to squat, stand and concentrate every ball. In his own recounting he says he enjoyed and learnt a lot keeping to spinners Elmo Rodrigopulle, Cyril Ernest, Gordon Dissanayake, Kanaga Balendren an Nevile Pereira and paceman Nihal Zoysa at SBC and later keeping to Ian Pieris, Darrel Lieversz, Norton Fredrick, Sylvester Dias, T.B. Kehelgamuwa and world class spinners Ajit de Silva, Lalith Kaluperuma, D.S.de Silva, Daya Sahabandu, Abu Fuard, Neil Chanmugam, Anura Polonowita, Fritz Crozier, Annesley de Silva, Priya Perera and Raja de Silva.
Fernando later served Sri Lanka Cricket in almost every capacity – player, coach, administrator, selector, television commentator for over 25 years and also as a cricket journalist. He was Executive Secretary (honorary) of the Sri Lanka Cricket Foundation for many years. A career that any cricketer could be proud of.
And now the question that needs to be asked is whether Ranjit Fernando is better known in our country or is it his glamorous and talented wife Ramani, who has acquitted herself so well in the beautician business? Ask any lady, conscious of beauty and style, and you'll get the answer!
