FR against President for appointing over 30 ministers

A fundamental rights petition filed by a lawyer challenging President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to increase the number of Cabinet ministers from 30 to 48 was yesterday fixed to be mentioned on November 17 by the Supreme Court. This petition had been filed by attorney-at-law Aruna Laksiri. He has cited President Sirisena and the Attorney General as respondents.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court Justices Upaly Aberatne and Anil Goonaratne, Deputy Solicitor General Indika Demuni de Silva with Dr. Awanthi Perera appearing for the first and second respondents informed Court that they were raising preliminary objections against the petition.
The petitioner has stated that according to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, a National Government should comprise the party that has obtained the highest number of seats and the other parties and independent groups in Parliament. The petitioner maintains that the present government could not be described as a National Government merely because a couple of parties entered into an agreement to form a government, and, therefore, it is a gross violation of Article 46.1 (a) of the Constitution. The petitioner is seeking interim relief preventing the President from appointing more than 30 ministers.
