Sysco executives, global food service industry leader visit innovation center in SL

Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY), the leading global food service distribution company, announced that two of the Company’s executives, including its executive vice president and chief technology officer, Wayne Shurts, visited the Sysco LABS team in Colombo.
Sysco LABS is Sysco’s innovation team, leveraging agile and design thinking to re-imagine the customer experience, with team members in Redwood City, California, Austin and Houston, Texas, and its core engineering team in Colombo. Shurts and Sysco’s vice president of business technology, Americas, Wesley Story, were in Colombo to discuss Sysco’s business strategy and collaborate with the local Sysco LABS’ team on the cutting edge work taking place.
Sysco supplies close to half a million customer locations across the globe, with a team that is over 65,000 strong. In order to accomplish this feat, it employs technology in everything it does, including the sourcing of products, storing and managing them in digitally catalogued temperature-controlled warehouses, calculating price and availability and coordinating orders, deliveries and reporting.
Sysco is able to reliably supply hundreds of thousands of customers with products and services that their businesses depend on, because of technology. Together, the Sysco business technology (BT) team and the Sysco LABS team are looking at this technology stack, and how it can be innovated to streamline Sysco’s business even further.
“Sysco’s business technology team and Sysco LABS are innovation partners, utilizing deep customer insights, cross-functional engagement and agile, rapid design to develop the food service industry’s leading technology,” said Shurts. “We are excited to be in Colombo to support the team, as we work together to enrich our customers’ experience.”
Sysco BT and Sysco LABS work very closely together, often with Sysco LABS delivering new customer facing technology, which is integrated with the core Sysco systems that BT supports on the backend.Sysco LABS’ managing director and senior vice president of engineering, Shanil Fernando, said, “The opportunity in front of us is unlike any other the world over. Food is one of the world’s largest industries, and Sysco is the industry leader in food service. When you combine that with our leading-edge tech and the culture of innovation we have fostered, you can expect to continue to see great things from Sysco and Sysco LABS.”
