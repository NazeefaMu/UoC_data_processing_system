Salman, Ranveer  and Katrina in  ‘Dhoom 4’?

A few reports today suggested that after ‘Race 3’s success at the box office, Salman Khan is set to star in yet another hit franchise. It seems Aditya Chopra’s much-anticipated film ‘Dhoom 4’ will feature Salman in the lead.
According to reports, the makers have been discussing the project with the star for quite some time now. However, it was finalised only after ‘Race 3’s release.
Dhoom 4 will, reportedly, be helmed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, who has helmed the previous ‘Dhoom’ films and is currently busy shooting Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan starrer Thugs Of Hindostan. There is also speculation that Ranveer Singh will also come on board the project.
An insider also stated that Katrina Kaif has been approached to play the female lead in ‘Dhoom 4’. If Katrina and Salman come together in the fourth installment of ‘Dhoom’, it will be their sixth film together.
Let’s wait and watch when the makers will finally announce the cast of ‘Dhoom 4’. TNN
