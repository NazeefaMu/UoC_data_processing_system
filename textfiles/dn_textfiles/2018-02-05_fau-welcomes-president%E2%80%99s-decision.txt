FAU welcomes President’s decision

The Flight Attendants’ Union (FAU) in a media release yesterday welcomed the decision of President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate, inquire into and report on acts of irregularities and corruption in Sri Lankan Airlines Limited, Sri Lankan Catering Limited and Mihin Lanka (Pvt.) Limited. “We consider the initiative of the President as a timely intervention to salvage the national carrier from the endless exploitation and mismanagement it has gone through at the hands of successive administrations,” the statement reads.
The FAU intended to extend its fullest cooperation to the Presidential Commission in fulfilling its mission, the press release states.
An urgent meeting of the executive committee of the union has now been convened to decide on the steps it should take in this regard. The FAU is keen to see the sacrifices the cabin crew has made over nearly three decades to maintain the prestige of keeping the flag of the national carrier flying high is at last put to meaningful use and ensure the future generation will inherit a competitive, profitable and an efficient airline that the nation could be proud of, the statement reads.
