After Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi : is a brilliant co-star

While multi-starrer films are a rarity in Tamil cinema, Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi have worked together in Vikram Vedha, a gangster film set in North Chennai.
Ahead of the release of the film, Madhavan has lavished praise on his co-star, Vijay Sethupathi and said he began his friendship with the latter over a smoke.
Speaking at Vikram Vedha press meet on Wednesday, Madhavan said, “I’ve worked with some of the big names in Indian cinema like Kamal Haasan and Amitabh Bachchan. I would say Vijay Sethupathi is a brilliant and intelligent actor to work with after Kamal Haasan. We have also become cigarette buddies,” said Madhavan.
It must be noted that superstar Shah Rukh Khan released the trailer of Vikram Vedha on Twitter. Madhavan said that the Hindi belt is raving about Vikram Vedha and that he would loved to take the film to Bollywood.
“Yes, my friends from Bollywood have watched the trailer and praised Vijay Sethupathi and music composer Sam. I would loved to take the film there (Bollywood). Since Vikram Vedha is completely set in North Chennai, I’m not sure how to tweak it to match their sensibilities,” he added.
Apart from Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi, the film also stars Shraddha Srinath, Kathir and Varalakshmi Sarathkumar in pivotal roles. Vikram Vedha is directed by duo- Pushkar and Gayathri, and is slated to release on July 7.
