Just In Time Group Christmas Wish Charity  Project helps Children’s Home

Just In Time Group commenced on a Christmas Wish Project for Lucia Perotti Children’s Home situated in Welihena, a small town located on the outskirts of Negombo.
Their needs were simple, Bed sheets with pillow cases, food rations and sanitary items. But we wanted to do a bit more to bring extra joy to the children the Home lacked a TV and we installed a brand new 42 inch TV for the children’s activity room.
The staff of Just In Time Group also contributed in order to give individual gift bags filled with accessories and stationery to brighten their day.
Lucia Perotti Children’s home is a special one, which is managed by Missionary Sister Pushpa who is the main care taker along with six other missionary sisters who have dedicated their lives solely to help children in need of assistance in facing their daily lives through the struggles they face.
It becomes special because of the children who reside here, young girls from the ages 4-16 years who have been saved from extremely troubled backgrounds, experiences and struggles such as, extreme poverty, imprisonment of parents, ethical conflicts, abandonment and abuse to name a few.
For this reason photos of these children are not allowed to be published to the public in order maintain their anonymity.
The primary goal of the home is to provide a comfortable place to live and conditions favouring schooling for the children who have no adequate parental protection, guidance or hope for the future.
Working to create a better and brighter future for our country’s youth is a cause Just In Time staff are very passionate about. Additionally to our Christmas Wish Project, Just in Time Group has already launched and running its CSR programme ‘Today a Reader Tomorrow a Leader’ – which inculcates the habit of reading in children across the island, thereby playing our part in empowering our future generation.
Just In Time Group a wholly Sri Lankan company has been a key partner and implementer of several cutting edge mission critical ICT projects in the country over the last two decades. With the dawn of 2016, Just In Time Group completed a two decade 20 years mammoth journey in the ICT arena of Sri Lanka.
This growth throughout the years is a vital milestone with their longstanding strategic partnerships with principals, customers and employees.
