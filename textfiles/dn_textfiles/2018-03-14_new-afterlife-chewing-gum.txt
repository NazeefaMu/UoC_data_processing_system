New afterlife for chewing gum

British designer Anna Bullus found an ingenious way to collect chewed gum and transform it into coffee cups, Wellington boots and shoe soles.
Her project started 10 years ago when she was looking into which elements of roadside rubbish could be recycled.
“One of the litters I found was a piece of chewing gum and, as a designer, I was amazed there was nothing being done to recycle it,” she told the BBC.
Chewing gum is made from a synthetic rubber that does not biodegrade.
When tossed on to the pavement, it sits there until it is removed, which is a time-consuming, costly process.
Gum is the second most common type of street litter after cigarette materials. In the UK, councils spend around £50m each year cleaning up the mess.
Anna designed eye-catching bright pink, bubble-shaped bins made out of her recycled gum. She called them Gumdrops and ensured they could be installed anywhere.
The project was launched at the University of Winchester where recycled-gum coffee cups were given away to celebrate the first Gumdrops on campus.
“Students would give the cup a sniff to check it didn’t smell of mint or bubble gum,” said Liz Harris, the university’s environmental officer.
A recycling plant in Worcester takes the Gumdrops full of used gum, filters out unwanted material, grinds it into pieces and then compounds this with other recycled plastic polymers.
They were trialled at Heathrow Airport for three months, saving it £6,000 in cleaning costs.
Great Western Railway has installed the bins in 25 of its railway stations and plan to roll on the project.
One of the biggest chewing gum companies, Wrigley has backed Gumdrop commending Anna for coming up with a ‘long-term sustainable solution’ to tackling gum litter.
“I do believe that through the right design,” Anna said, “we can change the way people behave.” BBC News
