NDB partners IFC in  developing its strategic plan

NDB recently signed an agreement with IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, to partner in realigning the strategic plan for the group.
IFC is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries.
The bank at the beginning of the year looked at developing its strategic plan with a vision to become a driving force for a financially empowered Sri Lanka.
IFC will bring in best practices and leverage their experience from across different regions to help NDB during this transformation process.
The signing of the agreement was held at NDB Head Office with the patronage of senior officials from the bank and IFC.
NDB Director/CEO Dimantha Seneviratne said, “We take great pleasure in having to work closely with IFC to take this initiative forward and work with a panel of experienced advisory service providers. NDB acknowledges IFC’s support and looks forward for a fruitful partnership going forward.”
IFC Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives, Amena Arif said, “IFC has worked closely with NDB in the past and has a strong relationship going back several years. We are pleased to support NDB in achieving its strategic goals for 2020 and beyond.”
