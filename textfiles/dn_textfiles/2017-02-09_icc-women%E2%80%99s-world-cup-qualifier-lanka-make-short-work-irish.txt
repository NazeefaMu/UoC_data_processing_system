ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifier: Lanka make short work of Irish

Brilliant half-centuries from Prasadani Weerakkody (61) and Dilani Manodara (53 n.o.) coupled with excellent bowling by off-spinner Inoshi Priyadarshani (3/21) gave Sri Lanka Women their first win in the ICC Women’s World Cup qualifier tournament at the NCC grounds yesterday.
Batting first Sri Lanka racked up an impressive 239-8 and dismissed Ireland Women for a paltry 93 to record a convincing win following their defeat at the hands of India on the opening day on Tuesday.
Prasadani hit eight fours in her 81-ball knock and Dilani four fours in facing 60 balls.
Ireland were troubled by the spin cum pace combination the Lankan came up with and were all at sea with only two batters getting into double figures.
