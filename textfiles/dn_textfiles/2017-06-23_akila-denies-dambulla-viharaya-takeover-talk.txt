Akila denies Dambulla Viharaya takeover talk

Education Miniaster Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday denied allegations that the government was going to takeover the Rangiri Dambulla Rajamaha Viyaraya and instead revealed that they were taking action to curb corruption within the famed Buddhist temple.
The Chief Incumbent of the Rangiri Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya, Ven. Dr. Godagama Sri Mangala Thera addressing the media on Wednesday (21) had alleged that the Minister was trying to take over the temple and merely turn it into a tourist attraction. The Ven Thera of the temple, which is attached to the Asgiriya Chapter, accused the Minister of attacking the Sangha.
“Ven. Mangala Thera last year asked me to investigate into the malpractices and corruption which has been going on for sometime within the temple and we have found that there are serious problems in the figures . So I do not understand why he has changed his stance now?” said the Minister addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha.
He added that on an inspection of the world heritage site, they found that the antiquities were in a precarious situation and no maintenance had been done to protect and preserve it despite the large income earned by the temple.
Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova on a recent visit to the temple said Dambulla was at risk of being removed from the World Heritage list, said the minister.
Sri Lanka has six archaeological sites recognized as World Heritage sites and according to the minister, the listing not only brought honour to the country but also income in terms of tourism earnings.
“We cannot approve of the acts of certain Buddhist monks who have been running the temple. Since the early 80s and up to 1996, it was the Central Cultural Fund (CCF) which issued tickets to foreigners but in 1996, the monks pressured the government to stop that practice. But after 2009, the monks started to issue tickets priced at Rs 1500 each to foreigners”, explained Minister Kariyawasam.
He pointed out that according to the Antiquities Ordinance, the right to issue a ticket lay in the hands of the Archaeology Department.
The Dambulla Temple which comes under the Vihara Devalagam Ordinance is required to submit their yearly accounts for auditing purposes to the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs and according to that report in 2015, the temple only showed earnings amounting to Rs 38 million. The Minister thus said this number was suspicious given the fact that Sigiriya alone earned over Rs 10 million a day and at least 80 percent of foreign tourists who visit Sigiriya also visited the temple.
“Our investigations show that they would at least earn between Rs 3.5-8 million a day on average”, said the minister.
He stressed that though the temple had been collecting the money they had not spent any on its preservation and instead had built illegal structures, leading to the damage to the archaeological value of the site.
“If we get this money we can use it for the preservation of all sites. There are many sites and temples which need renovation but the Archaeology Department does not have the funds to undertake such activities”, said Minister Kariyawasam.
The Minister has also taken steps to release funds for temple renovation projects through the Divisional Secretariat instead of sending cheques directly to the chief incumbent.
“No one wants to tackle this issue as any politician who touches this sensitive issue is going to have a hard time. But I am doing this with genuine intentions. Do not use this to say that we are insulting the Sangha”, said the minister.
He further explained that there was nothing wrong with preserving archaeological sites so that the country can earn revenue through tourism.
The Archaeological Department has also identified 10 other archaeological sites which can be improved and opened up for tourism and the minister explained that the chief incumbents of those temples had no issue with their proposal.
“We believe that from 2009-2017 the temple would have earned an income running into billions, larger than the capital expenditure allocated to a Ministry for a year”, Kariyawasam said.
He said : “No matter the condition, as a government we will do what needs to be done and for that we need your support”.
