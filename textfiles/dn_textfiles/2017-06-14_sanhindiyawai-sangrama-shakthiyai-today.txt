Sanhindiyawai, Sangrama Shakthiyai today

A cultural pageant themed Sanhindiyawai, Sangrama Shakthiyai organised by the Defence Ministry jointly with the Water Supply and Urban Development Ministry will be held today at the Independence Square.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will participate as the Chief Guests. Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said the cultural event has been organised in place of ‘war victory celebration’ on May 19.
Speaking at a press conference at the Defence Ministry auditorium yesterday, he said the purpose of the event is to give out the message that all communities should work together to attain development and eradicate poverty. “Last year we organised a similar event themed ‘Sanhindiyawe Piya Satahan’. This year we had to slightly postpone the event in view of the International Vesak Day Celebrations,” he said. Water Supply and Urban Development Ministry Secretary Sarath Chandrasiri Vithana said about 600 performers would take part in the event representing tri-forces, Civil Defence Force and Police. “The event will be held from 8.30pm to 10pm. Ministers, MPs, diplomatic community, public officials, officials representing the tri-forces, Civil Defence Force and Police have been invited. There will be about 1,500 invited guests, and we extend an open invitation to the public. It will be telecast live on Rupavahini,” he said.
He said the event would showcase the contribution of tri-forces, Civil Defence Force and Police to the “Gramashakthi” project initiated on a concept of the President.
The event will be colourful with a perahera, tribute song, ‘Sathviru Wannama’ (a new wannama that depicts the human inside the soldier), Angampora item (traditional martial art), and cultural performances representing various ethnic communities and countries.
