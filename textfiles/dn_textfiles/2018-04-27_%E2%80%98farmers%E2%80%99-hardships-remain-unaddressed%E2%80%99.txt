‘Farmers’ hardships remain unaddressed’

Farmers' hardships to which priority was not given to by the previous regime, still remains unaddressed by present government as well, All Island Farmers' Federation Chairman and Provincial Councillor Namal Karunaratne said. He was addressing a media briefing at the Dambulla Yapagama Siyapatha Hotel.
He said there was no proper market for agricultural produce. As a result, farmers have to discard their yields and hence, face losses. Moreover, farmers are currently in a quandary as they had not yet received due fertiliser subsidies which were promised by the government.
It had been said that all farmers could obtain a 50-kg bag of fertiliser at a price of Rs. 500 for paddy cultivations, while for other crop cultivations, it would cost Rs. 1,500 per bag. However, farmers cannot afford subsidies at such exorbitant rates, Karunaratne said, adding that there was no fertiliser in the open market or government sector at the stipulated rates.
He said that certain traders sell 50-kg bags of fertiliser at a price of Rs. 3,750. Politicians are too consumed in power struggles that they forget the problems of the people. Meanwhile, the President is attempting to amend the Cabinet, while the United National Party proceeds to re-organise itself.
All Island Farmers' Alliance Secretary T. D. Sarath also addressed the event.
