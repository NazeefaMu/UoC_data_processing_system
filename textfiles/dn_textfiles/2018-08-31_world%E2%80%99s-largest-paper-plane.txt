World’s largest paper plane

A Massachusetts museum is hoisting a 64-foot-long paper airplane into the air to break a Guinness World Record.
The Revolving Museum in Fitchburg announced the paper plane, created under the supervision of "Project Soar" leader and local artist Jerry Beck, will be lifted by a crane Tuesday at the Fitchburg Municipal Airport.
A Guinness World Records adjudicator will be on hand to verify whether the 1,500-pound plane beats the previous record for a paper airplane, which was created by students and faculty at Germany's Braunschweig Institute of Technology in 2013.
Beck said the project has been four years in the making and involved contributions from more than 4,500 people.
"We're doing something that's never been done in the world before," Beck told the Boston Globe.
"It's a beautiful montage of artwork from all ages, from a two-year-old to a 92-year-old."
