Struggle to provide housing

A small solar panel sits on top of the hot tent, collecting sunlight, while the people sit outside, unable to bear the heat that their solar panels revel in.
Close to a year since the devastating landslides which took place in Aranayake, Kegalle, many still remain in tents; unsure of their future and yet adapting to their present circumstances.
Authorities have finally found lands to settle those displaced, but controversy around their final resettlement has risen, as people who have been displaced from possible vulnerable areas now state that they do not want to leave the camps—very few trust the government authorities when they inform the people that it is ‘safe’ to return to their new lands.
Aranayake District Secretary Z.A. M Faizel, however, assured that the issues pertaining to settlement of those displaced would be solved soon.
The displaced people living in camps for nearly a year alleged that the whole process of handing out new houses was politicised, and many vulnerable people have been ignored.
Houses for Displaced families

Around 571 families were affected in the landslide in Aranayake and many lost their houses, while others were evacuated as they lived in the high-risk areas demarcated by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO). The government, at the time, promised that houses would be provided to families which have been identified as living in high-risk areas and to the victims whose houses were damaged beyond repair.
According to Faizel, the people were provided with tents, while some were housed in partitioned school premises until the government constructed houses for them.
He added that 56 families completely lost their houses and that they have already been handed over 50 houses by last week.
“There are 571 families who lived in high-risk zones. Among them, measures have been taken to proveide land and houses for 191 of families. The people would be paid according to the work they carry out on their own houses. For that, they have to commence constructions, but many have failed to do so,” he said.
Faizel claimed that people opposed when they tried to close the camps as well.
At present, there are eight camps in; Dehiyanwala, Rahalagala, Dippitiya Muslim MahaVidyalaya, Dippitiya Arafa Senior School, Narangamana School, Pallepamunuwa School, Hathgampola grounds, Godigamuwa school, and Ussapitiya public grounds.
Chaminda Premaratne, who runs a small-scale garment factory, and Saman Kumara, a mason, were hopeful of getting new houses very soon.
“Flats are being built for us under the Chinese housing scheme. We have given our names; hopefully, we will get our houses soon,” said Premaratne.
He said, they were informed that a total of 100 houses would be built. During the first stage, 60 houses are to be built, and 40 houses would follow in the second stage.
Kumara, however, pointed out that there are 60 more families who are in need of houses.
Fear of false promises
Unlike Premaratne and Kumara, N. Samaraweera, a three-wheel driver, was disappointed by the initiatives taken by the government authorities.
“Not all the victims are receiving houses. The whole process is politicised,” he said.

According to Samaraweera, his mother, who had lost her house in the landslide, has been completely ignored by the authorities.
“When I went to talk to a government official about it, he asked me whether I have support from a politician so that the work can be done easily. This is a common slogan in all government authorities,” he said.
Meanwhile, lives that collapsed with the landslide continue to be restricted to displaced camps amidst great difficulties.
Samaraweera said, with rain water seeping into camp sites, the people living in the camps were facing many health issues.
J.P. Badmakumari lamented that the government had promised to provide them houses, but are yet to provide a definite date. She feared that it just might be another false promise given to them by the government.
“I wonder for how many days I would have to suffer in these tents with my children,” she said.
Badmavathi’s house was marked as ‘high-risk’ by the NBRO after the Samasara landslide. She said, she had a small house with a big garden, and now, all is lost. “We were immediately evacuated and sent to these camps after the landslide. Now we are stuck,” she said.
K. Ratnayake, meanwhile, said that his house was also marked as ‘high-risk,’ but the NBRO had recently asked him to return to his house, stating that it was safer to live there now.
“They had no answer to give me when I asked them what they did to mitigate the risk,” he said.
Ratnayake stressed that without knowing of the preventive measures taken by the government authorities to mark it as ‘safe,’ he would not leave the camp.
A government official who wished to remain unnamed said the people were refusing to leave the camps, claiming they feared another landslide and added that some also insisted that their houses too, have been damaged beyond repair.
He said the government had promised to provide these people with measures to protect their homes, but was reluctant to elaborate on the measures that are being taken by the authorities.
The official noted that some of the victims who witnessed the landslide fear that another landslide could occur once the rains recommence.
Faizel, meanwhile, emphasized that only those people living in the danger zone identified by the NBRO, as well as those whose houses were destroyed, would be provided with housing via government schemes.
“Villagers from areas identified as possible vulnerable areas have been requested to return to their houses as the government had promised to provide measures to ensure the safety of their homes, in addition to constructing roads to their houses,” he said.
Despite several attempts made by the Daily News to contact Chairman of NBRO R.M.S Bandara, for a comment, he was not available.
Less support from people
According to the government official, the government has been making good progress to settle the displaced. He said, the people received support from non-governmental organizations as well.
Faizel explained that people from vulnerable areas too, were staying at camps, claiming their houses were endangered and uninhabitable.
“They also request alternate land from the government, which is not an easy task. The government has already taken initiatives to provide houses for the victims whose houses were completely destroyed and who lived in high-risk zones,” he said.
The official stressed on the fact that the people should also make a move whilst the government takes all possible initiatives.
“Not everyone, but some, have their own hidden agendas. Some try to do everything possible to get a house from the government,” he said.
A retired teacher from Aranayake, W. Chandrasekara, also had the same view on the problem.
“It is not easy to find out who is being truthful and who is not. This becomes an emotional problem when you ignore their demands,” he said. Chandrasekara further said, government authorities should deal with these issues without being biased.
