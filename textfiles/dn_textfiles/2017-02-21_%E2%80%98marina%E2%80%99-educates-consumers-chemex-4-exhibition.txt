‘Marina’ educates consumers at CHEMEX 4 exhibition

Marina Foods, a manufacturer of coconut oil in Sri Lanka, outlined its processes of producing safe and hygienic coconut oil, using state-of-the-art technology in compliance with internationally accepted quality standards to the participants, including school children, at the CHEMEX 4 Exhibition and Trade Fair.
The three-day unique chemical educational event organized by the Institute of Chemistry was held at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre in Colombo recently.
Marina Foods (Pvt) Ltd is a subsidiary of NMK Group of Companies. Expressing his views, Manjula Narayana, Chairman NMK Group of Companies, said:
“Certain companies which concentrate solely on making hefty profits without reaching out to help the community at large, through corporate responsibility initiatives, are propagating a myth that coconut oil contains cholesterol. It is important to bear in mind that coconut oil manufactured in a scientific manner using modern technology, which ensures high quality, goodness and hygienic standards in no way jeopardizes the health of the consumer.”
“Marina Foods (Pvt) Ltd actively participated in the CHEMEX 4 with the core objective of further educating the people on this subject. The good health of the masses in the long-term is more important to us than short-term commercial profits.”
Members of the public and school children attending the CHEMEX 4 Exhibition were educated on the importance of having such modern technology and the pragmatic role it plays in producing edible oil absolutely safe for human consumption.
When producing coconut oil in the traditional way, active properties found in coconut oil which are beneficial to human health are destroyed. It results in the accumulation of chemicals in coconut oil, which are deleterious to human health. But in the manufacture of Marina coconut oil products, none of these reactions adverse to human health occur.
