Champion eater slurps down 480 oysters in eight minutes!

A competitive eater slurped down 480 oysters in eight minutes to win a New Orleans competition and set a new record for the event.
Darron Breedon of Orange, Va., bested six other competitors Sunday at the World Oyster Eating Championship at the Oyster Festival in New Orleans.
Breedon downed 40 dozen oysters - 480 total shellfish - in eight minutes, leaving the competition in his dust. Defending champion Michelle Lesco of Tucson, Ariz., came in second after consuming 27 dozen - 324 oysters - in the time allotted.
Organizers said Breedon's win was a new record for the event, sponsored by Acme Oyster House.
