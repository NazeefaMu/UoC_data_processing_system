Life beyond circumstances

After years of bad policy, new hope for care-After years of bad policy, new hope for care-leavers leavers:
Moses Akash entered the state’s care when he was two weeks old.
But, just after his 18th birthday, he was homeless, legally required to leave the Fridsro orphanage in Kandy where he had lived his whole life.
“That’s the law,” he said in a recent interview. “When you turn 18, even if you are there, you are not allowed to stay in the place you grew up.”
So Akash said he left Kandy for Colombo, with everything he owned in a single bag. He brought that bag with him to job interviews, hoping he would be hired and allowed to stay at his new employer’s facilities.
Making things worse, he said he was turned away from jobs and turned away from opening a bank account, because his birth certificate was not complete. The section where a father’s name should have been was left blank and Akash said this both confused people and carried with it the weight of social stigma.
But, he eventually started living at a church and got a job at a polythene factory in Kaduwela, washing equipment. The church’s pastor, Damien Dishan de Silva, took Akash into his home and gave him his last name. Now 32-years-old, Moses Akash de Silva runs his own foundation, “Voice for the Voiceless,” and is trying to change the laws that created such barriers in his own life.
“That moment, age 18, 19, was a crucial part of my life,” he said.“Luckily, for me and I would say it was God’s plan, I had very good people who would help me.”
“But, a lot of people who come out of these orphanages need advocacy,” he added.
There are more than 14,000 children in care homes in Sri Lanka, according to data from the Department of Probation and Child Care Services.
That means hundreds of young men and women, like Akash, are leaving them every year.
The exact numbers of how many people leave state care homes are unknown.
Akash is part of a coalition of organizations pushing key government ministries to relax the laws mandating that youth leave state homes at 18. They’re also pushing for the government to dedicate state money for a resource center for such care-leavers, and make significant changes to the country’s birth certificates.
“There are a lot of easy things that can be done,” he said. “But, whether the government authority is willing to do that … it’s a challenge.”
Blocked by the law
One of the groups at the helm of this movement is SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka. The international organization operates in 135 countries around the world and its children’s village just outside Colombo houses 153 children and 52 youth in its unique, family-style setting.
House mothers live in family homes with up to eight children and cook for them, help them with school, and take them out on errands. They essentially fill the parental role many of these children lost at a young age.
The organization has operated in Sri Lanka since 1981 and in that time has mainly focused on direct care, rather than advocacy.
However, their own struggles trying to continue caring for their kids after they turned 18 led them to the public sphere, Divakar Ratnadurai, the Deputy Director of SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka, said.
He recounted a story of fighting a court order so his organization could help a 21-year-old girl have housing while she went to university.
“We do it, with difficulty, because the rules are blocking us,”Ratnadurai said. “But, we want the rules to be flexible and the government to also support us, because this is also a responsibility of the state.”
“Earlier, we were not very much into this type of work,” said Kirthi Hettiarachchi, who is the Senior Project Director for SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka.
“We were doing a very neutral, you know, very silent job. Now we thought that we have to do something about this problem.”
SOS organized a “speak-out” event in July, where care-leavers, including Moses Akash, shared their stories with government officials like Women and Children’s Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara and Dr. Thusita Wijemanna, MP, who heads the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Women and Gender of the Sri Lankan Parliament.
After the event, the government leaders promised to start addressing these issues, beginning with changing the format of the country’s birth certificates.
Ratnadurai, of SOS Children’s Villages, said that without the speak-out, where people in power heard care-leavers’ stories first hand, he believes these changes would not be happening.
Potential for Reform
On Tuesday, the Parliamentary Oversight Committee on Women and Gender met, along with representatives of the Registrar General’s Department, to begin discussing the advocacy goals of the
care-leavers’ movement.
“It was fantastic, it was excellent,” said Chaturi Jayasooriya, who attended the meeting on behalf of SOS Children’s Villages. According to a transcript of the meeting, committee members agreed to look into setting up a system to provide extracts of birth certificates, which would only contain basic information about the individual. Full birth certificates would exist in a separate database.
Dr. Wijemanna said she was “very much in favour” of such an extract, because it would preserve the child’s right to privacy and dignity.
Members moved for the Oversight Committee to meet on September 19 to draft a proposal to the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General to implement these legal reforms. Committee members also discussed the need to better track the numbers of children in and leaving care every year.
They said that even though such a database exists, not all of the over 400 care facilities on the island have adequate computer capability to keep it up-to-date.
They decided to invite the nine provincial commissioners to a meeting in October to discuss what could be done on the ground to improve the situation.
Finally, they agreed to look into vacant government buildings to house a resource center for care leavers, which could serve as a networking and job center for youth leaving care.
“This is just a first step,” Dr. Wijemanna said.
Moses Akash said he is hopeful that change may be coming.
He repeated something he said he often tells young men and women leaving state care.
“Life is beyond what we see,” he said. “Life is beyond your circumstances.”
