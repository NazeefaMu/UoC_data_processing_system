A cancer drugs manufacturing factory will be set up at a cost of Rs.1.4 billion at Malegoda, Payagala, soon, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
The factory will be set up by two Indian companies which will provide 500 jobs for Sri Lankan youths. Nano technology will be used to manufacture the cancer drugs. The factory is to be built on a 15-acre plot of land. At the agreement signing ceremony, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne pointed out that one cancer drug costs around Rs. 150,000 and cancer drugs are to be manufactured locally to lower their cost.
A total of 19 drug manufacturing factories will be constructed at Welipenna zone in the Kalutara District.Minister Senaratne also stated that 40 companies have already signed agreements with the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) to produce drugs in Sri Lanka.
The production capacity of the SPMC will increase up to four billion tablets annually after construction of its new factory.
