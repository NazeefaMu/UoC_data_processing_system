Birthday bash with a dash of wild panache!

I never imagined that the mention of my birthday last Thursday, the fifth of July would evoke such a huge response. Being a rather modest scribbler I would never have contemplated that my name had become a household word among so many readers. That would have been a laugh as far as I am concerned. Because my name isn't even a household word in my own home!
So every 4th and 5th of July I raise a glass or three to the land of ‘Uncle Sam’ with a heart-felt toast of ‘Happy Birthday America!’ Essentially, it is because I like to think that the whole of the most powerful nation on earth reciprocates by celebrating my own birthday which happens to roll by around this time. That is also when I wave the American flag manufactured in China.
Yes siree, one of their favourite 4th of July traditions actually takes place after the Star-Spangled holiday is already over. That is when the dum-dums, drunks and pyromaniacs start uploading their near misses of my birth-date with a bombardment of bangs and booms.
As the night skies above them explode with spectacular showers of pyrotechnics all my relatives and friends in Yankee-Doodle-Dandy-Land will start calling and wishing me on the landmark occasion. I must concede that I am grateful for their kind wishes. I think it is really kind on their part remembering the milestone occasion.
But I must concede it is rather head-swelling when I imagine the whole of the North American continent, some 10,000 miles away celebrating their National Day, which according to the International Dateline falls on my birthday.
So far, the 5th of July has brought me to the realisation that this year happens to make me the oldest I have ever been! So what the heck, I did celebrate with a good many people who happen to be family and friends. And no one will complain about the monumental hangovers, the effects of which will not wear off for a week.
That is because I usually only drink on two occasions. Meaning when it is my birthday and when it is not. But let me tell you that the pain of ageing is not something you want to hear when you are turning 60. Ok, ok, which to be perfectly honest was actually more than a decade ago. Oh, all right I am not uncomfortable about my age but I do not want to proclaim it from the rooftops. Although that is what the dreadful little grandkids had been doing weeks before the big day.
It seems funny how birthdays can instil terror in the hearts of so many old fogeys. The word has only to be mentioned to conjure up images of those first awkward moments in babyhood and beyond. You know, the earliest educational period in your life that seemed to throw you from the cradle to crayons and clay. And when you actually think about it, it may be a terrifying prospect to imagine how soon life can take you from clay to dust.
But for me and some of my surviving cohorts, being over 60 and pushing three score and ten can certainly be considered a phenomenal achievement. A miracle, one might call it, in the case of a few of us who have lived dangerously most of our lives. Yes, a handful of my old ‘Yahoo’ buddies and I have thrived on living our dreams, even if it meant courting potentially perilous or suicidal situations.
And we still do. Peoples’ perception of our frame of mind has been altogether different from our infancy to our adolescence and adulthood. Or as some ancient malaprop once said: “I knew him from his infancy to his adultery!” The old adage still stands good, with a little amendment of course: “Boys will be boys and so will a lot of middle-aged and, ahem, older men.
But then again at my age when many people consider themselves over the hill and are thankful for not being under it, is where the trouble begins. As an older guy, I am expected to be quiet, stay in the background and stop being my old, or is it young rambunctious self? Being blessed with youthful energy and exuberance I am having some difficulty fitting into this unaccustomed role. The older I grow the more I distrust the familiar doctrine that age brings wisdom. Setting an example for your children and grand children takes all the fun out of ageing.
Having said that, I think it would also be apt to remind you of another old axiom that there is no fool like an old fool, except of course a young fool. But the young fool has first to grow up to be an old fool to realise what a darn fool he was when he was a young fool. All this leads me to the logical conclusion that with both young and old fools in existence life should be considered an ‘All Fool’s Paradise’.
No surprise then that I determine my physical age as opposed to the chronological. The more perceptive among you would have realised by now that my body when measured by the physical age yardstick makes me a much younger man. That is perhaps why I can be likened to the US and A, considering we both have a solid constitution. Still I am not a fussbudget about my age.
In addition, I am not the type to begin lusting after my lost youth when mine was spent mostly downing double drams and writing what I like. Two things I am pretty darn good at, even if I do say so myself. As you can see I am still enjoying this privileged lifestyle while retaining my youthful spirit and debonair air.
Yes, it is true that few women admit their age. But it is also correct that few men act theirs. I like birthdays but in moderation. That is because I think too many can kill you.
As for you disappointed readers out there I will let you know later about the big bash the family threw for me.
Yet I will accept belated greetings and good wishes from you reading men folk out there. As for the charming lady readers, well I’ll simply close my eyes. That way you don’t have to fuss or blush when you rush to offer me a sound buss.
Meaning it’s not late to give an old, bold and uncontrolled buckaroo a stunning smackeroo!
