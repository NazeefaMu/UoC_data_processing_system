North joins South Korea for Winter Olympics
Trump’s ‘State of the Union’ speech causes global stir

The world’s self-proclaimed ‘leader’ of democracy and global order may have, last week, sounded alarmingly belligerent to the rest of the world community and heartlessly self-centred as well. But if America is sounding more and more aggressive, in East Asia, the two Korean republics are busy, with much global support, making peace. The latest effort is the exercise in unified participation in this year’s biggest world sporting event – the 2018 Winter Olympics.
And, in West Asia, the European Union has swiftly stepped in to support the Palestinian government after Washington summarily cancelled its financial support for Palestine. Turkey, however, is still busy crushing Syrian Kurdish rebel forces in small parts of war-torn Syria where those rebel groups, with US support, helped vanquish the remnants of the Islamic State movement.
It was Russian military support to its ally, the Assad-led Baathist Party dictatorship in Syria, that was the main factor that led to the elimination of the IS in Syria territory. Russia, too, is not too unhappy at the weakening of the Syrian Kurds, because the US-supported Kurds would have contributed to American manoeuvring to carve up Syria and destroy the powerful Arab nation it once was.
Even as US President Donald Trump blared out a war-like and xenophobic ‘State of the Union’ (SOTU) speech to the joint session of the US House of Representatives and Senate last Tuesday, the US Congress was clearly polarised on partisan lines in their response to this annual presidential address, Trump’s very first. The opposition Democratic Party’s women legislators all wore black in protest against Trump’s personal, questionable, record on gender issues. And, as Republicans frequently stood to applaud their President’s statements, the Democrats remained seated with stony faces.
Of course, many commentators across political lines and across the world, praised Trump for sticking to his script and not wandering off the rails with ad lib remarks that are too often racist, sexist, or crudely abusive of whole countries, including America’s principal allies. At the same time, the script, soberly delivered by a usually volatile President, articulated a vision that was implicitly (White) racially biased and elitist in its description of American socio-economic realities, promised more socially discriminating ‘reform’ and, ignored urgent global issues such as Climate Change, and armed conflict hotspots.
Iranian leaders said his speech exposed his ‘ignorance’ of world issues. Chinese media commentators called it ‘belligerent’ and criticised what they said was America’s ‘zero-sum-game’ approach to global politics.
State of the Union speech
A possibly significant new development in the US was the Democratic Party’s choice for the traditional Opposition response to the State of the Union speech – young Democratic member of the US House of Representatives, Joe Kennedy, a grand nephew of the legendary President John Kennedy. US commentators praised Joe Kennedy’s speech delivered to a small town gathering in his home state of Massachusetts.
His pick for this role is seen by some commentators as indicating that the Democratic Party may have Kennedy also in mind for the 2020 US presidential race. His refreshing youthfulness, his socially progressive and intellectually refined approach as well as his star power as a scion of America’s most prominent ‘political family’, provides Kennedy with very useful attributes for presidential candidacy.
However, in terms of gaining political prominence and institutional experience, Kennedy has a long way more to go. Apparently, in order to gain experience, Kennedy is considering entering either a US Senate or state governorship race first. Perhaps, his pick for the SOTU response is his party’s way of boosting him. From the sound bite I heard of his speech, Kennedy certainly shows talent. His speech is available on the Web.
Readers are encouraged to read the full SOTU speech on the internet available in numerous websites. The tone and content of the American President’s speech so echoes the xenophobic belligerence – smoothly delivered – expressed by our own immediate past governmental leadership that we are reminded of what we, Sri Lankans, went through in the recent decade.
Certainly, the peoples of countries that have undergone autocracy, racism and abuse of power will more easily discern the current trajectory of American governance and political life than those affluent nations who have only known comfortable liberal democracy and lavish social welfare. We have heard and seen all this in our own country already. In fact, many of us knew what the American people were in for when we realised, in 2016, that they were electorally opting for a very un-intelligent, dirtily playboy, overtly unscrupulous, businessman as their Head of State.
Truly, Democratic presidential candidate (and former US Secretary of State) Hillary Clinton was very sharply accurate when, in a 2016 election campaign speech, she described the emerging core of Trump political mass support as ‘a basket of deplorables’. In fact, the growing list of his crude, constitutionally dangerous, interventions to undermine the intensive investigation by his own specialised counter-espionage and subversion agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), only affirms that the President himself is likely the chief of ‘deplorables’!
Of course, it was stupidly – and arrogantly – tactless of Hillary Clinton to have made that remark about ‘deplorables’ from her own election platform. It simply affirmed her intellectual aloofness from that smallish – but electorally significant – section of the US population of mostly low education and low income who form the core of Trump’s constituency.
As far as this writer is concerned, who the American people elect for governance is primarily their problem, just as it is for our voters.
Trump under investigation
What continues to be sensational news is that the head of world’s most powerful liberal democracy, famed for its superpower achievements and sheer geo-political might, is increasingly betraying behaviour of someone who is guilty of at least serious misdemeanours, if not grave crimes.
Even as he delivered his presidential address, Trump is under investigation by his own top counter-espionage and crime agency as well as three most powerful Congress oversight committees for possible treasonous conspiracy with his county’s worst rival, Russia, and may also be abusing his powers by attempting to obstruct the federal probes into this possible conspiracy.
The fact that already, even before Donald Trump was elected or even made presidential candidate, most of America’s top security agencies had concluded that Russia was covertly intervening in US internet social media and even hacking into US election systems in attempts to prevent the election of the more accomplished – and therefore more dangerous – Hillary Clinton.
Unfortunately for the world’s sole - but declining - super-power, the flurry of forceful interventions against top federal agencies as well as violations of strict political norms within the US Congress and Government itself, are not just the actions of one person, the President. Rather, his own ruling Republican Party seems to be as active in undermining, in numerous ways – public maligning being the least – both top public officials as well as their country’s vital security and justice agencies!
The Republican have their own, ultra-elitist agenda for their country: an unleashing of a more neo-liberal capitalism, an arms build-up mainly to fill the pockets of the military-industrial complex, and, a socially and ecologically inconsiderate de-regulation regime ostensibly to revitalise a sluggish economy.
This agenda is already being implemented with the ecological and social damage to be subsequently experienced by America.
How much serious damage a Republican presidency will do to the larger world depends on how much the Republican politicians can get an ignorant President to sign off on. It may also depend on how much that President remains loyal to his own country and not to any foreign entities that may have earlier trapped or compromised him either in terms of financial dealings and indebtedness or as a collaborator in political subversion.
2018 is likely to be a year of political upheaval in the United States both because of the Trump conspiracy investigation and its related attempts to obstruct justice and also because of November’s mid-term congressional elections.
