Rapid agriculture development Mangoes to lead project

The Agriculture Ministry plans to set up mango cultivation zones in Dambulla and Jaffna.
On the advice of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, initiatives have been taken to implement this project under the rapid agriculture development project ‘We plant - We eat’. The aim of this project is to plant mango trees in the selected districts in view of favourable weather and environment conditions.
Mango plantation zones will be the first project under the rapid agriculture development project ‘We plant - We eat’. The project has been funded by the World Bank-assisted Agricultural Modernisation Project and 100,000 Tom EJC mango plants will be planted in these zones.
The Tom EJC species of mangoes grow well in both dry and wet zones and there is a huge demand for these mangoes nationally and internationally. The Ministry has taken this initiative targetting the export market. As a first step, 12,500 plants will be planted in Dambulla.
