Child found dead in well

A female child was found dead in a cultivation well at Pahala Bohingamuwa, Kuliyapitiya yesterday, police said.
The deceased, Alagiyawanna Mohottalalage Lakisha Lakduli Alagiyawanna, three years and eight months old, was found in the well by her father.
The grandfather of the child – her mother’s father – had allegedly thrown the child into the well following a family brawl.
The grandfather who had been drunk on the day, has had an argument with his wife regarding the latter’s plan to go abroad. Following the heated argument, the grandfather has said that he “will teach a lesson to the whole family.”
According to the grandmother, the child was put to bed around 7.30 pm.
Then, the father of the child, A. M. Rasika Premaratne, has found his wife and her mother looking for the child, when he reached his home.
While the family was looking for the missing child, the suspect had been sleeping at the back of the house and had not responded.
The father had later found his daughter’s body in the cultivation well. Kuliyapitiya police arrested the grandfather. Police are investigating as to the reason why the clothes worn by the child were missing when her body was found in the well, Kuliyapitiya police said.
Kuliyapitiya police are investigating.
