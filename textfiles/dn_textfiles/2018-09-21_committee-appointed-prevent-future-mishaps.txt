Jumbos killed by fuel train:
Committee appointed to prevent future mishaps

On the heels of the recent death of three elephants in an accident involving a fuel train, on the Batticaloa railroad, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva has decided to take immediate action to prevent such tragedies in future.
He has taken this decision considering the constant movement of elephants across railroads, the danger caused to them, and the losses incurred by such accidents to the Railway Department.
At a special discussion held at the Ministry regarding the matter, Minister de Silva appointed a committee headed by Transport Secretary G.S. Withanage to recommend measures to overcome this problem.
The other members of the committee are Railways General Manager M.J. Dilantha Fernando, Additional Secretary (Technical) Wildlife Ministry Veterinary Surgeon Dr G.A.T. Prasad, Elephant Conservation Director R.A. Sumanasena, Wildlife Protection Society Director Dr. Hemantha Perera and Irosh Perera, a student of Kingston University.
Following the appointment of the committee, several steps to prevent elephant mishaps were also discussed.
The committee paid special attention to the erection of electronic circuits at elephant corridors along the railroads and sections of the railroad frequented by elephants.
The possibility of erecting tunnels under the rail track for elephant crossings as well as building railway flyovers at spots frequented by elephants was also discussed at length. At this discussion, Irosh Perera explained to the Minister the successful results shown by the electronic circuit pilot project implemented at Settikulam on the Mannar railroad.
He said these circuits help to alert train drivers as well as the central operations room about the presence of elephants along a particular section of the railroad. The signals emanating from the circuits also helped to drive away elephants from the area.
Minister de Silva said the elephant population was affected by the large number of elephant deaths caused by train accidents. It was their duty to prevent this crime and lend their assistance towards the conservation of wildlife. The Minister requested the committee to study this problem and recommend urgent steps towards solving it.
He said he would obtain the funds necessary for the project by submitting a Cabinet paper on the matter.
