The world's most extreme places to eat and drink

Dinner in the Sky, worldwide
Dinner in the Sky offers customers an entirely new experience: fine dining served by some of the world's top chefs, while suspended 50 metres in the air. Operating in over 45 countries, the experience combines unforgettable cuisine with views over London, Las Vegas, Saudi Arabia, Italy, Cyprus and many other incredible locations.
London in the Sky is currently running until the end of the month, on London's South Bank.
Treepod Dining - Soneva Kiri, Thailand
Up to four diners can squeeze into this bamboo pod, which is "gently hoisted" 16 feet up into an ancient forest. The fine dining experience is delivered to you by your very own personal waiter, who delivers food and beverages via a zip-wire, being careful not to spill or drop anything on the journey.
Ithaa, Maldives
The world's first undersea restaurant celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Ithaa, on the beautiful Rangali Island, sits five metres below the surface of the Indian Ocean, with 180 degree panoramic views of the surrounding coral gardens.
The menu features local produce and spices, alongside more Western influences in the six-course set dinner menu includiong such indulgent delights as caviar, truffles, foie gras and lobster. The area can also be hired for private functions such as business breakfasts, meetings and weddings.
ICEBAR LONDON
The UK's only permanent ice bar, this location is simply unforgettable. Everything inside is carved from crystal clear ice from the Torne River in Jukkasjärvi, Northern Sweden, absolutely EVERYTHING - the bar, the walls, tables and even your own personal glass. As it's a chilly -5C, you are handed a hooded thermal cape and gloves before going in.
Every year the icy architecture is taken down and transformed for a new theme.This year, the upcoming theme is ICEBAR LONDON ROCKS, featuring a "rocktastic" 6ft tall Ice Skull sculpture, a punk rock ice-studded bar and specially created cocktails: "November Rain" and "Dirty Little Secret". The spirits provided are sure to leave you feeling warm inside after this icy experience.
Fresh in the Garden, Kunfunadhoo Island, Maldives
Fresh in the Garden is the perfect name for this treetop wonderland, at an upmarket hotel. A wide variety of freshly sourced food and wine is provided, predominantly Mediterranean-inspired but with a strong Asian influence.
Surrounded by tropical banana trees, the open air view is simply spectacular
Sirocco, Bangkok, Thailand
This 63rd floor open air restaurant is the highest al fresco restaurant in the world. The award-winning head chef creates clean, uncomplicated and fresh Mediterranean cuisine, with the live jazz band creating a relaxed atmosphere as you enjoy the views
Dans le noir? London
Fancing trying to eat in complete darkness? Dans le noir? (French for In the dark) has five restaurants in London, Paris, Barcelona, Nairobi and St Petersburg, where you will be served simple, fresh food by blind waiters. The company claims: "By suppressing the dominant sense of sight, you will enter a whole new world in which one is uncertain of their surroundings."
The only question is, how do you go to the loo?
The Modern Toilet, Taiwan
This definitely might not not be to everyone's taste. The Modern Toilet restaurant is a venue where everything is bathroom-themed. From toilet-shaped seats to bath tables, you can't seem to get away from the washroom. The owners claim this venture began when one of them was "reading manga on the toilet - and the rest is history". They began solely selling ice cream, where the bowl was a mini-toilet, and the ice cream was all brown in colour (regardless of the flavour) and shaped like - well, like poo.
Since then, they have developed into a fully-fledged themed chain with branches all over Taiwan.
Alice in Magic Land, Tokyo
Fall down the rabbit hole at one Diamond Dining's six Alice in Wonderland-themed venues throughout Japan. Featuring playing card tables, hedge maze booths, heart-shaped chandeliers and waitresses clad in Alice-style dresses, you will not find anything here without at least a hint of Wionderland.
Volcano House, Hawaii
Dining on the rim of a volcano has to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The Rim at Volcano House, Hawaii sits on top of Kilauea Caldera, with spectacular views of the majestic Halema'uma'u crater.
Nearly all of the meat, seafood, fruit and vegetables used in the traditional dishes are sourced from local Hawaiian farmers and suppliers. Make sure to try the Hilo-coffee rubbed lamb.
