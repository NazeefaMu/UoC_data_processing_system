‘Ancient traders well noted Sri Lanka’s strategic location’

“Sri Lanka’s strategic location in the Indian Ocean was well noted by ancient traders who travelled from east to west and vice versa.
It formed an integral part of the original maritime silk route. Today a revival of the trading traditions is seen with the launch of the Colombo International Shopping Festival spanning the length and breadth of the country,” Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister Amaratunga said
The Festival will be held for the first time in Sri Lanka under the patronage of Minister Amaratunga from October 20-22 at the SLECC from 10 am to 10 pm each day.
The event is organised by the Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau and Sri Lanka Retailer’s Association to showcase and create the ultimate shopping experience and to promote Sri Lanka as a shopping destination for tourists. The event will be marked as an annual event in the Tourism calendar.
“It offers an ideal platform to showcase our produce ranging from spices, handicraft, jewellery, clothing and food to hi-tech electrical and electronic equipment at very competitive prices. The festival is an added attraction for tourists to visit the beautiful island and benefit from the shopping bargains on offer for global brands,” the Minister said.
Secretary to the Ministry Esala Weerakoon said this was a significant milestone in tourism development – one great window of opportunity for tourists attracted by the beauty and the serenity of our country.
‘’They will now have more to look for and to take back pleasant memories. It is equally beneficial to Sri Lankans here and abroad who can learn of the strides we are making,’’ he said.
The festival will bring a new dimension towards the shopping experience in Sri Lanka, allowing the consumers to buy renowned brands at the most cost–effective manner by catering to each need by expanding services related to travel, lodging, payment, and showcasing what Sri Lanka has to offer.
The event will promote Sri Lanka as a "shopping hub" and attracting tourists to have a shopping experience in the typical Sri Lankan style.
