Great Britain take medal total to 56

Rio de Janeiro Sunday: Richard Whitehead, Beth Firth and Jo Butterfield won gold Paralympics as Great Britain picked up 21 medals on day four of the Rio Games, taking their tally to 56.
Whitehead retained his T42 200m title in an impressive 23.39 seconds as fellow Brit Dave Henson took bronze.
Swimmer Firth dominated the S14 200m freestyle to take gold in 2:03.30 ahead of team-mate Jessica-Jane Applegate.
Club thrower Jo Butterfield (F51) then broke the world record to secure Britain’s eighth gold of the day.
The other gold medal successes came in the afternoon session, courtesy of the rowing and cycling teams.
It set the tone for a thrilling fourth evening, in which Rebecca Redfern also set a new European record in the SB13 100m breaststroke, finishing in 1:13.81 to take silver.
Thomas Hamer touched home second in the S14 200m freestyle final, while there were bronzes for Amy Marren, Josef Craig and Stephanie Millward.
Whitehead, 40, ensured he retained his title with a strong finish to keep South African Ntando Mahlangu in second place.
His teammate Henson took bronze five years after losing his legs in an IED explosion in Afghanistan while serving in the military.
“I won gold at the Invictus Games in 2014 and a week later I gave up smoking and thought I’d give Rio a bash,” he told Channel 4.
“It just shows you want you can do. People suggested I go for Tokyo but I said I would go to Rio and medal.
“Five and a half years ago I nearly died. I’ve got my wife and daughter watching at home. Words can’t express how thankful I am for their support.”
Butterfield, a former army civil servant who was paralysed after an operation on a tumour on her spinal cord, threw 22.81m to break her own world record.
She and Kylie Grimes, who finished fourth in the same event with a throw of 18.75m, previously played wheelchair rugby, with Grimes representing Britain at London 2012.
Jo Butterfield and Dave Henson both come from military backgrounds but after different careers while serving their country, they both now also have Paralympic medals in common.
Butterfield is now a wheelchair user, paralysed from the chest down, while Henson, the Invictus Games hero, has had to get to used to running on prosthetic blades.
It hasn’t been easy but with the assistance of Help for Heroes and the support of British Athletics, they have reached their goals of Rio medals - and the future looks bright for both.
Six-time Paralympic champion David Weir celebrated the birth of his son by qualifying first in his T54 400m heat, finishing in 46:66 seconds. “I was a bit gutted that I didn’t see him being born, but I had to come here and do what I do,” he told BBC Radio 5 live. There was disappointment for Sammi Kinghorn who finished sixth in the T53 400m, before being disqualified for a lane infringement. BBC
