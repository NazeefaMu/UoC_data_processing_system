PM hosts ACC delegates  at Temple Trees

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe hosted the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) delegates at his official residence at Temple Trees on Sunday, showing his support of the ACC agenda to develop cricket in Asia. Discussions that took place on this occasion included the recognition of Sri Lanka as a neutral venue for regional cricketing events and the need to nurture cricket at both school and national level in the region.
While the ACC members expressed their gratitude to Thilanga Sumathipala, president of ACC and Sri Lanka Cricket for initiating the building of its Head Office in Colombo, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe assured the ACC of the continued support of the government of Sri Lanka towards realising its goals.
