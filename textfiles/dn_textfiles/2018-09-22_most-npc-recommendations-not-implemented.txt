Most NPC recommendations not implemented

The National Police Commission (NPC) said that most of the recommendations made by it had not been implemented. The NPC said that around 50 of the recommendations made by it had been implemented by last Thursday with regard to those subjected to political victimisation.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Media Coordinator of the Police Commission said that a meeting had taken place last Thursday between the Inspector General of Police and members of the National Police Commission.
But, he denied any knowledge of what had been discussed at this meeting.
However, it was said that the two parties had come to an agreement on several matters, adding that the IGP had explained to the National Police Commission certain difficulties pertaining to the implementation of some of the recommendations.
However, when contacted, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said that so far, no decision had been taken with regard to the promotion of Kilinochchi SSP Palitha Siriwardena. Last week, Constitutional Council Chairman Karu Jayasuriya, had summoned the NPC and the IGP in a bid to resolve the issues between them, due to the IGP continuously failing to implement several recommendations made by the NPC.
The NPC had recommended the promotions of 129 officers subjected to political victimisation, removal of OIC Narammala from his post, investigations into educational qualifications of DIG Nalaka de Silva and the suspension of the OIC of the Statistics Division.
