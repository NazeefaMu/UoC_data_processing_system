S’pore - Lanka  FTA unlocks new era for both countries

The signing of the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement between Singapore and Sri Lanka has truly unlocked a new era for both countries, said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama.
Speaking at the Sri Lanka - Singapore Business Forum yesterday under the theme ‘Unlocking a New Era of Partnership’ he said that for Sri Lanka, this is a landmark agreement.
“It is the first trade agreement that Sri Lanka has forged in over 10 years. It is also the first comprehensive agreement for Sri Lanka, which means it’s the first agreement that goes beyond goods and includes services, investment, economic cooperation e-commerce and more. It signals the commitment of our government to usher in an era of openness for Sri Lanka, and become a formidable economic hub in the Indian Ocean and its part of a broader strategy of looking east to renew our trade relationships. This FTA is our first agreement with a South East Asian country and we envisage this as a first step towards closer integration with ASEAN, and potentially be part of the RCEP, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in the future.”
The Minister said that Singapore has emerged as an important partner for Sri Lanka over the years. Singaporean state institutions and private companies are involved in infrastructure development, urban design, manufacturing, tourism, and technical training. Singaporean agencies have helped with the digitization of Sri Lanka’s Inland Revenue Department, which is already demonstrating results in terms of administrative efficiency and revenue collection.
Commenting on the Sri Lanka economy the Minister said that the government has taken numerous initiatives to re-orient the economy and make Sri Lanka a respected and formidable player in the Asian region once again.
“The focus of the government is to shift the economic growth model from one that was heavily dependent on debt-fuelled public infrastructure spending, to growth driven more by private enterprises, exports, and foreign direct investment. We are also committed to improving the ease of doing business and by next year you will see the results.”
“In addition to the agreement with Singapore, we will soon finalize comprehensive FTAs with India and China. We also recently regained the GSP Plus trade concessions to the European Union and have an ongoing trade and investment framework agreement with the United States and Australia. With our excellent strategic location, we have also become attractive for Belt and Road projects from China.”
The Minister invited Singaporean firms to invest in these zones and to do business here to access the South Asian region and beyond.
