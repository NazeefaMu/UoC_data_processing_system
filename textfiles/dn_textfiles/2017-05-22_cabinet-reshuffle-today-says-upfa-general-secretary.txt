Cabinet reshuffle today, says UPFA General Secretary

There will be an unprecedented Cabinet reshuffle today, UPFA General Secretary, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said. Speaking to the media personnel at Agunukolapelassa yesterday, Amaraweera said that President Maithripala Sirisena has called for all party members to discuss about the future journey of the party and the government, including various other important and urgent matters today.
He would definitely bring the party into greater stability by getting all together. The country will be steered in a new direction from today. The President will provide a fitting reply to the people who make various allegations against the government about delaying the Cabinet reshuffle,” he said.
