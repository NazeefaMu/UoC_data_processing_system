FACE FORWARD!

When it comes to your skin, the basic routine is ‘cleanse, tine and moisturize.However the mere cost of a product may leave your wallet weeping. Luxurious ingredients often make products extremely expensive. Here are a few tried, tested and affordable tricks to enhance the healthy glow in your skin.
 Benefits of using a toner
Applying a small amount of toner to a soft cotton ball or pad and gently blotting and wiping your face with it will remove oil and give the appearance of smaller pores.
* It restores your skin's pH balance
Our skin is naturally acidic, typically with a pH balance of between five and six (on a scale from 0 to 14). But that balance can get out of whack after cleansing due to the alkaline nature of soap. When this happens, your skin needs to work overtime to return to its normal levels (and that may result in oil), but using a toner can help restore this balance quickly.
* It adds a layer of protection
Toners can help close pores and tighten cell gaps after cleansing, reducing the penetration of impurities and environmental contaminants into the skin. It can even protect and remove chlorine and minerals present in tap water.
* It acts like a moisturizer
Some toners are humectants, which means they help to bind moisture to the skin.
* It refreshes the skin
Toner can also be used in lieu of washing your skin when it's oily or dirty. It will leave your skin revitalized even when you're on the go.
A good cleanser and moisturizer
Cleansers and moisturizers are the most important skin products, particularly for softening dry skin. A skin moisturizer works by sealing moisture into the outer layer of the skin and by pulling moisture from the inner layers of skin to the outer layer.
The key ingredients that seal in moisture are petrolatum, mineral oil, lanolin, and dimethicone. Glycerin, propylene glycol, proteins, urea, and vitamins help attract water into the outer layer of the skin.
Some skin moisturizers also contain an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), which exfoliates dead skin. AHAs are a good choice if you have very dry skin.
Removing your make up before going to bed
It is very important to remove makeup before going to bed because it can cause extensive damage to your skin during the night.
The skin renews itself while you sleep, and when you leave makeup on, you are preventing that from happening. The skin ceases to breathe and fatigue signs appear soon enough.
As most makeup is made of oily substances, when it stays on for the next day, it clogs your pores and leads to the appearance of more acne and blackhead breakouts.
Makeup residue and the substances that make your make up can also cause many skin imperfections, when left for hours on end during the night.
That’s why it is important to use a makeup remover before going to bed, and then moisturizing your face to help your skin breathe right.
A quick way to clean off all your makeup residue, dirt and oil, after a long tiring day, is to use Deep Clean Makeup Remover Wipes. The wipes sweep away all pore-clogging impurities and leave your skin thoroughly cleansed.
Finding the skin moisturizer for you
It may take some trial and error, so be patient. Follow these guidelines as you shop and, if you’re not getting the results you want, try a new one the next time.
Note the first five ingredients:
Look for common active ingredients, such as lanolin, glycerin, or petrolatum. Glycerin is less likely than lanolin to cause an allergic reaction, she says. She also recommends picking a moisturizer that’s made by a reputable company.
Go for added sunscreen:
Protecting your skin from harmful sun damage is one of the best things you can do to keep your skin looking young, so buy a moisturizer with a sun protection factor of at least 30. You’ll have to do some searching, but more companies are offering face and body moisturizers with sunscreen.
Make it skin-type appropriate:
The skin on your face is thinner and more sensitive, so it’s a good idea to use a different moisturizer on your face than you do on your body, Fusco says and recommends buying one that’s labeled “non-comedogenic” because it won’t clog your pores. Of course, choose one that’s right for your skin type. If you know you have sensitive skin, it’s always a good idea to look for a moisturizer labeled hypoallergenic. If you have oily skin, go with a light, oil-free moisturizer. If you have dry skin, get something richer. And if you have combination skin, go with a lighter moisturizer for your whole face and dot drier areas with a heavier cream. Keep in mind that you may need a lighter lotion in the summer, and a cream or ointment in the winter.
Consider using a moisturizer with retinol before bed:
Retinol is vitamin A for your skin. It works by increasing the speed at which your skin cells turn over. You can find it over the counter or by prescription, but use it carefully as it may cause a skin irritation.
