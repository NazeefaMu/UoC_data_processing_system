Set to  sway!

‘Maathra’ – the creative, spell-binding performing arts event produced and performed by Lyceum International Schools will be held for the 11th consecutive year at the BMICH on October 13, 3.02 pm and 5.58 pm.
One of the most popular performing art forms that has been incorporated into Lyceum's formal education is classic Sri Lankan cultural dancing, which displays the true beauty and elegance of our Sri Lankan culture. This type of dancing has not only earned unprecedented recognition both nationally and internationally, but is one that is enjoyed by all generations, regardless of their ethnic or religious background and must be preserved for future generations to come.
This resulted in the concept of 'Maathra', which was envisioned by Lyceum Founder Mohan Lal Grero and administered by Kumari Grero in 2008, with the aim of preserving and showcasing the beauty of Sri Lanka's rich, cultural heritage by instilling a love for traditional dancing in the young minds of our students. Over the past decade, Grero's vision was realized as Lyceum students have brought to life the rituals and dances of our ancestors through highly refined, stunning performances, which are now in par with Sri Lanka's National Inter-School cultural dancing standards.
The successful evolution of 'Maathra' was also purely due to the tireless efforts of Head of Cultural Dancing Rasika Kothalawala and his experienced group of teachers and students, who intricately choreograph and create a unique display of mesmerizing traditional dances in all of their shows.
The show comprises of nearly 500 performers from Lyceum International Schools' in Nugegoda, Panadura, Wattala, Ratnapura, Gampaha and Nuwara-Eliya and Kurunagala. The dances created by Kothalawala and his team incorporate a fusion of up-country, southern, Sabaragamuwa and other dance forms related to Sri Lanka's multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-lingual national culture.
