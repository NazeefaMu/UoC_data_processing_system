Lesitha Prabath crowned 1st National Surfing Champ

Lesitha Prabath was crowned the first National Surfing Champion of Sri Lanka in Arugam Bay after two days of battling with his rivals at the inaugural National Surfing Championship Series 2018.
The 27-year-old from the Arugam Bay Surf Club had to overcome windy conditions and head high sets of waves but convinced the judges by showcasing strong skills of speed, power, flow and a solid aerial.
An aerial means the surfer flies through the air above the wave to land again and carry on the ride. This gave him the leading points above his fellow competitors, Parents Sadaruwan (2nd place) Asanka Sanjeewa (3rd place) and Nadeen Sampath (4th place).
Tim Jones, International Surfing Association advisor to the SFSL commented on the outstanding skills of the new National Champion: “Lesitha probably had the most experience of anybody when it comes to contests. He has got solid, strong skills. He is also one of the few competitors that have an air game. In the finals his understanding of being safe in his surfing when he needed to and taking chances and risks in his surfing when it demanded he did so, was excellent".
The 3-round tournament was organised by the recently formed Surfing Federation of Sri Lanka (SFSL). In January 2018, Lesitha had already applied his winning formula at the start of the popular series in Hikkaduwa. Although Lesitha only made it into the semi-finals at the second competition in kabalana in March, he pushed hard to clinch the National title at his home-break.
For Lesitha it was a special moment in his life and a historical one for the whole nation.“Of course it was my
dream to become the National Surfing Champion of Sri Lanka. I trained for it, whenever I had free time I came to Main Point".
Hiran Ukwatte, First President of the SFSL explained: “Surfing as a sport has only very recently been introduced by the International Olympic committee to the Olympic Games. It will feature in the 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. In Sri Lanka, surfing was only considered a tourism develo pment activity, enough to get the tourists to visit the country. But when this Olympic moment came it laid the grounds to have a National level tournament for the first time in history".
"The recognition and preceding Surf series also allowed the SFSL to form Sri Lanka’s first National Surfing Team. Sandika Thushara, Event Director and First National team Manager led their members to the Covelong Surf Competition in India. Lesitha Prabath’s victory scored him a place within the team.
“I was very proud to take the newly-formed National team for the first time abroad to compete. It's the most valuable aspect for me to have them as one team. The Sri Lankan National team is very special, at high levels battling against competitors mainly from India, Bangladesh, France and Australia. I was very happy that all eight athletes made it into the Semi-finals and the Sri Lankans finishing 2nd, 3rd and 4th place. My experience at the contest also gave me inspirations and new ideas for our great event in Arugam Bay,making it more eventful and successful, said Sandika Thushara".
Tim Jones of the ISA added: "Surfing has many facets and sides. We intend to focus attention on high quality coaching for visitors to the island but very importantly for local surfers.
We have been introducing ISA instructor courses for Sri Lankans which mean they can develop in their surf clubs, the vital elements of junior and women’s surfing as well".
