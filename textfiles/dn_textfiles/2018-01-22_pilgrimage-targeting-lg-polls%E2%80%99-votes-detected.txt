Pilgrimage targeting LG polls’ votes detected

Matale Assistant Elections Commissioner (AEC) has requested instructions from the Chairman of the Election Commission to investigate an alleged pilgrimage with a hidden political agenda organised in the Wilgamuwa and Laggala DS Divisions recently. Assistant Elections Commissioner Shanika Rupasinghe said Laggala police and his office had received complaints alleging that a political bigwig in the Matale district had organised the pilgrimage with an eye on elections. About 595 people in Wilgamuwa and Laggala were asked to join a one-day pilgrimage in 13 buses for free on January 19.
Candidates from a certain political party contesting the Laggala and Wilgamuwa Pradesheeya Sabha elections had planned the pilgrimage, they alleged. The Assistant Elections Commissioner said that during the initial investigations, the tour operators had said a private tour operator in Avissawella had organised the pilgrimage using part of his profits from the venture and it had no political connection whatsoever.
The Laggala Police OIC said police intervened and advised the tour operator to cancel the tour, but allegedly they were organising the pilgrimage secretly, circumventing election laws.
