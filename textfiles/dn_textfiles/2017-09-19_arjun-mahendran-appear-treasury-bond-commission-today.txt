Arjun Mahendran to appear before Treasury Bond Commission today

The former Governor of the Central Bank Arjun Mahendran is to appear before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue today in compliance with the notice of summons sent to him to give evidence before the commission.
The Treasury Bond Commission sent a notice of summons to Mahendran on September 13, requesting him to appear before the commission on September 19.
The Criminal Investigation Department officers attached to the Treasury Bond Commission recorded statements from Mahendran in March 2017.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena testified before the Commission yesterday. PTL lawyers President’s Counsel Nihal Fernando, Romali Thudawe and Neranjan Arunpragasam re-examined the witness arguing against the cross-examination carried over by the Attorney General’s Department of Palisena. PTL CEO Palisena said that PTL did not sell Treasury bonds to Employee’s Provident Fund or any other captive sources at off market rates. He also denied PTL gaining large profits by dumping long term Treasury bond into the EPF. Palisena also said there were no losses caused by the PTL to the Government when they carried out their deals.
Palisena will complete his long testimony when Kalinga Indatissa PC and Anuja Premaratne PC cross examine Palisena today. The Commission sits today at 10.00 a.m.
