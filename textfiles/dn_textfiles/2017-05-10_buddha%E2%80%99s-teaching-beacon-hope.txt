Buddha’s teaching, a beacon of hope

Minister of Tourism Development, Christian Religious Affairs and Lands John A. E. Amaratunga sending a Vesak message stressed that in a world of increasing violence where ruthless religious extremism has raised it's head, Buddha's teaching of loving kindness and compassion to all beings, good and rightful conduct based on equality forbidding the use of force, stands as a beacon of hope of righteousness.
Full text of the message:
"It gives me immense pleasure in forwarding this message on the Vesak festival, the occasion commemorating the Birth, Enlightenment and the Passing Away of Buddha. "Vesak is the most important event in the Buddhist calendar and the most colourful religious festival of the year that unites the entire country in a celebration irrespective of religious, cultural or other differences.
"In a world of increasing violence where ruthless religious extremism has raised it's head violating human dignity and establishing the contours of peaceful co-existence, Buddha's teaching of loving kindness and compassion to all beings, good and rightful conduct based on equality forbidding the use of force, stands as a beacon of hope of righteousness.
"In the context of inter faith understand and religious harmony in valuing each other, there are several points at which Buddhist and Christian traditions intersect.
Themes of contemporary interests such as non-violence, purity and mind and reciprocity are paramount in the teaching of both Buddhism and Christianity forming in common platform spreading the message of love and kindness.
"With the Vesak celebration becoming even more significant with the UN sponsored international celebration of Vesak, as the Minister of Tourism Development, Christian Religious Affairs and Lands, I wish all Buddhist brethren a Happy and Peaceful Vesak."
