SLC explains new rotation policy for support staff

 
Sri Lanka Cricket clarified yesterday their new rotation policy that has been put in place with regard to the support staff accompanying the national cricket team on tours.
“It is not that we have terminated the services of Charith Senanayake as manager of the team as some media institutions speculated but we have replaced him with Ranjith Fernando for the South African tour which is part of a new rotation policy which Sri Lanka Cricket has put in place,” said Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley de Silva.
“As you may notice it is not only the manager that we have replaced but several other members of the support staff for the South African tour. We have a couple of other names on the pipeline for the post of managers which we don’t want to reveal at this stage as we have not yet spoken to them,” he said.
De Silva stated that this new policy by Sri Lanka Cricket was to ensure that support officials don’t get too familiar with team players, which has happened in the past.
