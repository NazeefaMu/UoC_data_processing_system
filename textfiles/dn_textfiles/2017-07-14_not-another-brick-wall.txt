Not another brick in the wall...

Juliet Coombe was invited to the LEGOLAND Castle Hotel grand opening and found herself lost in a world of Merlin potions, talking frogs, knights in shining armour and real life size talking dragons.
Lowering its drawbridge for the first time this week LEGOLAND Windsor Resort in the UK has made this right regal experience from no less than around 2.1 million bricks and in the process brings to life an enchanted world of brave knights, magical wizards and mischievous court jesters. Colourful LEGO touches and models large and small feature throughout with a staggering 657 LEGO statues in the new castle hotel for guests to discover - from the astonishing lobby dominated by a giant floor to ceiling LEGO brick Merlin Wizard unleashing LEGO magic from his staff in the form of twinkly stars - to the tiny adorable 7cm high LEGO dragonfly models that seem life like and other creatures that talk.
With separate sleeping areas for adults and up to three children, the 61 magical Wizard and Knight bedrooms are brimming with LEGO surprises too. From the bright LEGO wall graphics to the magical LEGO models, children (and adults alike just loved it all) and will delight as we did in solving the special clues hidden in the carpet and walls to unlock the LEGO surprises that wait in the safe. Bunting, flags, LEGO shields and an illuminated stained glass window bring the majestic Knight themed rooms to life with illuminated lights behind, whilst the spellbinding Wizard rooms are bursting with LEGO magic from potion bottles, spell books and mystical LEGO creatures. In the bathrooms you have your own LEGOLAND hair wash and knightly creams and potions.
Knights and Wizards
The LEGOLAND Castle Hotel is now officially part of the park and the sculptures that have been created used a staggering 80 million pieces of LEGO.
Guests are greeted in the entrance lobby by a spectacular, floor to ceiling, 35,000 LEGO brick wizard unleashing magic from his staff, which comes to life in colour, light and sound at the press of button. Each model is individually made by hand and takes weeks to create and lots of smaller statues can be found in every one of the 61 themed bedrooms features a range of them – from owls and swords to dragons and frogs.
Each Knight room is home to a 17kg LEGO dragon, which took 60 hours to build. Each Wizard room is home to a family of three owls, which took 90 hours to build. The rooms have been created around two themes – Knights and Wizards.
Every room contains a safe and children are invited to crack the code by solving hidden clues; then break it open for their exclusive hidden LEGO surprises, which my Sri Lankan children were rather good at. Each bedroom has a separate sleeping area with uber cool bunk beds for children packed full of fun stuff to keep them amused – including, of course, lots of LEGO to fuel their imaginations and if they create something really amazing they might even one of the LEGO competitions that result in all sorts of exciting LEGO give aways.
For all of us the green LEGO dragon in the Tournament Tavern restaurant was beyond amazing as the home to an 80,500 LEGO brick snoozing dragon guarding her LEGO eggs in the glowing hearth below. Lit by flickering LEGO torches, you will spot the 8 LEGO mice playing the chandeliers and find between courses of delicious food the dragon noises will make even the naughtiest child quiet as one hardly expects ones LEGO to talk back.
Absolutely stunning
Nothing has been stinted on the amazing range of food or the 900 LED’s light up the stained glass window in the Tournament Tavern restaurant. Guests can have fun in The Jester’s Play Den complete mischievous Jester in the King’s Treasure Chest made up of over 70,000 LEGO bricks and weighing 100kg. The biggest individual model is a 162,000 LEGO brick knight on horseback standing at 8.5ft tall, designed by 11-year-old competition winner, James Waine from Darlington, UK. The model was officially unveiled on July 1 in front of all the media and Breakfast time TV and us. An exciting day to be in the park as we were able to try and pull the sword out of the castle grounds, and even have a go at opening the castle gate with a giant yellow bricked key that even the big friendly giant might have found tricky to use.
Amzar and Samad loved all the roller coaster rides, pirate ships, laser battles in the Egyptian part of the park and yet it was the smallest individual model, a tiny 7cm high dragonfly and magic frog that they talked about for days afterwards. The book 50 Shades of Grey has nothing on several million pieces of LEGO grey bricks, which makes up the brand new castle LEGO hotel and resort and must be on everyone’s travel list when going to the UK this Summer. Just make sure between all the fun rides, water experiences and world in miniature bricks you need to take time out as you arrive or leave the park to admire the views from the top of the hill of the Queens residence Windsor Castle and London with all its iconic buildings. The views are absolutely stunning.
Both my sons amused me in the LEGO shop as they tried to work out how many boxes of LEGO they would need to buy to build their own dream home back in Sri Lanka. The idea of a LEGO villa complete with a LEGO pool on the Sri Lankan South coast with elephants amused me, as it would be quite a thing to recreate all the islands exotic birds from endless boxes full of tiny little bricks. Who knows though with all their energy and enthusiasm they might even inspire LEGO to do it for them, as it would take us a lifetime of trips to the UK taking boxes back to do it.
But what better place to have LEGOLAND than an exotic location with great weather all the year round with plenty of wild animals to get inspiration from, and be truly fun to make out of LEGO bricks. Unlike grey old England Amzar my son said it will need be in every shade of the rainbow as nothing in Sri Lanka is dull grey like England’s regal castles, which are I explained the perfect camouflage for a country that has made grey a selling point.
