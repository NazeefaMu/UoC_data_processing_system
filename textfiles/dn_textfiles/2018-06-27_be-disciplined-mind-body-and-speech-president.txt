Poson Day messages
Be disciplined in mind, body and speech: President

Within a setting where most milestones of human civilization were noted with the power of weapons, the festival of Poson, which signifies the glorious message of loving-kindness, brings back the memory of an arrival of a virtuous nation, stated President Maithripala Sirisena, in his message marking Poson Poya Day.
The message added: “It is not only the heredity of a new religion that we obtained with the arrival of Arahat Mahinda on a full moon Poya Day such as today in the year 236 B.C., but also a nation nourished by Buddhist cultural values was created based on that significant incident.
“Within that, we inherited the rich traditional values of education, literature, architecture, agriculture and most importantly, ethics of life.
“It was also the light of Buddhism introduced to us by Arahat Mahinda that moved us towards a lifestyle and a tradition that is endowed with a co-existing policy to provide protection for the environment not only for the humankind but also for fauna and flora, rivers and torrents.
“It is with the aid of Buddhist consciousness treasured in our hearts that we generated the greatest strength to rise from major challenges as a nation that we faced later without suffering major setbacks.
“Thus, as a nation listening to Buddhist preaching under a shade of a mango tree on a Poya day such as today, we must determine to be disciplined within mind, body and speech to dedicate ourselves to bring virtue to the whole environment, giving priority to humankind.
“I wish you all a virtuous day of Poson!”
