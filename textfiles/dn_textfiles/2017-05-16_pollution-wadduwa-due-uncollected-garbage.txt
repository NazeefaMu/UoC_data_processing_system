Pollution in Wadduwa due to uncollected garbage

The Wadduwa garbage collecting centre which is situated in close proximity to the Wadduwa Railway Station is polluting the whole area as garbage collected by the sanitary workers of the Panadura Pradeshiya Sabha is kept for days at this spot.
The public face difficulty as stray dogs, cats and cranes scatter the garbage in search of their food.
