FUTURE OF TOURISM SUMMIT on September 26

The Future of Tourism Summit is set to take place on September 26 under the theme Innovation, Technology and Authenticity. This year’s summit will feature a host of thought leaders in the international travel and tourism sphere. Sebastian Rassmann and Rene Massatti will be in Colombo sharing their insights at the Summit that will be held at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
Rassman and Massati will discuss how researching trends have become an absolute game-changer assisting marketers to identify latest innovations around the world. While observing micro-trends can be a painstaking task, Nils Müller and his team of researchers setup TRENDONE GmbH in 2003.
This year’s conference will have a special feature, Future Space, an interactive installation available at the summit offering the attendees the opportunity to physically try out modern, innovative and cutting edge technology with pre-built systems which can be directly implemented to existing systems.
“We are convinced that small changes foreshadow big ones. We have deployed around 80 trend scouts in 22 language regions. They alert us with new trend signals everyday. The most promising trends are then filtered out and the marketable innovation which matches the specific trend is then launched in the region. Trendsetting influences are necessary in order to be able to develop ground-breaking product ideas and new business models. Reliable knowledge of upcoming technologies gives the innovation a competitive advantage. If you already know today what is going to be important tomorrow, you will have a valuable advantage for your innovation process,” explained Nils Muller in a press release.
