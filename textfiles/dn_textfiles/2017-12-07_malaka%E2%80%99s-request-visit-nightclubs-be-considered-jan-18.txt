Malaka’s request to visit nightclubs to be considered on Jan. 18

The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court yesterday re-fixed for January 18 to decide whether Court can relax bail conditions imposed against Malaka Silva, enabling him to enter nightclubs.
Seven suspects including Malaka Silva are facing a magisterial inquiry over an alleged assault on a British couple at a nightclub in 2014.
Malaka Silva, the son of former Minister Mervyn Silva, had earlier requested the Court, to grant him permission to visit nightclubs.
Malaka Silva’s request is to be considered on the next hearing date since the permanent Magistrate was not present in Court.
On a previous occasion, the Court had issued an order preventing Malaka Silva from entering nightclubs as a bail condition. Seven suspects including Malaka Silva had been arrested over an alleged assault on a British couple at a nightclub in Duplication Road, Colombo 3.
They are currently out on bail. At the same time, Malaka Silva had also made a counter complaint that he was also assaulted by the British national following a brawl at the night club.
