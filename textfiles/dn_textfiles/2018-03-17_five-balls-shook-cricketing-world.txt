Five balls that shook the cricketing world

Sean Abbott once again came into spotlight, not because of his wickets, certainly not because of his batting but because of a bouncer which struck the batsman right on the helmet.
This time Australian cricketer Will Pucovski was at the receiving end.
The incident happened in a Sheffield shield match between Victoria and New South Wales at Melbourne's Junction Oval. The incident happened in the 19th over of Victoria's second innings when Pucovski got hit on his helmet while trying to duck Abbott's bouncer. Abbott rushed to the aid of Pucovski who was treated for a concussion and withdrawn from the remainder of the match.
This is not a first time when something like this has ever happened. Instances like this have been occurring on and off the field since the birth of cricket. Earlier, such occurrences were common as protective equipment were uncustomary.
There have been several instances in the past where the outcomes have been more tragic.
Here's the list of 5 such incidents in the history of cricket.
