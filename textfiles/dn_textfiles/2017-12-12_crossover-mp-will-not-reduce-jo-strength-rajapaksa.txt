Crossover of MP will not reduce JO strength: Rajapaksa

The crossover of a woman parliamentarian supporting the Joint Opposition into government ranks will not diminish the strength of the Joint Opposition. She defected from the Joint Opposition due to a controversy over the allocation of seats with other Parliamentarians, Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was speaking to the media after he called on Most Ven. Napane Pemasiri Mahanayaka Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya and receiving his blessings yesterday. Rajapaksa said every Parliamentarian in the Joint Opposition has been given the right and freedom to change sides as he or she wished as done when he was in power. He said all rogues of his time were now on the government side. Rajapaksa said he had no political deals with Ranil Wickremesinghe whatsoever as alleged in certain quarters. The cost of living was spiraling daily. This was a clear indication of the incapacity of the government to ensure proper governance.
Joining the SLFP was no problem for him. But since the SLFP is a shareholder of the government, there was no possibility of joining the SLFP as long as it remained in the government with the UNP.
