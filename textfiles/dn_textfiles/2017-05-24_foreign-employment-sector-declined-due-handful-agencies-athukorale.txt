Foreign employment sector declined due to handful of agencies: Athukorale

The Foreign Employment sector has declined due to the misdeeds of a handful of Foreign Employment Agencies, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
Addressing an awareness program attended by approved foreign employment agents at the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, Athukorale said the SLBFE was now geared to provide instant solutions to any problem encountered by the sector. If there were any shortcomings on its part, she was ready to intervene and remedy them.
“Availability of jobs in this sector depended on the support and co-operation received from you and sending of workers to legally obtained job vacancies.”
Although workers are now sent to Israel too, most of them escaped from that country. A special team would arrive from Israel shortly to discuss special action which should be taken to tackle this problem.
Each worker was able to bring home Rs 1 to Rs 1.2 million after a 5 month stint there. Nearly 370 workers had been sent up to the beginning of last October.
Nearly 1,000 to 2,000 vacancies have been received for this year. This opportunity may be lost due to this problem, the Minister said.
