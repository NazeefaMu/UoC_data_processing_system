Public awareness on civil aviation sector dull - DG

Although there is a general awareness on most sectors among the public, there is a hardly any awareness on the civil aviation sector, Civil Aviation Authority Director General H. M. C. Nimalasiri said.
He said there should be more public awareness on the civil aviation sector for it to be popular among the public.
Prizes to the winners of the art competition organised by the Civil Aviation Authority celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Civil Aviation Authority were distributed at a ceremony.
The Authority has recorded a net profit of Rs. 900 million annually of which Rs.400 million is expenditure and the balance Rs.600 million deposited with the Treasury.
The Authority has sent Rs.3100 million to the Treasury since inception. The Authority had played an active role for the development of the sector. Plans are drawn to take over properties vested with the Authority in the future. Accordingly, taking over of the Batticaloa domestic airport is significant. We will take over all other domestic airports in the future as well,” he added.
