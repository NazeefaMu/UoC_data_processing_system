May Day messages

Salute workers for relentless struggle: President
Marking the May Day today, President Maithripala Sirisena said he takes this opportunity to salute the working force of the country for its relentless struggle to intelligently and collectively work towards the economic progress of the country, while leaving aside communal or religious differences and work for the betterment of all the people.
Issuing the May Day message, the President said, “I extend my warm good wishes to their rightful struggle.
Full text of the message:
“I send this message of greetings on the International May Day, which symbolizes the fact that the great force of united people clamouring for freedom could break the strongest iron shackles as witnessed on the day of historical Chicago March of the working forces. I salute all those who sacrificed lives and shed blood over the years for the freedom and rights of the people and the workers of the world on this occasion.
Human civilization evolved with the courage of the people who did not surrender before challenges. Wonderful inventions of the human civilization, which were held by a privileged few became available to the entire mankind thanks to the courageous persons who relentlessly fought for the rights of the masses.
The May Day reminds us the true fact that the wide space we enjoy in our lives today is due to the sacrifices of blood and sweat by those great people.
Furthermore, this May Day is also an occasion to remember the lessons we learned in the history of the three-decade-long communal conflict, which was followed by a period of autocracy and the efforts made over the past three years to take the nation forward as a free, strong and democratic country.
Sri Lanka works in accordance with the agreements, treaties and regulations adopted by the International Labour Organization and other related institutions. In line with those, we have taken steps to provide houses to estate workers, impose minimum wages for private sector workers, include domestic workers under labour laws and remove disparities in maternity leave rights to provide the respect and dignity to the labour force.
I take this opportunity to salute the working force of the country for its relentless struggle to intelligently and collectively work towards the economic progress of the country, while leaving aside communal or religious differences and work for the betterment of all the people and I extend my warm good wishes to their rightful struggle.”
 
Commit to rewrite history: PM
Marking the May Day today, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe called on all workers to be radical in the accomplishment of their responsibilities and commitments in order to rewrite a history for the Workers’ Day.
The full text of the message:
“Human labour is widely recognised and valued with the communication and technological advancement in the present world. Workers are not merely the labourers or farmers like in the 80’s but a whole set of people in different ranks of professions and in different strata of life. Concerns and conversations on individual rights and discharging particular responsibilities to the nation in return are equally important. Not surprisingly workers’ riots in world’s history have been able to meet many of the demands of the workers. The sacrifices of so many people who fought for the rights and dignities we enjoy today cannot be forgotten.
Yet today we have the challenge of finding other means for our gains. We can end up our fighting for a win-win solution. The workers today have to be radical in the accomplishment of their responsibilities and commitments in order to rewrite a history for the workers’ day.
I take pleasure in hailing the whole working community on this day and I wish the fulfilment of their own rights while bestowing valour and vigour on them in accelerating the course of the country’s development.”
