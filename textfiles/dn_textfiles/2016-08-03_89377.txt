SLFP reaches breaking point: Anura Yapa

Disaster Management Minister and SLFP Central Committee member Anura Priyadharshana Yapa yesterday said that the party had reached a breaking point after the the Joint Opposition’s Paada Yatra to Colombo.
“I admit that we have a problem of ideology within the party. We have to resolve it through discussion. We need to practise patience,” Minister Yapa said. The minister was addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department.
The Paada Yatra which had the participation of several SLFP MPs earned the ire of senior members of the party, but Minister Yapa added that the SLFP Central Committee is yet to meet and decide on any disciplinary action that would be meted out to its errant members.
Answering to allegations that several participants of the Paada Yatra hooted at the SLFP headquarters while passing it, Minister Yapa said: “We have never had members who hoot at the party headquarters. They are not members of our party,”he said.
The minister said the Joint Opposition protest could not topple the government. They were determined to continue with the unity government until the next election. Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said:
“The UNP did not feel the protest at all. The former President called the Prime Minister and asked for a place to hold their meeting.
The Prime Minister and the President were generous enough to give them Campbell Park, but they opted for Lipton Circus as their 2,000-3,000 people could fill that space.”
“We have seen university students’ protests which could muster more people than the Paada Yatra,” he said.
