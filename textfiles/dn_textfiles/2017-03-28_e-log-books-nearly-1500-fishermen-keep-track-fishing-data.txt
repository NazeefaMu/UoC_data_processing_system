E-Log books for nearly 1,500 fishermen to keep track of fishing data

E-Log books (electronic tablets) costing Rs. 149 million would be provided to 1,490 fishermen within the next three months to keep track of the data related to fishing in international waters, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The failure to keep track of data in relation to fishing was the main drawback which caused the European Union (EU) to ban Sri Lankan fish exports, the minister said.
He said the government agreed to 52 conditions of the EU, including facilitating local fishermen to ease the procedure of data collection related to fishing by providing an electronic tablet.
Amaraweera said, “These tablets will be designed to withstand rough handling. The waterproof tablets will also enable the fishermen to use it underwater where it enables the fishing community to update data relation to fishing.”
The minister also instructed to install a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) to the E-Log book with the aim of minimising illegal activities in international waters.
