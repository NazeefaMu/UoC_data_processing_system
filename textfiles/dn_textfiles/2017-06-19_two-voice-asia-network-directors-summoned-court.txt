Two Voice of Asia Network directors summoned to court

The Colombo Fort Magistrate's Court has issued summons on two directors attached to the Voice of Asia Network to appear in court on June 30.
This is for allegedly cheating a Singaporean national for US$100,000 after dishonestly inducing to deliver a television broadcast transmitter.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order pursuant to a private plaint filed by Jaswinder Singh Bajaj, a Singaporean national engaging in business activities in Sri Lanka.
Accordingly, two accused Roshantha Kariyapperuma and Ajaz Shafeek, the directors of Voice of Asia Network were noticed to appear in courts on June 30.
In his petition, the complainant, a director of Alliance Media Private Ltd informed court that his company had entered into an agreement with Voice of Asia Network to manage the broadcasting affairs of Vettry and Varnam TV channel. Bajaj said he had been informed by the Voice of Asia Network that it is required to install a broadcast transmitter with 5KW output in the Gammaduwa transmission tower to expand broadcast range of Varnam TV in the Eastern Province.
Bajaj said following a request of Voice of Asia Network, he had remitted US$100,000 to a foreign bank account belonging to accused to install a broadcast transmitter with 5KW output to upgrade the broadcast system.
The complainant said it was revealed through sources relating to Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka that the accused party had installed a broadcast transmitter with 1KW output instead of 5KW, after breaching the agreement entered into between Voice of Asia Network and Alliance Media Private Ltd. The Magistrate maintained that documents submitted before court proved that the complainant had made payments to the accused for this purpose and they have induced the complainant to install a broadcast transmitter.
"If is clear that the alleged offence can be considered as a civil offence since both parties had entered into an agreement, it must be emphasized that there is a criminal liability as well", the Magistrate observed.
The Magistrate said there is sufficient material to prove that the accused have committed several offences under the Penal Code for cheating and thereby decided to issue summons on them.
Accordingly, the Magistrate issued summons on two accused to appear in Courts in terms of section 139(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
President's Counsel Rienzie Arsekularatne with counsel Udara Muhamdiramge under instructions of Premium Legal Consultants appeared for Bajaj.
