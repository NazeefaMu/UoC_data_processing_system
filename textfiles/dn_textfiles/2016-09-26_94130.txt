Sri Lanka to host inaugural U19 Asia Cup

At a meeting of the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket, held at SLC last evening, the following, amongst other, important matters were ratified by the Executive Committee.
I. Inaugural Under 19 Asia Cup to be played in Sri Lanka 8–22 December 2016: Sri Lanka has been granted the honour of hosting the inaugural Under 19 Asia Cup, and will do so from the 8-22 December 2016. Whilst the tournament itinerary and other details will be finalized in due course, the Executive Committee approved in principle the proposal to play 3 games at MRICS – Hambantota, GICS – Galle and at the Matara Uyanwatte Stadium giving the opportunity to the cricket loving public and most especially the youth of the outstation areas to witness an International Youth tournament.
The Executive Committee further ratified the appointment of ACC General Manager Thusith Perera as the Event Director and ACC Events Manager Sultan Rana will be the Event Manager to take the event forward.
II. SLC to engage in Cricket Development activities with Cricket Tasmania: Following cordial discussions held between the Premier of Tasmania and other dignitaries with the president SLC, Thilanga Sumathipala and other officials of SLC, it was decided for SLC to explore the possibilities of entering into an exchange programme for youth cricketers of the two nations. The Executive Committee was of the view that an exchange programme of this nature would be beneficial to our youth who would gain not only cricketing experience but also valuable cultural exposure.
III. SLC to contract 100 players to the National Pool: The Executive Committee has decided to contract a National Pool of 100 players for Sri Lanka Cricket. Accordingly, 30 National and A team players - central contracts, 20 Youth Players - Emerging category, 25 state players - Senior Veterans, and 25 Provincial players to uplift the club cricket standards, will be contracted. Discussions between the players of all categories and the officials of SLC led by President Sumathipala took place on the 10 September at SLC headquarters, and the contracts are due to be signed next week.
IV. Appointment of National Team Trainer: Sri Lanka Cricket is to recruit Nick Lee as the National Team Trainer with effect from October 2016. Nick Lee is a prolific run-scorer who was a key member of the Suffolk Minor Counties squad hitting over 1,500 runs. In all cricket since 2007, including First Class, Second Eleven, Minor County and Premier League, Lee has scored well over 10,000 runs – a tally including 23 hundreds. He is now forging a career as a Strength and Conditioning Coach and currently works for Sussex CCC.
V. Avishka Gunawardene re-appointed Head Coach for the forthcoming West Indies A tour of Sri Lanka: The Executive Committee ratified the appointment of Avishka Gunawardene as Head Coach of the Sri Lanka A team for the forthcoming West Indies A tour of Sri Lanka due to commence in the first week of October.
