Special Police Unit to deal with religion based violence

A special Police Unit with full powers will be established to deal with organised groups bent on religion based violence.
This follows a special directive issued by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development.
Several officers who have shown exceptional talent and efficiency will be posted to this unit which will dispatch Police investigation teams where ever attacks on religions places are reported and provide specialist advice towards investigations made into them.
Meanwhile the IGP has been directed OICs of all police stations to ensure that incidents damaging communal and religions amity do not occur in their respective police areas.
An intelligence report on plans by organised communal and religious groups to attack religious events by using communalism as a tool is due to be handed over to the President and the Prime Minister next week.
