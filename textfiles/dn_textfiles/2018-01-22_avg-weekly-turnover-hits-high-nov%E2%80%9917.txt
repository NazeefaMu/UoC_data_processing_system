Point of view
Markets skirted around 6400-levels this week as profit-taking and a sell off by foreigners on Thursday & Friday drove the Index lower.
The benchmark ASPI fell ~30 points over the week amid the profit-taking that has dominated markets since last week, and pushing the YTD gain on the Index down to 1.2% cf. the 2.3% gain recorded in the 1st week of trading in 2018.
Markets lost ~64 points during trading in the 1st half of the holiday shortened week, but recovered ~33 points on Friday to help the ASPI Index consolidate 43 points above the 6400-mark.
Weekly average market turnover levels however, improved 31% over the week to hit a YTD high of Rs.1.09Bn, the highest since early Nov’17 when weekly average turnover rose to Rs.1.42Bn. Market activity was aided largely by strong HNI and Institutional participation, which accounted for ~61% of total market turnover for the 3rd consecutive week. Institutional and HNI interest in equities was driven primarily by Banks, -particularly HNB (48% of total crossings), COMB (23% of total crossings) and SAMP (15% of total crossings) -which accounted for a total of 87% of total crossings for the week.
Foreign investors meanwhile, turned net sellers for the 1st time since the start of 2018, pushing the net foreign buying on the Colombo Bourse down to Rs.344Mn, down a marginal 4% from last week’s net buying of Rs.359Mn.
Net foreign sales of Rs. 342 on Thursday and Friday, trimmed down the net foreign purchases of Rs. 685Mn at the start of the week. Foreign investors have consistently remained net purchasers since the start of 2018, and the net selling on Thursday and Friday was largely prompted by profit taking as the Index made strong gains (2.3%) in the 1st week of trading in 2018. Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain largely unchanged from the current levels.
World Bank estimates GDP of 5.1% in 2018E
In its flagship publication Global Economic Prospects, the World Bank highlighted that global growth is likely to increase to 3.1% in 2018 after a stronger-than-expected 2017, as the recovery in investment, manufacturing, and trade continues.
The Group noted that the broad-based cyclical global recovery has been aided by a rebound in investment and trade, against the backdrop of benign financing conditions, broadly accommodative policies, improved confidence, and the easing impact of the previous commodity price collapse.
Global growth is expected to be sustained over the next couple of years and even accelerate to a degree in Emerging and Developing economies due to the rebound in commodity exporters.
The WB noted that 2017 GDP growth in Sri Lanka (est: 4.1%), is estimated to have grown lower than its June forecast due to disruptions from droughts and floods.The Group added that despite monetary policy tightening to ease inflationary pressures in H1’17, credit growth remained strong, supporting private consumption and investment.
The WB estimates growth over 2018-20 to average 5.1% p.a, reflecting strong private consumption and investment growth, with exports being supported by the reinstatement of the GSP+ to the EU. The Group added that Sri Lanka’s potential growth is estimated between 6-8%, and that the country’s economic reform agenda supported by World Bank and IMF programs, is expected to sustain macroeconomic stability and support potential growth over the medium term.
Public debt meanwhile is expected to decline amid ongoing fiscal consolidation, which should create fiscal space and enable the country to allocate public spending toward human capital investments that support potential growth.
