GMOA appreciates Health Minister

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) thanked Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne for responding positively to the demands presented to him during the recent meeting, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said another progress review meeting will be held with Minister Senaratne within the next few days.
Health officials should speed up the process in order to fulfill the agreements made during the meeting held with the Health Minister but they are very slow and take time to work, he said. Learning a lesson from the past, at least now, health officials should understand that simple issues should be solved quickly without these leading to island wide strikes, he added.
