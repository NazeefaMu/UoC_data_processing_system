Seventy students of the Sri Pada College of Education, Patana, Hatton, were admitted to the Kotagala Hospital on October 23 with a case of food poisoning. They had felt faint and developed stomachaches and diarrhoea in the early hours of yesterday after a meal of rice and chicken curry, the previous night.
Kotagala Hospital DMO Dr. Savithri Sharma said the student group hospitalised included 58 females and 12 males. Kotagala MOH Dr. M. Ganesh said several other students who had developed similar symptoms were awaiting hospitalisation.
