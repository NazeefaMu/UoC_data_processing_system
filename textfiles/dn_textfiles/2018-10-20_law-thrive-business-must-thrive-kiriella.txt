For law to thrive, Business must thrive - Kiriella

Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella spoke about the interdependence of law and business during the launch of “Law and Management Journal, vol. II,” at the Galadari Hotel on Thursday.
“We have enough laws in the country,” Kiriella said, but “most of the lawyers who pass out of law today do not have much work.” He suggested that the evolution of business and law coincide, “Our business environment has been virtually static, and as a result, the legal systems haven’t developed as much as we expected,” he said.
“To break away from the beaten track, business must thrive,” Kiriella said, “if there is hope in that field, then only law will thrive.”
Kiriella said that at the time of independence Sri Lanka had been an economy comparable to Japan’s, but has since fallen “miles” behind the economies of Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia.
He attributed much of this economic lag to the inefficiency of State institutions. “Now in Sri Lanka today the biggest problem is the State spends nearly 450 billion rupees to subsidise state institutions.” Kiriella said. He said the ability of those institutions to be self-sufficient, supporting their own expenditure, “that’s a starting point.”
The “Law and Management Journal” is published by the Institute of Legal and Management Studies (ILMS). Speakers at the event noted of the paucity of law and business academic resources, and the importance of this journal. “We have very little legal literature in Sri Lanka,” Chairman of ILMS, Sunil Abeyaratne said, “and when it comes to legal management literature, we basically only have these two magazines.”
The launch was attended by Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, and present and former members of Parliament.
