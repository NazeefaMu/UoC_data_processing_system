SLT first telco to test Pre-5G LTE Advanced Pro Technology in region

Sri Lanka Telecom, together with Huawei Technologies, has successfully carried out South Asia’s first comprehensive field trial of Pre-5G LTE Advanced Pro technology, laying the groundwork for the next generation of broadband technologies.
SLT has continued to develop its modern infrastructure, complementing its access technology portfolio with FTTH (fibre-to-the-home) and fixed TD-LTE (time-division long-term evolution) on the one hand, while implementing state-of-the-art service platforms such as Akaza Cloud, IPTV (Internet protocol television) and OTT (over-the-top content).
SLT’s Group Chief Executive Officer, Dileepa Wijesundera, said, “We anticipate momentous changes in our business with results that promise to be far-reaching and exponential.
SLT being a challenging player in the arena and a resilient and multifaceted company equipped for the future, together with our reading of the industry, will use such technological advancements to further penetrate and leverage all segments of the society.”
SLT has already boosted the capacity of the Ultra High Speed National Backbone Network (NBN) with 100G technology, aiming to cater the future needs of all ICT operators in the country.
The company is fully supportive of the regulator to implement Quality of Service (QoS) based cost structures and infrastructure sharing for better utilisation.
The SLT Group’s overlaid broadband strategy comprises fixed-wired broadband, fixed-wireless broadband, wi-fi and mobile broadband provided by SLT’s fully owned subsidiary, Mobitel.
