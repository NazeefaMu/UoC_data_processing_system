He said the implementation of RAMIS has now been 95% complete and they had invested over Rs 5 billion in the project.
Guruge said in a bid to broaden their tax base using RAMIS they would interface 35 institutions in the country and a unique number will be provided to every person and entity in the future which would be linked to the Inland Revenue Department.
