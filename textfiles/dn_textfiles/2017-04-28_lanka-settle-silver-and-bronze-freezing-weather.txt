Lanka settle for Silver and Bronze in freezing weather

Asian Grand Prix 2017 second leg:
Sri Lanka had to content with silver and a bronze medal as the second leg of the Asian Grand Prix 2017 concluded in Jiaxing Sports Complex, East China yesterday.
Himasha Eshan who won the 100m silver at the first leg with a timing of 10.43 seconds took 10.47 seconds to win the silver yesterday in the second leg. Me Hong of China (10.40 secs) and Indonesia’s Boby Yaspi (10.50 secs) won the gold and bronze medals respectively.
Nimali Liyanarachchi won the 800m bronze medal with a timing of 2:07.51 minutes while Wang Chen of China (2:05.86 minutes) and India’s Tintu Luka (2:06.32 minutes) clinched the gold and silver medals respectively. Nimali recorded a better timing of 2:08.47 minutes at the first leg to finish fifth. The first leg bronze medalist Gayanthika Abeyratne (2:03.78 minutes) did not perform well and secured only fifth place, clocking 2:10.42 minutes.
Except for the Chinese athletes many others were affected by the freezing climate, especially the Sri Lankans as the temperature slumped to 11 degrees Celsius.
Himasha was glad that he could remain around the 10 second margin. “I had to travel to China soon after returning to Sri Lanka from Jamaica, where I underwent training and was very tired. This climate too made it very difficult to perform well, but I am determined to win the gold in the third leg,” Himasha said.
Nimali said that she entered the race with a fresh mind, forgetting the bad experience in the first leg where she won a bronze. Her personnel coach Sujith Nilantha said a much better performance is expected from her in the third leg.
The only Lankan gold medalist of the first leg, Indunil Herath had a dismal performance in the men’s 800m and was placed fourth (1:50.99 minutes). Indunil said that his aim is to record a much better timing which would enable him qualify for the Asian Games. Abrahim Al Sofari of Kuwait won the gold (1:50.06 minutes) and Tachi Ikino of Japan bagged the silver (1:50.89 minutes).
Rumeshika Ratnayaka finished fourth in the 100m with a timing of 11.81 seconds. The gold medal was won by Kazakhstan’s Victoria Sayabikina (11.36 seconds).
The third and final leg of the Asian Grand Prix will be held in Chinese Taipei on April 30.
