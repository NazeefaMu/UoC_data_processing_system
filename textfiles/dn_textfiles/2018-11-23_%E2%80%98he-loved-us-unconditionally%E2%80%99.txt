Sarath  Malalasekara
‘He loved us unconditionally’

As the eldest granddaughter of senior journalist Sarath Malalasekara, this article is my tribute to an iconic personality who passed away a week ago.
It’s been seven days since his departure and we are still in shock over losing him. November 16, 2018, was one of the darkest days of our lives. We are still trying to comprehend our grief, but know that it is not possible.
Seeya was truly a selfless person and was always willing to help others who were in need. I can still remember how he used to give Rs.50 and Rs.100 notes to poor people whenever he met them. He was a lovable person who loved us unconditionally. He used to call anyone younger than him ‘Puthu’.
He was a fun and a joyful person who tried to make us happy in every way he could. Though he was a pure vegetarian, he used to take us to fast food outlets to make us happy. He was a special person who earned the love of people, but not money. He didn’t care about wealth or status. All he cared about was people and relationships. He was such an influence to our lives and he was truly a role model for us.
Seeya was a hardworking person and loved his profession as a journalist more than anything else. He used to spend most of the day with his colleagues at Lake House. He worked very closely with police officers and they were very fond of him and used to praise him a lot.
He tried his best to produce accurate, relevant, complete and understandable legal and police information to the public without misleading them. Though he was so dedicated to his profession, he never messed up his work life and his personal life. He tried to balance both remarkably.
Each and every person who worked with him at Lake House adored Seeya. He never spoke a hurtful word to them and no one even spoke ill of him. Whenever we visited Lake House, all of them treated us very well because of their love for Seeya. He was like a father to everyone there.
We know that we will have a very difficult road ahead to recover from this huge loss. He was truly a remarkable person and I certainly know that I won’t meet such a great personality throughout my lifetime. So, goodbye Seeya. We will miss you a lot and you were the best Seeya in the whole world for the four of us. Love you so much, Seeya.
May you attain
the Supreme Bliss of
Nibbana!
