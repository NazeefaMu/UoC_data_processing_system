Payments for SLCCA bought potatoes:
Farmers seek President’s intervention

The potato cultivators in Welimada and Uva Paranagama request President Maithripala Sirisena to instruct relevant authorities to pay them Rs. 90 million for their harvest that the Sri Lanka Consumer Cooperative Association (SLCCA) bought from them during the government that lasted a few weeks ago.
Since the potato price dropped during the last few months, the SLCCA bought the potato harvest of the farmers at centres at Welimada, Bogahakumbura, Nugathalawa, Uvaparanagama, Mediwela and Ambagasdova from October 1 to October 9 this year. The farmers told that the SLCCA bought 1.8 million kg of potatoes from them, but the money for the purchase has not yet been settled.
The farmers said they cannot commence the Maha season cultivation since they did not get their income of the previous season. They said 50 kg of seed potatoes cost them Rs. 25,000 and the farmers in Welimada cultivate imported seed potato for the Maha season from November to January and a part of its harvest they cultivate in the Yala season from May to August.
Welimada and Uva Paranagama Potato farmers’ Association President D. M. Siriwardena said that if the potato cultivation failed in the Maha season, it would directly affect the cultivation in the Yala season.
“If we delay the cultivation in the rainy season, farmers will lack water for their cultivation later,” Siriwardena said. “We brought this matter to the notice of the previous government, but they failed to resolve the issue. We request President Maithripala Sirisena to resolve our problem,” he said.
