Multiple endings to keep climax undercover

Apart from its high octane action sequences and gripping storylines, the ‘Race’ franchise is known for its twisted climax scenes and its third installment will be no different. However, to keep the climax scene from being leaked out, the makers are apparently out with a brilliant strategy.
According to reports, the makers of ‘Race 3’ will be shooting multiple endings so that no one knows which scene will be incorporated in the film. Nobody from the entire film crew will reportedly be aware of the climax sequence.
Seems like us, they too will need to wait until June 15 to know the same!
Helmed by Remo D’Souza, the film stars, Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor, Jacqueline Fernandez, Saqib Saleem, Daisy Shah and Bobby Deol in lead roles. The trailer of the film which was released recently has received mix reviews.
