Errant traders face the music

 Seven traders found guilty of displaying and selling food items unsuitable for consumption, were fined Rs.70,000 by Kurunegala Chief Magistrate Githani Wijesinghe on Wednesday.
Rotten eggs, vegetable rotties and ground nuts seized during the raids were produced before court as case productions by the health Authorities.
The traders are residents of Theliyagonna, Gettuwana and Malkaduwawa.
