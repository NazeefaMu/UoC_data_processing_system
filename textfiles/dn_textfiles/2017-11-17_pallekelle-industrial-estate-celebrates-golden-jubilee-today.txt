Pallekelle industrial estate celebrates golden jubilee today

The Industrial Estate of Pallekelle, Kandy, coming under the supervision of the Industrial Development Board of Ceylon (IDB) will celebrate its golden jubilee today, with the participation of IDB Chairman Mahinda Jinasena, as chief guest.
The event to mark the completion of 50 years is jointly organized by the Pallekelle Industrial Association and the Office of the Superintendent of the IDB Industrial Estate.
The IDB, the Central Office operating from Katubedde, Moratuwa, is the prime state organization established to promote and develop industries in Sri Lanka and cater mainly to Sri Lankan enterprises, institutions and individuals.
Falling in line with this broad concept, there are 64 industries of different types operating now, under the aegis of the IDB in the Industrial Estate at Pallekelle, Kandy, 154 kilometres away from the City of Colombo. The estate covers a land area, a little more than 53 acres which comes within the Central Provincial Council and the Municipal Council of Kandy.
These factories provide 2,800 direct employment and thousands of indirect employment, a means of earning to many, who have no employment to boast about. Some of the industrialists operating here on the same land, focus their attention on the international market.
The Superintendent of the Industrial Estate Pallekelle, Kandy North, Gavarammana told the media that while they celebrate the golden jubilee of the industrial estate, its beginning was noteworthy as the estate was the rock on which many industrialists climbed the ladder of success.
The industrial estate was the stronghold on which one could heavily depend for land and other infrastructure facilities, if one had the will to begin and pursue an industry of one’s choice. Of course it goes without saying that the industries commenced should be market-oriented if the industry wants to succeed and continue.
And we are told that all the industries begun in this Pallekelle estate had a great demand, a commendable market share, and their products were very much appealing to both local and foreign market. Such industrialists have found this estate a haven and 64 industrialists now operate successfully.
Gavarammana went onto say that the estate authorities here would give a helping hand to those seeking such help and guidance, creating confidence in them to proceed without hesitation. Looking back, what strikes one most was the fact that an institution set up to encourage and develop local industry, with an office on a plot of land found 12 kilometres away from the city, had taken the initiative to provide buildings necessary with three-phase electricity and other infrastructure facilities to those eagerly looking for means to commence industries of their choice.
“The land is a big factor, without which no industrialist could think of beginning an industry. It was undoubtedly a blessing in disguise to many industrialists dreaming of setting up their industries and the industrial estate awaits with open arms to receive those who are keen, to start their industries here," he added.
With the passage of time, land was allocated to the industrialists and they had to put up their buildings, factories and like. “I must commend those responsible in setting up the buildings especially the water tank which could contain 100,000 gallons of water, distribution line and the sewage and the washrooms, as they do well even now after five decades without any repairs or any alteration," Gavarammana said.
The industrial estate not only provides them the facilities to commence their industries but also make available other sources and resources useful to the industry and the people involved in a particular industry. “We introduce new technology and give them the opportunity to visit foreign lands to study the market available and the type of goods they expect and the using of new technology to earn more foreign exchange.”
He also said despite the fact that a part of the land belonging to the industrial estate was taken over by the Government in building the Victoria Dam and continuing with development work, the then Government had committed, the IDB has taken steps to construct new buildings on the available land, in place of those on the land that had been taken over by the state, without causing any hardship to the owners of the buildings.
Making reference to future plans of the industrial estate, Gavarammana said that steps would be taken to fall in line with the Government's concerted effort to make this a more environmentally conscious industrial estate.
“We are very much concerned about the environment and we are operating our industries in an environment-friendly atmosphere. This was possible for us, for we educate, make the industrialists conscious of this fact. There is some sort of brainstorming sessions and collecting of information from the participants at seminars and workshops conducted for their benefit. We have now taken steps to divide this estate into eight regions with a view to ensure and maintain environment-friendly atmosphere," he said.
He also said with the submission of the new plan to create eight regions within the estate, the Commerce and Industry Ministry allocated funds necessary to improve the condition of the estate and every road within it is now fully carpeted and special roadways are set up for the easy movements of the workers. "We have also planted bamboo trees along the boundary separating land from the lakes.
