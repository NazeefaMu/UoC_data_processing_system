Overloading cause for power outage

The power outage experienced in Dehiwala, Kalutara, Horana and many other areas yesterday evening was caused by overloading as a result of a technical issue at the Norochcholai coal power plant, a Ceylon Electricity Board official told the Daily News.
However, he said the CEB officials managed to restore the power supply to these areas last night.
