Pink gets real

In a recent interview with The Guardian, singer Pink opened up about her marriage to Carey Hart.
“There are moments where I look at (Hart) and he is the most thoughtful, logical, constant… he’s like a rock. He’s a good man. He’s a good dad. He’s just the kind of dad I thought he’d be. And then I’ll look at him and go: I’ve never liked you. There’s nothing I like about you. We have nothing in common. I don’t like any of the sh*t you like. I don’t ever wanna see you again. Then two weeks later I’m like, things are going so good,” Pink told the publication, according to EOnline.com.
“Then you’ll go through times when you haven’t had sex in a year. Is this bed death? Is this the end of it? Do I want him? Does he want me?” she said, adding that monogamy takes work.
