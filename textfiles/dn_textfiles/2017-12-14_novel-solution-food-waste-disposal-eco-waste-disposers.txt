Novel solution to food waste disposal from  Eco Waste Disposers

Eco Waste Disposers recently introduced a product which offers a unique solution to Sri Lanka’s garbage problem. This garbage disposer unit eases the hassle of collecting and disposing food waste in residential and commercial establishments.
This unit grinds nearly all types of food waste including chicken bones, egg shells and fruit and vegetable peel. The ground waste passes through the existing pipe systems and its septic tank safe. The units can be used in any type of kitchen and they can be easily fit underneath existing kitchen sinks.
Waste management and collection has been a major concern for many years and this year has seen tragic outcomes arising from this issue. It is said that Colombo accounts for 1,500 MT per day of garbage and Gampaha 600 MT per day, Kaluthara 300 MT per day and Kandy 209 MT per day. It was said that over 61.8% of waste is organic waste (Open Journal of Civil Engineering, Vol.05 No. 01 - 2015). Of this, 40% is given to the local government services to collect and dispose.
“We are happy to introduce waste disposers to Sri Lanka as it will no doubt ease the garbage problem we are facing today. We think it’s a timely solution for residential customers and commercial customers alike. We have been fortunate to partner with the world’s number 1 brand Waste King, a company who have been pioneers in this industry for over 70 years in the USA,” said Kishani Kaluarachchi, Managing Director, Eco Waste Disposers.
Waste King disposers have a number of key benefits which includes motors which have 50% more RPMs (speed) and 30% more torque (grinding power) compared to other brands, hence taking less time to grind. The units are energy efficient, use less electricity and water, make less noise in operation, are environmentally safe and are septic tank friendly. Its EZ-mount systems makes installation fast and easy, while the stainless steel grinding component makes it corrosion free and durable.
“With Waste King Garbage Disposers you can eliminate the need for collection of your food waste and avoid the odours this waste creates in your home, especially if you’re living in an apartment complex.
It will also help you to reduce your carbon footprint and contribute to better environment management,” Kaluarchchi added.
Waste King Commercial units can be used across a wide range of outlets including hotels, restaurants, pastry shops, hospitals, cafeterias, schools, snack bars, juice bars and other types of kitchens. The product range varies from 1HP-5HP models which can process waste of 50 upto 5,000 meals per hour. ­­­Consumers could request a demonstration at Eco Waste Disposers office at Thimbirigasyaya Road, Colombo 5.
