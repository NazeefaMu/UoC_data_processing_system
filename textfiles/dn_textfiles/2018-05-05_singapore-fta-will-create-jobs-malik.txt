Singapore FTA will create jobs - Malik

Contrary to reports that the new Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) would disproportionately benefit Singapore, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said it would create new jobs and revenue at home.
“This process will generate more employment opportunities for Sri Lankans, including our professionals,” he said.
He was speaking at the ministry offices at the World Trade Centre on Friday.
“The allegation that Singaporeans will be able to freely take Sri Lankan jobs is “a diabolical lie,” Minister Samarawickrama said. The FTA does allow experts and senior management employed by foreign investors to obtain “time-bound” work visas, however. Minister Samarawickrama further rejected the claim that the FTA was signed without Cabinet approval, pointing to the Cabinet Decision of January 16, which authorised him to sign the agreement a few days later.
There have also been concerns that ASEAN countries would use Singapore as a point of entry to take advantage of the lower tariffs into Sri Lanka.
But, K.J. Weerasinghe, the FTA’s chief negotiator, pushed back on that notion, saying that that the FTA had rules of origin and other safeguards. Speaking broadly about foreign direct investment, Minister Samarawickrama said the government’s trade liberalization policies were showing concrete benefits.
“Last year we achieved a record investment of 1.9 billion dollars,” he said. “This year we are expecting an increase to 2.5 billion dollars.”
“This clearly shows that the policies of our government are well-received by the international community, and well-received by our exporters,” he added.
Minister Samarawickrama said the government was currently negotiating Free Trade Agreements with India and China, and was exploring the possibility of a deal with Thailand as well.
“We are on the correct path,” he said.
