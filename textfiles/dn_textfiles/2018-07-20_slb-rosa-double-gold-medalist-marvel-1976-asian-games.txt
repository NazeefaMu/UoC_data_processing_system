S.L.B. ROSA - the double gold medalist marvel at the 1976 Asian Games

If the Initials SLB were meant to read “Sri Lanka's Best” then in 1970's it was surely a reference to SLB ROSA . He was really the best athlete that Sri Lanka produced. And deservedly he took the country and Asia by storm.
As a long distance runner SELLAPPULIYAGE LUCIAN BENEDICT ROSA – aka – S.L.B. ROSA was a long distance running marvel. Like his Ethiopian and Kenyan brothers he came from the hinterland. Ampitiya was his birthplace. And from those humble beginnings he rewrote the history books of Sri Lankan athletics when running barefoot and winning the 5,000 and 10,000 metre events at the 1970 Asian Games in Bangkok,Thailand. He created an Asian Games record in the 10,000 metre event.
In lighter vein, the story goes that when ROSA would run up and down the winding roads of Ampitiya, no one dared to challenge him and it was left for the stray dogs to chase after him. And then the people in the nearby boutiques “kades” would chime in aptly with the perennial : – ROSA polla genang, balla maranta and Hinguru kothamali genna ROSA'!
ROSA at the Asia Games at the same venue in 1966 won the bronze medals in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres and bettered it by winning gold in both events in 1970. His best personal timing was 29.18.0 which was a national record.
Munich Olympic Games
ROSA also ran in the marathon at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, West Germany. ROSA led the Sri Lankan team that comprised Sunil Gunawardena and W.Wimaladasa. At these Games former champion runner UPALI GOONERATNE, uncle of LALITH ATHULATHMUDALI also a champion athlete and the writer were the guests of the West German Government and watched ROSA in action in the marathon.
Montreal Games boycott
ROSA failed to run at the 1976 Montreal Games with Sri Lanka deciding to boycott the games. He was unfortunate not to run in at the Mexican Games because Sri Lanka sent only a three-man squad due to financial constraints.It was sad on this great marathon runner who would have left his mark had he been sent.
ROSA hailing from Ampitiya was an old boy of Roman Catholic School where he took to the track showing his potential in long distance running winning the five mile road race organized by Dharmaraja College, Kandy. After that running and winning trophies came naturally to him.
On leaving school ROSA enlisted with the Army as a Private and kept up his winning streak setting up records in the 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000 metre in all three events at the Inter-Unit Army meets and Defence Services meets. He was fortunate to have former long distance champion runner in Linus Diaz as his coach.
Put to second best
ROSA then made everyone stand up and take notice when he put to second best Sri Lanka’s long distance runner R.J.K.Karunananda in the National championships. Although his rivals were Karunananda, A.W.Aloysius, Wimalsena Perera and the sensations from Bandarawela brothers A.S.M. and A.L.M. Khan.
It did not take long for ROSA to be crowned king of long distance running when he ran sans spikes on a modern track. He set up records in the 10,000 event clocking 29.55.6 and finishing the 5,000 in 14.32.2. ROSA also ran in the prestigious Boston Marathon in 1976 and performed
creditably, coming in fourth with a time of 2.15.4 seconds which was a first by a Sri Lankan athlete.
OSA’S brilliance
After watching ROSA’S brilliance at the Asian Games in Bangkok the Director of the University of Wisconsin Park, US Roshan Ditch and Bob Lawson their athletics coach offered ROSA a scholarship to do a Business Management and Coaching Certificate Course from 1970 to ’74 and he successfully completed the course.
ROSA running in the World Championship Marathon in Japan finished seventh with a time of 2.13.14 seconds. After quitting the track that he loved most, he took to coaching of the University of Wisconsin and was later promoted as Cross Country and Track and Field Coach of the University.
ROSA’S magnificent effort at the Asian Games in Bangkok in 1976 where he won two gold medals in the 5,000 and 10,000 metre events will not be equaled or bettered and will stand the test of time.
Self made athlete
When will there be another athlete of the class of S.L.B. ROSA? He was a self made record breaking athlete and he set an example for other athletes to follow. It was a pity that ROSA’S expertise was lost to the country.
This account will not be complete without mention of the incident when the writer was watching the Munich Olympics in 1972 brings to mind the nightmarish and frightening experience UPALI and the writer suffered when
terrorists styling themselves ‘BLACK SEPTEMBER’ struck invading the quarters of the Israeli athletes and gunning some of them down in cold blood during the Games. The Games were not the same after that inhuman experience and there was fear all round not knowing what was going to happen next. The Israeli athletes were unfortunate to suffer murder. Why the terrorists had to vent
their anger on the innocent Israeli athletes by invading their quarters and causing death and destruction was inexplicable and unforgivable.
‘Black September’ terror attack –
It later transpired that the ‘BLACK SEPTEMBER’ group that struck had worked in that very building that was being constructed to house the Israeli contingent and the terrorists had no difficulty in finding the quarters. The attack group had entered the Games Village posing off asathletes with kit bags and track suits to boot and had no difficulty in fooling the security and gaining entry.
The ‘BLACK SEPTEMBER’ killing group that showed man’s inhumanity to man were despots. The Games were not the same again and it was the first time that terrorists had struck at a sports event. GOONERATNE and the writer experienced fear for the first time and were counting the days when we would be flying back home.
The Americans who were stunned by the murders quickly whisked away the swimming sensation MARK SPITZ who was dominating the pool winning events with consummate ease and taking the swim events by storm.
