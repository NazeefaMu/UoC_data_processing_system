Musali protesters are not asking for different state: Musthapha

The community living in the Musali administrative area in Wilpaththu were not asking for a different state during their peaceful protest, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapha.
He said so while addressing a public gathering held on May 8 at the mosque where the 43-day protest was held.
The protest was due to a gazette notification published saying that Marichchikatti Pallakkuli and villages in Musali administrative area in Puttalm, belonged to Wilpaththu National Park.
"This is a non-violent struggle to gain their heredity, so I request everyone not to comment on this matter in a political view. We should dedicate ourselves to support them as we all are Sri Lankans," the minister added.
He also said that during the past years, Sri Lankans had to face bitter experiences. Especially people in the North and Eastern Provinces experienced the worst. The war left them with nothing. As the war was over, they have the right to come back to their lands which they left in fear.
The minister said, "There is enough evidence to prove that these lands belonged to these people. They have even given tuskers for the Temple of the Tooth Relic. It is very unfair that these people are considered as outsiders."
"We have discussed this matter with the President. We believe that he will give a fair solution to this. The Muslim community played a huge role in building the present Yahapalana Government. We believe that this government will ensure national reconciliation,” he added.
Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, Provincial Councils and Local Government politicians and individuals, while the Sri Lanka Muslim Media Forum President N.M. Ameen presided.
