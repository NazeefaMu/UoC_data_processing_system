Alonso satisfied after Daytona spin

Miami: Fernando Alonso believes he has gained vital experience for a future crack at the Le Mans 24 Hours after finishing 38th in the Daytona endurance race on Sunday.
The Spanish former Formula One world champion’s campaign in Florida was derailed by mechanical problems that included two brake failures in his United Autosports Ligier JS P217.
The 36-year-old admitted however he had been unnerved by the experience.
“You’re scared a little bit, no doubt,” Alonso said. “It happened two times in the first corner - you’re right there at 300-310 kilometres an hour then you hit the brakes and there’s no brakes.
“At night, you don’t see clearly the tire wall or the escape road, so there was even a little more of a scare.”
The McLaren driver took to the track in Florida this weekend to gain experience for racing Le Mans.
Alonso has spoken of his desire to take a crack at the “Triple Crown” of motor-racing - winning the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix, the Indianapolis 500 and Le Mans. AFP
