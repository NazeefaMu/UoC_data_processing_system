A captain’s dream all rounder

In the pre Test cricket era, Zahira College, Maradana produced some outstanding cricketers who could have sported the country’s colours and left their mark with telling performances.
GHULAM RAZICK from Zahira is our ‘SPORTS LEGEND’ this week. His full name is a 'Googly' in its own right: GNANI SHEIKKH ABDUL CADER MOHAEDSEEM ABDUL 'GULAM' RAZICK. It reflects that there are many facets to this Sportsman of yore: the curly haired handsome cricketer. He was an all rounder that any captain, school, club or country will strain every nerve, sinew and muscle and love to have.
He belonged to Zahira College which was a breeding ground at that time for cricketers of class. RAZICK was that mercurial all rounder and naturalist who took to the game like a duck to water when he was in grade 4 at school. His love for the game knew no bounds.
Rose to be a champion
He rose to be a champion playing in under 12, 14 and 16 age groups showing his immense natural talent. It was not long before he realized his dream of playing in the first side in school.
In the mid 1950s the best cricketer Zahira gave to the game was undoubtedly Muttiah Devaraj. A Tamil in a predominantly Muslim school Devaraj belonged to a generation when race, creed or religion had no part to play in neither school nor national sports.
Devaraj was a classy all rounder. As a right hand batsman he was devastating with strokes all round the wicket.
As a fastish right arm off spinner he was not easy to negotiate and as a cover fielder, he had it him to put to second best the world’s best in that position South Africans Colin Bland and Jonty Rhodes. Devaraj dominated the school scene in the mid 1950s.
He later played for the Tamil Union and Nomads and his consistency earned for him calls to play for the Board President’s X1 and in the then regular and famous Gopalan Trophy game against Madras.
Knack of spotting talent
RAZICK'S first coach was the famous Bahar who had the natural knack of spotting talent and licking into shape and giving to the country a finished product that would be a pride and an example.
RAZICK had a good run in big time school cricket, before joining Moors Sports Club, which club saw a host of promising Zahira cricketers joining them. He was oozing with talent so much so that as a schoolboy he played for Moors in the company of some exalted cricketers.
RAZICK sported the captaincy cap at school in 1963 and 1964. In a game against S.Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia ---believe it or not--- he captured six wickets for five runs and helped Zahira triumph. The Thomians were captained by Randy Morrel who was the writer’s team mate at the Burgher Recreation Club.
An offer of a bat
Incidentally a little anecdote. Morrel and the writer were playing for BRC in a Donovan Andree Trophy game at the BRC ground against Saracens and Clive Barthomoleusz a former Wesley cricketer made an offer that any member scoring the first century in that game would be presented with a bat.
Morrel and I were racing neck to neck to get that elusive bat and we reached the 90s together and Morrel attempting big hit to race ahead of me skied a catch and was out and wasn’t I elated.
Back to RAZICK and his taking five wickets and over in a game with his right arm cutters came naturally and heading the schools bowling averages was no big deal. He began his big time cricket career in 1962 for Moors and played in the company with stalwarts of the calibre of Makkin Salih, Tony Buhar and M.E.M. Nawaz. The rookie RAZICK held his own among these stalwarts.
A grand century
In a Sara trophy fixture against University which UNI side had famous schoolboy cricketers – Lareef Idroos, Sarath Wimalaratne, Nihal Gurusinghe and Raja de Silva he scored a hundred and then followed with 87 against Moratuwa and 40 against a strong SSC side.
Those knocks earned him a slot in the Board President’s X1 against Madras in Gopalan Trophy games in 1966 and 1968.
He then graduated to the Ceylon team that played MCC in a limited over match and in a match won on a faster run rate he took the wickets of the renowned John Edrich, Roger Prideaux and Keith Fletcher and making an unbeaten 15.
It was he who hit the winning run. He still treasurers pocketing the wickets of Edrich, Prideaux and Fletcher.
However he enjoyed his most memorable moments in the game when he was selected to play for the country against MCC in an unofficial test.
He bowled after T.B.Kehelgamuwa and Daya Sahaband used the new ball.
Hawk eyed slip man
RAZICK who was hawk eyed with quick reflexes had the knack of taking some amazing slip catches. More than once he had taken five catches in an innings and the best effort was grabbing for Moors 13 catches in a Sara trophy game and that too when leading the team. That effort would have been a world record, but the cricket had that time was not recognized because that effort was performed in the pre Test era.
RAZICK was also coached by the great Bertie Wijesinha and admits he improved his game all round tremendously under Wijesinha’s guidance.
I had the opportunity of playing against RAZICK and can vouch for his abilities as a stylish, copy book correct, yet right hand dashing batsman; bowling medium paced vicious right arm off cutters; and as slip fielder he could be bracketed with former Australian opening batsman and slip fielder par excellence Bob Simpson.
He also had a brilliant captaincy brain.On a personal note – sub head Before going on to sing more praises of RAZICK, I would like to digress and on a personal note recall the Sara Trophy game between Moors and Saracens at the then Braybrook Place matting in the 1970s. After a century opening stand between T. K. Palitha and Weerabangsa for Saracens, I was asked to go in next by captain Shanti Pieris and up the scoring rate. That was because of my ability for big hitting against the fast bowlers.
Knowing and having seen me hook left arm fast bowler and my former team mate at SBC Nihal Zoysa playing for NCC in Sara game for two sixes to the Rifle Green rail track off bouncers, RAZICK who was captaining Moors immediately summoned a left arm spinner called Dawoodbhoy to bowl.
Into the land of nod
Now Dawoodbhoy would toss the ball so high, that you could go into the land of nod, yet wake up and play him. I was waiting, and sick of waiting for the ball to descend that sleepishly I pushed forward only to snick for RAZICK to gobble the catch at slip and pocket the ball to my consternation. Out first ball for zero.
That was RAZICK for you as captain. Playing for Moors he also won the Single Wicket Tourney organized by the Colombo Cricket Club for the 'Times of Ceylon' Trophy in 1965 beating Cambridge Blue P. I. Pieris of the Sinhalese Spots Club in the final.
RAZICK also showed amazing energy when he bowled 42 nonstop overs in a 'SARA' Trophy game which he claims to be a record.
RAZICK is married to Zeenath Munawar and has one daughter and two sons and resides at Bauddhaloka Mawatha.
Cricketers and all-rounders of his class are rare-and rarer still are self-effacing gentleman of RAZICK'S calibre.
