‘Some do not understand importance of promoting reconciliation’

 “Certain people do not fully understand the importance of promoting national reconciliation. Some blame me for supporting certain ethnic groups. Children all are alike despite their ethnicity and religion. They have a right for education, Dr. Pannila Sri Ananda Thera said.
The Thera was addressing the gathering after opening a fully completed Dhamma school for schoolchildren in Dabana recently as a part of an educational promotion programme implemented by the Thera.
The Chief Incumbent of the Huston Buddhist Temple in America, the Thera is the Chief Prelate of the Sri Arahantha Raja Maha Viharaya in Attanagalla as well.
The Vedda Chief Vannila Atto said at the handing over ceremony of the school that the Dhamma School would enable their children to be more committed to a pious life style. He pointed out the importance of Dhamma education in connection to their lifestyle and said the school will be a foundation for the children to improve their social and psychological well-being.
“The programme will enhance the national reconciliation process. It also comes in as an answer to religious uneasiness. I have sponsored a three-storey building worth Rs. 20 million for Al Akbar Madya Maha Vidyalaya, an Islamic school in Thihariya and a two-storey building worth Rs. 20 million for St. Mary’s College in Veyangoda. Kirindiwela Sanghamitta Maha Vidyalaya received a Rs. 10 million worth building as a part of the programme.” the Thera said.
“An educated generation will despise racism and religious and otherwise discriminations.
“They will make a better future for the country,” the Thera said.
