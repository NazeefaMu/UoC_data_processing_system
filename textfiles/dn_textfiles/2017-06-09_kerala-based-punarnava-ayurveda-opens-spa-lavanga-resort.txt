Kerala-based Punarnava Ayurveda opens spa at Lavanga Resort

Kerala-based Punarnava Ayurveda, one of the premier ayurvedic healthcare providers in India with 22 years of service is scaling new heights.
The latest accolade for Punarnava comes with the signing of a MOU with Anudan Holdings (Pvt) Ltd to launch their first Sukhayus Ayurveda centre in Sri Lanka at Lavanga Resort and Spa, Hikkaduwa.
Lavanga Resort and Spa, which opened just three and half years ago, has invested over Rs. 160 million to upgrade its property.
The investment includes the installation of the new sewerage plant, a building of new staff quarters and upgrading of rooms with European fittings, decor and furniture.
The hotel which won Best Small Hotels in the Asia Pacific Region recently is also seeking to be classified as a four star hotel soon.
The hotel, built by former Australian entrepreneur and professionally qualified architect, Daniel Frydman, today offers 60 rooms. The hotel is currently overlooked by the Managing Director Anusha de Alwis Frydman.
