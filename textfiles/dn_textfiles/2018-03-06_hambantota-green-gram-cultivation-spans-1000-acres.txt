Hambantota green gram cultivation spans 1,000 acres

Under the National Food Production Programme initiated by the Presidential Secretariat, green gram has been cultivated in an area of 1,000 hectares, in the Hambantota district. Seven hundred and fifty hectares have been cultivated in Lunugamwehera and 250 hectares have been cultivated in other areas of the district, the district agriculture director said.
Meanwhile, the Agriculture Ministry has provided subsidy funds for green gram cultivators in the Ridiyagama and Badagiriya areas.
The director said that the target for this season with regards to green gram cultivation, has already been achieved. He said the target was 6,000 hectares and added that to prevent cattle from destroying green gram cultivations, steps have been taken to set up electric fences in 30 places in the district.
State lands that remained barren for decades would be brought under mango and other fruit crop cultivations.
Farmers in the Hambantota district have been provided with paddy-planting machines and invasive plant-clearing machines. Steps have also been taken to train farmers on new farming technology and as such, it has been targetted to train 240 farmers.
Another 25 farmers would be trained on growing of grass suitable for cows, in order to boost milk-production, the Hambantota assistant agriculture director said.
