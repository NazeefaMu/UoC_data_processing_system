A countrywide carbonic cultivation programme has been initiated under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The minister told Daily News that a testing carbonic cultivation programme conducted in the Kottankattuwa village in the Kantale area has proved the advantages of carbonic paddy cultivation. He said 194 bushels of paddy were secured at a cost of Rs. 34,250 from a single acre paddy field cultivated with carbonic fertiliser.
An acre of paddy grown with chemical fertiliser yields only 165 bushels and it costs Rs. 40,500, the minister said.
"Therefore, we initiated an island-wide carbonic cultivation programme from Mihintale, Wellaragama and 250 farmers families participate in it. Two thousands acres will be used for the project. The farmers are provided with seed varieties, and agriculture appliances among others.
A carbonic fertiliser plant will be established at Wellaragama.
A carbonic cultivation colony that will produce 100 percent chemical free food crops will be established by 2019, the minister said.
