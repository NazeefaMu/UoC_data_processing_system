Point of view
Institutional and HNI interest continued to drive markets this week, as crossings in Blue-chips, Diversifieds and mid-caps accounted for ~52% of market turnover. Although lower than last week’s ~72%, the proportion remains higher than the typical weekly average of ~35-40%.
Investor interest was driven predominantly by JKH (25% of crossings), Melstacorp (24% of crossings), NDB (16% of crossings), Dialog (7% of crossings) and mid-caps such as CCS (8% of crossings), RHL (7%) and LION (3% of crossings).
Foreign inflows to equities which have been consistent since early Feb and which have gathered pace since late Feb also drove market activity over the week, helping ease losses on the Index.
Despite the interest from HNI, Institutional and Foreign Investors though, the benchmark price Index fell steadily over the week, falling below the 6100-mark for the first time in a month.
Nevertheless the pace of decline eased over the week as positive earnings along with the IMF’s review and S&P’s credit ratings impacted sentiment. In its latest meeting to review its economic reform program with Sri Lanka, the IMF commended the authorities for meeting the December fiscal quantitative targets and for progress in improving revenue collection and automating revenue administration.
The Group noted though that the country’s net international reserves were short of the target as some of the structural reforms were lagging behind original timelines.
S&P meanwhile, affirmed Sri Lanka’s B+/B’ ratings while maintaining its negative outlook due to the country’s vulnerability to external shocks amid high external debt and low FX reserves.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain largely driven by Institutional and HNI investors as Retailers continue to adopt a watchful stance.
Cumulative 9m earnings rise 20% Y-o-Y
Market earnings over the December 2016 quarter rebounded strongly, helping push the trailing 12-month earnings of the market up by 24% Y-o-Y.
Total corporate earnings1 for the quarter rose 28% Q-o-Q and 34% Y-o-Y to Rs. 74Bn (cf. Rs. 58Bn in Sep’16 and Rs. 48Bn in Jun’16 quarter) driven mainly by Telcos which recovered from large FX losses and Banks & Finance and Diversifieds which benefitted from strong earnings performance in JKH and VONE.
From a cumulative 9-month2 perspective meanwhile, total market earnings rose to Rs. 177Bn, up 20% Y-o-Y from the Rs. 147Bn recorded a year ago. Robust earnings growth stemmed from sectors such as Telecom, Banks & Finance and Manufacturing although sectors such as Beverage, Food & Tobacco and Construction recorded losses over the period. Corporate earnings over the quarter reflect the mixed macroeconomic performance in H2’16; performance over the period has been mixed as the gradual improvement in growth has been accompanied by an uptick in inflation due to the drought impact and higher consumption-based tax increases (ie: VAT).
Nevertheless, the stronger earnings performance over the quarter helped push the market PER lower to 12.5x relative to 14.1x in the comparable period in 2015 and lower than the average PER levels of both its Frontier Market Peers (MSCI FM Index PER : 14.4x) and Emerging market peers (MSCI EM Index PER: 15.5x).
The ASPI has however, under-performed its peers over 2017, declining 1.7% YTD3relative to the MSCI EM (+7.1% YTD) and MSCI FM (+5.4% YTD).
