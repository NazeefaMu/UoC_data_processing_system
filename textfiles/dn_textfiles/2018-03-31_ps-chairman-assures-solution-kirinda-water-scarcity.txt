PS Chairman assures solution to Kirinda water scarcity

Under the Matara Development Scheme, the drinking water issue faced by residents of Kirinda and the surrounding areas, would be resolved as soon as possible, newly-elected Kirinda-Puhulwella Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Sanath Hettiarachchi said.
He added that feasibility studies are currently in progress, while construction and reconstruction work on minor water projects at Wathukolakanda, Hetiyawala, Boraluketiya, Ovitigamuwa South, Dammullegoda and Puwakgahahena had already been completed.
According to Hettiarachchi, certain unavoidable obstacles had affected the community water supply projects of Walakanda North, Ovitigamuwa North and Bambarawelkuttiya.
However, swift measures are now being taken to address the issue, he added.
