Dambulla T. B. Tennekoon Theatre abandoned

The T. B. Tennekoon Open Air Theatre in Dambulla which began construction in 2005 to further arts in the region has now been all but abandoned, complained artists in Matale.
The construction work of the theatre started with an initial capital of Rs. 10 million and construction took place in a slow pace. In 2014, the Budget allocated an additional sum of Rs. 36 million for it. But in 2015 when the government changed, construction on the theatre also came to a halt. The artists now ask what happened to all the money that was allocated for it?
The Open Air Theatre now has an audience hall as well as a half built theatre and has become home to the wild animals in the area who have taken over the abandoned construction site. The area residents also complain that the audience hall is being used by certain individuals for nefarious activities, causing trouble for many who live around it.
The artists in the meantime ask that construction on this theatre be completed so that it can be used for its original purpose.
