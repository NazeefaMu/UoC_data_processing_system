TNA to move motion

The TNA will move an adjournment motion on “Sri Lanka’s International Obligations” tomorrow in Parliament. The debate on the motion will be taken up from 2pm to 7pm. The debate comes amidst the heat of preparations for the 34th regular session of UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva from February 27 to March 24. The debate will focus on the country’s progress, drawbacks and way ahead with regard to the undertakings mentioned in the 2015 Geneva resolution to which Sri Lanka was also a co-sponsor. TNA MP M A Sumanthiran who went to Geneva last week reportedly met with the UNHRC authorities and several representatives of its member countries. As of the UNHRC resolution 30/1 adopted without a vote on October 1, 2015, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is expected to present a comprehensive report on the progress of Sri Lanka in the spheres of reconciliation, accountability and human rights at its 34th session.
The report on Sri Lanka is to be taken up for discussion on March 22 and Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera is to brief the UNHRC on February 28 outlining the country’s progress with regard to the undertakings mentioned in the resolution.
The UK representative attending the Organizational Meeting of the council last week expressed the intention of presenting a follow up resolution on Sri Lanka at its upcoming session in partnership with the Government of Sri Lanka.
