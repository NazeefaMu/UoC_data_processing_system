West Bromwich move to the top

LONDON: West Bromwich Albion moved to the top of English football's second-tier Championship table with a 3-2 win away to basement club Preston on Saturday.
Leeds United's 1-1 draw away to Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough's identical result at Hull on Saturday created an opening which the Baggies duly exploited by beating Preston.
Jay Rodriguez gave West Brom the lead early in the second half before Andrew Hughes's free-kick drew Preston level at Deepdale.
But a Ben Davis own-goal restored West Brom's lead in the 73rd minute.
Dwight Gayle's curling 25-yard free-kick put the Baggies 3-1 up before Alan Browne pulled a goal back for Preston late in stoppage time.
West Brom's win left them a point ahead of both Middlesbrough and Leeds.
Boro's Britt Assombalonga scored his fourth goal of the season only for hosts Hull to gain a point through Jarrod Bowen's penalty after Daniel Ayala fouled Chris Martin.
Elsewhere, Sheffield United came from behind to win 3-2 away to second-bottom Millwall.
The Blades’ Billy Sharp had a penalty, given for handball, saved by Lions goalkeeper Ben Amos.
But Sharp gave United the lead at the New Den when he headed in Kieron Freeman's cross before half time.
Jake Cooper equalised for the London club with a header and Millwall went ahead through Lee Gregory.
But two goals from David McGoldrick, the first a penalty, the second a stoppage-time winner, meant the Blades left south London with three points.
