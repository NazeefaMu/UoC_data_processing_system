Unitary state, Buddhism will be upheld in new Constitution: President

The responsibilities vested with the government regarding the unitary status of the country as per the Constitution, and the place given to Buddhism should never shirk under any circumstance, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He made these observations at the ceremony to present the Scroll to the newly elected Chief Sanganayaka of the Eastern Province and Thamankaduwa, Egodapattu, Venerable Makuruppe Pannasekara Nayaka Thera at the Mahaweli Shalika Hall Dehiattakandiya, on Monday.
The President said even a draft of the new Constitution is not ready yet and if the draft Constitution is prepared, it will be presented to Parliament and to the country. Thereafter, considering all suggestions and criticisms the draft will be prepared with relevant amendments, the President added.
The President emphasized that no change will be made to the clauses of the Constitution regarding the unitary status of the country as well as to the provisions regarding Buddhism in the 1972 Constitution.
President Sirisena said the expectation of the people regarding the new Constitution is to see a change in the existing electoral system and to introduce Proportional Representation System. He said in the process of building national reconciliation and devolving power, a scientific political mechanism would not under any circumstance, divide the country or change the unitary system.
