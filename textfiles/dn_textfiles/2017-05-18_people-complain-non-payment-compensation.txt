People complain of non-payment of compensation

H’tota – Sooriyawewa road widening project:
People in Sooriyawewa have complained that they have not received compensation payments for their lands acquired for the Hambantota-Sooriyawewa road widening project.
They allege that nearly a year had passed since the completion of valuation reports and other documents pertaining to compensation, but they are yet to receive their payments.
A spokesman for the Hambantota Divisional Secretariat said they had not received funds even though they had submitted documents to the RDA.
