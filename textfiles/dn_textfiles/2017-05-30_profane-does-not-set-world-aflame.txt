Profane does not set the world aflame

It's not the swearing per se. It's not the oaths, the expletives or the vulgarity. Really, it's not! I admire strong language. After nearly 40 years in newsrooms, I speak it fluently.
One of the most affecting memories from childhood involves my schoolmate and neighbour Ferna, at age 11, getting his mouth washed out with soap for uttering a swear word. I cannot recall the specific word, but I do remember the gagging and foaming, amidst promises never to repeat the offence.
I was certainly careful to keep my own language G-rated in front of his mother after witnessing that disturbing event! Personally, I don't find profanity inherently offensive as some people do. To me it depends on the context. That's not to say my language is a shining example of pristine purity. I can swear with the best of them when the occasion demands it.
Sophisticated vocabulary
For many working-class people, the F-word seems to me to be hardly countable as an expletive. Rather it is used as a reinforcing adverb: It's f****ing cold/hot/terrible' or whatever. Some purists argue that this shows an inability on the part of these speakers to use (or even to have) more sophisticated vocabulary, but I doubt this. In my view, nothing is regrettable in linguistic usage.
In the puritanical 60s only those considered ill-bred louts would dare drop the word ‘bugger’ or the F-bomb unless they were really hurt or wild-bull mad. Three decades on, the word has become so commonplace that its shock value seems quite lost. You see the whole darn surprise element has been negated by the expletive explosion. It is actually the repetition because the more you hear it, the blasted words sound like an idle threat or a battery operated torch. The more you use them the less power they have.
Oh sure, there was a time when an F-bomb in the right hands could destroy an octogenarian ladies’ cut-throat bridge party. That would, in the old girl lexicon have proved ‘deuced awkward’. But when they rain down in an almost uninterrupted barrage in casual conversation it shows a profound lack of creativity and a limited vocabulary.
It amounts to a type of lethargy, a kind of dim-witted avoidance of the effort it takes to say something truly startling.
People who can find no better means of expression than to keep harping on the same two or three tired, predictable, well-worn expletives are letting everyone down - most of all themselves. I've given it some thought, and here's my solution: Let's all make a conscious effort to come up with some new idioms to express the surprise, disappointment and confused anger that are so much a part of our daily lives.
Now, when I say ‘new,’ I don't mean to insist that you have to put that much personal creativity into it. But we can stand on the shoulders of generations of people who cared enough to give us amusing baubles rather than dirty diapers.
A loyal reader of mine suggested the resurrection of ‘By jove!’ That's very British, and it may turn out to be among the phrases that sound right only in one of those dialects. I'm a fan of ‘Oh my sainted aunt!’
Tremendous fun
‘Oh my God’ is almost always dreary as well as blasphemous in the eyes of many church doctrinaires. Besides, ‘OMG’ is a sad example of tediousness among the young. Which is why I'd like to resurrect ‘Oh my sainted aunt,’ ‘Oh my stars,’ or the truly delightful ‘Oh my stars and garters,’ which has the added feature of sounding a little bit racy, in a Victorian way, though it isn't, and is tremendous fun to say.
You don't have to be a comic-book character to utter expressions of strong astonishment or dismay such as ‘Great Scott!’ ‘Great Caesar's ghost!’ or ‘Hell's bells!’ Those are best delivered in something close to a shout, but for a milder effect you might go with ‘Holy socks’ or its rhyming variant concerning underwear. There was virgin aunt Rhonda who tickled everyone’s fancy when astonished with: ‘Well, butter my buns and call me breakfast!’
Disbelief is most often signalled by simply spewing out: ‘What the ...’ without finishing that question such as, ‘What the devil’, ‘What the deuce,’ or ‘What in blazes!’
But early exposure to objectionable vocabulary is not so uncommon. And some of the bluest outbursts that come out of the mouths of babes and sucklings can often make us see red. And particularly so when the profane becomes high-octane.
Grandson Kingco, when around four, was no exception. But as I said earlier, it depends on the context. The only extenuating circumstances weighing in his favour were his surroundings. He was domiciled in a country where swearing appears to be a national pastime.
At the time he had been scandalizing his grandmothers, aunts and the rest of the family by using certain unutterable words. One particular taboo word could clearly be described as 'ineffable'. That doesn't mean he knows the meaning of the word although he does know it's taboo in this neck of the woods. The 'swear jar' where he had to deposit a buck every time he dropped a 'potty' word or phrase was already full.
Foamy mouthwash
They tried the universal deterrent of threatening to wash his mouth out with soap. Fat hope! The technique in this instance failed miserably. Rather than fear the frothy, foamy mouthwash, he seemed to savour the prospect of its sudsy flavour. Reaching out for the glass of bubbly liquid he expostulated: "Oh goody... gimme that and gimme a straw I can blow bubbles!" But Kingco also realised that even the differently-abled were no exception. In an environment peopled by a bunch of versatile opponents in the art of vituperation was Charlie, his deaf and dumb play-mate. Charlie could lip-read and expressed himself quite effectively with hand signs to make his point.
Despite his deficiency in hearing and unable to mouth the spoken word he could out-cuss the best of them in the same offensive faculty with dramatically communicative mouth and hand gestures.
After one such episode following his gesticulated hurling of vile imprecations at a whole bunch of his mates Kingco appeared more curious than offended. He came home and posed the pertinent question: "Does his mother ever wash his filthy hands with soap?"
