[APPRECIATIONS - (18-12-2018)]

Joe Karunaratne
He strove to make a difference
We appreciate someone through our own eyes and experiences. When that person passes away, we learn more and understand better who he was through the eyes of the world he affected. He lived in Colombo and Washington, D.C., spent time in the U.K., and travelled extensively for business and pleasure. His world was large indeed, but ultimately it was to those around him who mattered most. Joe passed away on the October 18, last year.
Character mattered more than the letters after someone’s name of course, so it was what someone did with his degree that made the difference. Joe took his LLB and ably and graciously used the knowledge he gained to serve late Dudley Senanayake as his Private Secretary in the 1960’s.
He respected public service and his times with Dudley had a profound impact on the rest of his professional career, which expanded to the private sector and the Ceylon Tobacco Company. He took that experience and his vision to develop the duty-free industry for Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The stories he shared of government service then and the men and women he worked with had more to do with respect and integrity than what we know now.
With all his extensive global travels, he still loved his island home of Sri Lanka and did his part to share his values and opinions with the community. From serving in Kiwanis International to various charitable organisations, he always focused on transforming those around him and sharing his wealth in more ways than one. When he was supposed to be retired, he instead offered his counsel to younger Sri Lankans who had ideas and needed his help to move forward.Joe appreciated that network of friendships and business partnerships he developed in his lifetime in Sri Lanka. Everyone seemed to have been a batch-mate or the sister of a colleague. It is one thing to make friends, but another to cultivate friendships. It wasn’t the numbers but the people who mattered to him. Charmaine and Joe hosted countless grand dinner parties on Gregory’s Road and cozier meals in Colombo 3. Whether they were old childhood friends or old friends of their children, Joe made all feel welcome.
Whether it was the foundation learning he received at St. Benedict’s College or the Peradeniya University, he was a keen believer of the power of learning both through theory and people.
He inspired and enabled his children to achieve and thrive in the universities in the U.S. He made sure his grandchildren understood the value of their education.
Finally, bringing Joe’s life into focus from a worldwide perspective back to Sri Lanka to his friends then to his children and grandchildren, little of the above could have, nay would have happened without his wife of 56 years, Charmaine.
For better or for even better, this marriage endured under the watch of the heavens. Joe’s successes and setbacks, joys and sorrows, and countless other aspects of his life were all experienced with Charmaine at his side.
Only biographers and God can catalogue a man’s life adequately. One story to cover 83 years is all we can offer. So, we say to him, in the Latin language he enjoyed quoting, “Requiescat in pace” (May he [continue] to rest in peace).

Epitome of altruism
It is with profound sadness that I pen these words for my father who passed away on October 30 at the age of 80.
My dad was a kind, generous, and warm person who had a single-minded approach to life. He sacrificed most of his time to help those in need. In his magnanimity, his charitable concerns transcended boundaries of religion and race and as a result, he was a true inspiration to all who associated with him.
My father started life from humble and tragic beginnings. His father was a revenue inspector at the Colombo Municipal Council. He lost his mother before the age of five; she died while giving birth to his fourth sibling. He was raised by his father and grandparents. The family consisted of four siblings; one girl and three boys. He hails from Wellawatta, Colombo 6.
My dad was a bright student in primary school and was well-liked by teachers and peers alike. He was the only student to enter medical school from his batch. He entered on his first attempt and sailed through all his exams in the first attempt as well.
He was a hardworking and diligent student throughout his career who left no stone unturned in order to be successful. He loved his profession as he found that it was another way to help his friends and relatives in need. He went on further to qualify as a surgeon, as well as to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He had a thriving practice in the private sector of the medical profession and this helped him secure a position as a lecturer at the University of Colombo. He was also appointed as a Professor at the Baqai Medical School in Karachi, Pakistan.
My dad was an astute businessman who entered the property market in Sri Lanka. He used the proceeds from the business and medical practice to further finance his pet projects. This included his generosity to the Rotary Club of Colombo Central, Zahira College, and the All Ceylon Moor’s Association of which he was the President up to the time of his demise. He used his own initiative to create new projects such as the free medical clinic in Slave Island and the Janaza Services which was targetted to the underprivileged. He was heavily involved in helping Madrassa and making religious education a top priority for all. He was nominated to be the Mayor of Colombo as he worked tirelessly in his endeavour to help those in his home city.
He was a dearly loved father, brother and husband. He took his brother Faizel under his wing when he had some challenges and took care of him for the rest of his life. But he was also firm and made the need to do well academically clear to all of us. He raised us with a lot of love and always brought out his calm and sunny side with everyone.
My dad’s insistence on all three of us, his sons, being doctors was due to his feeling that it would bring stability to our lives; this has led us to do well in our chosen medical fields. He doted his wife and our dear mother, Zeena.
He took care of all her needs and made her the right hand person in all of his endeavours. She, in turn, took care of him during his struggles. A true marriage made with lots of love and compassion.
The illness which took his life was long and challenging one and mum took great care of him with lots of affection and empathy. During the time of his chronic ailments, he was still working on projects such as the orphanage in his mother’s name. Dad was my role model, my hero; he showed me how hard work and compassion for the underprivileged could always make one a better person.
Dad touched many lives in various ways. While he is no longer with us, his accomplishments are a shining light which will last an eternity Thanks, dad, for everything. We all miss you so much. May Allah grant you a special place in heaven.
