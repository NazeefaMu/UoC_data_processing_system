MURDER most foul

December 1 was a flurry of theatrical activity at Gateway College, Kandy as the middle and senior schools staged two productions; ‘Ion’ and ‘Murder at Dharmarama Road’ directed by a mother and son duo; Dayangi and Dhisal Kapuge.
Ion, a Greek play directed by Dayangi Kapuge and performed by the middle school was a delight. The young actors and actresses were quite powerful and boasted signs of future expertise in the domain of theatre. The play had a number of lovely original songs and musical pieces, and the presentation on stage was very colourful and dynamic. It was heartening to see such a lot of promising talent being utilized in this manner.
Upcoming director
The principal event of the evening was the Senior School’s production: ‘Murder at Dharamarama Road’, written and directed by Dhisal Kapuge, an undergraduate of the Faculty of Arts, University of Peradeniya. It proved to be nothing less than what was expected of this upcoming director in Kandy whose first production ‘Hecuba’ performed by university students earlier this year proved to be an immense success.
This play was what Kapuge called a ‘dark comedy’. True to this term, it was replete with very sensitive scenes as well as very sophisticatedly crafted humour; there was also plenty of cringe-worthy slapstick humour involved, which as I saw, was deliberately used with the very intention of poking fun at it.
‘Murder at Dharmarama Road’ can very clearly be called a revolutionary attempt because it wasn’t anything that could be traditionally expected from a school play. As Kapuge mentioned later in his concluding speech, this was definitely a risk; it was a risk simply because it certainly did not stick within the confines of what one might suppose a school to perform and also because as a play itself, it set to question and challenge several daunting societal issues that are quite rarely addressed in such a forum.
Contemporary Sri Lanka
The very usage of all three languages, English, Sinhala and Tamil was a bright move, and setting the drama in contemporary Sri Lanka also facilitated the spectators’ ability to relate further with the play and its concerns. The academic staff of Gateway College, especially Ianthe Rajadurai, Nissanka and Lakshmi Amaraweera should be commended for enabling the performance of this play.
The plot on its own wasn’t that entire complex; it followed the familiar structure of the whodunit genre where the most unassuming character winds up the culprit at the end. However, the play’s remarkability lies in the way in which Kapuge decided to go about with his plot, incorporating much thought-provoking and insightful dialogue that elucidated issues of rampant racism, classism and even language disparities.
Spectacular manner
Of course, this script was brought to life in the most spectacular manner by a very powerful cast comprising Poshia Hettiarachchi, Kaushal Agalakotuwa, Santhush Bandara, Duvini Attygala, Risigaran Nagendran, Jacinta Richards and Amaruwan Jayasinghe as the main characters and Suha Hamza, Sakya Rathnayake and Isuthil Sentil in their supportive roles. The script demanded the kind of energy and vibrancy that this wonderful cast did not fail to fulfill. They were all in perfect synchrony with each other, which helped in technicalities like generating sharp humour, as well as moving their spectators to tears and in short, gripping the audience and keeping them at the edge of their seats. There was never a moment in which the play failed to maintain the interest of the audience, and all credit for this goes to the cast.
Cleverly illustrated
The stars of the evening were Risigaran Nagendran who provided the play with comic relief that kept the audience in fits of uncontrollable laughter, and Jacinta Richards in opposition, who stirred the audience with her heart-rending portrayal of a character undergoing the pain and plight of being downtrodden and abused on account of her lower class and status in society. In fact, classism was one major theme addressed in the play, and it was cleverly illustrated visually on stage, and not merely through dialogue. Though Nagendran and Richards depicted very different characters in personality, the characters share the bond of belonging to the same class; one, a peon and the other, a domestic aide. Owing to this alone, there is much congeniality between the two, which was skilfully depicted by how the peon, Freddie constantly looks out for the domestic aide, Deepthi as they are both being sidelined by the other characters who are agents of higher social classes and statuses. In fact, this congeniality between the two on the basis of their class, trumps their differences in race (Freddie being a Tamil and Deepthi being a Sinhalese) and language (Freddie being fluent only in Tamil and English, while Deepthi can speak only Sinhalese). Victimization on the basis of their class was brought out in a very chilling scene in which the lady of the house manhandles Deepthi, slapping her, clutching her at the hair and even throwing her to the ground, screaming verbal insults. This was also projected in a light-hearted and very humorous scene where the best friend of the victim engages in a comic physical fight with Freddie on being called a murderer, despite all the other characters also accusing him of murder. This class factor was brought out through these two scenes as well as other subtle actions throughout the play.
Majoritarian ignorance
Delving into racism, which was perhaps the most controversial of the issues explicated in the play, we see the victim of the play, Sachin Siriwardana (portrayed by Amaruwan Jayasinghe) encompassing values that might be seen as typical of those festering in majoritarian ignorance and entitlement, which makes him a very disoriented racist. He voices without any reticence, his prejudices against the Muslims and also harbours patronizing sentiments towards the Tamils. Much of his dialogues came as a shock because they were bluntly racist and created a painful unease within the audience who reacted with pin-drop silence during these instances as it was unsure as to how to react. However, he was powerfully contested by Nafaz Marzook portrayed by Santhush Bandara, in his moving rendition of the difficulties faced by the minorities, about how they are judged not according to their humanity, but by their race and religion.
