Inherent right to life in the Constitution

The Constitution of Sri Lanka does not expressly recognize right to life or livelihood or the right to earn a living as a fundamental right, although it does recognize the freedom of every citizen to engage in ‘any lawful occupation, profession, trade, business or enterprise’. However, the Republic of Sri Lanka Bill, 2000 which did not become law expressly recognized in its article 8 the inherent right to life. Our Supreme Court has referred to the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights when dealing with issues relating to workers' rights, and attempted to interpret the law consistently with these provisions, and endeavoured to protect the right to earn a living by reference to other constitutional provisions. Irrespective of the fact that there was no direct provision to safeguard the right to life, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has interpreted Articles 11 and 13(4) in order to bring in the fundamental right to life.
Cited below are several judgments where our Supreme Court has examined the scope and application of the rights relating to work – livelihood – right to earn a living.
(a). Jayasinghe vs the Attorney – General and Others
The decision of the Supreme Court in Jayasinghe vs the Attorney – General and Others is a hallmark of judicial activism in this sphere. To appreciate the value of this landmark decision, it is necessary to note that our courts had previously refused remedies such as the writ of mandamus to compel a statutory employer to comply with provisions of circulars issued by them providing payment of half salary from the seventh month to an interdicted employee where the inquiry into the charges against him is not completed in six months. In Jayasinghe’s case the Petitioners sought relief in terms of Article 12 read with Article 126 of the Constitution on the basis that the inordinate delay in disciplinary proceedings after interdiction and suspension of pay deprived him of his fundamental rights. In granting relief to the Petitioner, the Supreme Court observed that the Constitution and the law provide safeguards for liberty, and that in the same way the Co-operative Employees’ Commission Act and regulations provide ‘protection’ for the livelihood of an employee. It must be noted that Supreme Court had held in several cases that workmen are entitled to join trade unions and participate in lawful industrial action and that no workman can be victimized for doing so’.
(b). Bulankulama and Others vs the Secretary, Ministry of Industrial Development and Others
This case is commonly known as Eppawala Judgment. Six of the Petitioners were farmers and / or owners of land situated in the vicinity of the Eppawala phosphate deposits, while the 7th was the chief monk of a temple, which was sustained by land in the area. They claimed that the proposed agreement between the government of Sri Lanka and Freeport MacMoran Resources Partners of USA, a multinational mining company, whereby the latter would be given the right to extensively mine the phosphate deposits situated in Eppawala, would result in violation of their fundamental rights to equality (Article 12(1)); the right to engage in an occupation of one’s choice. (Article 14(1) (g)), and freedom of movement and choosing one’s residence within Sri Lanka (Article 14(1) (h)).
It was argued that its operations would deprive the petitioners of their land and their means of livelihood or sustenance; cause acute environmental damage to the area including harm to health, cultural monument and the ancient irrigation systems that sustained agriculture, and deplete the phosphate deposits. The petitioners however, did not oppose the utilization of the mineral deposits; they opposed its exploitation in an accelerated and unregulated manner.
The proposed agreement it was averred, also circumvented the need by the company to comply with existing national laws relating to environmental impact assessment. (EIA), thereby denying the petitioners equal protection of the law. Referring to both the Stockholm (1972) and Rio (1992) Declarations on Environmental Protection, Justice Amarasinghe on behalf of the Supreme Court highlighted principles relating to sustainable development and declared that the proposed agreement must be considered in the light of forgoing principles.
After hearing the case, the Court gave relief as pleaded by the petitioners. The Court’s pronouncement, among others, that right to livelihood has been included in the Article 14(1) (g) – the right to engage in a lawful occupation of one’s choice – and its violation in this case has taken the parameters of the discourse of constitutional protection of human rights to new heights.
(c). Jayawardane vs Dharani Wijayatilake, Secretary Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and Others
Jayawardane case involved the cancellation of an appointment of an Inquirer into Sudden Deaths. The petitioner alleged that the first respondent had no power to cancel his appointment and that in any event, the cancellation was without cause or inquiry and hence invalid.
It was held:
‘Respect for the Rule of Law requires the observance of minimum standards of openness, fairness and accountability in administration and this means – in relation to appointments and removal from officers involving powers, functions and duties which are public in nature – that the process of making a decision should not be shrouded in secrecy……’
Justice Mark Fernando, further stated that Court can and indeed must take judicial notice of the fact that generally a person holding an office which is in public in character is not removed without legal authority without cause, without complying with the audi alteram partem rule and without notice.
The Court added that arbitrariness has been recognized as being violative of the equal protection clause. Therefore, it was held that a denial of natural justice prior to the cancellation of the petitioner’s appointment was violative of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.
The Court should certainly play an active role in interpreting the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution not to change any of its provisions but to give it a more effective meaning.
It is strongly recommended that the right to livelihood be specifically incorporated into our present Constitution by a constitutional amendment or be included into fundamental rights chapter of the proposed new Constitution as a justiciable fundamental human right.
