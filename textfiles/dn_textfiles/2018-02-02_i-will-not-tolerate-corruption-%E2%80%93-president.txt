I will not tolerate  corruption – President

Addressing a mass rally at Addalaiachenai Government Teachers’ Training College Grounds on Wednesday, President Maithiripala Sirisena said that his government would not allow corruption and malpractice under any circumstance and those who were involved in such activities would be severely dealt with.
President Sirisena was accorded a rousing welcome by the people of the District, representing all three communities, who had gathered in large numbers.
The meeting was organized by the National Congress headed by its leader and former minister A.L.M. Athaullah. Religious dignitaries, candidates contesting the local government elections and an unprecedented crowd, including a large percentage of women, were present.
President Sirisena thanked Tamils and Muslims of this area for his overwhelming victory at the last Presidential election. “I am prepared to extend my fullest support in whatever possible way to the people here. I am fully aware that Ampara District needs a lot of development projects and many issues need to be solved, but I regret very much that no one has approached me in this regard. Now that I have found a capable leader to associate with me to go ahead with these tasks, I request you all to strengthen his hand for the development of good governance,” the President said.
He advised candidates contesting under the National Congress’ ‘horse’ symbol and SLFP’s ‘hand’ symbol that serving the common masses should be the prime objective and warned that anyone involved in corruption and malpractice would be severely dealt with. “Hence, my humble request to you all is to be loyal and honest in your service to the people,” President Sirisena said.
The President said that he has been regaining the image of Sri Lanka in foreign countries that was tarnished by the previous government and he has taken all measures to strengthen rapport with other nations.
He added that Sri Lanka was in the bad books of more than 200 countries and only five were in favour of us. This was due to the corruption, malpractice and other unlawful activities prevalent in the country during the previous regime.
President Sirisena also revealed a ‘dream’ he had for Sri Lanka and said that he would be the happiest person if this dream becomes a reality. “We Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims in this country should join hands and work together as brothers and sisters forgetting all communal and petty differences and be patriotic citizens of this beautiful country.”
Former minister Athaullah, in his speech, said that Ampara District consists of all three communities who are living together peacefully. The sacred Deegawapiya Dagoba in Addalaichenai Divisional Secretariat area was protected by the Muslims from the LTTE during the war. “We have common problems and individual problems and I appealed to the President to look into these matters and he has assured his support all the times,” Athaullah said.
State Minister A.H.M. Fouzie, former provincial minister M.S. Uthumalebbe, former Akkaraipattu Mayor Athaullah Zackie and National Congress Propaganda Secretary M.M. Baheej also spoke.
At the conclusion of the programme, Athaullah presented a memento to President Srisena. State Minister Siriyani Wijewickrema, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray and Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama were also present.
