Large crowds expected at UNP May Day rally

A crowd of about 150,000 is expected at the UNP May Day rally at Campbell Park in Borella, UNP MP Nalin Bandara said.
It has been themed “May Day of the winning people”. MP Bandara said as estimated, a cost of about Rs 4.5 million would have to be spent for buses alone to transport people.
“We need about 3,000 buses to transport this crowd. Unlike the previous Government, we pay the CTB for all the buses used for the May Day rally,” he said. The Plantation Workers’ Congress led by Vadivel Suresh would also join hands with the UNP May Day rally. He assured the participation of over 5,000 plantation workers in the rally.
