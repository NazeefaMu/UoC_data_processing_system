UNP determined to abolish Executive Presidency: Harshana

 The UNP is bound and determined to abolish the Executive Presidency, UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna said.
"Abolishing the Executive Presidency, being one of the key issues on which the last presidential election was fought, we are obliged to keep the promise," he said.
He made these comments at a media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday.
"President Maithripala Sirisena at the Sri Dalada Maligawa and at the funeral of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhita Thera made an oath to abolish the executive presidency. He must abide by this," Rajakaruna said.
Asked on the SLFP claiming the opposite, Rajakaruna said those ministers have not properly gone through 'Maithree Palanayak'.
"Even though certain SLFP ministers claim their personal views on abolishing the executive presidency, the SLFP as a political party has not made such an announcement," he said. "It was the UNP that prepared the manifesto along with the President. This is why we introduced the 19th amendment to the constitution." he said.
Speaking on the restoration of GSP+, UNP MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi said the Joint Opposition is trying to diminish the importance of the facility. "The Joint Opposition wants to make people forget as to why we lost the GSP+ facility in the first place. It is because of the single-minded Rajapaksa regime that we lost it. We only have to restore what the previous government did not, such as, good governance, media freedom, democracy and sustainable development," Hettiarachchi said. Hettiarachchi said the Joint Opposition was trying to come up with groundless allegations to mislead the people that the GSP+ facility as unworthy. "There is no such thing as 50 or so conditions laid out by the EU. What they refer to is about the 27 conventions that Sri Lanka as a country have already signed to." Hettiarachchi said. The Yahapalana government will not give into unfair international demands or let the country be separated, he said. "We shall not allow anything that will harm the culture and values of the people of this country." Hettiarachchi said. He said the Joint Opposition is on a mission to rescue individuals involved in crimes and corruption.
