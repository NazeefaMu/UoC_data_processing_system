Five cricketers who have scored the most Test centuries at a single venue

Cricket is always characterized by numbers, stats, and figures. The dominance of a team, the greatness of a batsman, and the impact of a bowler is asserted through the numbers they have racked up over the years.
While perusing through the career of a batsman, the number of runs he scored in different countries and continents is always an important factor to consider. Some men tend to perform well at home, while others show their ability on away tours.
However, in some special cases, a particular batsman tends to find a mysterious affinity with a single venue. He does not know how to fail there and almost every time he takes the field there, he churns out admirable performances.
Let us take a look at five such cricketers who have scored the most Test centuries at a single venue:
MICHAEL CLARKE: ADELAIDE OVAL, 7 CENTURIES
Michael Clarke’s name will always be remembered fondly in Australian cricket.
The young prodigy of the golden era of the Kangaroos, Clarke was a part of the team that conquered the world and also the team that fell through the ranks, a few years later.
However, he captained his country to glory once again and took his team to the World Number 1 ranking in Test cricket and clinching the ICC World Cup in 2015.
The Pup was particularly fond of the Adelaide Oval, where he scored as many as seven Test centuries. In the 17 innings that he has played on the ground, he has crossed at least 50 runs on ten occasions.
The former Australian skipper has an extraordinary batting average of 94.29 at the venue and has also scored two double centuries there in a single year - 230 against South Africa and 210 against India in 2012.
KUMAR SANGAKKARA: SINHALESE SPORTS CLUB GROUND, 8 CENTURIES
This left-hander arguably is the greatest Test batsman produced by Sri Lanka.
His enviable record in the longest format of the game is awe-inspiring and his immense contribution to Sri Lankan cricket is now part of a phenomenal legacy.
Kumar Sangakkara finds the fourth place on this list with eight Test centuries at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo.
In the 34 innings that he has played at the venue, he has scored 50 or more runs on fifteen occasions.
The former Sri Lankan batsman has three double centuries to his name on this ground and has maintained an impressive average of 74.58 there.
His last innings at the SSC came in August 2014, wherein he managed to shine once again, scoring 59 from 130 deliveries to contribute to a Sri Lankan win against Pakistan.
JACQUES KALLIS: NEWLANDS CRICKET GROUND, 9 CENTURIES
The highest score of the former South African cricketer’s international career came at Newlands
In the wake of the ball-tampering scandal in the second match of South Africa- Australia Test series, the NCG in Cape Town has been getting a lot of the negative spotlight recently. However, the ground has seen some incredible cricket through the years and has been privy too numerous superlative knocks.
Jacques Kallis, arguably the greatest cricketing all-rounder of all time, stands third on this list with nine hundreds at this venue. He has scored 2181 runs in Cape Town with a batting average of 72.70, which is bolstered by 18 fifty-plus scores from him.
The highest score of the former South African cricketer’s international career came at Newlands, where he played a match-winning knock of 224 against Sri Lanka in 2012.
DON BRADMAN: MELBOURNE CRICKET GROUND, 9 CENTURIES
The Don’s record at the Melbourne Cricket Ground tells an astonishing tale. Whenever international batting records are discussed and dissected, the name of the great Donald Bradman has to pop into the conversation somewhere along the way. His unquenchable thirst for runs and incomprehensible talent saw him set some incredible batting records, some of which may always remain unbreachable in the history of the sport.
His record at the Melbourne Cricket Ground tells an astonishing tale: 11 matches, 1671 runs and 9 Test centuries. For someone whose career batting average stands at 99.94, Bradman outdid even himself at the MCG, with a peerless average of 128.53 and the highest score of 270 in the 1937 Ashes.
His last match in Melbourne came against India back in 1948, where he captained the hosts to a victory by an innings and 177 runs. The legendary batsman also contributed 7 unbeaten runs with the willow in the game to cap an incredibly successful stint for him at the MCG.
MAHELA JAYAWARDENE: SINHALESE SPORTS CLUB GROUND, 11 CENTURIES
The two gems of Sri Lankan cricket, Mahela Jayawardene and Sangakkara, have scored as many as 19 centuries between them at a single venue. That, in itself, is the ultimate testament to their unmatchable endowment as a pair to the longest format of the game.
Jayawardene sits at the apex of this list comfortably with 11 Test centuries at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo. With his calm disposition and elegant strokeplay, the right-hander accumulated 2921 runs at this ground with an average of 74.89 in 42 innings. The highest Test score of his career also came at the SSC, when he smashed 374 runs past the Proteas in July 2006.
It will always be an incredibly special venue for the former Sri Lankan skipper: not only because he boasts of a fantastic record there but also because he played the last match of his career at the SSC. In his last batting innings, he scored 54 against Pakistan to play a vital role in Sri Lanka’s victory in the game. - SK
