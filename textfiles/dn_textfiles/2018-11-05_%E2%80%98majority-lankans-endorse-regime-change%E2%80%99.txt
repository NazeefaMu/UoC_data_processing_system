‘Majority of Lankans endorse regime change’

Kelaniya University Prof. Ven. Nabiriththankadawala Gnanarathana Thera said that majority of Sri Lankans had endorsed the decision taken by President Maithripala Sirisena for a regime change.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo, yesterday, Ven. Gnanarathana Thera said it was the same kind of change that people expected in 2015. “We endorse this change with the blessings of the bhikkhu community led by the Maha Sanga,” he said.
That was why people volunteered to help the move by reducing three-wheeler fares and prices of bakery items. The stock market had also shown significant improvement and only the international community had rejected the change, the thera added.
People said that President Sirisena had played a neutral role, allowing the United National Party (UNP) to govern the country as it wished for the past three-and-a-half years; but the President was under severe pressure and did not act to betray the UNP, even though UNPers were involved in campaigns against him, Ven. Gnanarathana Thera said.
“People were fed up with the deteriorating national prestige, hunting down of war heroes, destruction of archaeological artifacts, and sidelining of the Maha Sangha during the previous regime. All these reasons resulted in him taking the a wise decision to save the country and its people,” he added.
Just like all political parties and other factions which came forward to support Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to end the war when he was President in 2009, everyone should rally round the government to resolve the issues related to the economic recession and foreign influences, he said.
The thera added that the Yahapalana government, which came into power promising the elimination of fraud and corruption, ended up engaging in malpractices itself.
Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya Registrar Ven. Dr. Pallekande Rathnasara Thera said that the public’s confidence in the Yahapalana government had broken down. The country marched towards Western colonialism by neglecting the values of the nation.
“We were shocked when archaeological artifacts were destroyed and war heroes were taken into custody. The President was viewing this situation for a long time with patience and took a brave decision at the right time,” he said.
Matara Weherahen Temple Chief Incumbent Ven. Kegalle Ratanasara Thera said people were under pressure due to the escalating prices of essential commodities, the drug menace, as well as the crime wave that had been prevalent for the past three years.
He added that although the public initially had hope in the UNP administration, at the end of three-and-a-half years, they had become desperate. For a long time the President waited for the UNP administration to chose the right path, but he recently understood that it would never happen.
Shanthi Foundation Anushasaka Ven. Kotapola Amarakiththi Thera said the Portuguese and the English wanted to subject the country to colonialism, adding that the former Prime Minister attempted to repeat history.
The Buddha had said that a leader should review situations and act cautiously. The public came to understand that the regime should be changed and that is why the President took the decision in due course, Ven. Hegoda Vipassi Thera said.
