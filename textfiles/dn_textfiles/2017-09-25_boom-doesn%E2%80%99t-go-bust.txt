Boom doesn’t go bust

Wednesday is World Tourism Day. Ever since its inception the event is celebrated on September 27 to foster awareness among the international community of the importance of tourism and its social, cultural, political and economic value. As the official day set aside in the United Nations calendar the celebration seeks to highlight tourism’s potential to contribute to reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), addressing some of the most pressing challenges society is faced with today.
The main income sources
This year, the world will celebrate the occasion with a common theme with the focus on ‘Sustainable Tourism – a Tool for Development.’ As in the past the event also stresses the international significance of aiming to push tourism towards becoming a global industry. Tourism has experienced continued growth and deeper diversification to become one of the fastest growing economic sectors in the world. Modern tourism is closely linked to development and includes more new destinations for visitors. Tourism has become one of the major players in international commerce and represents at the same time one of the main income sources for many developing countries. These dynamics have turned the industry into a key driver for socio-economic progress. For our tropical island nation such an event is all the more important to facilitate showcasing the famous Sri Lankan hospitality in the ambiance of a peaceful environment. That is because tourism which was once among our principal foreign exchange earners was dealt a lethal blow by the prolonged secessionist war. The industry was on its knees, suffering a life threatening crisis. Its infrastructure development was brought to a screeching halt. Tourists naturally gave the country a wide berth in the wake of a wave of terrorist bombings. The gruesome scenes of carnage broadcast in the international media stopped even the most intrepid foreign visitors in their tracks.
The empty hotels and hostelries remained in forlorn neglect as testimony to the sad state of the bad times they had fallen on. For thousands who were engaged in the industry the future seemed an extremely bleak one. Clearly, it seemed that it would be only a matter of time before the prevailing visitor drought sounded the death knell for the hospitality sector.
The pessimism was not unfounded because the industry seemed dead and as extinct as the Dodo. And they would have been right because no one had predicted a decisive end to the long drawn out conflict. But now eight years after the terrorist threat was wiped off the face of our nation, the industry is experiencing a miraculous resurrection. Indeed, Sri Lanka’s tourist arrivals have been continuing to grow sharply after the 30-year conflict ended. It is not only alive and kicking in a peaceful environment, but showing signs of heading for an unmatched surge in attracting holiday-makers. More than two million visitors now head to our tiny Indian Ocean island every year, more than four times the number that came in 2009.
An expansion
Arrivals have been rising every month on a year-on-year basis since the war ended in May 2009. And the government has launched several ambitious projects and promotional campaigns to achieve targeting an annual revenue of US$2.5 billion by 2016 from 2.5 million expected visitors coming to take in our beaches, hill resorts and religious and historic sites.
The year has already witnessed a boom in the tourism industry and the authorities are confident that the new initiative would further spur the activity and benefit the reviving nation. Sri Lanka’s tourist arrivals rose 2.5 percent in August this year compared to the same period last year, surpassing the 1.4 million arrivals for the year, data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) revealed. The month recorded 190,928 tourists arriving in the country compared to the 186,288 arrivals in August 2016. In the first eight months of this year 1,406,854 tourists visited the island compared to the 1,359,906 visited in August 2016, recording an increase of 3.5 percent.
Tourism is the world’s largest export, yet it is ephemeral, produced within an encounter, usually fleeting, between host and guest. It has enormous growth potential and almost every country desires an expansion in this sector. The industry can provide the ideal export for developing countries, such as ours, which can avoid debt by capitalising on what we already have. No one can deny that we have a unique culture, a singular natural environment and a definite place in world history. However, this would mean a huge expense in infrastructure such as major sanitation facilities, local transportation, hydroelectric plants, medical facilities, and hotels.
Over the decades, tourism has experienced continued growth and deepening diversification to become one of the fastest growing economic sectors in the world. Modern tourism is closely linked to development and encompasses a growing number of new destinations. These dynamics have turned tourism into a key driver for socio-economic progress.
Becoming the forerunner
Today, the global business volume of tourism equals or even surpasses that of oil exports, food products or vehicles. The sector has become one of the major players in international commerce and represents at the same time one of the main income sources for many developing countries. This growth goes hand in hand with economic and employment benefits.
This world-wide spread of tourism in industrialised and developed states has produced large scale economic and employment benefits in many related sectors - from construction to agriculture and telecommunications. There is no doubt that pent-up demand for Sri Lanka as a hot-spot destination, which has been inaccessible for many years, is driving growth.
Undeniably there are still varied challenges ahead to catch up with our competitors and thrust the industry into becoming the forerunner of our economy. Many neighbouring nations possess similar tropical attractions. Several other countries in the Asian region are blessed with the allure of intriguing paradise isles complete with warm seas and sunny beaches. They have all launched inventive promotional campaigns to sell themselves as prime holiday destinations. All these nations boast international hotel brands which naturally attract high-spending tourists.
But Sri Lanka has far more going for it in the sphere of tourist attractions including remnants of its magnificent civilisation, artistic monuments and an incredible diversity of landscapes, climates and unique flora and fauna. Yet these resources and present boom patterns can and must be translated into long-term sustainable growth to propel our tourism sector to be in the forefront of our economy. [email protected]
