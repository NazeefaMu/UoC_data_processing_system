Luca’17 celebrates Green Commerce

The Commerce Society of Ananda College, Colombo unveiled its Commerce Day, Luca’17, aimed at promoting a Green Society within schools in Sri Lanka, on October 24 at the Kularatne Hall. The event, originally scheduled to be held on October 17 but delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, was sponsored by EduLink Campus.
It was based on two categories: intra-school and inter-school. With respect to the former category, Luca’17 involved a quiz competition, a live marketing campaign, and a scriptwriting competition, finalised on Friday, September 29. They were followed by a plantation rehabilitation and renovation drive within the Commerce section at Ananda. With respect to the latter category, attended by around 30 schools, it was preceded by another quiz competition and live marketing campaign, as well as a Sinhala and English Oratory competition, finalised on Wednesday, October 4 at the Kularatne Hall. Bandaranayake College, Gampaha emerged as Champions, with Lyceum International School, Nugegoda as Runners-Up and Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda as Second Runners-Up. All three schools were subsequently tasked with preparing a presentation revolving around the theme of sustainability and the commercialisation of Sri Lankan society.
Luca’17, the Commerce Day of Ananda College, was attended by around 35 schools. The Chief Guest for the event was Tharindu Dananjaya, Senior Lecturer at the University of Kelaniya. Luca’17 was spruced up with various skits, involving the Drama Society and the Dancing Society of Ananda College as well as a musical performance by the school-based band Voltage, the latter headed by the incumbent President of the Commerce Society, Vimod Edirisinghe. Special plaques for students who had secured first and fourth places nationally in the Commerce Stream at 2016 GCE A/Levels were handed over, while three teachers who had served more than 10 years at Ananda, and who had been transferred to other schools, were duly and dutifully felicitated.
