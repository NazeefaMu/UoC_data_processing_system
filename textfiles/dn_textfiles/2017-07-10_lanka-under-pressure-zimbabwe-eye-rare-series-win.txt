Lanka under pressure as Zimbabwe eye rare series win

HAMBANTOTA: Initially it was the fielding and now it is poor bowling that is letting Sri Lanka down as they face a challenging task of trying to win the five-match One-Day International series against Zimbabwe in the fifth and final game to be played at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium here in Sooriyawewa today.
After running up a total of 300-6, Sri Lanka looked capable of defending it and winning the fourth ODI played here on Saturday which would have given them a winning 3-1 lead in the series but instead they now face the task of having to beat Zimbabwe in today’s contest to secure the series that is vital for their rankings.

The intervention of rain that arrived quite unexpectedly coupled with sub standard bowling saw Zimbabwe win under the Duckworth/Lewis rain rule and level the series 2-all going into today’s match.
“We actually didn’t know that the rain will come in. It was dry and we expected the wicket to turn as the day went on. We saw in the last game also that the ball started turning after 20 overs in the second session. So we thought that if we bat first and bat well we had the batters to do the job. Dick batted really well and Danushka gave us a good platform, but the bowling was once again very disappointing,” said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews.
“How many times can you lose a game after scoring 300 runs. We had enough runs on the board, unfortunately the rain intervened but we still had the attack to defend it. The first ten overs we gave away too many runs and then rain intervened and after the rain we didn’t bowl well we were well off the mark.”
The bowlers’ poor efforts on the field overshadowed the brilliant batting of openers Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka who became the first opening pair in ODI cricket to share successive double century partnerships. Following the defeat Mathews said that his team was now under pressure to win the final match and the series.
“I am under pressure as captain. We batted well but the bowling has been disappointing in both games we lost. Our fielding too has been disappointing. We should have played better. If we can’t defend 300 there’s something wrong,” said Mathews.
“We are sloppy with our fielding and the consistency is not there. In bowling also there are huge problems. Suranga Lakmal and Nuwan Pradeep are both unwell. Why we lost was because our bowling was weak.”
We don’t whether it was through sheer frustration that Mathews made the remark, “I don’t know whether I will be captain till 2019.”
Sri Lanka Cricket has made him captain till the 2019 World Cup but the way things are panning out Mathews must be one of the most dissatisfied captain’s in the world when his team is not performing to expectations. Meanwhile Zimbabwe has given themselves an outside chance to win their first ODI series against Sri Lanka.
“We have had a few good games but nothing like this. A series win would be excellent for us. To beat a top team like Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka will be huge for us,” said Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer.
“I think we’ve achieved more than expected. Sri Lanka is a tough place to tour. It’s hard to win against Sri Lanka who play so well at home. I would say it’s unexpected. They are a very hard team to beat at home but credit to our guys for sticking with it in a tough series.
“They probably didn’t expect this. We believe that we could achieve. I assume the pressure is more on them because they were expected to beat us. We won’t take any pressure into the final match. We will take the confidence from this game. The confidence is pretty high for us,” he said. - ST
