UNOPS, UN-Habitat to build 25,000 houses for war-affected

Cabinet approval was granted this week to enter into a MoU with UNOPS and UN-Habitat to build 25,000 houses for families affected by the conflict in the North and East.
On May 22, the Cabinet granted approval for brick and mortar houses to be built for affected families. A Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee (CANC) and Project Committee (PC) were appointed to study the proposal submitted by UNOPS and UN-Habitat-led non-profit oriented humanitarian organizations consortium for the construction of 25,000 houses under phase-1 in the Northern and Eastern Provinces with financing arrangements.
The CANC with the PC has deemed their proposal acceptable.
Each house would cost Rs. 1,246,435 million without VAT and NBT and Rs. 1,458,328 million with VAT and NBT according to the proposal.
The building of 15,000 houses would commence in 2018 and the balance 10,000 houses will be substantially completed by the end of 2019.
UNOPS will build 17,000 housing units and UN-Habitat will build 8,000 units.
