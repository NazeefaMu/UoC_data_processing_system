Ravi under a cloud

The conduct of former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake who is now Foreign Minister is looming as the greatest crisis faced by the National Unity government following revelations made at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Central Bank Bond sale.
Giving evidence before the Commission two weeks ago, Anika Wijesuriya, daughter of businessman Nahil Wijesuriya was to reveal that an apartment owned by her was rented by the Karunanayake family for whom the rent was paid by Arjun Aloysius.
Family’s transactions
Aloysius is the son-in-law of Arjuna Mahendran, the former Governor of the Central Bank under whose tenure the controversial sale of Central Bank bonds occurred. Aloysius is also a Director of Perpetual Treasuries Limited, the company at the centre of the controversial sale.
Following the explosive testimony from Wijesuriya, the Commission of Inquiry summoned Foreign Minister Karunanayake to give evidence. The Minister took his time to appear before the Commission. When he eventually did, last Wednesday, he was grilled for over five hours.
Minister Karunanayake’s stance at the Commission centred on one theme. That was to say that he was unaware of the transactions entered into by his wife and family. Had he been aware of Aloysius’s involvement in renting the property he lived in, he wouldn’t have allowed it, Karunanayake said. The Minister’s position has been greeted with widespread scepticism, both publicly and in private. Social media has been awash with posts lampooning Karunanayake for his ‘I didn’t know’ stance, claiming that he was unaware of his wife’s transactions running into more than ten million rupees.
Since then, there has been a great deal of political activity surrounding the issue. The Joint Opposition (JO) has taken the lead in submitting a motion of no confidence against Minister Karunanayake. The signatories to the motion are from the JO. The motion has been submitted to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
On Tuesday, Speaker Jayasuriya noted that objections have been raised against the motion on the grounds that the matter under discussion is an ongoing probe before a Commission of Inquiry and hence sub judice. Speaker Jayasuriya has said he will make a ruling on the matter today (Thursday).
In the meantime, calls have been growing for Minister Karunanayake’s resignation. These calls have come not only from the JO and other parties in the opposition but also from within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and even sections of the United National Party (UNP) itself.
Karunanayake’s resignation
Opposition stalwarts such as Dinesh Gunawardena, Bandula Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and G L Peiris have been vocal in calling for Minister Karunanayake’s resignation. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has also called for the Minister to step down.
There had been some speculation that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had refrained from signing the motion of no-confidence against Karunanayake. However, Rajapaksa publicly declared that he had no qualms about voting against the Minister when it is put to a vote in Parliament.
“I would cast my vote gladly not only against Ravi Karunanayake but also against the present Government. This is the first time I’m going to vote in Parliament after this Government was elected to office,” Rajapaksa stated at a public meeting, quashing speculation that he was evading the issue.
The SLFP Ministers have taken the lead from within the government in calling for Karunanayake to step down. Minister S B Dissanayake called on the President and the Prime Minister to “take a decision” as he feared the issue would damage the dignity of the government and even lead to public unrest.
Minister Susil Premajayantha was to note that the peoples’ confidence in the Foreign Minister had been shattered due to the alleged controversial transaction that had occurred when he was the Minister of Finance. It would affect his duties in international matters as well, Premajayantha observed.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera who had been lampooned for mispronouncing the Royal College motto ‘Disce aut Discede’ used the same phrase - pronounced correctly - to suggest that Karunanayake, an old Royalist, should resign. ‘In the language of Royalists, he should learn or depart,’ Jayasekera said.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera was to suggest that a motion of no confidence against Karunanayake will not be required. Amaraweera said he did not believe that anybody would have to bring in a no-confidence motion. “What has to be done would be done before that,” Minister Amaraweera said.
Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena was more direct in his observations. President Maithripala Sirisena may remove Minister Karunanayake if he does not resign over revelations uncovered by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond scam, Abeywardena was to declare.
The Minister went so far as to say that President Sirisena is likely to take a decision on Karunanayake within the next two weeks. “If found innocent, Karunanayake can always come back,” Abeywardena suggested and cited the resignation of E L Senanayake from J R Jayewardene’s Cabinet in the 1980s.
It is understood that the UNP ministers are dismayed with the current circumstances they find themselves in. They fear that with Local Government and Provincial Council elections due soon, the ongoing developments could cause irreparable damage to the party’s prospects at the polls.
Minister Daya Gamage said he personally believed it was appropriate for Minister Karunanayake to quit his portfolio until his innocence was proved in the allegations against him. “Such a decision on the part of the Minister will be good for the party,” Gamage, the National Organiser of the UNP, said.
Minister Sajith Premadasa was not quite as forthcoming but has declared that he would resign from the Cabinet if he is asked to “vote for corrupt people”. At the height of the UNP’s leadership crisis in December 2011, Premadasa contested Karunanayake for the Deputy Leader’s post and won.
Initially, media reports suggested that President Maithripala Sirisena had met Karunanayake at a ceremony to mark Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s 40 years as a parliamentarian and suggested that he should resign. Karunanayake was to vehemently deny these reports.
It was however reported that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe did meet with Karunanayake. The sentiments of a group of UNP parliamentarians, who believe that Karunanayake should resign to limit the political damage that the Bond issue is causing the party, would have been conveyed to him.
UNP stalwarts
Many ministers in the government feel Karunanayake’s position in the government is untenable- at least until the Commission of Inquiry concludes and releases its findings. They cite the resignation of Tilak Marapone after he made a speech in Parliament defending a client of his in the House.
The UNP, in particular, has reason to be concerned. By not acting forthwith and stalling on the issue of Karunanayake’s resignation and, it is creating an impression that it is attempting to protect him, party stalwarts have noted. This is allowing the SLFP to take the moral high ground, they argue.
While the JO is happy to revel in Minister Karunanayake’s misery, it is indeed the SLFP faction of the government which stands to gain from the current situation, UNP ministers say. If the President was to sack Karunanayake instead of the minister resigning, it would jeopardise the UNP further, they say.
As such, UNP stalwarts would prefer to see Karunanayake resign, rather than dragging the UNP down with him. Thus far the beleaguered Foreign Minister has protested and remained defiant, arguing that he is entitled to the presumption of innocence until he is found guilty by a process of law.
The coming days would undoubtedly see more developments on this issue and the first step in that process is the motion of no-confidence in Parliament against Minister Karunanayake.
The government hopes it can avoid that because if it is put to the vote, even some UNPers may vote for it.
That can be prevented only if Ravi Karunanayake hands over his resignation. At the time of writing, that has not happened. Nevertheless, what is certain is that the outcome of this saga will have a bearing on the prospects of both the UNP and, by extension, the SLFP, at the forthcoming elections.
