Actress fined for ‘Expressway dance’ posted on Youtube

Teledrama actress Menaka Madhuwanthie was found guilty of driving a car recklessly on the Southern Expressway and was fined.
She had disengaged her hands from the steering wheel in the moving car to perform a dance act. The passenger in the box seat had video filmed her act and released it on Youtube. A person who watched it on internet had complained to the Southern Expressway authorities who had taken legal action against her after establishing its truth.
She was fined Rs 5,000 by the Bandaragama Circuit Magistrate recently.
