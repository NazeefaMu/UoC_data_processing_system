Ambanganga bridge submerged

The Ambanganga bridge across the Naula-Opalgala road completely submerged after the Mahaweli Authority Water Management Unit opened the spill gates of the Bowatenna reservoir on Wednesday.
Opalgala, Moragolla, Galaboda and Senagama were blocked and several schools were closed.
The unit has opened the spill gates of the Bowatenna Reservoir to supply water from the Bowatenna reservoir to the Ambanganga, Technical Engineer M.H.N.G. Bandara said. The Dambulla Kandalama Mahaweli reservoir overflowed and the authorities opened its gates as well.
