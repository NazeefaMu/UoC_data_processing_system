UCL holds inaugural scholarship awards ceremony

Universal College Lanka (UCL) held its first scholarship awards ceremony recently to recognise and felicitate deserving students who have excelled in the spheres of academia, sports and leadership at school level or achieved outstanding results in the UCL Foundation programs.
The Chief Guest, Director, UCL and Chairman of the Gateway Group of Organisations, Dr. Harsha Alles along with the CEO, UCL Gihan Silva, COO, UCL Nishani De Silva, Dean of Academic Affairs, UCL, Dr. Dhananjay Kulkarni and other distinguished guests including Warden, S. Thomas’ College, Rev. Marc Billimoria and Principal, Colombo South International, Mr. Richmond Suraweera, graced this event.
A total of 47 UCL scholarships were awarded in 2018. The recipients represented the Monash University Foundation Year (MUFY), Monash College Diploma (MCD) and University of Lancashire (UCLan) Degree programs.
This scholarship initiative is in keeping with the vision of UCL’s founders, Bob Kundanmal, Dr. Harsha Alles and Zarif Munir, who established UCL to make the very best in international tertiary education accessible to the youth of Sri Lanka.
UCL is committed to providing tertiary education of the highest quality and has garnered a proven track record of academic excellence in the past three years. These scholarships are considered a ‘mutual investment’ whereby students of the highest calibre will be attracted to UCL, encouraged to maintain the high standards the college has become known for, and reach their full potential.
It is a great privilege to be able to study at UCL since it is an organization that delivers internationally recognized degrees from universities such as Monash which is ranked in the world top one hundred and is part of the prestigious Group of Eight universities in Australia. And, I consider it a greater honour to be awarded a scholarship which enables me to pursue my dreams and goals for a secure academic future.
