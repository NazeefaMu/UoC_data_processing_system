WPC members browse social media during budget

Members of the Western Provincial Council (WPC) were caught watching various videos and browsing through social media sites on their newly fixed screens at the recently built Council chambers as Chief Minister and Finance, Planning and Local Government Minister Isuru Devapriya presented the Financial Statement for 2019 yesterday.
The newly built WPC building houses a state-of-the-art Council equipped with tabs at each desk which allows the councillor to browse the internet and communicate with other members of the House.
The complex on Denzil Kobbekaduwa Mawatha was built at a cost of Rs 6.1 billion and it not only has a Parliament-style chamber to hold council meetings but will also house all the ministries of the WPC government.
Members from both the Government and Opposition indulged themselves with watching videos and at times, some even interrupted sessions while playing videos.
A handful used it to take notes and watch Parliamentary sessions.
