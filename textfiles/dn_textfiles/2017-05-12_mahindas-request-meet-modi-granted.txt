Visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at ‘India House’ in Colombo at the request of the latter in an off-the-itinerary meeting late Thursday night.
Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu told the media that the talks had been “cordial and friendly” and lasted for over a half an hour.
Subsequent to the meeting former President Rajapaksa tweeted, “As always, a cordial meeting with PM Narendra Modi. Happy to see him in Sri Lanka for International Vesak Day Celebrations”.
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Podu Jana Peramuna Chairman and former Foreign Minister Prof G L Peiris had attended the meeting alongside with the former President, while Indian Premier Modi was accompanied with Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, and Indian Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar.
The hastily arranged meeting took place after the dinner hosted by President Maithripala Sirisena for the Indian Premier at the President’s House.
The High Commissioner said Rajapaksa thanked the Indian Premier over the Indian support to Sri Lanka over the past years as well as the present.
Sources close to the former President said economic and development cooperation between the two countries was discussed during the meeting.
