Forest clearing intensifies human-elephant conflict

Large scale clearing of jungle in the elephant habitat in Hambantota has led a herd of wild elephants to invade surrounding villages and terrorise villagers.
A herd of three wild elephants have been roaming in the Ridiyagama, Ambalantota, Godewaya, Beligalgoda, Welipatanwila, Puhujulgoda, Usangoda, Lunama and Kalametiya villages at various intervals making villagers panicky.
Wildlife Range Officer J. A. P. Wijayakumara said they are helpless as they cannot prevent the animals straying into villages when their traditional habitat is cleared for development and human settlement. They had been struggling day and night to chase the herd away into the jungle heartland last three days without success, he said.
