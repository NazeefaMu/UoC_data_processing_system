School band to present the Suraksha Insurance Policy

A school band in Colombo and suburbs and in the so called ‘affluent’ and ‘well-off’ schools will invariably consist of instruments such as bass drums, cymbals, trumpets, bugles and clarinets, flutes and even accordians that are part of the traditional Western Band as in these schools. However, it is not so for these little children of Anamaduwa Kedeththawa Primary College. They are welcoming Irrigation Water Resources and Disaster Management State Minister Palitha Range Bandara with the salutation of their ‘school band’ to present the Suraksha Insurance Policy for the children and the school prefects induction ceremony with a painted can used as the bass drum for this band.
