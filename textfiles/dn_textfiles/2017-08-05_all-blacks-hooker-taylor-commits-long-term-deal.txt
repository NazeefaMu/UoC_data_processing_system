All Blacks hooker Taylor commits to long-term deal

Wellington: Codie Taylor has become the first All Black to sign a long-term contract to remain with New Zealand rugby through to 2021, and confirmed Friday he wants to play in three World Cups.
The 26-year-old hooker, who is currently in South Africa with the Canterbury Crusaders preparing for the Super Rugby final against the Golden Lions on Saturday, said he had no desire to take up an overseas contract.
"I feel like I am living the dream at the moment, raising my young family here in New Zealand and playing for these teams that I love, so recommitting through to 2021 just makes sense for me," said Taylor who recently became a father for the first time.
Taylor, who started all three Tests in the recent British and Irish Lions series while Dane Coles was sidelined with concussion symptoms, played one match in the 2015 World Cup against Namibia.
He told Fairfax media from Johannesburg he was targeting the 2019 World Cup in Japan and "thinking in the future I won't be too old for the next World Cup either. So, who knows what can happen next."
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen described Taylor, a great-great-grandson of 1893 All Black Walter Pringle, as an "outstanding" hooker who has "the skill-set and temperament to play at a world-class level".
While he is the first All Black to commit through to 2021, Sam Whitelock, Ben Smith and Anton Lienert-Brown are signed through to 2020.
Another 16 All Blacks have inked deals through to 2019 including captain Kieran Read, Owen Franks, Israel Dagg, Brodie Retallick, Aaron Smith, Dane Coles, Beauden Barrett and Sonny Bill Williams and Joe Moody. AFP
