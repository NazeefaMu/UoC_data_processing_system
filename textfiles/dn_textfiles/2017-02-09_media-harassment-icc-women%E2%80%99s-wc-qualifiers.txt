Media harassment at ICC Women’s WC qualifiers

The ICC women’s World Cup qualifiers that commenced in Sri Lanka to select four teams for the big event in England next June continues as an event that is not worthy of its name as an ICC status tournament when considering the facilities extended to the media personal.
Even though this is an international event, only one overseas journalist from India is present at the venues to cover the matches. The facilities provided to all media personal were very unsatisfactory.
According to the SLC sources they are not engaged with the organizing of this ICC event and the representative of ICC, Rajasekhar Rao, the officer in-charge of media personal was vehemently criticized for his inefficiency to provide facilities for media men. Being an experienced media-man Rao’s step-motherly treatment has not gone down well with the local media.
On the opening day, local photo journalists were not allowed to cover the matches inside the grounds and asked to capture pictures of the event from outside the ground. Due to this restriction only a few media-men were present to cover the match between Sri Lanka and India on Wednesday.
