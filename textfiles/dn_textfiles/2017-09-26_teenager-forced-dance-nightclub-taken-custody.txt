Teenager forced to dance at nightclub taken into custody

The Police yesterday took into custody a 15-year-old girl who was in employment at a nightclub in the Welikada area. The police said that the girl was forced to wear revealing clothes and dance at the night club.
The police further said that the girl would be admitted to a hospital for a medical checkup to find out whether she was subjected to sexual harassment.
Police said the victim was from the Dummalasooriya Police division.
They revealed that an 18-year-old girl who visited the victim’s house often had requested her parents to allow their daughter to attend one of her friend’s wedding. As their daughter failed to return at the promised time, the parents had complained to the Dummalasooriya Police. Police investigations revealed that the victim was taken to the Welikada nightclub in a vehicle from Dummalasooriya.
Dummalasooriya Police are carrying out a comprehensive investigation to arrest the 18-year-old girl and the driver of the vehicle in which the victim was taken to the Welikada club.
The victim had told Police that she was forced to dance wearing revealing clothes and added that she was forced to stay at the nightclub for four days from September 16 to 20. Police last Friday arrested five women on prostitution charges, three men for running a club without a license and 10 employees of the nightclub.
