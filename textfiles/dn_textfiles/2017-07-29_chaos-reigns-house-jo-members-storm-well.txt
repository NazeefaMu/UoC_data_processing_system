Chaos reigns in HOUSE: JO members storm well

Parliament sittings came to an abrupt end at 11.45 am yesterday as chaos reigned in Parliament when the Joint Opposition members swarmed the well of the house following a heated argument with government side members.
This is with the announcement to take the vote on the resolution under the Essential Public Services Act on making fuel distribution an essential service.
The arguments flared up as the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya called for a voting as a member was heard requesting for a division although it was not clear as to who made the request.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya adjourned sittings till August 4 as the Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando took the Mace for protection as Joint Opposition members stood around the mace.
However government side members said ‘Aye’ to pass the resolution before Parliament sittings adjourned.
At this occasion Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentary Group Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake rose to his feet and said the debate was adjourned the previous day as there were two government side members to make statements on the resolution.
“We want a clear statement from the government as to what government do in connection with the attack on the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation ( CPC) workers on Wednesday,” Anura Kumara Dissanayake. “Here are the pictures of attackers.What do you do to the Welikada OIC who assaulted a Provincial Council member? The Prime Minister or the Law and Order Minister should make a statement,” he said.
Joint Opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene said the government should respond to questions raised by the Opposition. Thereafter joint opposition members were seen coming into the well and walking towards the Speaker’s bench. Then Speaker Karu Jayasuriya asked if Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake will make a statement. The minister said that he would make a statement after the investigation was over. The Speaker then requested to calm down. “Please cooperate to continue proceedings?” the Speaker said. “You should not waste time and public funds. The division is asked for so the vote should be taken now”.
The quorum bell was rung and during the bell was being rung the argument continued.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who joined the cross talk insisted that no statements could be made when a vote is called for. “This will set a bad precedence.We cant allow it,”he said.
