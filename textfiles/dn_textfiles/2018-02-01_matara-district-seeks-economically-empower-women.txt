Matara District  seeks to economically empower women

Projects to economically empower women from low-income families in Matara District have begun at Divisional Secretariat level. Over 25 grama niladari areas from each of the four divisions - Matara, Weligama, Devinuwara and Dickwella - have been included in the programme.
Over 4,000 women including school leavers will benefit from this programme which will include skills development, vocational training and career guidance programmes. Those who successfully complete the programme would be provided with job opportunities in either the public or private sector. Facilities would also be made available to them to become self-employed, Matara District Institute for Development of Community Strengths Project Director Condrad Ranawake said.
Women will be provided with loan facilities to start small and medium-scale self-employment ventures, under this programme. Institute for Development of Community Strengths has also taken steps to direct select academically qualified young women for higher education and others to vocational and technical training colleges.
The European Union and Save the Children would assist and support these welfare programmes, Ranawake said.
