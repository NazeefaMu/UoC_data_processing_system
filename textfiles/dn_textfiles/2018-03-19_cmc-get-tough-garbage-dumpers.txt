CMC to get tough with garbage dumpers

The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) has sought assistance from the Police and the Military to nab those who dump garbage haphazardly at public places.
“Legal action will be taken against those who engage in illegal garbage dumping while violating waste management regulations imposed by the CMC, Colombo Municipal Council Acting Municipal Commissioner Eng. Lalith Wickremeratne said.
Wickremeratne also said the CMC would refrain from collecting non-segregated waste from today onwards.
Wickremeratne, responding to the Daily News, pointed out that an attitudinal change in people is in demand for a successful waste management system in the CMC as well as in the country.
He also pointed out that there is no issue relating to the disposing of segregated garbage.
“The segregated garbage is sent to compost yards managed by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry or the recycling projects,” he said.
“The problem is with the unseparated garbage. Even in the last few days, you may have noticed that garbage piled up in areas such as Maradana, Maligawatta, Borella, Dematagoda and Slave Island.
“Most of the people in these areas and the surroundings do not separate garbage before they dispose them. It is not fair to say that separating garbage into degradable and non degradable is a difficult task. Unfortunately, this matter rises not because of unawareness but because they don’t feel the need to execute these policies. The general public needs to realize that it is them who will have to endure the repercussions as well,” Wickramaratne further said.
