Purge the Gentleman’s game

Cricket in the countries played the world over has over recent times seen turbulence in its administration. Struggles to democratize, equalize representation, accountability, long term development, professionalize, stamp out nepotism, depoliticize etc. have all been causes in some form or another.
Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is worth US$ 295 million. India’s win of the 1983 world cup changed the fortunes of the Indian cricket. In 2008 the Indian Premier League or IPL started and the BCCI began to make more money.
Cricket South Africa (CSA) is the second richest, worth: US$ 69 million.
The Relevance of the ‘Public Function’ Test in Indian Constitutional Law
Under Articles 32 and 226, the Constitution authorizes access directly to the Supreme Court and High Courts for allegations of fundamental rights violations.
In Zee Telefilms v. Union of India, the Supreme Court distinguished Article 32 from Article 226 stating under Article 226 even if a body does not represent the ‘State’, it is susceptible to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court if it performs a ‘public function’.
The Court held that BCCI performs a public function and authorized fundamental rights violation claims to be brought against BCCI even though its legal status is only that of a ‘society’ registered under a statute.
The Court in Sukhdev v. Bhagatram analysed ‘state’ action and ‘private’ action stating “when given function is of public importance and closely related to governmental functions” or “activities which are too fundamental to the society” financial aid from government is not a prerequisite relying on case law from the United States Constitution on the same subject, including Marsh v. Alabama, New York v. United States and Nixon v. Condon.
Why does the BCCI perform a public function?
The BCCI formulates rules, regulations, norms and standards covering all aspect of the game of cricket. It enjoys the power of choosing the members of the national team and the umpires. It exercises the power of disqualifying players, which may at times put an end to the sporting career of a person. It spends tens of millions of rupees on building and maintaining infrastructure like stadia, running cricket academies and supporting State Associations.
The BCCI also frames pension schemes and incurs expenditures on coaches, trainers and team staffs. It sells broadcast and telecast rights and collects admission fees to venues where the matches are played. All these activities are undertaken with the tacit concurrence of the State Government and the Government of India which are not only fully aware but supportive of the activities of the BCCI.
Further, the Court also made a rather intriguing observation while concluding that the BCCI performs a public function:
Such is the passion for this game in this country that cricketers are seen as icons by youngsters, middle aged and the old alike. Any organisation or entity that has such pervasive control over the game and its affairs and such powers as can make dreams end up in smoke or come true cannot be said to be undertaking any private activity.
Intervention of the Indian Supreme Court May 2013-January 2017
The arrest of S Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila (all Rajasthan Royals’ players) revealed a nexus between bookies, players and franchise members. CSK team principal, Meiyappan was arrested after being questioned for spot-fixing charges. To further investigate the spot-fixing scandal and to a matter of BCCI, Supreme Court appointed a committee headed by Justice Mukul Mudgal. The Supreme Court appointed another panel headed by Justice (Retd) RM Lodha to determine punishments for those found guilty in IPL spot-fixing scandal. The Lodha panel was also tasked to suggest reforms for BCCI.
The Lodha panel recommendations
The Committee – in which Lodha was aided by retired Supreme Court judges R Raveendran and Ashok Bhan –suggested several reforms that aim to shake up the power structure in the board and redistribute power more equitably among officials, state representatives and also future administrators, as election of office-bearers was also a subject of review.
* States would be limited to one cricketing body or association for representation on the BCCI electorate, only members of the board with a defined territory would be full members. Non-territorial members – such as Railways, Services and All India Universities – would be limited to associate status with no voting rights. Multiple members from the same state would also be limited to associate status.
* To improve transparency, the recommendation of three new independent officials was also made. These include an ombudsman (the already-appointed Justice AP Shah, selected by the BCCI in November 2015), an ethics officer and an election officer.
* A nine-person Apex Council. This would include representatives from amongst the players themselves, establishment of players’ associations, whose members would be Indian internationals and several first-class cricketers who retired not sooner than five years ago. Office holders to undergo review of eligibility criteria and tenure. Individuals barred from holding positions on the board would include ministers and bureaucrats currently holding office, those holding positions in various state associations and those above the age of 70.Fo that BCCI clout may be lost
* Five elected members on the Board – a president, a vice-president, a secretary, a joint secretary and a treasurer. These persons would serve a maximum of three terms of nine years apiece, with no person permitted to serve two consecutive terms.
* Nomination of a Comptroller and Auditor General to check the exercise of the Board’s monetary muscle, restricting the power of the president (for example, eliminating the president’s involvement in team selection) whilst granting power, permitting the board to decide its own broadcasting policy and contracts.
* The court has also directed the Parliament to decide the matter of legalising betting and placing the BCCI under the ambit of the Right to Information (RTI).
* The panel also suggested to set up a separate players’ associations (men and women).
Lodha panel had given BCCI time till January 31 to get back with suggestions, but they did not. The SC gave the board a deadline till March 3 to respond to guidelines suggested by Lodha panel. In a 55-page counter-affidavit submitted in the court, BCCI stated that it partially accepted some of the reforms, but had concerns on many of the recommendations presented by the Lodha panel. The Supreme Court criticised BCCI’s method of disbursing funds to state associations saying it was being done without any particular mechanism. During this particular hearing, the court also turned down BCCI’s request to review one-state-one-vote recommendation made by Lodha panel. The Supreme Court observed that the BCCI’s constitution was incapable of achieving the values of transparency, objectivity and accountability. While hearing a matter related to implementation of Lodha reforms by BCCI, the Supreme Court said: “The inherent constitution of the BCCI is such that it is highly incapable of achieving the values of transparency, objectivity and accountability (such) that without changing its structure it can’t be done so.”
Lodha Committee asked the Supreme Court to direct the “immediate” supercession of the current BCCI top brass for blatant violations of the July 18 Supreme Court judgment directing them to implement the panel’s recommendations for transparency in cricket administration.
Referring to Justice RM Lodha’s suggestion to remove BCCI’s top brass, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India TS Thakur blasted the cricket board. “BCCI thinks they are a law unto themselves. They are wrong. You behave like lords. Fall in line or else we will BCCI rejected some of the Supreme Court’s key recommendations aimed at administrative reform.
BCCI after an emergency meeting decided to distribute Rs 1,100 crore to state associations. But on learning the development, Lodha panel stepped in and asked the banks to stop disbursing money to state associations. BCCI president Anurag Thakur told in a press conference that the third Test between India and New Zealand in Indore is in jeopardy because of this order. However, Justice Lodha himself clarified that banks will release funds required for daily operation of the board and the Indore Test doesn’t faces the threat of being called off.
The Supreme Court barred BCCI from releasing any funds to its state affiliates until they give an unconditional undertaking that they will comply with the organisational reforms as recommended by the Justice Lodha Committee.
The Supreme Court directed Thakur to file an affidavit and clarify whether he had asked the ICC to write that Lodha Recommendations amounted to government interference. This was reportedly claimed by ICC Chief Executive Dave Richardson in media interactions. Thakur had, according to International Cricket Council CEO Dave Richardson, asked the international cricket body chairman to furnish the Indian board with a letter that indicated the Supreme Court order was like government intervention.
The ICC does not allow government intervention in the functioning of its member boards and they could even be suspended. However, Thakur and BCCI have denied asking for any such letter from the ICC.
At a SGM, the BCCI agreed to implement some important recommendations but they remained defiant of some key reforms.
The members decided that the age restriction of 70 years for board officials, the tenure cap of nine years with cooling-off periods, and the one-state-one-vote policy, among others can’t be implemented.
After continued defiance, the RM Lodha committee recommended the sacking of all office bearers of the BCCI and its state associations. The Supreme Court suggested the appointment of former Home Secretary Gopal Krishna Pillai as an observer in the apex body. In a fresh status report filed to the Supreme Court, the panel asked that Pillai be appointed as observer with power to appoint an auditor, and guide the BCCI administration, particularly on the award of contracts and on transparency.
BCCI secretary Ajay Shirke said there was no change in their stand on the recommendations made by the RM Lodha Panel after a meeting. Only three state associations - Hyderabad, Vidarbha and Tripura - had agreed to implement the recommendations in full, while others rejected it.
Board of Control for Cricket(BCCI) president Anurag Thakur and secretary Ajay Shirke were removed by the Supreme Court in January for not complying with its order to implement administrative reforms within the body.
The Indian narrative is a fascinating account of the Supreme Court defining public functions, intervening in the affairs of the richest cricket board in the world involving a sport which captures the attention of a huge following and setting right anomalies in its administration.
