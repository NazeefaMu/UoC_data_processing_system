Delhi likely to lose World T20 semi-final match

 
The Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) is in the news again for all the wrong reasons, and it's likely that the semifinal clash of the ICC World Twenty20 2016 will be moved out of the Feroz Shah Kotla to some other venue.
The DDCA cannot sell tickets for the RP Mehra Block, which can accommodate close to 1800 spectators. "We were given time till Sunday evening to get clarity over RP Mehra block," said Ravinder Manchanda, the DDCA treasurer, on Sunday (March 20). "Since the case is in court, we have not got any clarity over the same.
"ICC wants to use that area for branding and also for seating purposes, since semifinal is a big game. We have not received an official word from BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) or ICC yet, but our deadline ended this evening."
The semifinal will be played on March 30. DDCA was in troubled waters over a number of issues, but got a go-ahead to host matches just before the tournament.
