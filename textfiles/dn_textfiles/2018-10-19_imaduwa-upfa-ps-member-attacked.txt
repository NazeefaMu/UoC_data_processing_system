Imaduwa UPFA PS member attacked

United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) member of the Imaduwa Pradeshiya Sabha A.G. Aruna was hospitalised after a group of members from the ‘Pohottuwa’ party assaulted him in a PS meeting yesterday.
Aruna was assaulted by the ruling party members of the Imadauwa PS when he entered the monthly meeting of the Sabha carrying an effigy of the PS Chairman.
Aruna was protesting against the activities of the Chairman and the ruling ‘Pohottuwa’ party claiming they have not done anything beneficial to the people in the area.
The PS member, according to sources, had been assaulted by several members of the ruling party and later he was seen lying in a corridor.
Several workers and members of the Sabha had called the 1990 ambulance service and Aruna was admitted to hospital.
