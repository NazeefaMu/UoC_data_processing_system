A quantity of 5 million currency notes would be issued and the serial numbers of the notes would be from S70/1 000001 – S70/5 1000000. The date on the note is 2018.02.04.
The currency note would be legal tender in Sri Lanka for the payment of any amount and would be a liability of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka whilst in circulation. The currency note was officially presented to Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera by Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy on January 30.
The commemorative currency note would be issued to circulation through licensed commercial banks, commencing from February 6. At the same time, a limited number of notes with early serial numbers, in an attractive folder, would be sold at a price of Rs. 1,300 each at the Economic History Museum at No. 54, Chatham Street, Colombo 1 and Central Bank Regional Offices at Anuradhapura, Matara, Matale, Trincomalee, and Kilinochchi.
