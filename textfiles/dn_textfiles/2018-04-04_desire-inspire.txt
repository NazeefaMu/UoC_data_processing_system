Desire to inspire

For Head Boy of Lyceum, Hemaka Gunasekera trust is a cornerstone of his leadership. Gunasekera calls those under him to have a sense of responsibility and value integrity. Perfect Prefects features Gunasekera a man of his word.
“A Head Prefect should take responsibility when a situation of difficulty arises. It calls for leadership skills. No matter how nervous or distressed you are you need to take responsibility. You have to take charge. When coming to a decision I will always think about it twice. If I am nervous I need a little bit of time to think about it. So I will come to a conclusion with my fellow Head Girl Budara Wickramasinghe,” said Gunasekera.
Street-mart
Gunasekera pointed out that the position of a leader is never easy. Whatever those under him do, he or she comes under criticism. Every mistake a person under his/her authority makes, falls on him/her.
“It is my responsibility not to make a mistake that might reflect badly on my boss. If I make a mistake I should take the full responsibility. It is a way of getting street- smart. I also believe in talking to my boss in a diplomatic and courteous way. It is a bit of a risk but it is worth it,” said Gunasekera
In this century there are so many stereotypes points out Gunasekera. There is a great need for men who are honest. He or she should be straightforward and someone who does not talk behind your back.
“Basically you need someone, who is entirely honest with you, pointing out your faults and what you have done correctly. He or she has to be authentic. And he or she needs to be credible. If there is a credibility I can say he is role model for me,” added Gunasekera.
Along with his sense of morality comes a conviction that one needs to go through a baptism of fire.
“In life, in order to change you need to be broken. In that sense, Lyceum has changed me so much. I started out as a very inexperienced character but I have matured ever since I took this position. I have made a lot of rash decisions and this year of prefect-ship has changed me a lot. There are excellent people in the management and staff that I can look up to and talk to,” explained Gunasekera
Make the change
Gunasekera’s dream is to be an entrepreneur because he has this desire to inspire people. Because inspiring people is what makes a change and making the change, is what this world needs says Gunasekera. You need to be strong to ignore what everyone is saying about you and be yourself.
“A leader needs to be confident and honest. You need to work hard no matter what anyone says about you, if it is a lie, ignore it and move on,” said Gunasekera
He believes that there should be more legitimate people in the world. People you can look up to and trust. The main goal any leader should have is for the progression of the country. Not for one individual or for a group of people. It should be for the country. Change starts within yourself.
“I feel there should be more understanding of each other. Society often rejects and corners people due to many reasons. It always happens. The change I would like to see is more acceptance of people. At the end of the day, we are humans regardless of how we appear. And we would like to be treated as humans. Racial discrimination, Gender Inequality and the Stereotypes is what really concerns me. If you do not live up to them some people reject you. And when people reject you it hurts. We are social creatures. We need acceptance. But if we want to work together and make the world a better place, people need to see each other as equals,” explains Gunasekera.
Also as leaders we should know where to draw the line and how to get the job done. This is something else he believes in. Too often we don’t know when enough is enough. Every problem you encounter you have to bring it out because the more you keep a problem within yourself it is going to hurt you.
Formulating plans
“Making a crucial decision is tough in life, because the moment you screw up, everyone is going to put the blame on you. People will point fingers at you so you need to think very carefully. Think about it, discuss it and formulate the plan. Budara and I never knew each other until we got this post and now we are great friends now,” said Gunasekera.
Head Girl of Lyceum Budara Wickramasinghe’s attitude is that adversity in life is actually an opportunity for one to acquire skills that will enable one to be a model citizen and also mould one’s character so that one may be of service to society and motherland.
“As Head Prefects me, and my fellow Head Boy Hemaka Gunasekera have to really take the plunge. As Heads, we have to take responsibility for the situation that requires immediate attention. Both of us collaborate with each other and talk about the situation and come to a conclusion. Because when we are under pressure, decision making is at its best when we take a decision together. Because then we present our different angles and viewpoints to each other and scrutinize and come up with the best decision possible,” said Wickramasinghe
This position itself is a role that prepares us for the workplace. The boss takes all the decisions and is responsible for the mistakes every worker makes.
“I believe it is my responsibility to do the task properly and hand the assignment over, so he or she will not be blamed, for what I have done. So I believe this position and this prefect-ship itself is a training platform. When you consider problems in a relationship, the best thing to do is to approach that person, and explain matters to him/her courteously so there won’t be a conflict in the future. It involves discussing pluses and minuses,” said Wickramasinghe.
We live in an age of great and rapid change. Now more than ever before the youth of this world are tested and need to prove themselves. The youth need to keep up with this rapid change.
“The 21st century has many demands. It is up to us to take action in response to an opportunity or crisis, and think properly before taking a decision. Because if a decision goes wrong at the end, you will not be able to fulfil your potential to be of service to others. You need to be a good citizen,” pointed out Wickramasinghe.
Fostered within
Being a good citizen is a belief that has been embedded in Wickramasinghe. These are values that have been fostered within her.
“From the day I joined this school it has provided me with a lot of opportunities. We are exposed to discussions about basic human values. This has taught us to be proper citizens. We are also educated on Effective Speech so we can speak confidently without being nervous. Since becoming Head Girl I have matured in so many ways. Truth, Love, Peace, Right Conduct and Non Violence are themes we are educated in. You should always speak the truth and be honest with people. When it comes to love, be caring for each other,” said Wickramasinghe.
Wickramasinghe’s ambition is to become a Chief Executive Officer of a company. She has the courage to make this dream come true. She has faith in herself and can face any situation no matter how tough it may be.
