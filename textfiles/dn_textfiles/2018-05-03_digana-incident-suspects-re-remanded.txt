The 27 suspects held in connection with three incidents which occurred during the turmoil in Digana and Moragahamula on March 4 and 5 were re-remanded till May 14 when they were produced before the Teldeniya Magistrate and District Judge M. H. Farikdeen by the Teldeniya Police yesterday.
The Teldeniya Police led by OIC Inspector R. M. S. Ranaweera and Sub Inspector Upali Chandrasiri objected to granting bail saying that investigations had still not been completed. Kundasale Pradesheeya Sabha SLPP Member Samantha Perera was allowed to attend the Pradesheeya Sabha sessions on May 9 escorted by prison officials.
After the Court order re-remanding the suspects, 26 of them were taken to the Pallekelle Dumbara remand prison while the other suspect, leader of the Mahasohon Balakaya Amith Weerasinghe was taken back to the Anuradhapura remand prison with heavy police escort. Relatives of the suspects were present in Court during the hearing while there was tight police security around the Court premises.
