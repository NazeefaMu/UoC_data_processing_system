‘Dialogue on lessons learnt – 2017’

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said, he strongly believes corruption can be minimized if women’s participation in Sri Lankan politics can be increased.
He was speaking at the progress review meeting on the North Eastern Local Services Improvement project (NELSIP) which was implemented under his Ministry for Provincial Councils and Local Government.
The review meeting, held under the theme ‘Dialogue on lessons learnt – 2017,’ was attended by representatives from the World Bank, the Australian High Commission, members of Local Authorities in relevant areas, and representatives from the construction companies attended this event.
“The most recognized barrier for the development of our country is corruption. If we could increase women’s participation in Sri Lankan politics, I believe that we will be able to control this issue,” he said.
The minister went on to say that fraud and corruption in institutions under the administration of women is comparatively lesser.
Speaking further at the event at Aliya Resort, Habarana, Minister Musthapha said, “We know that women have played a great role in the history of our country. They are intelligent. But during the past era, we couldn’t see much engagement of women in social activities, especially in politics. Compared to other countries, there’s a huge difference in women’s representation in politics in Sri Lanka. As I believe, the percentage of women’s participation in politics must be higher than this, especially as our country is a developing one, he added.
This programme was held for two days and the participants made discussions about implementing new programmes to achieve their new goals in development scheme.
The objective of this progress review meeting was to look into the services delivered in respective areas and to identify issues faced during the implementation of this project and to discuss the ways in which to overcome them. Secretary of the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government Kamal Pathmasiri, Australian Deputy Commissioner Michal Numan, Task Team Leader S. Manoharan, and Advisors from World Bank A. Ameen, M.D.A. Harald, and SarathWickremarathne attended this event.
