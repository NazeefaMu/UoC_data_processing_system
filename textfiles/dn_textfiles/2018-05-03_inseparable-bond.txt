Inseparable bond

A little over a week ago Colombo experienced two great cultures joining hands. The Japan Expo Sri Lanka 2018 Exhibition was held at the BMICH recently. Japan is a resilient country and its culture is rich and diverse. It is fitting that such an exhibition should take place as both our peoples are resilient and have emerged from a period of darkness. Japan showed tremendous courage and rebuilt their country and economy after the Hiroshima Nagasaki bombings and Sri Lanka ended its civil war nearly a decade ago. Both countries were hit by devastating Tsunami’s and have recovered. Therefore it is only natural that these two nations should join hands in a time of great political instability in other parts of our world. Perhaps this will serve as a reminder to all that ties of love are stronger than hate mongering.
Among the activities arranged were the Tea Ceremony, Ikebana, Sumo Wrestling and Japanese films.
The opening was attended by dignitaries who addressed the audience gathered and laid emphasis on the greatness of this event and its benefits.
Minister of Science, Technology and Research and Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Sarath Amunugama said that Sri Lanka and Japan have definitely been the best of friends even before the time we received independence.
Literacy rate
“Sri Lankans have been very interested in Japan and Japanese have been very interested in Sri Lanka. At the time of independence, commentators said that the two countries that have the greatest potential to develop were Japan and Sri Lanka. Both had a very high literacy rate. Both had a democratic government and both had leaders who knew each other. At the San Francisco conference, J R Jayewardene represented Sri Lanka at the conference. We were the only country in the whole world that said publicly – ‘We don’t want one yen of reparation from Japan. Japan is a friendly country and a Buddhist country, and whatever happened in the war they remain our friends and we don’t want any separation from them.’ That has been remembered in Japan and there is a statue of President J.R. Jayewardene,” said Amunugama.
Whenever dignitaries from Sri Lanka visit Japan, Japanese leaders very gratefully recall the role played by President J.R. Jayewardene and the Sri Lankan government of that time.
“So we have had very friendly relations. Many Sri Lankans have gone to Japan. Some have settled down there. Some have come back and begun enterprises here. So we have a growing relationship with Japan. This is a cultural event and it is very good that we emphasize the cultural relations between our two countries. We have a strong Buddhist background. But today I would like to mention something which is not normally referred to. And that is the role of Professor Sarachchandra who was a cultural icon in Sri Lanka and still is. All his cultural work – his plays, novels and poetry, all have been strongly influenced by Japan. He was in Japan for I think one and a half years on a scholarship. And our iconic play called ‘Maname’ was strongly influenced by what he saw and read in Japan. He wrote one important novel - Malagiya Aththo. It deals with his experiences in Japan. Especially with a nice beautiful Japanese girl called ‘Noriko’. Today there are so many Sri Lankan girls called ‘Noriko’. So we must encourage scholars to study this relationship between Sri Lanka and Japan because Japanese culture has certainly influenced Sri Lankan theatre and literature apart from Sarathchandra. We have studied political and economic relationships but what about cultural relationships?” explained Amunugama.
History investigation
Amunugama also stated that there are so many areas that a lot of people do not know about. Areas that must be brought into the open. These areas need to be investigated because there is so much history between our two countries.
“I think this should be a very important event in the Sri Lanka calendar for every year. It should not be confined to three days but at least should be one week! A lot of people should see it as it is something fantastic. We look forward to more and more Japanese tourists coming to Sri Lanka. The tourism board I understand is building golf courses all over the country because the top Japanese businessmen come and play golf! So here is to a long relationship, as we have never had problems with Japanese tourists. A lot of Sri Lankans are learning the language. When it comes to the economy I must say that Japanese products are of high quality. So I wish to congratulate the organizers of this event,” said Amunugama.
Ambassador of Japan in Sri Lanka, Kenichi Suganuma said it is undoubtedly a great joy for him to attend the 2nd Japan Expo Sri Lanka 2018 exhibition.
“There will be so many Japanese Cultural activities such as Ikebana, Bonsai and Tea Ceremony. Also, there will be the introduction of new, young Japanese pop culture related activities and also traditional folk festivals. There will also be movies from Japan along with authentic Japanese food. This is by far the greatest exposition of the diversity of Japanese Culture in Sri Lanka. I wish to express my deep gratitude to all efforts taken by the organizers and the sponsors and associations in Sri Lanka involved in this. The relations between Sri Lanka and Japan have always been good. But we are now trying to make it even stronger. We have succeeded in increasing exchanges at the political level. Now we have more Japanese investment coming in. We have more Japanese tourists coming into Sri Lanka – hopefully more than 50,000 this year. That is a seven percent increase from last year,” said Suganuma.
Strengthened relationship
He also stated that now there are more Sri Lankans going to Japan because of their interest in Japanese culture.
“The prospects of strengthening our relationship is very good. This event is the ideal opportunity for those who are not familiar with Japanese culture to become knowledgeable about it. I hope everyone will enjoy the various aspects of Japanese Culture,” said Suganuma
Executive Committee Chairman of Japan Expo Sri Lanka, Michiyo Furusawa, said that Sri Lanka and Japan have many things in common and that our relationship is indeed greatly valued by Japan.
“We are both island countries and beautiful countries at that. We are both hospitable and kind to people. We are both friendly and welcoming. The Japan Expo Sri Lanka 2018 is a festival organized in the hope that it will broaden mutual understanding between our two countries and cement our friendship. We want the people of Sri Lanka to be exposed to Japanese culture and technology.
This time we have tried our best to bring to you the best of Japanese culture. We want you to have a good time and hope that you will enjoy. We are doing this in the hope that we will get to know each other well and understand each other deeply. This is something I firmly believe in – friendship. We will create a wonderful future for each other. We will improve our relationship,” said Furusawa.
