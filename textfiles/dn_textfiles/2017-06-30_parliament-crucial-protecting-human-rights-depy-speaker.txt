Parliament crucial in protecting human rights: Depy Speaker

Parliament is an indispensable component of the national governance systems, a crucial institution in the protection and promotion of human rights, said Deputy Speaker of Parliament Thilanga Sumathipala.
He was delivering the keynote address at the Commonwealth Secretariat Working Session in Parliament on June 27.
He reiterated the fact that Parliamentarians, being the people’s representatives, are uniquely positioned in steering the State’s actions in safeguarding and upholding the rights of the people.
Since the new government came to power in 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe proceeded to set the country on a transformative path in terms of good governance, rule of law, justice, reconciliation and economic development, to safeguard every citizen’s rights; irrespective of ethnicity, race, religion, gender, language, class or social status, said the Deputy Speaker.
Presentations were made by visiting delegates from South Africa: Justice Dikgang Moseneke – Former Deputy Chief Justice and Judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, and Advocate Karen Mckenzie, Head of Human Rights of the Commonwealth Secretariat.
