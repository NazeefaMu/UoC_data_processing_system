No funds to pay allowances of NWP school heads

The North Western Provincial Education Ministry has not received funds to pay allowances of school heads in the Kurunegala and Puttalam.
School heads of the province complain that Principals of National Schools are enjoying the increased allowances, but provincial school heads are not paid due allowances.
Provincial Education Minister Sandya Kumara Rajapakse said he is unable to comply with the appeals of provincial level school heads as his ministry has not received funds.
