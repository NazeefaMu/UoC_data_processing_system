Special attention has been paid on the development project of the Galle Port, Deputy Minister of Ports and Shipping Nishantha Mutuhettigama said.
Mutuhettigama stressed that all the possible steps will be taken to face challenges and to provide solutions for them when the initial phase of this project is implementing.
All of these development projects are implemented based on the Green development concept declared by the President.

Secretary of the Ministry of Ports and Shipping L.P. Jayampathy, SLPA Vice Chairman Prof. Prasanna Perera, Managing Director Sarath Kumara Premachandra and several other officials took part in this event.
Galle City is a world heritage site and in accordance with the standards of the UNESCO, when development projects are carried out inside an ancient city historical values of the city should be protected. Hence, already a plan has been formulated to develop the Galle Port in a way it doesn’t create environmental pollution and harmful impacts. Funds will be allocated from the “JICA Project “and is being implemented under Japanese funds. It is expected to construct the new wave breaker of the Gall Port through these funds. Increasing the depth around the piers, construction of the piers, and expansion in the infrastructure facilities are to be implemented under Galle Port development project.
Galle city is well known for tourism, because it is a World Heritage City.Plans have made to construct a yatch marina in the Galle Port since 15 to 20 sail ships arrive daily at the Galle Port. Primary objective of the Ministry of Ports and Shipping is to provide guidance to enhance these rates.
Deputy Minister Mutuhettigama advised officials to take technical support on the cement production carried out around the Galle Port for a more environmental friendly industry. When cement manufacturing materials are unloaded in the Galle Port, it should be carried out in a way it doesn’t spread particles to the surrounding environment, Minister Nishantha Mutuhettigama added.
Many companies prefer to invest, to provide technical support needed in the procedure of turning these industries and mechanisms more environmental friendly. Mutuhettigama advised officials that agreements should be signed with these firms to obtain technical support required in these projects.
