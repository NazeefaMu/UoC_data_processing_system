Supreme driving fun in every situation: MINI Clubman now available in Sri Lanka

Prestige Automobile (Pvt) Ltd unveiled the new MINI Clubman to conquer the premium compact segment.
The new model offers the highest level of everyday practicality, long distance suitability, versatility and ride comfort ever seen in a MINI.
With four doors and the characteristic split doors at the rear, five fully-fledged seats and a generously sized, versatile interior, the new MINI Clubman meets all the requirements of the compact class in terms of functionality in its own unconventional way, migrating from its youthful exuberance to a mature responsible outlook, much similar to its customers who have been a part of MINI. Individual style, outstanding driving fun and the quality level of a premium automobile, makes it an exceptional phenomenon that allows additional target groups to get a taste of the distinctive MINI feeling.
Heinz Reuter, Chairman of Prestige Automobile (Pvt) Ltd said, “When the MINI Clubman was first presented in 2007, it was responding to a desire for space to accommodate more passengers and luggage as well as to expectations of a 21st century automobile in terms of comfort, safety and efficiency. Today, the new MINI Clubman far surpasses its predecessor not only in dimensions but in providing an enhanced driving experience packed with more technology and innovations than ever before.”
Ranjith Jayawardena, Director Marketing at Prestige Automobile (Pvt) Ltd. said, “We are thrilled to offer the new MINI Clubman to our fans in Sri Lanka. On top of its much-loved signature split rear doors, drivers will also enjoy greater accessibility and everyday usability thanks to its four full-sized side doors. With its powerful fusion of sleek lines, innovative touches and first-rate materials, we believe the new MINI Clubman will turn heads on the road and deliver a classic MINI driving experience that will appeal to MINI fans and car enthusiasts alike.”
