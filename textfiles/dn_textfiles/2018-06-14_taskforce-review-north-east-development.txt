Taskforce to review North, East development

President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday informed the Cabinet that a Task Force under his chairmanship, together with the Prime Minister, Provincial Governors, Officers of the Armed Forces, Police and relevant agencies has been appointed to ‘review, coordinate, conduct and monitor’ development programmes in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing a progress review meeting of the development projects in the North at the Jaffna Kachcheri on May 28, promised that this committee would be appointed.
He said the government has formulated sustainable plans to revive the Northern economy devastated by several years of tension and uplift the living conditions of the people in the area.
