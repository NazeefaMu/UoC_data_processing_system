If music be the food of love…

Cynderalla, a grey coloured 14 storied building, built by the side of the Beira lake cools her toes in the waters. She was dazzled for a few hours with the Sri Lanka Export Development Board tapping their toes to the sound of music.
The musical, a sing-along with Annesley Malewana and Super Chimes, was on from 7 pm. It was organized to bring ties with the present and past – the silver haired golden oldies to have fun and frolic and sing and dance their cares away.
SLEDB Chairperson Indira Malwatte and other dignitaries graced the occasion while Chandani Abhaygunawardene and Sriyani de Seram delivered keynote speeches. Then it was Annesley Malewana’s opportunity to dazzle the evening with his music. The youngest of the crowd, Ranmali, shared the Dancing prize with Harsha who was the best male dancer. Francis Pitigala won the best beautiful shirt wearer.
The proceedings of the event will be in aid of ex-officers in need of medical assistance.
