Softlogic partners JP-IK to boost ICT education

Softlogic Information Technologies Pvt Ltd, one of the country’s leading software and hardware solutions providers and a subsidiary of Softlogic Holdings PLC, has partnered with JP-IK, a global pioneer in ICT-based education, to create, integrate and foster best practices in the use of education technology in Sri Lanka.
JP-IK is widely considered to be the number one worldwide organisation in implementing large-scale education projects, leading the way towards technological innovation and sustainability for Education. The company belongs to the JP Group, a Portuguese business group with an international presence which primarily operates in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector.
Inspiring Knowledge Ecosystem, the integrated initiative developed by JP-IK consists of three key pillars of a technology-based education project - Technology, Engineering and Pedagogy - as part of an education project with a long-term impact.With this educational ecosystem, JP-IK distributes more than technology, ensuring the transfer of knowledge as a key success factor, supporting the sustainable development of communities.
Softlogic Information Technologies is currently the leading importer of Commercial PCs to Sri Lanka. The company also markets and distributes notebook computers, servers, storage, network infrastructure and printers. It looks to provide the world’s best products and services to its customers, while consolidating its market leadership.
Director/CEO Softlogic Information Technologies, Roshan Rassool stated: “Softlogic Information Technologies is a company that aims to provide world-class ICT solutions to our valued clientele at all times. This partnership with JP-IK since 2010 emphasizes our commitment to provide nothing but the very best. High-quality ICT education will play a critical role in the future of our country and it is imperative that we produce tech-savvy individuals in large numbers to fuel the country’s economic growth in today’s challenging global environment.”
Commenting on the partnership, Chairman of JP-IK, Jorge Sá Couto stated, “Our journey in education started in 2008 with our endearing project in Portugal, known as Magellan, which was the first home computer for thousands of Portuguese families and enabled children to develop digital literacy skills. The Sri Lankan government gives high priority to improve the national education system. This is clearly reflected in the fact that Education is State-funded and free-of-charge at all levels while the youth literacy rate stands at over 95%.”
