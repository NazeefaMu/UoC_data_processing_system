[CITIZENS' Mail - (08-08-2018)]

Why not levy a “Kunu” tax?
Now almost all of us pay a nominal santhosam to the garbage collector to facilitate easy disposal of our garbage. I suggest that by imposing a tax for garbage collection, the Municipality can pay an extra allowance to these workers as incentives thus discouraging them from accepting bribes.
Isn’t it better that we pay the government or rather the Municipal Council, a payment (which is acceptable and legal) than pay a bribe (which is despicable, illegal and a punishable offence), to the garbage collector. This is the way forward to eliminate bribery, that is, by increasing the payments made to the garbage handlers.
Over to Inland Revenue Department to consider the above proposal to convert the bribe to “kunu” tax! This will also solve to some extent the garbage issue for Mayoress Rosy Senanayake.
It is also possible that the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) could be disbanded if we could eliminate bribery completely or if it can be at least reduced drastically. This will strengthen good governance in Sri Lanka and make our country a model for other countries.
