Sri Lanka finish 33 runs behind Proteas

A 98-run stand between Hasitha Boyagoda (79 not out) and Ashen Bandara (43) enabled Sri Lanka to recover from a top order collapse and total 262 in their first innings in reply to South Africa’s score of 295 for eight wickets declared on the second day of the 3rd and final under 19 test played at the Pallekele Stadium yesterday.
The Lankan innings once again was undone by the left-arm and right-arm pace of William Sendin (3/59) and skipper Wiann Mulder (4/28).
South Africa hold onto a slender 33 runs lead going into the third and final day today. The first two under 19 tests ended in draws.
