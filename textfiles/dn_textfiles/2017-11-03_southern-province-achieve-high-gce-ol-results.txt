Southern Province achieve high GCE O/L results

The Southern Province has reached the national level in the field of educational development with highly successful results achieved by students through the GCE Ordinary Level Examination this time, Southern Provincial Minister of Education Chandima Rasaputhra said while speaking at a ceremony held at the Wilpita Maha Vidyalaya in Akuressa.
Rasaputhra said that there is an excess of teachers in some schools while some other schools in remote rural areas in the region have a shortage of teaching staff. He expressed his deep sense of gratitude to students for making better academic achievements amidst difficulties and bringing honour to the Southern region. A recent survey carried out in South has revealed that lack of a proper and healthy atmosphere for children in view of want of parental protection, poverty and disruptions of families led to the decrease in examination results of some children.
SPC Ministry of Education is also exploring the possibility of getting the children going through difficulties and economic hardships admitted to children’s homes and afford them a quality education. Advanced countries in the world have adopted these procedures, Rasaputhra said.
Rasaputhra said that children are the asset of the country. Making financial allocations for them would not be an invaluable investment for a bright future for them and it definitely won’t be a mere expenditure and waste of money. Affording a sound education to every child in the Southern region would be the cherished aim of his ministry.
Rasaputhra mentioned that in the National Educational Development Process, the study of technological subjects has been prioritized. Better facilities should be made for children for the same.
Plans are afoot to further boost the academic attainments and examination results of all students in State schools in the Southern Province. Speedy measures have also been initiated to enhance the physical and human resources in all schools in the Southern Province, the Minister said.
The educational development of the children would be the vision and mission of the SPC Ministry of Education, Rasaputhra further said.
Several speakers also addressed the meeting.
