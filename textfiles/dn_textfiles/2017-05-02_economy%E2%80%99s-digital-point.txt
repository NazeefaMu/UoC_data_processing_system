ECONOMY’S  DIGITAL POINT

The global economy has undergone many transformations in the last decade and half. A notable feature of this new economy is the emergence of a number of new digital products or services that have to a great extent changed the lives of people all around the world by strengthening communication and facilitating trade.
Many of these new products are IT or internet based and created by a whole new generation of self made billionaire entrepreneurs such as Jeff Bezos (Amazon.com) Jack Ma (Alibaba Group) Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google) and Travis Kalanick (Uber). Captains of industry and innovators are increasingly drawn from sectors that are linked to goods and services that have an IT or Internet base.
Age of the digital economy
Because of the growing importance of this type of product to modern lifestyles they have been often shown as indicators of a new economic era, the age of the digital economy. This claim and others in disagreement are the basis of a very interesting debate which will be the subject of this article.
There is considerable confusion today as to what really constitutes the “digital economy” and perhaps as a starting point we need to understand that it is not separate in any way to the existing economy. What is referred to as digital economy is in reality a transformation or mutation of the existing economy with the introduction of new technologies. But is that really the case?
Prof. Joseph Stieglitz, Professor of Economics at Columbia University and Nobel Laureate in Economics stated that new technologies have transformed the nature of competition, of marketing and how we collect taxes. He added that this represents “the foundation of how the economy works”.
Digital technology
It is indeed true that the global economy as well as that of individual States, including Sri Lanka, has to a great extent been reshaped by the advent of digital technology. However, experts generally hold that the economic impact of the digital technology has not been as significant as it is often claimed. In other words technology inputs have transformed the market but it remains fundamentally unchanged.
It has in fact been argued that when compared to vital historical technological advances such as electricity, the automobile and the aircraft, the introduction of digital technology has lagged behind in terms of the impact and social changes that it has resulted in.
Leading economists such as Stieglitz have in fact argued that a leading and widely used web search engine is just “a better advertising agency” rather than being on par with what he describes as “earlier fundamental transformations”.
However not everyone shares this perception and this earlier opinion has been disputed by Economist Eli Noam who believes instead that products like the IPhone, I Pad and services such as Uber are all innovations in their own right and unlike anything else that has existed before. According to Noam the global economy has taken a radical new turn.
Another important issue is the economic usefulness of technology. The general view of economists is that if advances in the digital economy have the ability to generate new and sustainable employment or impact significantly at a global level on humanity, then they can be considered positive.
Global events
In the USA in particular, there has been considerable research in what is known as the “economics of information”. Information flows have increased and changed lives, perceptions and to a large extent the outcome of global events. But can a real value or worth be assigned to them?
In the past, news organisations marketed news and advertising as a joint product. However now advertising was entered a new dimension, namely online platforms. This can be called the decentralization of information. At a recent visit to Galle Fort a particularly helpful waiter at a restaurant requested this writer to praise the quality of his service on Trip Advisor. By this request the young Sri Lankan waiter had indicated that he wanted the whole world to be aware of this excellent service and he considered his clients to be the global travelling community.
Technological advances have resulted in a considerable lowering of the cost of news and information. However there is also a concern that information that has no cost may also have no value. The real problem today is not a shortage of information, but seeking out what information is really worthwhile accessing and using.
A central issue about knowledge is how it is valued. Knowledge is in general considered a public good which can be shared, but that also needs to have a return on its original investment. In the digital age, knowledge is widely disseminated but many problems and much discussion exist on how best this knowledge can be monetized. Perhaps we need to see people as recipients of knowledge and determine the true value of this knowledge.
The lowering of the cost of information is likely in the long term to reduce the distance between the people and the market. Perhaps the long term global environment for innovation and information will be one where ideally all the people will have access to all the information in the world.
This would mean the emergence of a truly globalized economy with exciting new prospects for the individual as well as for developing nations, such as Sri Lanka.
