Supreme Court extends stay order on Geetha ruling

 
The Supreme Court extended the stay order issued against the Court of Appeal ruling on UPFA Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe, until the petition is heard.
 On May 12, the Supreme Court issued an interim order until May 15 on the Court of Appeals’ ruling that Geetha was disqualified to function as MP as she holds dual citizenship in Sri Lanka and Switzerland.
