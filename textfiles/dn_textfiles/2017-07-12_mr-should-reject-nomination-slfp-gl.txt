MR should reject nomination from SLFP: GL

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should reject nomination from the SLFP, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna President Prof. G. L. Peiris said yesterday.
He said there is no room for the people to express their opinion as the government does not hold elections. The people have been deprived of their right to franchise.
“When the people’s right to franchise is infringed, there is no room for democracy to stay,” he said Addressing the media in Colombo, Prof. Peiris said the next Presidential Election should be held between November 9 and December 9, 2019.
“I wonder whether this government will exist until November in 2019,” he said. North Central, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council elections which are supposed to be held the year end, can not be postponed under the law, Prof. Peiris said.
