Tribute to John Denver

For the first time in Kandy, the Grand Kandyan hotel organized an amazing musical eve to pay tribute to the iconic music legend – John Denver. The show was exclusively featured by the amazing voice of Mark Roberts; song writer and singer from Ireland; award winner for impersonation of John Denver’s music and also a winner of four platinum discs.
This show was a journey through John Denver’s life and music and it had been a huge success in Ireland, UK, Germany, Brussels, Australia and Denver’s home town Colorado. This was the very first time the show was conducted in Sri Lanka and The Grand Kandyan took the foremost step to bring Mark to Kandy to give the Kandy music lovers the exclusive opportunity to listen to the music of the iconic musician.
The show was organized on a week day yet the hall was overloaded with music lovers, proving even though he’s physically gone, his music lives on.
