Rajapaksas’ village development inefficient: Wedaarachchi

Although the Rajapaksas spoke highly of the development of villages during their regime, it was still inefficient, State Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economic Affairs Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
He was addressing state officials, private sector institution representatives and councillors in the Hambantota district, during a meeting on the Gamperaliya project held at the Weeraketiya Divisional Secretariat, recently.
The state minister said that the views and ideas of those who participated in the meeting, would be given consideration when implementing the project.
He said that during the previous regime, development projects were implemented in villages according to the whims of ministers’ henchmen, and not based on the requirements of the villagers.
However, he said the Gamperaliya project would be used for the benefit of underprivileged villagers only, in order to raise their livelihoods.
State Minister Wedaarachchi said that women would be provided with employment opportunities, while the industrial and agricultural sectors would be developed as well.
