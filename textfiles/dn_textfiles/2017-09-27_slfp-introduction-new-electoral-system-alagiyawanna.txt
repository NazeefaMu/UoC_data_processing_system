SLFP for introduction of new electoral system: Alagiyawanna

Finance and Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said that the SLFP’s stance is to introduce an electoral system without a Preferential votes system not only for the Local Government election but also for the Provincial Council and Parliamentary elections.
He said so while addressing a media briefing at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
“The SLFP is stands for the introduction of such an electoral system since it is a long felt need of the country and people,” he said.
However,certain persons are trying to mislead the country by levelling baseless allegations about this new electoral system implemented through the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
The Minister said the Government plans to request the Chairman of the Elections Commission to hold the Local Government elections by next January.
“All the necessary measures in this regard will be taken by the Government by October 9,” Alagiyawanna said.
With the new electoral system, there will have 5,092 electorates with 8,443 members elected to the Local Government institutions. Asked whether the increase the number of members will be a waste of money, the minister said it will not result in a wate of funds considering the increase in population.
He added that the Government is engaging in introducing a most appropriate electoral system to the country with the implementation of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
He added that there may be amendment to the Constitution aiming to have a proper electoral system which symbolises people’s mandate.
