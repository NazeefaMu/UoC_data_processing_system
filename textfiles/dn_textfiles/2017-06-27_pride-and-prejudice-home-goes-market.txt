Pride and Prejudice home goes on the market

More than twenty years ago, Pride and Prejudice dominated our TV screens - introducing the nation to Georgian dresses, rural homes and, of course, a dripping wet Colin Firth.
And if you, like many others, have been captivated by the Jane Austen idyll ever since then you’re in luck, now is the chance to live out your wildest fantasies - Elizabeth Bennet’s home is up for sale.
Situated 17 miles from Bath, Luckington Court has been put on the market for the first time in 70 years by agents Woolley & Wallis.
Luckington Court will be recognisable to any Austen fan as the Bennet family home – Longbourn - in the iconic period drama.
The Grade-II listed house, built of Cotswold stone, contains original Tudor features but has been sympathetically modernised and tastefully decorated. Located on the site of a manor owned by King Harold before 1066, the present house was remodelled during the 16 Century and has been in the current owner’s family since 1947.
As a country estate this property ticks all the boxes, set in one of the most delightfulCotswold villages with easy access to the M4, Bath, Bristol and only 75 minutes to London Paddington.
The house consists of a range of elegant well-proportioned rooms, eight bedrooms with seven bathrooms plus an integral flat and a separate self-contained annexe accommodation. In addition there are five dwellings and a 17 Century square dovecote. Overlooking the Rose Garden is a Grade II listed stable block containing seven loose boxes, tack room, cart shed and walled outdoor manège.
The Home Farm is accessed by a separate gated road and includes a range of modern and traditional buildings with land comprising 145 acres (58 hectares) of permanent grassland, just over 6 acres (2×5 hectares) of woodland and 780 metres of River Avon frontage.
Woolley & Wallis partner, Richard Nocton, said: “Rarely does a property of this quality and in a such a sought after location come up for sale.
“Its excellent condition, additional accommodation and manageable farm will provide the buyer with not only a desirable estate but a country lifestyle in a rural community close to the amenities of Cirencester, Bath, Bristol.”
Luckington Court has a guide price of £9.5 million.
