Tourist arrivals  up 4.5%

Tourist arrivals recorded an increase of 4.5 per cent, year-on-year, with 123,351 tourists arriving during the month of June 2017.
On a cumulative basis, tourist arrivals grew by 4.8 per cent during the first half of 2017 compared to the corresponding period of 2016.
Following the same trend in tourist arrivals, earnings from tourism also increased to US dollars 211.6 million in June 2017. Consequently, on a cumulative basis, earnings from tourism increased by 4.8 per cent to US dollars 1, 733.6 million during the first half of 2017.
A decline in tourist arrivals from the Middle East, the low growth in Chinese tourist arrivals as well as the
rescheduling of some flights due to the resurfacing of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) can be partly attributed to the moderate growth in earnings from tourism during the first half of 2017.
