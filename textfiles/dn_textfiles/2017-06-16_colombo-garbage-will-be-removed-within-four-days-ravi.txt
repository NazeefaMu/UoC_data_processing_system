Colombo garbage will be removed within four days: Ravi

Garbage piled up in Colombo for the last few days in the Colombo city, will be removed by the authorities within four days, Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister said no room should be left for the people to suffer by the consequences caused due to tug of war among government institutions.
Minister Karunanayake made these observations at a ceremony held to lay the foundation stone for a building at Kanapathi Hindu Girls’ School in Kotahena on Wednesday.
The minister said the help of security forces can be sought to remove accumulating garbage in the city.
He said no room should be left for the people to suffer due to a conflict between the Provincial Chief Minister and the line ministries over the garbage dumping issue.
