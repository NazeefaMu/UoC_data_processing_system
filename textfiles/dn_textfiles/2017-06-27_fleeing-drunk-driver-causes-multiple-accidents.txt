Fleeing drunk driver causes multiple accidents

A speed fiend said to be a Samurdhi Bank manager resident in Elayapattuwa, who tried to escape in his vehicle in his drunken fits after causing an accident involving four vehicles, was apprehended by Anuradhapura Police on June 25 night.
The accident occurred near Tissa Wewa on the old Puttalam Road in Anuradhapura.
Police said the errant bank manager’s vehicle had earlier crashed into a parked three wheeler which had collided with another three wheeler parked behind.
As the three wheeler driver was chasing after the fleeing vehicle, it had crashed into an oncoming tourist car and fallen to a side.
Police said the suspect was due to be produced before the Anuradhapura Magistrate yesterday. Investigations are continuing.
