PM leads battle against rise of yellow terror

The Homagama Magistrate's Court emerged as the centre of a necessary fight against the rise of a wave of racial-religious terror that has the support of key opposition forces, and posing a major threat to the country's judicial system, too.
Only a few weeks ago the Homagama Magistrate ordered the Army Commander to extend fullest cooperation to the Police in investigations into the case of the missing journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda. The same Court has now had to order the detention in remand of the leader and General Secretary of the Budu Bala Sena (BBS) Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera, and ensure protection of the Court premises from the robed, robe removed, and lay persons who are demonstrating a swell of terror, fanned by racial and religious extremist forces, having the fullest backing of the opposition ranged against attempts by the government of consensus to take the country forward through reconciliation, understanding and accountability.
Responding to the show of this wave of terror at the Homagama Magistrate's Court earlier this week, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made a timely and valued statement in Parliament that there will be no room for another Somarama or Buddharakkitha in the country. The necessity to recall the assassination of Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike, a popularly elected leader of the country by yellow robes persons, so described by the fatally injured Mr. Bandaranaike himself, shows the danger that lurks with extremist forces seeking to gain control and give direction to sections of the Maha Sangha.
The new danger
Welcoming the Prime Minister's decision to prevent a Somarama-Buddharakkitha situation, and his orders to the Police to fully probe the activities of the BBS leader, it is necessary to record that what took place in the Bandaranaike assassination was an internal conspiracy over business interests with political connections; while, what is coming up in this new wave of terror is a clear attempt to push people politics into the arms of religious-racist extremism, which was clearly encouraged by the defeated Rajapaksa regime; with no room for doubt that the brother of the former President, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, was very close to and supportive of the BBS and its activities.
Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera
The previous regime took no action whatever against the BBS, Ravana Balaya and related forces in the violence against Muslims they provoked at Aluthgama and Beruwela in mid-2014, as well as against Christian organizations, and also the disruptive action they took in forcible entry to State institutions, threatening administrators and disrupting the functioning of those institutions. The only response was the joke of a Religious Police Unit being set up, which religiously avoided any confrontation with these dangerous forces.
Diverse threats
It is important to note that the timing of the BBS-led contempt of court and threat to the judiciary, and the near coincident Dalada Maligawa pledge by the "Sinha-le" movement, comes with the emerging interest in Sri Lanka as a new location for foreign investment in South Asia.
The discussions at Davos led by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, and the country's new trends in democracy, rule of law and economic policies, have shown key investors such as Microsoft, Richard Branson's Virgin Group, George Soros related institutions and many European companies, to show an interest in direct investment in Sri Lanka. The rise of the new extremist wave can be seen as an attempt to prevent such investment coming to the country, through the bad image of racist or religious violence given to the world, in line with efforts of the defeated Rajapaksa forces to prevent much needed economic recovery in the country.
Also related is the comment by the BBS leader in his tirade at the Homagama Magistrate's Court that they had no respect for the white man's judicial system that is followed, which stands out as a major threat to the progress of the Rule of Law in the country, and the welcome signs of the new independence of the Judiciary seen in several recent court decisions. Interestingly, this threat of "yellow robed" terror comes amidst the debate on the proposed Theravada Kathikavatha Bill.
The SLFP divisions
The political cartoons in most media are the best indications of the crisis strongly threatening the unity of the SLFP today. This situation is underscored by comments from SLFP groups in the Government and the Opposition, and especially from those realizing the inevitability of a break away from the party, under some Rajapaksa leadership.
Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR), weakly waving the SLFP flag stating he will never be a "party breaker", is causing a burden for the Joint Opposition loud mouths Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and cabal. Meanwhile, there is a clear inner Rajapaksa family contest for leadership of any new political alignment from an SLFP split. Basil Rajapaksa, having lost much support within the SLFP, on his bad record as SLFP National Organizer, leading to MR defeat on January 8, is certainly making a claim for leadership, in keeping with his record in political machinations and party jumping in the past. However, the stronger contender seems to be Gotabhaya, with his absence of a political record, and his standing as a "War Hero", and clear supporter of extreme Sinhala-Buddhist thinking.
BBS and 'Sinha-le'
The new rise of the BBS, and the "Sinha-le" waving the "Sinhala" flag, waved when Gotabhaya was first called to a Commission of Inquiry after January 8, shows the forces ranged in his support, mainly the extremist forces trying to make the best use of the so-called threats to War Heroes, as in the Ekneligoda and certain other cases today; best demonstrated by the BBS at the Homagama Magistrate's Court, the "Sinha-le" clashes with Police near the Dalada Maligawa and extreme anti-Muslim provocation at Mawanella, earlier this week.
Gotabhaya has reminded pro-splitters in the SLFP of the paternal history in party splitting, when DA Rajapaksa, left the UNP Government with SWRD Bandaranaike to form the SLFP in 1952. He thus sees a good family tradition in party splitting and is even posing a challenge to MR, who makes less sound about any support for a breakaway. There is less said about Mr. Bandaranaike's expressed surprise that DA Rajapaksa had indeed followed him in that crossover to the Opposition.
What is most likely to emerge is a break away from the SLFP, with some arrangements where MR will possibly remain within to look after the interests of his own family and those of his siblings, even in political rivalry; with his support for a Maithripala Sirisena leadership of the SLFP. It will be an interesting display of sharing family responsibilities on crime, fraud and corruption.
The Sailor inspiration
Amidst speculation about Lt. Yoshitha Rajapaksa, the second son of MR being called before a military court for alleged violations of the Navy Act, there is an interesting aspect about his recruitment to the Navy, without necessary educational qualifications for the rank he was hired, but costing the State more than Rs. 200 million on training abroad.
Minister for Media and Information, Gayantha Karunatilake, informed Parliament that Yoshitha may have been recruited to that rank, even without qualifications, being the then President's son, and possibly to encourage other youth to join the Navy, in need of manpower at the time, in December 2006. It's possible his entry to the Navy may have inspired some youth to join it at the time of war.
Yet, what is more significant is that this "inspiring force" did no service whatever in the area of conflict in the country, but spent more than three years, till the war against the LTTE was over, training abroad - in the UK and Ukraine at public expense; while many of those he may have "inspired" would have been the victims and even heroes of war.
Women's power
Departing from the turmoil of politics, the Prime Minister made important proposals on increasing women's representation in politics and governance, speaking as Chief Guest at the Ninth Sisters of St. Margaret Oration, celebrating Founders Day of his first school, Bishop's College, Colombo, on Wednesday.
He was concerned that although women were widely represented in all professions, public and social services, the numbers in governance, both national and local were very small. Parliament had only 11 women MPs when the population has over 50 % of women. His initial proposal was bringing women to local government, through a Women's List, similar to the National list for Parliament, ensuring 20 to 25% representation in Local Government bodies, based on percentage polled by respective parties. He expected this to progress towards better female representation in Parliament. Importantly, he also called on women's activists to ensure better promotions of women to the directorates of companies in the private sector.
His proposals, timely amidst the debate on constitutional reform, showed commitment to bringing capable women, into the field of politics and governance, to strengthen democracy, and paved the way for a good debate on aspects of gender equality, and matters of domestic violence that are of rising concern today.
