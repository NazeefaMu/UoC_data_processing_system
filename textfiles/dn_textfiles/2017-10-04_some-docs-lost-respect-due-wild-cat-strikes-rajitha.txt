Some docs lost respect due to wild cat strikes: Rajitha

A certain section of doctors have lost public respect due to wild cat strikes launched by them which greatly inconvenienced the people, Health, Indigenous Medicine and Nutrition Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a felicitation ceremony jointly organized by the Rajitha Senaratne Foundation and the Beruwala Yahapalana Sansadaya (Forum) at the Aluthgama Pradesheeya Sabha playground to mark International Elders’ Day on October 2.
Dr. Senaratne said the elder population in the country would increase rapidly in the future and more funds had to be allocated for the health service to cater to their health needs.
He said new medical facilities would be set up at the Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa and Moratuwa Universities shortly while the Medical Faculty at the Ruhuna University would further expand.
Although there were allegations that the government planned to privatize education over the SAITM issue, the government would never privatize education, he said.
Today there is an ideology which tries to prohibit education to people with financial means. A child of a brick-making labourer is also studying at the SAITM today under a scholarship, he added.
The JVP and the Frontline Socialist Party were also trying to obstruct the SAITM. Although even some members of the government feared to delve on the SAITM issue, he was not scared to express his views on it, the minister said.
