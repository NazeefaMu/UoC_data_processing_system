[CITIZENS' Mail - (12-04-2017)]

The difference between NCMC and SAITM
I have read many articles comparing the NCMC and SAITM. Therefore we have to consider whether these two institutes are comparable. Regarding the NCMC the following facts are important.
a). NCMC was established as a nonprofit organisation by a medical association.
b). NCMC followed the medical curriculum of the Medical Faculty of the University of Colombo.
c). Lectures from the Colombo Medical Faculty provided supplementary lectures.
d). Clinical training was provided in government hospitals.
e). NCMC students sat for the same examinations conducted by the Colombo Medical Faculty for the students of the Colombo Medical Faculty.
f). SLMC accepted that the training provided was adequate for practice of medicine in Sri Lanka
None of these facts are applicable to SAITM. The trouble started when the NCMC with the support of the then government demanded the MBBS certificate from the Colombo Medical Faculty. This was not acceptable as these students have not registered as students in the University of Colombo. This resulted in protests from students. The protests were ignored by the Government. The student protests then evolved into an armed struggle to overthrow the Government. This resulted in thousands of deaths and caused severe damage to the economy and the reputation of the country. President Premadasa as soon as he was elected nationalized the NCMC and solved this problem.
MBBS program of the KDU was established to provide Doctors for the armed forces. This was necessary as the Government Doctors were not willing to serve in the frontline field hospitals during the civil war. The KDU medical students are provided clinical training in Government hospitals. SLMC has accepted that the training of KDU students is acceptable for practice of medicine in Sri Lanka.
SLMC is the regulatory body for regulating medical education. It is similar to the Supreme Court regulating legal education by regulating the Law College. Nobody in Sri Lanka can practice as an Attorney at Law without passing out from the Law College. The sensible people in Sri Lanka hope that the Government will not repeat the past mistakes and provide a solution to this problem immediately. Any delay intentionally or not will cut a pathway for a disaster.
