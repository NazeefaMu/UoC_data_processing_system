Waiting for the voter’s choice

Sri Lanka's political landscape will see some decisive transformations in the coming weeks as campaigning for the local government elections pits major political parties against each other.
An early indication of this came last week when President Maithripala Sirisena addressed Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) activists last week. In a measured but hard-hitting speech, he readily acknowledged that he had undertaken every possible effort to unite the two factions of the party.
It is also no secret that towards the latter stages of the discussions it was the dissident faction of the party, with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as its de facto leader, which was reluctant to unite with the mainstream SLFP rather than vice versa. This is because this group, which is contesting the forthcoming local government elections as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), imposed several unrealistic conditions on the mainstream SLFP during negotiations such as leaving the National Unity government.
SLFP ministers who engaged in the talks now believe that while there were some hardliners who resisted a 'deal' between the two factions, it was a belief that the SLPP could outperform the SLFP that fuelled the SLPP's resistance.
In his speech to the SLFP, President Sirisena made no attempt to hide his annoyance about this attitude. "The identity of those who scuttled negotiations is well known " the President said and pointed out that he made every effort to arrive at a consensus, just as he had done prior to the August 2015 general election.
President's remarks
President Sirisena then went on to provide the strongest indication yet that there would be consequences for the SLPP's intransigence. "Just as much as I undertook my first challenge in November 2014," the President said in an obvious reference to his decision to leave the Rajapaksa government three years ago, "I will not hesitate to continue the second phase of that process".
Since then, there have been many interpretations to the President's remarks. Some have attempted to characterise them as a warning to the SLFP's partner in the National Unity government, the United National Party (UNP). Others have even gone to the extent of predicting a parting of ways with the UNP after the local government polls.
Adding to the speculation was the President's announcement that a presidential commission of inquiry will be appointed to probe management issues related to the national carrier, SriLankan Airlines. This has also been interpreted as the President training his guns on the UNP. This is due to the current management of the airline being appointees of this government with strong links to its UNP faction.
However it must be noted that not only the President but Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the entire government is also concerned about the underperformance of the airline and earnestly want it restructured as it is a major strain on the economy- with resulting political consequences for the government.
Rajapaksa government
Besides, any investigation into the national carrier will most certainly encompass its management under the previous regime when it was initially a profitable venture in partnership with the national carrier of the United Arab Emirates, Emirates Airlines. The decision to terminate the agreement with Emirates would surely come under scrutiny as there are suggestions that it was triggered after the airline refused a personal request by then President Rajapaksa.
The airline's subsequent decline in performance under the Rajapaksa government will also be under investigation. Thus, the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry into Sri Lankan Airlines cannot by any means be construed as a witch-hunt against the UNP.
SLFP stalwarts also note that in the same speech, the President was quite critical of the party's previous leadership. The President recalled how there was an attempt to belittle the Bandaranaikes although paying lip service to their policies by hanging their photographs in party offices. These remarks hardly suggest reconciliation with the SLPP leadership and indicate that President Sirisena could get tough with the SLPP in the aftermath of the local polls.
In this context it is pertinent to note that despite the aggressive campaigning by the SLPP and its forerunner, the Joint Opposition (JO) grouping in Parliament, its parliamentarians haven't had to campaign against the SLFP at an election until now. By doing so in the current campaign, they are explicitly violating party discipline and exposing themselves to measures being taken against them by the party hierarchy. This is a prospect JO stalwarts campaigning for the SLPP need to be mindful of. Of course, it is readily recognised by all concerned that any action by President Sirisena following the local government elections will necessarily be influenced by the performance of the three major parties in the fray- the UNP, the SLFP and the SLPP. If the SLFP performs strongly, there is no doubt that President Sirisena will be emboldened to wield the whip against the SLPP dissidents and full scale disciplinary action is likely. On the other hand, if the SLPP outperforms the SLFP, a more conciliatory approach is likely.
Against this backdrop, the campaign themes of the respective parties are noteworthy. Obviously, the SLPP is focussing on the alleged shortcomings of the government and also raising the Central Bank bond sale as a corruption issue in the incumbent government. However, knowing that they have to tap into the vote base of the SLFP if they are to make inroads into Sri Lanka's traditional two party system, they are quite critical of the SLFPers remaining within the government, perhaps even more so than their criticisms of the UNP.
Election campaign
The SLFP too is faced with the same predicament. Its harshest attacks are aimed at the SLPP rather than the UNP. In fact, the leaders of the SLFP and the UNP have arrived at an understanding that they will be prudent in their criticism of each other during this election campaign. This may be violated by activists on the ground every now and then but it also prevents indiscriminate sniping at each other.
While the UNP does stand to gain because of the rift between the mainstream SLFP and its dissidents, its victory at the election is by no means assured. This is due to several factors. Firstly, its performance in government has fallen short of expectations, particularly in easing the economic hardships that the electorate is faced with.
Secondly, the Central Bank bond sale issue has dented the party's image. This, coupled with its inability to prosecute leading figures of the previous regime for alleged corruption, means that it can no longer take the moral high ground regarding good governance or corruption related issues.
Thirdly, there are several 'unknowns ' at play at this election. Main among them is the size of the support commanded by the SLPP. The other imponderable is how the voter will react to the re-introduction of the first past the post method through the 'ward' system after nearly thirty years of proportional representation.
All these factors conspire to make the upcoming local government elections a litmus test for all major political parties, particularly for the warring factions in the SLFP. In that sense, there is much more than merely electing representatives for over 300 local government institutions in the country at stake at this poll.
It could revitalise President Maithripala Sirisena’s moves to gain total control of the SLFP and it would also provide Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the UNP with an assessment of their popularity. Most importantly though it will almost certainly make or break the political future of the Rajapaksa clan who ruled the country for a decade.
