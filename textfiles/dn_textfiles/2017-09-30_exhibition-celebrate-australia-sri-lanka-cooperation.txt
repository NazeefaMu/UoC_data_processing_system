Exhibition to celebrate Australia - Sri Lanka cooperation

Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson launched a photographic exhibition at the Jaffna Art Gallery on September 27 celebrating 70 years of development cooperation between Australia and Sri Lanka.
Australia has long supported Sri Lanka’s development island-wide, including in the North. The exhibition highlights how Sri Lankans have benefited from the humanitarian, health, education and employment projects delivered by Australian aid.
“Partnerships with all levels of government, civil society, the private sector and NGOs have been central to the success of these programmes,” said Hutchesson. Since the end of the conflict, Australia has provided assistance for demining, new housing, rebuilding of schools, roads, market places and created new jobs. Similarly, post-tsunami, Australia assisted with a range of reconstruction efforts.
The exhibition also captures the future of Australia’s development cooperation in Sri Lanka.
“Many of our new programmes focus on partnering with the private sector in innovative ways to create more and better jobs and opportunities for all Sri Lankans, especially women,” said Hutchesson.
The exhibition also celebrates, with a series of select portraits, the significant contribution Sri Lankans have made to Australian society. “These portraits showcase just a small representation of the large and vibrant Sri Lankan community that has contributed so significantly and positively to Australia’s multicultural life,” said Hutchesson.
The exhibition is open to the public from September 27 to October 1 at the Jaffna Art Gallery.
