Impartial discharge of duty by institutions will earn public esteem - CJ

No institution deserves to survive in a democracy unless it earns public esteem; and it can earn the public esteem only by discharging its duties impartially and expeditiously, said Chief Justice K. Sripavan yesterday as he bid farewell as the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka.
Citing his own contributions to make the judiciary more efficient, he said during his time, he implemented many measures to expedite cases in courts and to reduce the number of arrears of cases.
“As an initial step, three Supreme Court benches were constituted from December 2015 and the Judges were sitting at least four days a week. As a result of these tireless efforts of my colleagues 1,636 cases were disposed in 2016 as opposed to 783 cases in the year 2015. There were 1,508 cases instituted in 2015 and 1863 cases instituted in 2016, whereas only 574 and 1710 cases were instituted in years 2013 and 2014.
“Judges serving in the Magistrates Courts, the District Courts and the High Courts were directed to take up trials on a day to day basis. Due to trials being taken up on a day to day basis and the consequential workload, the burden on the members of the staff became unbearable and the Judicial Service Commission more recently was able to fill the vacancies in the cadre for scheduled public officers. In addition, 23 High Court Judges were appointed during the last two years out of which, 21 judges are carrier judges. Three judges were also appointed to the Court of Appeal and one Judge to the Supreme Court during this period,” said the CJ as he ticked off his achievements during his tenure. “After career spanning 40 years, the CJ also took time to advise new lawyers entering the field with, “what is required of the young lawyers at the Bar are punctuality, a clear head, a good memory, strong commonsense and an aptitude of analysis and arrangement”. “The success of the judicial process often depends on the services of the legal profession. Its nobility has to be preserved, protected and promoted. An institution cannot survive on its name or on its past glory alone,” said CJ Sripavan and called for a better relationship between the Bench and the Bar rather “than any element of arrogance and superiority on one side”.
“As a Judge, I tried my best to discharge my functions, but it is ultimately for the members of the Bar and the public to assess my contribution, if any, to restore the independence and integrity of the judiciary and the development of law in this country,” added the retiring Chief Justice.
