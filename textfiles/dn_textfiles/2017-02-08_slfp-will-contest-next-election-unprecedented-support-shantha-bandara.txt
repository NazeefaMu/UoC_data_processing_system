SLFP will contest next election with unprecedented support: Shantha Bandara

The SLFP will contest the next election under a coalition of larger number of progressive forces and youth movements unprecedented in the recent history, SLFP Youth Front (SLFPYF) President Shantha Bandara said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo, he said the situation is much different than it was last year and a large number have gathered around the party. “When we go to villages, people request us to join hands to strengthen the party,” he said.
He said the SLFPYF had established balamandalas (Executive committees) in each district successfully in all areas except in 11 electorates represented by JO members.
“Balamandalas for them will be established if JO members come to our side or new organisers are appointed,” he said.
“We will hold district leadership camps after setting up balamandalas island-wide.
SLFPYF Conventions will be held in each district as a final phase of the programme. We set up a balamandala and held a convention in Jaffna for the first time in the history,” he said.
The party marches forward with the input of youths and analyzes had been conducted to understand the reasons for the defeat at the last presidential election in to rectify the mistakes, he said
“We planned to start a political study center for the SLFP under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena in next month. Our aim is to produce intellectual and skilled politicians who have a good knowledge of local and global political and economic trends, and the history and the policies of the party. We request youths with progressive ideas to join us,” he said.
