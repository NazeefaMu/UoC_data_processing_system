SLTB urged to strengthen Kawdana Road bus service

The only SLTB bus that operates along the Attidiya-Dehiwela-Kawdana Road breaks down daily, residents of the area complain.
Schoolchildren, government servants, and others travelling by bus daily to get to the Dehiwela Railway station undergo many difficulties due to the issue. Private buses do not operate along the route, they said.
A bus driver said he was assigned to the same broken bus every day.
