O’Donnell and Duff are here!

Following the very successful concert staged in 2014 and due to popular demand DK Promotions once again have come forward to organise yet another concert by Sri lanka’s most loved singer Daniel O’Donnell also featuring Mary Duff. The concert will be held on March 28 and 29 from 7.30 pm at the BMICH.
Daniel O’Donnell proving he to be one of the best loved artists of our time, Daniel comes to Sri Lanka on the heels of a very successful New Zealand & Australian nationwide tour where he performed to packed houses over a four week period.
Daniel made musical history and proved himself to be one of Ireland’s most hardworking singers, by releasingat least one album every year since 1988. This is something which remains unmatched even with music’s most longstanding stars like The Rolling Stones, Madonna and Michael Jackson. Daniel will have a tough time choosing which of his hits to play from his back-catalogue of over 37 albums.
Daniel’s shows are a constant sell-out, he began touring again last August with 5 sold out shows at the INEC, Killarney in Ireland, performing his revitalised show to over 12,000 enthusiastic fans. Such is Daniel’s popularity that fans came from as far away as the USA and Australia to see him in his ‘Welcome Back Concerts’.
Daniel’s Sri Lankan fans have waited three years for their idol to return and they won’t be disappointed as Daniel brings his new show and new band to their capital city Colombo. The shows are set for Tue 28th& Wed 29th March and Daniel cannot wait. He says that they got such an amazing welcome there last time out, it just made everyone want to go back there again.
Daniel will be joined by his singing partner Mary Duff who has been singing with him for almost 25 years. During the two and half hour concert Daniel will perform his hits plus new songs that he has not performed in Sri Lanka before. He will also sing songs from his new CD “Back Home Again” which contains some great songs. Mary Duff will as usual do several duets with Daniel besides her solos.
Daniel will not forget to meet his fans and arrangements have already been made for a meet and greet after the concert at the Banquet hall at BMICH. It will be a great get together with food stall etc. Daniel together with Mary Duff will meet all their fans and also pose for photographs.
