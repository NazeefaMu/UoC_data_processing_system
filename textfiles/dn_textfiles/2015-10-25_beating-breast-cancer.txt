Beating Breast Cancer

October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Dr. Suraj Perera (MBBS, MSc, MD) of the National Cancer Control Programme of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry talks to T n'C about early detection and breast cancer prevention.
Early detection is the most important factor that helps save lives of women. If breast cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be cured. Later stage breast cancers cannot be cured completely. Breast self examination, clinical breast examination by a health care worker, ultra sound scan, a mammography and Non Excision Biopsy - Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) and or cone biopsy are the best early detection methods available.
Breast self examination should be done monthly by all women over the age of 20 on a fixed date in every month after menstruation. Clinical breast examination should be done by all women between the ages of 20 - 40 once in every three years and annually by all women above the age of 40. Mammography should not be done for women below the age of 35 unless asked by the doctor. All women between the ages of 50 - 69 should get done a mammography once in every two years. Genetic testing plays a major role in early detection of breast cancer, especially for women with family history. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are available in Sri Lanka.
Testing is done on DNA extracted from peripheral venous blood. Genetic Consultations available at Human Genetics Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Kinsey Road, Colombo 08. Telephone: 0112689545, email:[email protected] Working hours: 08:00am - 04:00pm (Mondays to Fridays).
Women at high risk are those who have a past history of breast cancer or breast condition, a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, infertility, the first child birth after 35 years, low parity, not breast fed or breast fed for a short period, menopause after 55 years, use of oral contraceptive pills for five years or more, obesity after menopause, high consumption of animal fats, less consumption of fruits and vegetables, less exercise and sedentary life style, consumption of excessive alcohol, active or passive smoking and past exposure to radiation. Cancer surveillance should be done for high risk women as follows.
Annual clinical breast examination by trained primary health care worker from five years before the index case.
Annual mammogram/magnetic resonance imaging surveillance beginning at the age of 35 years, or 5 years earlier than the earliest breast cancer diagnosis in the family. Ovarian surveillance if BRCA1 or 2 mutation positive or family history of ovarian cancer (Pelvic exam, trans-vaginal ultrasound, CA-125 once or twice a year starting at the age of 25 years.), he said.
The breast cancer does not show any clinical features during the early stages. Clinical features appear only with the advancement of the cancer. They are, skin/ colour/ shape changes of the breast, dimpling / indurations of the breast, pseudo orange appearance of the breast (orange peel), ulcer/wound over the breast, nipple change or nipple discharge other than breast milk, breast lump or thickening of the skin over the breast, axillary or cervical lumps ( lymph nods), lumps in the armpits or around the neck, he added.
