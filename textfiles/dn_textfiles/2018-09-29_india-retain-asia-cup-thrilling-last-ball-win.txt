India retain Asia Cup with thrilling last ball win

DUBAI, Friday – Bangladesh fought tooth and nail to win their first Asia Cup but India’s experience helped them in the end to pull off a three-wicket win off the last ball and retain the title which they won in Mirpur in 2016 by eight wickets - when it was staged for the first time in the T20 format - in the final played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday.
A maiden ODI century from opener Liton Das saw Bangladesh to a moderate total of 222 all out. It was a score which India would have overhauled on any given day. But Bangladesh fought like tigers and kept on picking wickets with no one making any substantial contribution.
Skipper Rohit Sharma made 48 and Dinesh Karthik and MS Dhoni scored 37 and 36 respectively.
When Kedar Jadhav was forced to retire hurt with a hamstring injury India required 56 off 12 overs. It was not that Jadhav who was hopping between wickets wanted to leave the field but he was asked to return by signals from within the Indian dressing room because his handicap was depriving India of valuable runs.
It was a good move by India because Bhuvneshwar Kumar no rabbit with the bat who replaced helped Ravindra Jadeja to run the important singles and twos that finally carried India to victory with a partnership of 45.
Although both were dismissed 11 balls of each other Jadeja for 23 and Kumar for 21, Jadhav returned to bat with his leg heavily strapped to guide India to a thrilling win off the last ball.
Bangladesh threw away a golden start to be dismissed for 222 after being put into bat first.
Making a surprise move Bangladesh promoted off-spinner Mehidy Hasan to open the innings with Liton Das and the move proved to be a master stroke as the pair gave their team a dream start by putting together 120 off 125 balls. But once India had made the initial breakthrough by dismissing Mehidy for 32 in the 21st over the rest of the Bangladesh innings fell apart and they were able to manage only a further 102 runs before they were all out.
It was a disappointing end to what promised to be a good total around 300 plus the way Das and Mehidy went about the Indian bowling initially. They provided Bangladesh with their first century opening stand in 27 ODIs.
Das led the Bangladesh charge with a inspiring innings reaching his maiden ODI century off 87 balls with 11 fours and two sixes out of a total of 145.
But the fall wickets at the other end slowed him down and he was eventually dismissed for 121 scored off 117 balls being sixth out at 188 in the 41st over. He was given a ‘life’ at 52 when Chahal running back from midwicket spilled a top edge.
Following Mehidy’s wicket, India pulled back the game to pick up four wickets within the space of 43 balls for 19 runs as the Bangladesh innings went into decline.
Both Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah the two experienced batters in the side in the absence of Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan (both injured) disappointingly holed out in the deep falling to catches by Bumrah and being dismissed for single digit figures.
Soumya Sarkar who dropped down the order tried to get the innings going but after a stand of 31 with Das which was the only other partnership of note in the innings he too found the going tough as the scoring rate dipped dramatically from a healthy six an over to a moderate 4½.
It was the Indian spinners who caused the Bangladesh rout and the Tigers were not helped by the result of three run outs which was a result of India plugging the run rate.
Bangladesh went 10 overs without a boundary that’s how much India took control of the game. The quite period was broken by Sarkar swinging Jadhav across the line for a six over mid wicket but those were only brief moments of the innings where Bangladesh sparkled.
Once the middle order was dismantled by the spinners the opening bowlers returned to put a quick end to the innings.
