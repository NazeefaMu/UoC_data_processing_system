Depression brings on early death

* Men's risk increases by up to three times, while women's peaks at 51 per cent
* Past research links depression to disorders associated with lowered immunity
* Sufferers may also have poor lifestyle habits, such as inactivity and smoking
* The risk of a premature passing is highest in the years after a depressive episode
Men's risk of a premature passing increase three-fold when suffering from the mental health condition, while women's risk is heightened by up to 51 per cent, a study found. Previous research reveals depression causes the release of stress hormones that suppress the immune system, putting sufferers at an increased risk of conditions such as cancer. People with the mental health condition may also be more likely to have unhealthy lifestyle habits, including a poor diet, inactivity and excessive alcohol intake, past studies have shown.
The researchers analyzed 3,410 adults between 1952 and 1967, 1968 and 1990, and 1991 and 2011. The study's participants' had an average age of 50 when the trial started. Results reveal depression increases the risk of an early death by up to three times.
The risk is greatest in the years following a depressive episode. Previous research has linked depression to the release of stress hormones that suppress the immune system, putting sufferers at increased risk of disorders including multiple sclerosis, arthritis and even certain cancers. The mental health condition is more prevalent in women. However, past findings suggest men suffer the effects of it more as they are often less inclined to seek help.
