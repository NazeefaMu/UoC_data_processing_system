Bicentennial Marx

The 200th birth anniversary of Karl Marx was commemorated recently with the third volume of his celebrated work Das Kapital introduced to the Sri Lankan audience.
The third volume is translated into Sinhalese by former Daily News Editor Jayatilleke de Silva. Professor Desmond Mallikarachchi, Dew Gunasekara MP, JVP General Secretary Tilwin Silva and Jayatilleke de Silva delivered special orations. The event was organised by the National Association of Intellectuals.
Das Kapital is a foundational theoretical text in materialist philosophy, economics and politics. Marx aimed to reveal the economic patterns underpinning the capitalist mode of production, in contrast to classical political economists such as Adam Smith, Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill. Marx did not live to publish the planned second and third parts, but they were both completed from his notes and published after his death by his colleague Friedrich Engels.
Das Kapital is the most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950.
