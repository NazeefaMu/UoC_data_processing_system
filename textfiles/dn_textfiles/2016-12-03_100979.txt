Calorie Counter to help international sportspersons

A younger generation of Sri Lankan athletes are taking on more unconventional and novel sporting disciplines that are bringing global recognition to the country, but most of them are self-funded or lacking financial support to take their passion forward.
The latest of such self-motivated success stories comes in the form young power-lifter Dhanushka Kodikara, Gold Medalist at the 2015 Commonwealth Powerlifting Championships in Canada.
Dhanushka represented Sri Lanka at the 2016 World Open Powerlifting Championships organized by the International Powerlifting Federation in Orlando, Florida, USA in mid-November, the first time Sri Lanka was represented at a tournament of such global scale, with the participation of
43 powerlifting countries. Dhanushka went in to the tournament ranked 24th in the world in the 93kg category, and successfully completed his 2016 season ranked 13th at the World Championships.
“Powerlifting is a sport that is rapidly going viral globally, and we need all the support we can get in Sri Lanka to strengthen our efforts to compete on the world stage,” Dhanushka commented. “My passion is what kept
me going, and thankfully, now I have a nutrition partner from Sri Lanka through Calorie Counter. What we would like to see is other businesses and corporates stepping up to support us, because through such partnerships, our success too has become more evident.”
Having pioneered the health food option for health-conscious Sri Lankans, Calorie Counter haslaunched a bid to encourage and support this new wave of emerging athletes by sponsoring them as their Nutritional Partner, demonstrating the significance of a healthy diet and healthier lifestyle that athletes need.
