Joseph Peter, Co-Chairman of the Negombo Zonal Society for the National Fisheries Federation, also spoke at the event expressing his gratitude to Colombo Port City for empowering these fishery associations through the financial grants.

Wattala Urban Council Member Nirmala Fernando and the Secretary of the Negombo Zonal Society for the National Fisheries Federation, speaking at the event said that the Negombo area Women’s Fisheries Societies which had been established amidst many difficulties were an example to Women’s Fisheries Societies across the island, given the way in which they have utilised and managed the monies received by their associations.
