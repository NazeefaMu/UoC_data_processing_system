JAT introduces SEA Kitchens

To minimize the hassle and improve functionality, yet keep the elegant and stylish look of a designer kitchen, JAT Furnishings introduced SEA Kitchens.
Making its debut at the recently concluded Architect’s Exhibition at BMICH, SEA Kitchens now has its own state-of-the-art space at The Colts Building, Castle Street, Colombo 8.
The SEA Signature Kitchen was displayed at the Architect Exhibition 2018. SEA also presented a live test of their unique Plyform Plywood kitchen range made in Germany. Visitors to the stall had the opportunity of witnessing the durability, strength and perfection of the product which is 100% water proof and has a thermal stability up to +150°. The kitchen display was the show stopper at the fair. Alex Sofalvi – Managing Director, Inga Buchholz - Strategic Manager, and Sarah Schmidt - Interior Designer from SEA Kitchens were present at the stall to help visitors truly understand the capabilities of the product. The new showroom space delivers a unique experience to the customer who would want to visualize, touch and feel their personalized kitchen before making the investment. Housing exceptional kitchen designs, the SEA Kitchens showroom designed by JAT Holdings also boasts unparalleled customer service and outstanding quality.
SEA Kitchens’ unique designs use materials and finishes that mirror nature and are inspired by the elements. Glass, ceramic, wood or even lacquer finishes make up bespoke kitchens that truly reflect the personality of the homeowner.
In order to personalize every minute detail of the kitchen unit and ensure adaptability with Sri Lankan conditions, a fully in house stationed, SEA Team with designers, showroom manger and master carpenters all from Germany, will undertake and oversee the installation, logistics and after sales services.
