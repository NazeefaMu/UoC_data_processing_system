Quick pension arrears recovery racket

Commissioner General of Pensions A. Jagath D. Dias has issued a circular to all District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries countrywide, stating that many recently retired government pensioners have been deceived and exploited of their money by a group of certain cunning persons, promising the pensioners that their due arrears and pensions would be obtained for them quickly.
Jagath Dias has told in his circular, that a number of complaints by pensioners countrywide over such deceptions have been reported to his Department by now. Commissioner General of Pensions has pointed out that his Department has not appointed any such authorized officers to visit houses of pensioners to assist them, to get their pension payments very soon by charging fees.
Department of Pensions cannot take the responsibility of such errant and illegal dealings by cunning persons any more, and if any pensioner knows or confronts such cunning persons, they should complain to the nearest Police station immediately or give a call to 119 or 1970, the Commissioner General of Pensions requested all the pensioners of the island.
