DMC to overlook Uma Oya Project

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) was mandated to overlook the matters connected with the Uma Oya Project.
A team of officials from the DMC, the National Building Research Organization (NBRO), the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) and the Peradeniya University Geology Faculty, are working at this centre, on the upper floor of the building for the Uva Radio at Uturu Kembillavela, Bandarawela.
The officials have to look at all aspects of the current phenomena in the Uma Oya Project area during a period of three months and compile reports afterwards for the benefit of the government and the Presidential Secretariat. The President and the Cabinet were instrumental in introducing the specialized centre there, an official said.
