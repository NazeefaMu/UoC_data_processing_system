Performance of Hajj is more than mere rituals

Today Muslims all over the world will be celebrating the conclusion of Hajj by the pilgrims who have indulged in certain rituals in the holy Ka'aba in Mecca and in the desert cities of Mina and Arafah. These are not merely rituals they have a greater significance than what is connoted by the rituals.
For a start, all the male pilgrims, whether they are monarchs or subjects, rich or poor or of whatever social status are attired in two pieces of unsewn white cloth. If they are not attired so, their Hajj will not be accepted. All of them attired in this fashion will have to cicumambulate the sacred Ka'aba and go, while jogging a short distance, between the hillocks of Safa and Marwa, doing both these rites seven times and finally culminating in congregating in the mount Arafah. There is no way that anyone of whatever means can be exempted from this for whatsoever reason if he or she wants to accomplish the Hajj. Only in extreme circumstances where a person with the necessary financial means is bedridden and cannot undertake the journey and partake in these activities can assign a person to perform 'Hajj badal', the pilgrimage on his behalf. This is the only concession and no other.
Promoting social equality and brotherhood
God in His absolute wisdom has made this a massive gathering of people simply attired in the same manner and performing all the rituals everyone on his own to signify that no one is different in the sight of Allah and that everyone has to account for him or herself when risen in the last day similarly attired in the white shroud that he or she was buried in.
Similarly it signifies the promotion of brotherhood as contained the Prophet (PBUH) last sermon in the mount Arafah thus: "All mankind is from Adam and Eve. An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor does a non-Arab have any superiority over an Arab; a white has no superiority over a black, nor does a black have any superiority over a white; [none have superiority over another] except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to yourselves".
Thus, while establishing equality amongst all the people, the Prophet (PBUH) singled out Muslims brotherhood in this sermon.
Respect for women and their rights
In the performance of Hajj women have been given several concessions unlike men. They can dress in any fashionable clothing, as long as they are not revealing and modest and their face, hands below the .... And legs below the ankle are uncovered. They can cover their faces with the niqab if they fear that molestation, but cannot wear any perfume.
Thus the vanity with which women express their passion for fashion has not been curtailed. The Prophet iterated in the strongest terms the rights of women in his last Arafah sermon thus: "O people, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under a trust from God and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste.
Thereby, the combination of factors granting concessions for women to complete their Hajj, even if they become unclean by menstruation recognised and allowed in the Shari'ah provides ample testimony in respect of protection of women and their rights.
Sacrifice and humility
To complete an accepted Hajj all male pilgrims are required either to shave their heads or cut some of their hair. Most of them prefer to shave their head in order to show humility and obedience to God. Female pilgrims are required to cut some of their hair. They are not required to shave. This is another concession for females.
The most important event in the culmination of the Hajj is the sacrifice of an animal - a goat or sheep by one person or a bull or camel by a combination of seven or twelve pilgrims respectively. The meat is distributed to the needy, not only in the place of slaughter, but in any part of the world.
Thus the performance of Hajj may appear to be mere rituals to some people, bu it has a much greater significance as a training ground in universal equality, brotherhood, granting of women's rights sacrifice and humility.
Allah knows best.
