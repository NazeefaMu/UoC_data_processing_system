Hakmana bee-keeping projects making good progress

Bee-keeping projects initiated in the Hakmana Divisional Secretariat area at the Grama Niladari divisional level have made good so far. They include divisions of Pananwela(E), Wepathaera(N), Narawelpita(S), Udupeellegoda(W), Ellewela (E) and Kohuliyadda, and several other divisions as well, sources of the development division of the Hakmana Divisional Secretariat said. As an impetus and encouragement for those engaged in bee-keeping activities, bee boxes, necessary instructions, and technology relating to bee-keeping activities have also been provided to beneficiaries free of charge.
On the progress made by these projects, bee colonies will also be started the other Grama Niladari areas, project officials said. State financial aids are harnessed in this regard.
Provision of good quality bee honey for Ayurvedic medicine and drug manufacturers, as well as the economic empowerment of families participating in these activities, would be the main aim and objective of these endeavours, project officials further added.
