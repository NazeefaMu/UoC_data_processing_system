 Wanton killing of elephants
It is very disturbing to hear about the shooting of tuskers to extract their tusks for business purposes. The latest is the shooting of the most loving animal Dala Puttuwa – that displayed the faunal beauty of this country.
This is a despicable activity perpetrated by some heartless individuals and without any hesitation, the perpetrators must be meted out with a deterrent punishment.
Elephants are a blessing to this small tropical island and some individuals who are ignorant of their faunal value, are attempting to wipeout this magnificent animal from this country.
Tourists take a personal interest to observe the wild elephants at Sri Lanka’s natural habitats.
Of late, the destruction of these animals and their habitats are accelerated by the various activities of man, like encroaching on their natural surroundings for agricultural and other purposes. Thereby, these innocent animals are displaced from their natural habitats and are forced to roam about in desperation.
The number of elephants that have been knocked down by trains are innumerable. Various traps have been placed to harm these animals besides shooting them when they enter villages. The extinction of this animal from the country is inevitable through these blatant acts by people.
It is high time to explore an effective programme to arrest the further shooting of these animals and protect them as they have a right to live in this land.
On an initial step, may I suggest that the field officers of the WildLife Department be converted into a Task Force like in the Congo and establish units in appropriate places to supervise the movements of these animals, along with other wild animals like the Cheetah and Sambhur etc.
