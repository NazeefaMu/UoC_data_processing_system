Wildlife Department records Rs. 3,380 million revenue

“Wildlife Department has been successful in earning a revenue of 3,380 million rupees this year,” said Wildlife and Sustainable Development Ministry Secretary R. M. B. D. B. Meegasmulla, speaking at a media conference held recently in Kurunegala.
The media conference was held under the guidance of Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Wildlife and Sustainable Development and Buddhasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera. He said that this amount of revenue has been earned by Dehiwala Zoo and Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage as both local and foreign tourists visit these places in great numbers nowadays.
He said that about 250 wild elephants and 60 human beings have died tragically due to elephant-human conflict during this year (2017) and all possible measures would be taken to minimize this plight next year (2018) as this Ministry has been allocated with a sum of Rs. 4,474 million for next year from the 2018 budget to carry out its development targets.
