Crackdown on factories producing prohibited polythene

The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) has launched an operation in cracking down on factories that manufacture various types of prohibited polythene countrywide.
CEA Chairman Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri told Daily News in Kurunegala recently that investigation officers of the CEA have been deployed for this by now and after conducting raids of such errant factories, further steps would be taken to nab those who sell such illegal polythene that has posed a grave environmental threat to human life by now.
He said that those who are found guilty of this national crime will have to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 or they have to undergo a jail term of two years or both sentences according to the newly introduced rules and regulations.
Kurunegala senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake confirmed these views and said today (07) in Kurunegala that about 43 officials have been deployed to nab errant polythene manufacturers and sellers in both Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the North Western Province.
