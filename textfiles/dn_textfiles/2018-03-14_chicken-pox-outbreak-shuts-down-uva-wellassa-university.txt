The Uva Wellassa University was closed indefinitely yesterday following an outbreak of Chicken Pox among students, Vice Chancellor Dr. Jayantha Lal Ratnasekara said.
He said during the last three days, 27 students with Chicken Pox were detected in the residential halls while eight other students in outside lodgings too had contracted the disease.
All students had left the university premises for their homes since the closure, he said.
