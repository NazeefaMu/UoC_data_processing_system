Sunshine Holdings to support CCC’s Economic Summit 2018

For the fourth consecutive year, Sri Lanka’s diversified conglomerate Sunshine Holdings will support the country’s premier economic summit, the Economic Summit 2018.
Hosted annually by Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), the foremost economic event of the country will be held on September 12 – 14, 2018 at Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
Organized under the theme ‘On the Fast Track to a Turnaround’, the three-day summit this year is a wholesome opportunity to learn about government plans to develop the Sri Lankan economy (as well as the progress in implementation of plans), to improve business through knowledge enhancement pertaining to relevant sectors, to identify potential sectors and projects for investment in Sri Lanka, and to clarify concerns with key government officials and industry leaders.
As the silver sponsor, brand Sunshine will play a key role by promoting deliberation and discussion on shaping a turnaround for the Sri Lankan economy whilst delving deep into key areas such as trade, investment and services that will help drive the cause.
The Economic Summit brings thought leaders in many spheres – including top economists, foreign and local private sector celebrities, professionals and leading public sector figures onto one platform, to deliberate on and explore solutions on key economic issues of the country. Group Managing Director, Vish Govindasamy speaking of the sponsorship, said, “Sunshine Holdings takes pride in supporting an event of the calibre of the Sri Lanka Economic Summit, a premier thought leadership forum in the country which generates much needed dialogue on issues which are critical to the evolution of the Sri Lankan economy. As a responsible entrepreneur, who has shaped Sri Lanka’s economic drive over the last five decades, we extend our fullest support to the Sri Lanka Economic Summit and we look forward to this year’s event with great anticipation.”
In addition to supporting the ‘Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2018’ through the sponsorship, Sunshine Holdings will also contribute towards intellectual discourse at the event with its Group Managing Director, Vish Govindasamy participating as the Deputy Vice Chairman of the CCC at the 7th session of the event—a high-level panel discussion on the findings of the summit and how to take them forward.
Sunshine Holdings PLC is a diversified holding company contributing to ‘nation building’ by creating value in vital sectors of the Sri Lankan economy – including healthcare, agribusiness, fast moving consumer goods and renewable energy.
The group, which provides employment to approximately 10,000, generates over US$ 138 million in revenue.
