LAUGFS Gas Partners with Colombo City Centre

LAUGFS Gas has come into an exclusive arrangement with Colombo City Centre’s upcoming mall to provide LPG to all its restaurants and food outlets. With the development of Sri Lanka’s first Board of Investment (BOI) approved mixed-use development project, LAUGFS Gas, the only private sector energy player in the local LPG market, recently announced a partnership with the Colombo City Centre mall.
Colombo City Centre Chief Executive Officer, Anand Sundaram said, “We are delighted to have LAUGFS Gas on board with us. As Sri Lanka’s leading energy specialist, LAUGFS Gas operates with superior service excellence, which complements our vision of creating the first international quality mall of Colombo as the city transforms into a world-class megapolis”.
A highly anticipated addition to the capital’s fast-developing skyline, Colombo City Centre is launching its international mall this season and is slated for completion of the hotel and residencies in early 2019.
The USD 180 million joint venture between local retail giant Abans and Singapore-based Next Story Group is one of Sri Lanka’s largest foreign direct investments in recent times, and rises 47 storeys above the heart of the city. Honoured as the ‘Best Mixed Use Development’ by PropertyGuru Asia, ‘Most Promising Mixed Use Development’ by CMO Asia, ‘Asia’s Greatest Brand’ by AsiaOne Magazine and ‘Upcoming Mall of the Year’ among several other accolades by The Golden Globe Tigers, Colombo City Centre is set to be a multi-award-winning development, dedicated towards transforming Sri Lanka’s capital into a global metropolis with the first integrated lifestyle complex of its kind.
This includes Sri Lanka’s first international mall with high-end brands, a 700-seat food court, a six-screen multiplex cinema, the upscale NEXT Hotel® with 164 keys and 192 luxurious residential units designed to offer unmatched views of the city, Beira Lake and the Indian Ocean.
Commenting on the partnership, LAUGFS Gas General Manager - Sales and Marketing, Muditha Adikari said, “The partnership will strengthen market opportunities in the LPG industry ensuring that LAUGFS Gas continues to cater to future LPG demands more effectively. LAUGFS Gas has partnered with Colombo City Centre to provide unmatched service and expertise to spearhead its energy requirements.” “As the nation’s energy specialist, LAUGFS Gas will carry out LPG system improvements, technical evaluations, integrity and compliance audits to periodically inspect and report system vulnerabilities and imminent risks. An in-house engineering team delivers 24-hour emergency responses to ensure safe handling of LPG systems and repair LPG accessories. Providing LPG systems for Colombo City Centre emphasises the drive to continue meeting commercial LPG requirements through a variety of downstream initiatives,” he said.
As a truly Sri Lankan energy company with over 6,500 dealers and 31 distributors, LAUGFS Gas delivers customised LPG solutions to local customers, and was the first ever energy company to be listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange with an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2010.
Providing customised energy solutions with unparalleled service using in-house expertise, LAUGFS Gas sets the benchmark in the local LPG industry.
