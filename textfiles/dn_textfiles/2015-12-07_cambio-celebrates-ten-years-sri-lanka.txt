Cambio celebrates ten years in Sri Lanka

Cambio organized a celebration at Ramada Hotel, Colombo, in honor of the company's 10th anniversary in Sri Lanka recently.
Cambio Healthcare Systems is an e-Health company headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. The company counts over 400 software professionals who develop Cambio COSMIC, comprehensive and easy-to-use software solutions for healthcare providers.
In late 2004, Cambio established a small dedicated team in Sri Lanka with Creative Solutions, one of the country's leading software development and outsourcing companies. The team initially counted five members, however, that number increased to over 80 in only five years.
Based on the success of their Sri Lankan team, Cambio established their own subsidiary in Sri Lanka in 2010. Today, Cambio SL counts well over 200 employees.
"Creative Solutions has brought numerous clients to Sri Lanka over the past couple of decades," said the Director of Creative Solutions, Sushena Ranatunga.
"By February 2016, we expect to see Cambio SL's office expand to 255 employees and I cannot express how proud we are to have contributed to the creation of such opportunities for Sri Lankan talent." According to Ranatunga and Jayawardena, the crucial factor behind Cambio SL's success is the expertise of Sri Lankan IT professionals that have joined Cambio over the past 10 years.
To reward some of their longest-serving staff members, Cambio Sri Lanka gifted the latest iPad models to 8 of their employees who celebrated 10 years with the company. Another 38 of their employees were also recognized for completing 5 years at Cambio SL this year.
Peter Cornelius, Head of R&D for Cambio Healthcare Systems AB, Sweden, flew to Sri Lanka exclusively to attend Cambio Sri Lanka's 10 year anniversary.
In his speech he reflected on the past 10 years of Cambio's operations in Sri Lanka and summarized the company's plan for the next few years.
"Looking ahead," continued Cornelius, "Cambio will work on developing new features to extend our software solutions. We are planning further expansions of our Swedish, Danish and UK offices, as well as our Sri Lankan operations."
Cornelius concluded that it is Cambio Sri Lanka team's loyalty and commitment that has made the company's success possible.
