Abduction and killing of five youths: UPFA MP attempted to influence IGP to stop investigations
UPFA National List MP Malith Jayathilake accompanied by another person met the IGP and influenced him to stop CID investigations into the abducting and killing of five youth in Dehiwala that took place in 2008, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake charged.
Speaking at the Parliamentary debate yesterday, he said the IGP had then summoned CID SSP Shani Abeysekara and inquired about the investigations in front of the MP and the other person.
The MP pointed out that the move was a deliberate attempt to stall the on-going investigations into the above abductions committed for obtaining ransoms under the cover of war.
The MP further charged that the Government was trying to discourage investigations into the killings of senior journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga and ruggerite Wasim
Thajudeen, abductions of Prageeth Ekneligoda and Keith Noyahr and attacks on Upali Thennakoon and Poddala Jayantha.
He said the Government was defending those responsible in these crimes.
The MP further accused that the IGP had taken back about 100 complaints he himself referred to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), adding that serious doubts have been raised whether this move was meant to deter investigations.
He pointed out that the FCID was not given any new investigation for the last several months. He also raised concerns over the transfer of the FCID Director to Moneragala without any reasons. “He was an experienced senior officer who provided leadership to the investigations and he should not have been transferred until the end of investigations. The new Director will have to study all cases from the start,” he added.
The MP pointed out that those in the Government who came to power with the pledge of taking a hard line on corruption, bribery, fraud and waste, were now trying to stall investigations.
Complaints made by the Top Ten disregaded: JO MP
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian D V Chanaka said that ten complaints have been made by way of the top ten, but no steps have been taken against any.
He made these observations while joining the debate on the motion for revision of limits of Bribery Raids Advance Accounts.
This government came to power saying it would bring about good governance. "The biggest fraud that had been committed in the country is the Treasury Bond issue," D V Chanaka said. "But Arjuna Alosious is being granted more facilities to engage in businesses. He was allowed to commence an Ethanol Company. He was also allowed to commence a company in the East free of tax. How does this happen under a good governance government," he questioned.
He added that there was an allegation against the Finance Minister for importing 700 Prado jeeps by undervaluing. He added that the Finance Minister had caused a Rs 10 billion damage to the country. But without investigating into this allegation, Customs officers had been charged.
Payment of Electricity Bills: A disparity that should be rectified
Nearly half the population who contribute for the production and promotion of the national economy are compelled to shoulder the burden of the other half when they pay their electricity bills owing to the relief provided to those who consume less than 90 units of electricity per month, said Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday responding to a question raised by UNP Parliamentarian Ajith Mannapperuma in Parliament during the round of questions for oral answers.
The Deputy Minister said that there were 6.5 million electricity consumers and nearly half – 2.8 million of consumers use less than 90 units per month.
“It is unfair for the consumers who use electricity for production purposes to contribute immensely for the development of the national economy to pay for others electricity bills just because the latter consume less than 90 units a month," the Deputy Minister said. "Currently, around Rs 18 to 19 was spent to produce a unit. Those who use less than 90 units need to pay only four rupees per unit as relief provided to them. Their balance is covered by those who use more than that," he said.
The Deputy Minister also said that it was unfair and a new mechanism was needed. He added that the entire nation should discuss this disparity and unjust that was meted to those who really do some work.
Govt. to increase renewable energy generation by 1,000 MW: Ajith P. Perera
The government has taken measures to increase the renewable energy generation by 1,000 MW during the next five years, said Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ajith P Perera.
He made this observation yesterday, in response to a question raised by UNP Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara Jayamaha during the round of questions for oral answers.
He also said that the government had reached a policy decision to allow the private sector to engage in renewable energy generation and to make transmission by purchasing the product under competitive billing. He however added that the government had planned to set up the Mannar 100 MW wind power plant with a loan taken from the Asian Development Bank.
He also said that the government had decided to replace the license system by the tender issuing system to grant the setting up of these power plants.
Responding to another question raised by UNP MP Ajith Mannapperunma, Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera said the Treasury was paying the loan taken to construct the Norochcholai Coal Power plant, adding that the Treasury settled a US$ 87 million and US$ 25.8 million as loan premium and interest in 2015 to the Chinese Exim Bank. He added that the government had paid US$ 94.7 million and US$ 23.6 million as loan interest in 2016. He added that the income earned by the CEB through the sale of products of the coal power plant was included under the income of the loan premiums and interest paid by the government on the construction of the coal power plant which was not included under the expenditure head which he accepted as some what strange.
Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera responding to a question raised by Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, said the objection against the construction of the Kuruganga small medium hydro power plant had been directed before a Special Committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena. He added if the damage caused by the same power plant was higher than the benefits, the plant would not be constructed.
