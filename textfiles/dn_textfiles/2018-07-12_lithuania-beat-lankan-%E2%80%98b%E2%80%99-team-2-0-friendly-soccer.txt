Lithuania beat Lankan ‘B’ team 2-0 in friendly soccer

The International two-match friendly soccer series between Sri Lanka and Lithuania concluded when Lithuania won the second match against Sri Lanka ‘B’ team by 2-0 played at the Race Cause grounds yesterday after leading 1-0 at half time. Earlier on Sunday visiting Lithuania team drew with Sri Lanka national team in a scoreless opener before the Lankan National team commence their friendly series tour to Japan.
Lithuania netted first goal in the 28 Minutes of the game when Laurynas Stonkus booted the goal after receiving the ball from Simon Urbys inside the penalty line.
Sri Lanka ‘B’ had several scoring opportunities but strong Lithuanian defence line did not allow Lankans to penetrate the defence. Lankans failed to come up with a good teamwork and poor accuracy in passing cost few scoring chances.
In the second half Lithuania did not attack hard and played a defencive game as Lankan did not able to pose a threat. In the sixteenth minute of the game Lithuanians got into action again when a corner kick converted to a goal with a superb head shot by their striker Lukas Artimavicius.
Former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara graced the occasion as the chief guest.
