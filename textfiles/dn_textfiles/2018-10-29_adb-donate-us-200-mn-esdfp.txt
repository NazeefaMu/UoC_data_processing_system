Figures provided by the Ministry of Education also showed that there was an increase in the number of students who opted to follow the Technology stream for the GCE Advance Level. In 2015 when technology was introduced only 13,452 students had taken the challenge of following the new stream while 18800 students had enrolled in 2017.
Students who select technology have the choice of either following Engineering Technology (ET) or Bio System Technology (BST) and offer Engineering Technology, Information & Communication Technology (ICT), Science for Technology (ST) and Bio Science Technology (BST) as subjects for the Advanced Level examination. “At present 25% of the marks is for practical projects and it would be increased to 40% in the future”, said Rathnayaka Karunasiri, Program Head of the ESDP.
“We would have had to face many problems if the Asian Development Bank did not support the initiative to introduce technology for the GCE Advanced Level,” said Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary to the Ministry of Education. “As the loan scheme is extremely flexible and is Result Based Lending (RBL) we have the freedom to set our own targets and funds would be released only if we achieve them”, he added.
“It is the Ministry of Education that has to present the Education Sector Development Framework Program (ESDFP) and the ADB and the World Bank has agreed to support it. In this instance the ESDFP was US$4.9 billion of which the ADB has agreed to give US$ 200 million and the disbursement would be achieving the key results”, said Herathbanda Jayasundera, Social Development Officer of the Asian Development Bank’s Sri Lanka mission who is in charge of coordinating the program.
“Increasing the performance at the GCE O/L and GCE A/L was one such goal and statistics made available by the Ministry Of Education showed that there has been a gradual increase in the pass rate each year,” Jayasundera added.
Narandeniya Central is a mixed 1AB secondary school situated in Kamburupitiya in the Matara District and has 2340 students on roll and a teaching staff of 108. Of the 795 students enrolled to the GCE Advanced Level more than a third had opted to follow course of studies in the technological stream which was introduced to the school curriculum in 2013.

Narandeniya Central College was one of the schools that introduced the technological stream for the GCE Advanced Level when it was introduced and has been able to make remarkable progress as well as achieve commendable results.
Ishan Madhushanka and Prabodha Nishadhi were two among the many who excelled at the GCE Advanced Level in 2017. Ishan was ranked 2nd in the district while Prabodha was ranked third.
