On invitation from the French Agency for Development (AFD), an official delegation headed by M. I. M. Rafeek, Secretary to the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs is now visiting the Reunion Island.

Martin Parent, AFD Country Director, commenting on the proposed visit said that “AFD, a partner to Sri Lanka in key sectors such as drinking water and sanitation, energy, urban development and irrigation, organizes this trip for a delegation of officials to have peer to peer discussions on the solutions developed by Reunion Island which faces similar opportunities and constraints: how to increase the share of renewable energies in an isolated power grid, how to invest sustainably in collective waste water treatment schemes, how to plan sustainable urban development in coastal tourist areas”.
This visit will be an opportunity to be in contact with the highest Authorities of the Reunion Island, with a view to fostering cooperation between Sri Lanka and the Reunion Island.
Discussions are also planned with the business community of Reunion Island to present them key infrastructure development projects to be implemented in Sri Lanka under PPP basis.
