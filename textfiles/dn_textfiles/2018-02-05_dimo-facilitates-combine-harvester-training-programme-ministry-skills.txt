DIMO facilitates Combine Harvester training  programme for Ministry of Skills Development

The inauguration ceremony for the second batch of students of the Combine Harvester training programme was held recently at DIMO Na Sevana Technical training academy.
This programme is an initiative of the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training and is funded by the Asian Development Bank. Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO) signed an agreement with the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training to train 150 Combine Harvester Operators under the Ministry’s Employment Linked Training Programme (ELTP).
This event was graced by the presence of DIMO Chief Human Resources Officer Dilrukshi Kurukulasuriya, representatives from the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training, Premasiri Kandawela Assistant Program Manager, Samudra Subasinghe Assistant Procurement Specialist and Nandana Sooriyaarachchi Assistant Procurement Specialist.
Assistant Director Deepal Samaranayake from the Vocational Training Authority Monaragala was among the guests.
The strong and extended partnership between the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training and DIMO has enabled the successful completion of the first batch of students for the combine harvester training programme and to move on to inaugurating the second batch subsequently. This initiative aims to ensure employability of the youth in the country and address the skill gaps faced in the industry. It is envisaged to improve and align the skills development with relevant industry requirements and the employment aspirations of youth in Sri Lanka.
DIMO hopes to continue this initiative and others with the collaboration of the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational training in the years to come.
