In tune with the infinite

The rain had hardly been experienced in this area. The heat has been almost deadly. But as you enter Chamara’s little palace, you will feel as if you have entered an icy courtyard owing to its high roof.
Chamara Nayanajith runs a small-scale fruit business in Gampaha with his wife Gayani Dinusha. But he would never forget to visit his hometown, a little village deep inside Horowpathana, Anuradhapura, to cultivate his paddy field. If the fruit stall is his source of income, paddy cultivation is his passion. When the paddy cultivation season dawns, Chamara would drive his tuk tuk the whole way to Anuradhapura with his wife.
Is paddy cultivation actually worth being passionate about?
As you drive a few kilometres from Anuradhapura to Horowpathana, you will come across this lesser known village called Rasnakavewa. The villagers have an unwritten custom. They would never enjoy the harvest without offering a share to the temple. Rasa noka dun vewa, which means offered without tasting in Sinhala, was gradually rephrased as Rasnakavewa. The area is residence to about 200 villagers. The younger generation is slowly moving to Colombo in search of posh employment, while their parents and grandparents have settled down comfortably with farming.
Chamara’s parents belong to that generation. They had no source of income other than paddy cultivation. They have raised their four children, of which Chamara is the youngest, solely on paddy income. Even today well into eighties, the elderly parents find themselves fit enough to work and walk around without an aide.
Even under the scorching sun, Rasnakavewa glistens with greenery. The villagers have concerns such as settling the debts after investing heavily on the paddy-fields. But still they find the life comfortable as they do not have any other worries. Rasnakavewa reminds us the fact that the village that we witnessed in fiction is still alive in Sri Lanka.
Make a trip to Rasnakavewa during the cultivation period, and you will witness how the farmers use the traditional methods. Some farmers slowly have moved on to modern machinery like tsunami, while some opt not to use pesticides. Rasnakavewa is blessed with a temple where only a few monks reside. The villagers are not bothered about their spiritual life. As long as the monks dwell there, the villagers would continue to nourish them. The temple is home to caves as well as inscriptions which journeys you to the past.
“There is a huge difference between life we spend here and Gampaha. In Gampaha we are constantly on the move. We have to focus on the business because of the competition. But here we hardly have any competition,” Gayani draws parallels between two lifestyles in her four-year old marriage.
In Gampaha, Gayani and Chamara would never get an opportunity to have a meal together. In Anuradhapura, they share only one plate, as they have ample time. Gayani’s house in Anuradhapura is not without the traces of modernity. They are privileged with electricity, though mobile phone reception is still a luxury.
The village life is not comfortable like that in Colombo and suburbs. Hospitals and national schools within close proximity is a dream here. Yet Chamara and Gayani crave to spend time here for many reasons. Life without Rasnakavewa is inconceivable for her. She lives her life in Rasnakavewa.
“We breathe properly here. In Gampaha we have to check everything. We have work here. But we have enough time to relax too.”
Chamara hopes to buy a paddy mill and settle down in Anuradhapura. He would hand down the business in Gampaha to his relatives and would permanently find shelter in Anuradhapura.
The trip to Rasnakaweva is not a little one. It takes about six hours. And at the end of the journey, you will feel dead tired. But that tiredness would not last. The lush greenery and the shady warmth will take the tiredness away soon. And all those noises deposited in your head will be restored into silence with the restricted tones of birds and other creatures of nature. Those plain-clothed villagers will offer you a warm greeting albeit slightly bewildered as Colombans are a rare sight in this part of the country.
Once you speak a word or two, it is not difficult to find a chatterbox or two. They would willingly enlighten you about the traditional methodologies. Throw one question, and you will be answered in dozen voices.
What is more welcoming is the brisk gusts of ice-like wind that would blow across your body.
Chamara would say nothing when the villagers explain something. Chamara’s marriage to Gayani was an offshoot of a longstanding love affair. But that love affair required a proper place to spark. Rasnakavewa is the only probable place where their post-marital love would bloom.
And for you, it is one of the few spots on earth that fill your mind with the earthly orchestra.
