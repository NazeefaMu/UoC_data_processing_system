Teachers at overstaffed national schools to get transfers

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has instructed Secretary to the Ministry Sunil Hettiarachchi that all teachers without timetables at national schools should be given transfers to other state schools to fill vacancies at them.
Accordingly, newly-recruited teachers passed out from national colleges of education will be transferred to national schools with vacancies.
Many teachers appointed to national schools in October last year are reportedly idling now without timetables at their schools as they are over-staffed, Kurunegala District Senior Education Director W.M.Balasooriya said.
He said that about 2,275 teachers will get transfers accordingly. The Secretary to the Ministry has planned to transfer schoolteachers who have completed eight-year term at the same school.
About 12,000 teachers had completed 10-year service continuously at one school last year.
