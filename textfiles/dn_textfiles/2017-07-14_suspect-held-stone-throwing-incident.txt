Suspect held in stone throwing incident

Doctor's wife and another injured:
One suspect has been taken into custody in connection with a stone throwing incident at Sittandy junction on Tuesday in Eravur.
The stone throwing had injured the wife of a doctor attached to the Batticaloa hospital and another person and damaged the doctor's car and a lorry, Eravur Police sources said.
Police said the doctor and his family had travelled from Colombo on their way to Batticaloa followed by a lorry carrying their household goods when some persons hurled stones at the two vehicles on Thursday.
The doctor, in a complaint to police, had said when they were passing Sittandy junction, some one jumped across the road dangling a sword. When he drove past ignoring his warning to stop, stones were hurled at the car and the lorry. Police said interrogation of the suspect revealed that he is a mental patient addicted to liquor.
