Alleged fraudulent investment of CBSL officer revealed

Former Bank of Ceylon Chief Dealer J.D.K. Dharmapala yesterday said that an officer of the Central Bank appeared at the Bank of Ceylon to invest on Treasury bonds at a rate of 12.5 on the day prior to the questioned Treasury bond auction that took place on February 27, 2015.
The CBSL officer came to the BOC on February 26, 2015, and forwarded an application to invest on Treasury bonds. He brought Rs. 750,000 for the said investment.
These revelations came into being yesterday at the Presidential Commission.
Asked if he could assume that the said Central Bank officer had insider information regarding the Treasury bond issuance which was to happen the next day, Dharmapala said he felt so at a later stage.
“The rate he requested for the Treasury bonds were 12.5, which was the same rate that the Central Bank accepted the bids the following day. I felt rather suspicious when this application was made, but I did not pay serious attention to it. I disregarded the application thinking that it was ‘insane’ to invest at such a rate,” Dharmapala said.
“I received the information that such a CBSL officer came to invest on Treasury bonds through a BOC’s Back Office lady officer. I requested her to let the CBSL officer know that we cannot accommodate such an investment,” he added.
Asked if the same CBSL officer has done any investments on previous occasions on Treasury bonds, Dharmapala said, the person had not. However, Dharmapala said, the CBSL officer invested in Treasury bills at previous occasions.
Dharmapala said, he never thought that the Central Bank would accept the bids that came in for higher rates for the Treasury bond auction that took place on February 27, 2015. He said, from his professional experience, that he thought the Central Bank would accept bids which have come at rates less than a 10%. The former Chief Dealer Dharmapala is to testify before the Presidential Commission on June 9.
Senior State Council Dr. Avanti Perera led evidence for the day.
