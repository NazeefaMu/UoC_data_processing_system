Morning in the bowl of night

There are several genres categorised in the literary domain. In the evaluation of works of art, the critics attempt to study, investigate and interpret the rich and varied shades of meaning generated by them. The craft of imaginative writing is observed in all forms of literature.
A high degree of craftsmanship in the imaginative application of suitable linguistic forms is observed in areas such as theme, title, the point of view, discourse, planning, construction, organisation, dialogue, setting, characterization, plot and style so forth. The pragmatic critical approach is focused on the communicated meaning by the artistic creation and this discipline is none other than Pragmatic – the study of meaning.
Pragmatic criticism is not myopic but offers a large scale view of evaluation. It supports the other forms of critical activity. The justification of pragmatic criticism is that by appropriate, relevant, thoughtful and creative application of linguistic knowledge, it is possible to unlock insightful, stimulating new meanings generated from an artistic creation.
In poetry, for instance, the meaning is not literal. There could be various shades and levels of meaning such as indexical, referential, symbolical, preferential, metaphorical, implicational, inferential, logical and cryptical meaning. In poetry more gets communicated than is said. The use of language involves a high degree of creativity.
Human experience and conversation too are infinite. The process of putting linguistic units cannot be divorced from the process of putting together conceptual units, and the ways in which such conceptual combinations produce meaning that is infinitely variable. In this sense, language is able to cope up with the infinite variability, and open indebtedness of human experience is precisely the fact that it does not make use of finite means.
Notions of pragmatic competence, construal (different linguistic forms that produce the same meaning) perspective (point of view), foregrounding (highlighting a specific component in an event), metaphor (a device that involves one domain of experience in terms of another) and frame (background knowledge) often interact to produce significant and meaningful implications and entailments. All these effects are the products of linguistic application in genre or kitsch. Kitsch is used to describing objects or works of art that are very elaborate and often very colourful. Kitsch is also used to describe any art to literature which is pretentious or in bad taste,
‘Awake! For Morning in the Bowl of Night
Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:
And Lo! The Hunter of the East has caught
The Sultan’s Turret in a Noose of Light’.
The opening poem of Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (Edward Fitzgerald’s First Version) presents a scenario of someone still asleep being motivated to rise up in the morning. It is essentially a speech event woven around a speech act. The speech act is “Awake! It’s morning’ a directive as well as a declarative with a communicative purpose (illocutionary act) and it produces an effect on the listener (perlocutionary effect)to rise up or to continue sleeping. In the last two lines, there is also another speech act which is expressive. Expressing surprise (The Sun has caught the Sultan’s Turret in a ray of light). But the poet has used figurative language in the entire verse.
