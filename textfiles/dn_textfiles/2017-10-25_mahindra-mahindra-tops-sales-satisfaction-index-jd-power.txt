The 2017 India Sales Satisfaction Index (Mass Market) Study is based on responses from 7,831 new-vehicle owners, who purchased vehicles between September 2016 and April 2017. Mahindra & Mahindra ranked highest in the sales satisfaction index, followed by Toyota and Ford.
The 2017 India Sales Satisfaction Index (Mass Market) Study is based on responses from 7,831 new-vehicle owners, who purchased vehicles between September 2016 and April 2017.
The study examined six factors that contributed to overall customer satisfaction with their new-vehicle purchase experience in the mass market segment. In order of impact on overall sales satisfaction, those factors are sales initiation (17 per cent); dealer facility (17 per cent); deal and paperwork (17 per cent); delivery timing (17 per cent); salesperson (16 per cent); and delivery process (16 per cent).
According to the press statement issued by JD Power, the overall sales satisfaction index for the industry improves significantly: Overall satisfaction increases by 31 points (on a 1,000-point scale) from 2016. Key factors contributing to this improvement include a higher implementation rate on process standards; an increase in the number of amenities made available at dealer facilities; and a drop in pressures and problems experienced by customers during the shopping experience.
