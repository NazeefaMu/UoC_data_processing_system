‘A government urgently needed’

The country urgently needs a government, Hambantota district Parliamentarian Mahinda Amaraweera said recently.
“We cannot afford to have this unstable situation and we need any government in the coming year. The matter should be resolved this week.”
He was speaking at a ceremony at Batatha to distribute livelihood equipment to low-income people in the Ambalantota divisional secretary area, with Indian government aid.
“The present situation in the country is regrettable. Policy stability should be urgently restored. Only then can we have an election. We have to think of the country and not personal power. It is the duty of all politicians,” Amaraweera said.
