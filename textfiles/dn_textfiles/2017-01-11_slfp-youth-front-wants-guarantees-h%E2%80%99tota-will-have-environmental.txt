SLFP Youth Front wants guarantees H’tota will have environmental friendly factories

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front (SLFPYF) requested President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday to consider if the factories that are to be set up in the Hambantiota Industrial Zone are environmental friendly or if they were on the banned list in China.
SLFPYE president Shantha Bandara made this request at a press conference at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters.
He added that setting up of factories in the industrial zone is commendable but said they have to be cautious about factories that are to be set up in the country. Bandara said there are many factories banned by China, Japan and India in their countries due to environmental factors.
“There are more than 50 types of factories banned in Beijing, by the Chinese government and environmentalists,” Bandara said. “Even the the internet contains information on them.” He added that the President as the Environment Minister should take decisions that would not affect the environment. Bandara said it was great expectations that the industrial zones are being set up in the country but these zones should be green industrial zones.
SLFP Youth Front media Secretary Asanka Ediriweera also spoke.
