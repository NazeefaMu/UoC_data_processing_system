Rs. 400 million to develop mushroom farming in Kegalle

The Saemaul Global Foundation of South Korea and the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council have launched a joint programme to propagate mushroom cultivation in the Kegalle District. The South Korean Government has granted Rs. 400 million for the project, Provincial Council's press officer Denzil Weerasuriya said.
The project is already in progress in Pitiyagama, Hewadiwela, and Walpola in Kegalle, he added. Another village would be included in the project which has already enrolled nearly 500 families in the district. Their products would be marketed countrywide under the auspices of a leading commercial firm.
Mushroom co-operative unions would also be established in each village for community empowerment. Steps would also be taken to develop infrastructure and sports facilities in these villages and conduct Korean language training classes as well. Several groups of people would also be sent to Korea for a training in mushroom cultivation.
A mushroom seed production centre built at Apegama in Rambukkana, Pinnawala was opened on November 12. The Sabaragamuwa provincial Council had spent Rs. 5 million to set up this centre. The opening ceremony was attended by Sabragamuwa Province governor Niluka Ekanayake, former Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya South Korean delegate Kin Hank young and project Director Park Byng Kyn and other officials.
