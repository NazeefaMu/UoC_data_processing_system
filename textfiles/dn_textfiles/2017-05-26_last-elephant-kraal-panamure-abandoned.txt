Last elephant kraal at Panamure abandoned

The last elephant kraal at Panamure where the wild elephant known as Panamure Eth Raja sacrificed his life now remains abandoned without maintenance.
The monument with the statue of the elephant is facing destruction because there is no one to maintain it, residents said.
They added that the fence setup around the elephant kraal using large logs is now facing destruction. This area comes under the purview of the Maduwanwela Walawwa Nindagam. The Panamure Eth Gala was set up in 1950, according to chronicles.
