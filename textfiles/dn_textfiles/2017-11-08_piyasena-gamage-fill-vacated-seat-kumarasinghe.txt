Piyasena Gamage to fill vacated seat by Kumarasinghe

The United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) yesterday, decided to nominate former Minister Piyasena Gamage to fill the seat in Parliament left vacant following the court verdict against Geetha Kumarasinghe. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal verdict that UPFA Galle district Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe was disqualified to be a Member of Parliament as she was a holder of dual-citizenship. Former Minister Piyasena Gamage had successfully sought the permission of the court to become a respondent in the case as he was next in line to fill the vacated MP seat by Kumarasinghe.
