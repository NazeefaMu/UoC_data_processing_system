Hellibees Racing, energised by Wild Elephant, triumphs in 2017

The Hellibees Racing team has completed yet another record setting year where it has revolutionised Sri Lankan motor sports. The team has been energised by Elephant House’s Wild Elephant, its Energising Partner, for the second consecutive year.
Famously “Ready for Anything”, Elephant House’s Wild Elephant empowers you with the guts and confidence to be prepared for anything, allowing you to step up your game and win in any situation. Sharing Hellibees’ passion for racing, Wild Elephant has taken an active role in the development of young drivers and riders, while also fostering the fearlessness and confidence that is vital for winning.
Throughout the year, Hellibees riders have also been recognised as National Champions in the 600cc, 250cc, 250cc Super Motard and Open events, while additionally winning the Open Super Motard National Championship and the SLADA Grand Prix.
The team also dominated the most recent Katukurunda Circuit Meet.
In one of 2017's most impressive feats, Hellibees rider Hansika Abeysinghe, the only woman participating this year, won all her events in the 125cc and 150cc categories. Her Hellibees teammates Shoel Daniel, Sangeeth Suriyage, Mohamed Shazan, Lathika Shamal, Chandima Goonaratne, Andrew Choksy, Michael Wijesuriya and Janaka Dias also performed superbly on the tarmac.
In its first ever year competing off road, Hellibees participated in 10 events where its youngest riders Minuka and Ruvinu Ratnayake proved their worth, with Minuka winning all his under 10 events and being adjudged best rider.
Nisala Jayasundara, new to the under 13 events, scored several podium finishes and Bhanuka Rathnayake, competing in the under 16 championship, took 2nd and 3rd place multiple times. Ishan Dassanayake, riding in the 125cc category, came back from injury to win many races.
Commenting, the team’s Founder Murad Ismail said, “Hellibees Racing completed another successful year together with our partners and sponsors. This year, Hellibees Racing ventured into gravel racing with the main goal to give young racing talent a start in their career in motor cross, before they go to tarmac. Hellibees Racing, energised by Wild Elephant, also engages in several other sports and activities and will launch our life style brand in the near future.”
“Wild Elephant is pleased to have supported Hellibees in successfully closing out another racing year. Our partnership has gone a long way in re-energising the sport of motor racing in Sri Lanka, especially keeping its popularity alive for our fans. We also commend the guts on display in this sport, which is an idea that is in line with Wild Elephant’s own energetic mindset,” said Head of Marketing – Elephant House Beverages, Mevan Peiris.
