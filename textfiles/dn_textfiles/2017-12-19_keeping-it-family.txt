Coco
Keeping it in the family

Strumming a time tested tune and flowing along a familiar theme Disney-Pixar has brought yet another family based animation movie to the picture in the form of ‘Coco’.
This coming of age story which is directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina the story centers on Miguel whom dreams of becoming a musician like his idol Ernesto de la Cruz. Based in Mexico, we are introduced to the Rivera family who makes shoes for a living. However everyone in the family despises anything that has to do with music and had banned it from their roots for generations. The reason for this is a mystery. Desperate to prove his talent, Miguel finds himself in the stunning and colorful Land of the Dead following a mysterious chain of events.
One of ‘Coco’s strongest points lie in its vibrant visuals. The beautiful backdrops are a palette of florescent greens, blues, yellows and oranges. There is rich detail and emotion in every frame, from the folds of Dante’s hairless body, the textures of the skeletons to the wrinkles in Miguel’s great-grandmother’s face and the vibration of plucked guitar strings. In one episode the detailed animation captures even the thin film of water on Miguel’s red sweatshirt, as well as the flickering light of the candles lit to welcome the spirits of the dead to this world.
Another plus factor lies in the fact that at times children have to choose between pursuing their dreams and their family. This topic relates to every child who is wishing to follow his or her dream and also for adults to look back on their childhood pursuits with nostalgia. This makes it a film which is a journey as much for its protagonist as it is for the audience.
Plenty of wisecracks follow and some of them are genuinely funny. The tunes too are quite infectious so you might find yourself humming them at leisure. ‘Coco’ might not be Pixar’s best product and though their recent productions seem monotonous, one fact remains stable in almost all their work. They have the ability to address the audience’s emotions and thus, the films are quite watchable.
Though there is hardly anything unique about ‘Coco’ one cannot help liking it because of its generous, heartfelt essence. Plus though it is much hackneyed, it is also an apt tribute to the importance of family ties.
