Welikada Prison killings:
IP Rangajeewa granted bail

Police Narcotics Bureau IP Neomal Rangajeewa, arrested and remanded on suspicion for allegedly being involved in the killing of 27 prisoners during the prison riots which took place at the Welikada Prison in 2012, was granted bail by the Court of Appeal.
A Court of Appeal two-judge-bench bench comprising Justice (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara ordered the suspect to be released on a cash bail of Rs.100,000 with two sureties of Rs.200,000.
The Court of Appeal made this order taking into consideration a revision application filed by IP Rangajeewa seeking bail over a magisterial inquiry into the Welikada killings. The court also issued an order preventing the suspect from leaving the country.
However, former Prisons Department Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa, who is in remand custody over the same incident, will have to remain in remand custody until his revision application is considered.
