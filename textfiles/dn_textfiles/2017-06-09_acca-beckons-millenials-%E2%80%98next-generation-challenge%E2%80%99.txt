ACCA beckons millenials with ‘Next Generation Challenge’

ACCA, considering the future requirements of the finance industry and the need for talent development in the finance profession, will be launching an innovative competition titled ‘ACCA Next Generation Challenge’ in early June together with TV1.
Millennials today need to be well equipped to deal with the changes driven by digitisation and globalisation, by having a global outlook, be technologically savvy and effectively use finance as a valued platform for their future careers.
This competition will target Advanced Level students studying in the Commerce stream of leading schools and private educational institutes in the country, as well as their own tuition providers.
The programme will consist of a series of interesting challenges that the students will participate in, based on the key areas that ACCA acknowledges to be important to finance professionals in the future. These key areas include identifying opportunity, integrity, accountability, ethics, leadership, teamwork, social responsibility, innovation, networking, creativity, technology, emotional intelligence and many more.
ACCA joined hands with TV1, the leading television station of Maharaja Organization, with an MOU being recently signed between the two organisations, in order to promote this competition to the public.
A team of leading finance professionals in the industry, who are also ACCA members, will comprise the eminent panel of judges for the competition. The judging criteria will be based on skills demonstrated in analysing and conceptualising given challenges and scenarios, teamwork, presentation of practical solutions, creativity and innovation, and in utilising best practices.
Nilusha Ranasinghe, Head of ACCA Sri Lanka, said, “We are keen to supplement the accountancy profession with skill sets that are required to meet the dynamic nature of the profession and drivers of change like automation and globalisation and in creating finance professionals who are capable of supporting and driving our economic growth. Our qualification itself offers the complete and essential blend of technical and ethical accounting competencies mixed with strategic leadership and professional skills required to turn students into the confident and trusted business partners that employers need.
