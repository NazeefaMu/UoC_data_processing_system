Unhappy with Vadivelu

Tik Tik Tik’s shooting took place at Chennai’s ECR, where a space shuttle set was erected. Ravi plays Vasu, an astronaut. Other cast members include Arjun Nandhakumar, the female lead Nivetha Pethuraj and Ramesh Tilak, who all play astronauts too.
Tik Tik Tik is directed by Shakti Soundar Rajan, who loves to experiment considering his previous film Miruthan (also starring Jayam Ravi) fell in the zombie genre and was well received.
