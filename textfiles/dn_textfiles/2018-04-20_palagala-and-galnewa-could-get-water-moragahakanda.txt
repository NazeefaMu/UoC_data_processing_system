Palagala and Galnewa could get water from Moragahakanda

Water from the Moragahakanda reservoir could be diverted to the Palagala and Galnewa areas in the Anuradhapura district, said Agriculture Minister and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissnayake.
This issue has been taken for discussion recently with President Maithripala Sirisena who pioneered the Moragahakanda reservoir project, he said.
Minister Dissanayake was speaking after inaugurating the renovation work of Mahakambiliya and Ruwanmaduwa tanks under the Kiul Oya irrigational development project in the Vavuniya district, recently. The government will incurs Rs. 400 million for the tank rehabilitation project. These two tanks have been abandoned for decades and once rehabilitated, around 1,000 acres could be cultivated under them.
The minister said further that the whole country should be educated about the Moragahakanda project under which 100,000 acres come under cultivation in three kanna, a novel experience for Rajarata farmers. He said that if not for the flood and drought which devastated cultivations in three consecutive seasons, this period would have been the golden era of agriculture development in Sri Lanka under the leadership of President Sirisena.
Dissanayake emphasised that within the next five years the irrigational and water supply projects such an Yan Oya and Lower Malwathu Oya, NCP canal project, Upper Elahera canal project, and Wahalkada and Mahakanadarawa water projects would provide ample drinking and irrigational water to the Anuradhapura, Vauniya, Trincomalee, Mullaitivu, Jaffna, Mannar and Kurunegala districts.
