Dengue on the rise in Dambulla

Dengue fever is on the increase in Galewela and Dambulla areas with the onset of rains, health officials said. According to health officials, over 60 dengue cases have been reported from these areas so far this year.
Health authorities however, have taken steps to control the existing dengue threat in the area. A door to door awareness campaign has been initiated by health officials to educate the public on preventative measures. Health officials warned that those found guilty of promoting the spread of dengue will be prosecuted.
