Racists against hybrid court concept - Rajitha

The Tamil as well as Sinhala racists stand against the hybrid court concept proposed by the Geneva based UNHRC, Health and Indigenous Minister Rajitha Senaratne said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation joining the adjournment motion debate on Geneva based UNHRC report and alleged human rights violations during the last phase of the war.
He said the Spokesman for the Global Tamil Forum, Suren Suranthiran, Wimal Weerawansa, Gunadasa Amaraskera, Karunanidhi, Jayalalithaa and Anandi Sasitharan despite their differences have a common slogan today in rejecting the hybrid court mechanism.
He said that the country has experienced a war that killed children, youth and leaders. He questioned as to why the country needs to see reawakening setting aside that dark past. The minister commended the JVP stating that it has evolved to a new position shedding its racist lines and slogans and added that it is genuinely involved in the process of seeking reconciliation.
Senaratne also stated that except for the JVP and few others, many who spoke at the debate have not studied what the reports by the UNHRC, Paranagama Commission and the Udalagama Commission said. Geneva report proposes ensuring the people of this country and to implement only the favourable recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission.
Minister Senaratne questioned as to who appointed the LLRC, the Paranagama Commission and the Udalagama Commission. He also questioned as to who is talking against them and who are talking of implementing their recommendations. He said the LTTE would not have been able to cause so much of damage to this country had President Premadasa and Minister Lalith Athulathmudali been alive as they were not racists. That is why the LTTE had killed them. The LTTE never killed Sinhala racists or a JVP leader because they knew their stance would help them survive their racist ideology and added that the JVP has come to the right place by now.
The minister said the country would have been put in labyrinth of chaos if the recommendations of Commissions appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were implemented whereas the co-sponsored resolution has a minimal effect on the country.
Senaratne said that the report prepared by friends of former President Rajapaksa have adverse recommendations than those in the latest US resolution at Geneva although some of the opposition members attempted to project it to be a devil.
Minister Senarathne said that the resolution has accepted that the inquiry should be held under a united and unified situation and under the existing judicial system. He added that the Paranagama Commission also has recommended to inquire into the killing fields of Channel 4 footage as well as White Flag incident. He added that it also recommended to inquire into the death of Prabhakaran's 12-year-old son.
The minister further said that we could have been able to bring the inquiry into this favourable level due to the steps take by the new government.
