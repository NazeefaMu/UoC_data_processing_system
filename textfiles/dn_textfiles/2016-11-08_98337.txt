Tunes powered by youth

The National Youth Orchestra (NYO) was established by the Western Music Unit of the Ministry of Education in 1992 following a grant of orchestral instruments from the Government of Japan. The NYO - the only such entity in the SAARC region to be supported by the state - provides opportunities free of charge to students throughout the island, to appreciate and perform western orchestral music. It could be described as the flag-ship project of the Education Ministry.
It concentrates on developing useful life-skills in students which contribute towards the overall enhancement of their aesthetic values and character-building. It is also aimed at exposing students, mainly from rural schools, to Western Classical music and to enable them to study and perform orchestral music alongside their Colombo counterparts who have greater access to such training and facilities.
Talented students, duly recommended by their respective heads of school, are given orchestral instruments through a lease agreement. They are taught about performing techniques and trained in orchestral playing.
The orchestral rehearsal sessions are conducted at the Royal College premises, Colombo, every Saturday afternoon from 1.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. and are attended by students from several provinces.
Around 100 students would be enrolled each year and students continue to perform in the orchestra until the age of 25. Membership is open to all students in the country, including those who possess their own orchestral instruments. All the students are encouraged to benefit from the experience of performing in a western orchestral setting.
Following their training, students are admitted to the orchestra through an audition process and perform both Classical and Popular music at the annual orchestral concerts.
Through the past 24 years, many students have reached levels of competency where they could join the established senior orchestras in the country and some have obtained scholarships from overseas training colleges to pursue their musical studies abroad.
Concerts have been held in Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Kurunegala so far. In view of a revival in interest from provincial students, out-reach programmes are being devised to attract the attention of more students.
