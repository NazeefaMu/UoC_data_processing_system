Foundation of Goodness Empowerment Centre opens in Mathagal, Jaffna

Here is a reconciliation story that makes a difference. When Rajiv and Kiran Radhakrishnan in the UK offered their ancestral property inheritance to be gifted for the community to benefit, after having followed closely the Foundation for Goodness humanitarian endeavors it resulted in the opening of the Foundation of Goodness’ 7th Village Heartbeat Project Empowerment Centre in Mathagal, Jaffna. This is the kind of example that we need to showcase and bear testimony to the South - North reconciliation initiative, as we believe that both parties together can make that major difference towards rebuilding a shattered community.
Imagine in today's world, when people are reluctant to let go, care & share this couple Rajiv and Kiran were willing to part with their property near the ocean for the benefit of rural disadvantaged to prosper in life. What an amazing blessing that only a few are capable of doing.
Then came our co-trustee AshanMalalasekera, Chairman of Arinma Holdings, who made sure this project creates the flight path that it needs to ascend, understanding the vision of all our other Village Heartbeat Empowerment Centres towards empowering rural students, bridging the gap and helping to make better progress. His unconditional gifting of the total building cost to make this dream of the 7th VHP empowerment initiative materialize is again very unique, generous, considerate and rare.
The Mathagal VHP Centre offers Computer/ IT, English Language, Sinhala Language, Science, Mathematics, Women's Enterprise & Empowerment and Volleyball programmes to the 280 children, youth and women currently enrolled from among eight surrounding villages who find it difficult to access educational and vocational resources to develop their skills.
The Centre also has a library to help the beneficiaries broaden their knowledge base and is home to a Children's Goodness Club to ensure that the children and youth attending programmes understand the importance of doing good deeds that can help and benefit their community, for a brighter future.
The architectural drawing to resurrect the building where the VHP Centre is located were done by renowned architect, Mr. Anjalendran, free of cost.
The longevity and success of this Centre is secured through the kind sustainability sponsorship of a group of donors who are eager to give rural but talented beneficiaries a chance to prosper. Dr. SangarapillaiNagendran from USA has been a strong donor and supporter of the Foundation of Goodness for many years, with special care for promoting the educational success as a building block for a secure and prosperous future, such as through FoG Essential School Supplies Programme, and presenting bikes to students in the North and East who walk incredibly long distances just to get to school.
Together with his brother Dr. SangarapillaiAsokan also from USA and friends Dr. Anton Sebastiampillai and Mr. Emil Kumar, both from UK, as well Ms. RashanthaDevanesan from Singapore they make up the exceptional group of people who stepped up to cover the sustainability cost of running the centre and all its programmes so that more and more villagers will have the opportunity to realize their dreams.
The Foundation of Goodness first introduced its Village Heartbeat Project concept to bring Empowerment Centres offering a selection of its key courses and programmes to distant rural villages where opportunities and access to resources is scarce.
Many of the courses offered at the VHP Centres are crucial for the development of women, children and youth, giving them the opportunity to build their talents and gain more skills.
The aim here is to give these groups an opportunity to take control of their future, rather than to remain victims of circumstance, by providing them with the necessary tools for success.
FoG's very first Village Heartbeat Centre opened in Udumulla - Galle District (2007) followed by five more in Rathgama - Galle District (2010), Hingurukaduwa - Moneragala District (2014), Gandara - Matara District (2016), Eravur -Batticaloa District (2016) and Thirukkovil - Ampara District (2016).
Our heartfelt appreciation goes out to the extraordinary people who made this milestone achievement a reality, out of love and compassion for others in need to attain a better life.
The Foundation of Goodness was established in 1999 and has worked extensively following the 2004 tsunami that devastated the lives of thousands of Sri Lankans to develop a one of a kind holistic rural community development model which today delivers a wide range of programmes to over 35,000 beneficiaries from 200+ villagers in the South, North and East of Sri Lanka annually, free of charge, via our 30 empowerment activity sectors.
When the years of conflict came to an end, the Foundation of Goodness extended its development activities to the post-war North and East of Sri Lanka and have been working in the North since January 2011, reaching over 34,000 beneficiaries to date, with uninterrupted monthly visits to introduce, maintain and expand a variety of welfare and development programmes.
