Looks at sustainable, cost effective construction solutions
Advantis Engineering Partners  With ATAD Steel

Advantis Engineering, a subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, recently entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with global pre-engineered building giant ATAD Steel Structure Corporation.
This latest partnership is in keeping with the company’s ongoing efforts to bring sustainable, cost effective and rapid construction solutions to Sri Lanka.
Pre-engineered steel buildings are tailor-made solutions to meet the exact needs of customers. This system consists of factory-fabricated steel column and beam segments that are simply bolted together at site.
The external surface is constructed using varying walling systems based on the requirements of the customer. Upon completion of component fabrication, the entire building is shipped, in parts, to the site for rapid assembly. As the latest trend in building construction, this advanced solution has outstanding advantages to customers.
An efficiently designed pre-engineered building can cost less than a conventional steel building (or standard steel or civil construction) by up to 25% and can reduce the scheduled construction time by 30-50% with fast delivery and quick site assembly.
Raw materials can also be calculated more accurately enabling the reduction of material usage and wastage in the factory and on-site.
Low weight flexible frames of pre-engineered steel buildings also offer higher resistance to earthquakes, making it a safer option.
“We are proud to be partnering with Advantis Engineering to bring our innovative and sustainable building solutions to Sri Lanka. At ATAD we are committed to bringing these new and efficient construction methods to the forefront of the construction industry and we believe Advantis Engineering shares our vision. Together we are confident in our ability to bring the next generation of construction solutions to this beautiful island,” said Huynh Ngoc Dong, Chairman, ATAD Steel Structure Corporation.
Advantis Engineering, a pioneer in converting marine containers to sustainable, usable work spaces under its brand Convertainers, has long identified the need for rapid construction solutions to aid the country’s economic growth and development. As existing businesses expand and new ones enter the market the gap between available space and demand will only continue to grow and it will be years before developers, relying on traditional methods, are able to bridge this gap.
Commenting on this partnership, Kamal Wimalaratne, General Manager, Advantis Engineering, said, “Providing a solution for the increasing scarcity of space in urban areas is crucial to the continued economic growth of our nation. With traditional construction being cumbersome and slow, especially for businesses that need large spaces constructed for their operations, it was clear that we needed an innovative solution to meet today’s fast growing needs.
Hence we are proud to be partnering with ATAD Steel Structure Corporation, a leader in the construction industry, which creates easily deployable space solutions that help businesses get up and running much faster, resulting in quicker return on investment.”
