Disrupt Asia 2017 ends helping SL establish startup ecosystem paradigms

Sri Lanka’s premier startup conference and showcase, Disrupt Asia 2017 (DA17) concluded on a successful note recently helping the country establish new startup ecosystem paradigms.
Organised by the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), the nation’s apex ICT Institution under the Ministry of Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure, the event included 52 star-studded foreign and local speakers,well-known resource persons and over 350 attendees.
This year’s conference was unparalleled and unique in that it united thought leaders, entrepreneurs, investors and avid community members for keynote talks, interactive workshops, speed mentoring and showcasing startups, all united in their mission to radically change our startup ecosystem.
Setting the tone for the conference, the morning keynote speaker Cheryl Edison, Serial Entrepreneur and Global Business Expert, observed, “We are standing on the edge of one of most the important times in the history of Sri Lanka. We need to work together to make Sri Lanka the superpower startup ecosystem that it intends to be.”
The American innovation guru and serial entrepreneur noted that local entrepreneurs were hemmed in due to a lack of an official payment gateway. She said, “The entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka have one hurdle that they cannot overcome on their own: a payment gateway system that will empower every person in Sri Lanka to move money, make a business that works for them and their local communities.”
She elaborated on the need to build ‘makerpaces’. “We need to build places which serve the needs of our entrepreneurs – makerpaces, where entrepreneurs come and create a community and create links between their creativity and commerce.

The keynote speaker for the evening session was Kevin Petrovic, Partner of Custom Space and President of Carbon70 Holdings. Taking the audience through his journey as an entrepreneur and founder of several startups, he said, “The ideas came from improving the value for the customer. Make something people actually want. If you don’t have a good idea copy one.”
He advised the audience on getting help. Kevin noted, “Everyone needs a lot of help when they start out so do not be afraid to go after help. Find people who know your industry, who have an interest and who want to help. It acts as a big driver in the success of startups.”
On being entrepreneurial he said, “Entrepreneurship means you don’t have to come up with your own idea to be an entrepreneur and work on startups. You can help grow a company as well as be part of that. That too is very entrepreneurial.”
In conclusion he said, “Start now and make steps towards the goal. Only you can decide your success. If you don’t try you definitely won’t succeed.”
