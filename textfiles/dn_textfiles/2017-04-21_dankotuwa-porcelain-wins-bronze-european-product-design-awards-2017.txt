Dankotuwa Porcelain wins bronze at  European Product Design Awards 2017

Dankotuwa Porcelain was adjudged winner of the Silver award in the catering products/table top specialties category at the prestigious European Product Design Awards (ePDA) 2017. Awarded by the European Union, this accolade is one of many that the company has won over its 34 years of heritage.
The winning entry at the ePDA awards 2017 is an in-glaze design which is produced especially for the UK market. The special technique used is called the ‘embossed reactive process’ which gives the product an embossed effect and at the same time, it has the same texture as a hand feel product.
This special product, manufactured and designed by Dakotuwa Procelain is safe for all aspects of dining as the raw materials used are lead and cadmium safe (based on international standards such as ISO 6486 - 1:1999, ISO 6486 - 2:1999, ASTM C 738 - 94 (Re-approved 2016) and California Proposition 65 Compliance).
The company maintains high product quality standards; as a result Dankotuwa Porcelain - renowned for pure white ware products, can be used in a microwave or a dishwasher.
Dankotuwa Porcelain Chief Executive Officer Wasaba Jayasekara said Dankotuwa Porcelain has designed, developed and mastered the art of producing innovative world-class table-wear. “It is our sense of creativity, the design techniques used and developing a quality product with exquisite designs that has given us the opportunity to enjoy a diverse customer base from various parts of the world. This feat is testament to our dedication, passion and attention to detail and the reason as to why Dankotuwa Porcelain is the market leader and a leading exporter of table-wear in Sri Lanka”.
Theme for the winning entry: the green leaf as it depicts tropical modernism which is the theme for most interiors and table tops for this season. Green is currently the trend and the leaf represents the connection to Mother Nature and its bounty and is also easy on the eyes.
