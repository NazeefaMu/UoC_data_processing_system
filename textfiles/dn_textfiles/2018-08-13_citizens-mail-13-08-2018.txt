Pride of place for all Sri Lankans
The Citizens’ Movement for Good Governance (CIMOGG) strongly endorses the untiring Bernard Fernando’s plea in his recent letter titled “Dispense with ad hoc ratios and bonus seats for PC Elections” where he urges that we should do away with efforts to keep alive the idea of classifying some groups as “minorities.” All citizens should be called “Sri Lankans”.
Accordingly, the Constitution of Sri Lanka should be for all Sri Lankans without differential treatment for ethnicity, language, religion and so on. This would be the only reliable way of uniting the country and concentrating thereafter on improving the efficiency of the legislative, administrative and judicial arms of the State, and thereby encourage the people to work towards developing the economy, social services, productivity and all those ancillary matters that would help us to catch up on some of the valuable decades of time that we have lost.
