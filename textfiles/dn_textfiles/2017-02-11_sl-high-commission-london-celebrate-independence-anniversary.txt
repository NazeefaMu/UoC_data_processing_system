SL High Commission in London celebrate Independence Anniversary

The Sri Lankan High Commission in London commemorated the 69th Anniversary of Independence with the representation of all the communities on February 4 at the High Commission premises.
The programme commenced with the hoisting of the National Flag by High Commissioner Amari Wijewardene. The National Anthem of Sri Lanka was sung followed by the observance of two minutes’ silence in remembrance of the war heroes. Religious observances were conducted by Ven. Bogoda Seelawimala Nayaka Thero, Supramaniya Kurukkal, Rev. Fr. Daya Perera, and Moulavi Mohamed Anas.
High Commissioner Wijewardene, in her address, stated that the commemoration of our independence is in many ways an occasion for us to celebrate the lives of our national heroes and to assess the path that our country has taken over the past 69 years. Quoting the President of Sri Lanka, she stated that “...the realisation of the true meaning of freedom and independence lies in our potential to free ourselves from the shackles of all forms of poverty and ill-health, and confines of diverse identities of race, religion and caste, and enrich ourselves, as a society that values equity and rights of all,” and called on everyone to resolve to this endeavour in every possible way.
On February 6, the High Commissioner hosted a reception for the representatives of the diplomatic corps, Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Lords and Members of the House of Commons, representatives of the international organisations based in London, Mayors, Councillors, academics and the business community in London. Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland, and Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps Sir Alistair Harrison were among those present.
The guests were treated to an array of Sri Lankan cuisine in keeping with the warm tradition of Sri Lankan hospitality.
