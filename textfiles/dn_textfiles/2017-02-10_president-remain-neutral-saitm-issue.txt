President to remain neutral on SAITM issue

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday emphasised that he will not allow the Malabe SAITM Private Medical College to cause any injustice towards medical students of other universities in the country. He said as the President, he will not take the side of any party to this issue but work independently and impartially to ensure justice to every medical student in the country. The President said that during the next few days he will hold discussions with all parties concerned with this issue and take measures to resolve it in a manner acceptable to each and every one.
He requested students of all medical faculties to pursue their academic activities as usual without boycotting classes. The President gave this assurance when he addressed the Woodville housing project meeting at the Talawakelle UC grounds after launching the Woodville housing scheme in Nuwara Eliya yesterday. He said no one would be allowed to manipulate the children who inherited the country’s future for their own benefit.
“The government would always perform its duty and responsibility of opening new vistas to the child population to move forward an emerge victorious in this competitive world.
While strengthening free education in its quality and essence by providing all facilities required by universities in the country the government will take steps to resolve the problems of students shut out from universities despite having the necessary qualifications for university education,” President said.
The President also emphasized the need for high quality education institutions to cater to students with necessary qualifications who could not enter the traditional universities in the country.
The Woodville housing scheme consists of 150 houses with a floor area of 550 sq ft on a 7 perches block of land. Each house is equipped with two rooms, a hall, kitchen, bathroom and toilet.
