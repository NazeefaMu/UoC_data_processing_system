Lyca Productions deny links with Rajapaksa

Lyca Productions, on Sunday, waded into the raging controversy over the now-cancelled visit of Indian superstar Rajinikanth to Jaffna, charging politicians who opposed the “goodwill trip” of “doing nothing” to help the Sri Lankan Tamils.
The production house also punched holes in the accusations that it had links with former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, saying, “Our continuous actions to date have proven that such reports are untrue and unfounded.”
Rajini was to participate in a function organised by Lyca Production’s Gnanam Productions on April 9, during which 150 homes were to be handed over to war-displaced Tamils in Vavuniya in northern Sri Lanka.
“We are saddened by the development of a negative environment surrounding aid programmes of a charity to further the political gain of some elements. We don’t want the Superstar (Rajinikanth) to be subjected to an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation,” the production house said in a statement.
Tearing into those accusing it of having links with Rajapaksa, the production house said some Tamil Nadu politicians who repeatedly speak out in support of those accusations might have been “indebted” to its competitors who want to defame their firm.
“We suspect that these politicians are repeatedly spreading these fabricated and baseless rumours due to their obligations to our business competitors… These politicians have done nothing for the betterment of Sri Lankan Tamils. However, there are politicians who are really concerned about the plight of ethnic Tamils,” the statement said.
The production house also appealed to all concerned to let the company continue its efforts to alleviate the suffering of Sri Lankan Tamils. After the news of Rajini participating in the programme stoked a raging political row, the superstar cancelled his visit, though he expressed displeasure over the opposition.
