‘THE ONE’ ADDS GLAMOR TO PORSCHE’S 70TH ANNIVERSARY

With luxury performance and technological innovation prompting ultimate pleasure when behind the wheel of the world’s leading sports car, ‘THE ONE’– Sri Lanka’ billed to augment the expansive skyscape of Colombo by 2021, added absolute glitz and glamour to the Porsche 70th birthday celebrations held at the BMICH recently.
The proposed ‘The Ritz-Carlton Residential and Hotel’ tower at The ONE project, will be the first tower to be completed in the three towers at ‘The ONE’ project. This is being constructed and sold by Zhong Tian Ding Hui (ZTDH) Co. Ltd.
At the celebratory event, Porsche owners and their families who were treated to an experiential day featuring the latest Porsches, a Porsche Quiz Competition, a Driving School for children, BBQ and cocktail reception, were also pampered in the specially curated Lounge to experience the look and feel of The Ritz-Carlton Residence.
Welcomed by the hospitable sales team of THE ONE, the Lounge echoed the oasis of luxury synonymous with THE ONE project’s triad of state of the art contemporary towers, during the half day’s programme organised by Eurocars (Pvt) Limited for Porsche owners and their families. All three towers in ‘THE ONE’ project is billed for completion by 2023.
