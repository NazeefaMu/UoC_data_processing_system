The Lord’s Test of 1984

“Well begun is half done.” Ironically speaking that was just the trouble with Sri Lanka in her first ever Test-against England at Colombo Oval in February, 1982. “We began so well we were half way there at the end of the third day. A little more consolidation and the match would have been ready for the final execution and victory,” stated my team mate at Ananda College in 1966, Sunil Wettimuny, in his book “Cricket the noble art.”
But there was no follow up of that good beginning. The second half was a batting shambles too ludicrous even to try to explain, a total and utter collapse mentally and morally. A glorious opportunity squandered in abject defeat, recalled Sunil.
If with the wisdom of hindsight one could have transported the Lord’s Test innings to that other Test match, what wonderful results might have been achieved! And Sunil added that, that was wishful thinking only to be indulged in day dreams, the stark reality was less kind.
Sunil unravelled that the Lord’s Test of 1984 whatever lied in store for Sri Lanka cricket, the first Test match in England will remain in the record books and will linger longer. Reams and reams were written and recorded in print and on film and what was not thus recorded the eye beheld.
It was a triumph of batsmanship and dedication, a vindication of the faith that was implicit in Sri Lanka’s ability in this respect, faith that had been sorely tried and tested and well nigh lost. If only that vindication had come two years earlier! -But there again he cried over spilt milk stated Sunil.
This was what the critics said then points out Sunil.
“England humiliated by Sri Lankan amateurs” screamed the banner headlines. “Shambles-day of Lords shame,” wrote Jim Laker.
“Wettimuny and Mendis deepen England gloom” said the Telegraph. “Sid’s the crack shot. What a gem,” reflected the Mirror. “England on the rack again.” Such and a host of other comments derogatory to English cricket appeared in all the national Press. It seemed an English sports writer’s past time to kick their national teams when they are down. (This is a common occurrence in Sri Lanka as well and in my book it’s all in order).
Sunil rewinds still further and stated that other commentators however, and writers who ought to know better, cynically suggested that the Sri Lankan straight bat strokes and a classic sideways stance were a sign of their naivete, their lack of sophistication and artless approach to Test cricket. A cynical comparison also to the “days of yore when purer techniques prevailed.” It was a left handed compliment.
The facts without comment have told their own tale, Sri Lanka without actually winning, had the better of that first Lord’s Test and earned the praise and respect of the cricket playing world. We had arrived on a grand note, not merely to participate but to share creditably in contest.
The long, dedicated innings of Wettimuny and the punishing strokeplay of Mendis had given rich colour to this match,” wrote Tony Lewis.”The tourist have brought to the game a pleasing instinct to attack with the bat: yet concentrate on technical excellence.”
“The style and high quality of their batting were a revelation to those not familiar with Sri Lanka cricket. Wettimuny’s innings lasted 636 minutes but it never lost its aesthetic appeal.”
“Mendis was brilliantly belligerent. The strongest memories of this Lords Test, historic to Sri Lanka, will be the cover driving of Wettimuny and Mendis’s hooking of Botham, the ball crashing into the stands high and handsome. Not far behind were Ranatunga and Roy Dias: the one neat and confident; the other flowing into elegant strokes. The immense promise of Aravinda de Silva was a source of special joy and appreciation of the talent so abundantly displayed.
WETTIMUNY BROTHERS
Sunil had often wondered if ever there was in the history of cricket anywhere a case of three brothers with an identical record of having:
a) Opened batting for Sri Lanka.
b) Captained there club team (first class cricket) and opened batting.
c) Captained their school team and opened batting.
This was the happy record for his brothers Mithra and Sidath, and himself. It has been their privilege to captain Ananda College, their “Alma Mater,” and the Sinhalese Sports Club, and open batting for both institutions and also for Sri Lanka.
Brother Mithra had a superlative record in school and captained the Sri Lankans Schools team on their tour of India 1969/70.He was the only one to end up with a schools test hundred scored at Eden Gardens, Calcutta. Two Sri Lankan Test captains Warnapura and Mendis played under him in that series. He clinched his Test cap by scoring five centuries and seven fifties for SSC in the first class tournament and he toured New Zealand.
Brother Sidath’s exploits are too well known for him to elaborate here concluded Sunil.
