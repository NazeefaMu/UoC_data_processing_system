Joint Opposition wants LG polls soon

The Joint Opposition yesterday urged Provincial Council and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapha in a written request, to take speedy measures to hold the Local Government Elections as soon as possible.
The JO members made this request after calling over at the Local Government and Provincial Council Ministry yesterday.
Responding to the JO request, Minister Musthapha pledged to take necessary measures promptly so as to hold the LG election without further delay. The Minister has told the JO representation that the Government’s intension is also to hold the LG election as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, the JO along with several ex-local government councilors launched a protest in front of the Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry urging the Minister for immediate conduct of the LG election.
The protesters, who were supported by several JO members including Parliamentarians Gamini Lukuge, Prasanna Ranathunga, Rohitha Abeygunawardana and Ranjith Zoysa claimed that the Government is afraid of conducting the LG election since the Government is suffering from election phobia. When the protesters made a huge cry for the LG election, ten persons was allowed to enter the Ministry for discussions with Minister Musthapha.
MP Gamini Lokuge told the media that Minister Musthapha was requested to present the Local Government Act to Parliament as an urgent Act. Besides, the Government has also been requested to forward their amendments to the Act if there are any amendments.
Responding to the JO representation, the Minister said that he is also against reducing the total LG seats by 50 per cent.
The Minister has pointed out that the Elections Commissioner has requested 55 days for conducting the LG election after the Act is passed in Parliament.
Lokuge added that the JO is ready to render their fullest support in this regard since the Minister said that the LG election will probably be held in coming September.
Addressing media Lokuge said that they will come back to the Ministry in another 55 days.
“At that day we won’t go back unless the Government holds the election” he noted.
