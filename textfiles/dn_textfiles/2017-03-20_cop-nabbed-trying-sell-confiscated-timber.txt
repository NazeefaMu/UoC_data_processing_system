Cop nabbed for trying to sell confiscated timber

A police constable from the Dankotuwa area, who allegedly tried to sell a stock of confiscated timber, was arrested.
The load of timber had been taken into custody by the police as they had been illegally felled. The timber was to be produced in the Marawila Magistrate’s Courts in relation to two ongoing cases. The police constable had allegedly transported the timber to a timber shop in the guise of taking them to courts.
An investigation had been launched following a complaint received by the DIG of the Puttalam area.
Later, police had seized the stock of timber again from a shop in the Dankotuwa area. Police had also arrested the driver of a tractor who had transported the load of timber.
