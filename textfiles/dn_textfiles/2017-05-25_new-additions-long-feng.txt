“I want to present our loyal guests with new flavours,” said Chef Yan. “These dishes that I have implemented are favourites back home. While some of these may sound familiar, I assure you, the taste will not. Every district in China excels at different dishes while some have variants. I have tried to introduce this diversity to our Sri Lankan friends and guests from across the seas,” he further added.
Long Feng is open for lunch and dinner.
