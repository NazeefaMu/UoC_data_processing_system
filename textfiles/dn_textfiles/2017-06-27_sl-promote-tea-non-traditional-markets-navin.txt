SL to promote tea in non-traditional markets - Navin

Targets USA, Latin America
 In a drive to expand Sri Lanka’s tea exports to non-traditional markets, Sri Lanka is to come up with a major promotional campaign to expand its tea exports to the United States and Latin America, says Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake.
Minister Dissanayake citing China as a potential tea market to be tapped noted that Sri Lanka’s tea exports to Iran have increased while Sri Lanka’s tea market in Russia has shrunk a bit.
Moreover, the government intends to develop coconut as a billion dollar industry.
Sri Lanka Tea Board has released tea production data for the month of May 2017 confirming a figure of 29.4 million kgs which is nominally lower than the previous year’s figure of 30.8 million kgs.
 
All three elevations recorded lower figures compared to the previous year. The 129 million kgs, January to date figure, is still higher than the 128.5 million kgs recorded for the same period last year. Low Grown teas were about 1.3 million kgs more than last year, but the high and Medium Growns are now nominally lower than last year.
