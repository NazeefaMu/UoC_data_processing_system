Sri Lanka to obtain US$ 125 mn for agri sector modernisation

The Government will support agriculture to transform itself from the low yielding, low income, few crop dependent, and subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture, raising income levels of farmers and developing small scale producers into big exporters.
The National Food Production Programme 2016-2018 has already been launched to ensure that Sri Lanka is self-sufficient in five major food crops,potatoes, big onions, chilies, maize and soya.
The Government has decided to implement the Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project from 2017 to 2021 mainly focusing on Northern, Eastern, North Central, Central and Uva Provinces. The total estimated cost of the project is USD 169.84 million out of which World Bank will provide US$ 125.0 million (Rs. 18,750 million).
The overall strategic objective of the project is to support the government's agriculture sector development policy through developing an enabling framework and incentive structure for small, medium, and large enterprises to invest in commercial agriculture and value chains, promoting partnership arrangements between private sector partners and smallholder producer for better linkages, demonstrating new agriculture technologies and innovations at sufficient scale to enhance productivity and diversification, promoting technology diffusion through capacity building and training and new models for extension service delivery and supporting sector policy analysis and research for reform. In addition, the proposed project will support smallholder farmers to produce competitive and marketable commodities, improve their ability to respond to market requirements, and move towards increased commercialization Ministry of Primary Industries, Ministry of Agriculture and five provinces (Uva, Northern, Eastern North Central and Central) and the Regional Development Department of Central Bank of Sri Lanka will jointly implement the project during the period of 2017to 2021.
