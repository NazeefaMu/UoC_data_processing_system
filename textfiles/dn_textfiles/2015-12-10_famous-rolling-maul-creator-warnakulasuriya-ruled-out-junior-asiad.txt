Famous rolling maul creator Warnakulasuriya ruled out of Junior Asiad

Supun-Warnakulasuriya
The highest try scorer for league rugby champions Royal College and the architect of their famous rolling maul Supun Warnakulasuriya has been ruled out of the Sri Lanka under 20 team for the Junior Rugby Asiad in Singapore with a serious knee injury.
Warnakulasuriya received this injury while playing in a practice match for the Sri Lanka under 20 team against ‘A’ Division side Police.
The practice match was played in the early morning hours last Thursday at Police Park.
Sri Lanka under 20 captain and number eight Omalka Gunaratne (concussion) and hooker Nisal Desaka (broken nose) were also injured in the same match but have recovered sufficiently to go on the tour.
Third year school coloursman Warnakulasuriya represented the Royal 1st XV side under captains Rimzie Jamaldeen, Nimshan Jayawardana and Bhanuka Gamage. Wasantha Warnakulasuriya, father of the injured Supun told the Daily News: “I am sad that my son cannot represent the country at the Junior Asiad in Singapore. This is part and parcel of a sport like rugby as you are bound to suffer nasty injuries. “Since he is recovering fast I am hoping that Supun will be able to return to play club rugby for CR and FC in the ongoing Dialog league rugby tournament."
The Sri Lanka team leaves for Singapore on Friday for the tournament that will be played from December 13-19.
