Rajapaksa supporters behind Saturday’s unrest: Bandara

The UNP yesterday charged that some Hambantota residents who received state lands courtesy of the Rajapaksa family as an inducement for their support were behind Saturday’s unrest when the China – Sri Lanka Industrial Zone was inaugurated.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara said information has surfaced that Rajapaksa gave away state lands to some of their supporters illegally and they were the ones behind Saturday’s mayhem. These Rajapaksa supporters had misled other people with canards and had instigated them to protest against the industrial zone which will bring unprecedented benefits to the people in the area, Bandara, told media in Colombo.
He said the government will take steps to acquire these illegally distributed lands in the future. “We are also planning to reveal the names and other details of this fraud," he added. He said a Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman in the Hambantota district had been given 34 acres illegally and another 53 persons who are members of an organisation run by the Rajapaksas were beneficiaries of state lands, given illegally.
Bandara said these lands had been given as an inducement for supporting Rajapaksas and performing various tasks for them.
