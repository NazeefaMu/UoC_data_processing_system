Firing of ballistic missile by North Korea: President calls for explanation from Foreign Affairs Ministry

President Maithripala Sirisena had called for an investigation be conducted into a statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs over the ‘firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) on July 29.
The Ministry’s statement had condemned the missile launch as well as “the series of similar hostile attacks by DPRK in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions.”
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne addressing the Cabinet media briefing yesterday, explained that when the President had questioned both the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister over the statement, they had informed him that they were unaware of it and had not approved it.
The strongly-worded statement had also called on DPRK to “refrain from such hostile acts and programmes, in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions, which impact adversely on the stability of the region and beyond.”
The statement had further added, “The international community must unite in words and deeds to seek solutions to this grave situation which is an ever increasing threat to international peace and security.”
