National Law Students’ Conference this weekend

The third annual National Law Students’ Conference (NLSC) will be held on September 29 at Sri Lanka Law College, and September 30 at Water’s Edge, Battaramulla.
In line with this year’s theme, ‘Identifying the legal practitioner and the legal academic of the millennial,’ the conference will feature talks on modern issues like ‘policing the virtual world’ and artificial intelligence.
All law students in Sri Lanka are invited to attend the event, which includes networking sessions, workshops, and panel discussions. NLSC Co-Chair Chiranthi Senanayake said the conference will offer law students the chance to connect with each other and the larger legal community in Sri Lanka.
Delegates at the conference will produce an outcome document, detailing recommendations from Sri Lanka’s law students regarding pressing socioeconomic and political issues. The National Law Student’s Conference is held under the patronage of the Sri Lanka Bar Association.
