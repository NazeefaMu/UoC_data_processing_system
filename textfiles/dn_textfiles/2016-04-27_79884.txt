Psychic and Dreamy: The Lady of Shallot

Many a time I had been psychic during my life when later I realized they all link the power-story of the poem. Sometimes, the night moaned through every crevice of my heart yet someone very much alive, broke the spell.
The Lady of Shalott was bonded to someone she never met but waited in expiation only to end up in tragedy and disaster. Like her there are people who connect each other by some mystique power. Call it telepathy or by any other name but the spiritual power in these combinations, become real with maturity though young people brush them aside. Yet as youngster we did have vivid dreams and mine was an illusion of a handsome young stranger of no identity. It passed away but decades later when I was hanging my baby's diapers on a clothline, something happened. That day was bright and sunny where I could hear the birds sing upon trees when I spied an aircraft flying very high in the heavens which is very normal since I live close to the airport.
'What if the aircraft crashed' I thought.
That evening over the air (no TV then) I heard of a terrible plane crash that killed hundreds at the time I imagined. Was it telepathy or intuition. I am still wondering Perhaps Tennyson may have gone through this type of mystery or to be exact, telepathy.
Take note of this incredible thing that happened to my friend which she never expected. Call her Sathya (not real name) She is about my age and long given upon on romances or relationships. A happy contented woman when she faced this amazing person for the first time and instantly fell deeply in love with him. She found her spirit stirring like never before. Why it happened; how it happened is still a mystery.
He was unaware of her feeling when they met many a time and she kept it locked tightly in her heart being aware he could never respond. With her affection growing stronger day by day and near explosion Sathya became dejected, miserable and unhappy. Gone were her laughter and joy. They were seized by him without his knowledge. Yet he could read between lines but what was he to do She was a prisoner in her body and soul. Like the LOS, she had given her heart to this Prince.
Sathya is still struggling 12 and perhaps find her way to Camelot leaving behind Sir Lancelot whom she loves dearly, very dearly.
'And down the river's dim expanse
Like some bold seer in a trance
Seeing all his mischance
With a glassy countenance.
Did she look to Camelot
To round up this human tragedy. Tennysn wrote an epitaph from his other poem.
'This better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all'
EPILOGUE
Among multitude of readers, many have come across fictitious characters especially in poetry that resembles many events or happenings in our lives or even having our identities. It is at pensive moments they strikes us. Could be from childhood, adulthood or even later. Then suddenly we realize how very close to resemblances, emotionally or otherwise we have been carried to. Dream-poetry often plays tricks where tragedy or happiness besiege one and many. To top it all, dreams connect us on such barren stage and make us its players giving life to such characters. It may sound a bit philosophical but in every man's life, philosophy plays its part unwittingly. The thinker analyse such a situation but the down-to-earth man, brush them all aside. He who interact with life's realities are such ones. With time racing against us, we have little time to pause and ponder. Can they arise from a poem, stanza or from a little literary gem
As we sail down this winding river of impossible visions. Imagination or even hallucinations, the human mind is found to be gripped by such framework which is the reason we are totally different to beasts who too are born with feelings just like human beings but pushed against nature to survive with lack of brains or mind and rendered helpless, often at the mercy of us all if they step out of their abodes. Literally we find ourselves in other people's personalities or guises. We imitate them unaware that such things are happening and get deeper into such complexes where others notice our change while we carry on regardless. As a teenager I found myself completely in the role of Lady of Shalott. I still do not understand why or how I got involved; how I was influenced and what made me seep into her. Of course, every teenager dreams her prince charming come riding by on a white steed or something to this effect. It is the time of youth but dreams disappear with time.
A life is trapped with no explanation by the poet, beautiful and tragic, she is made a victim of fate which leads us to imagine whether Tennyson was a psyche Possibly dwelling in his thinking-power that assess the character built upon The Lady of Shalott. She is psychic, a force assumed to explain the medium of psychology.
In the ghastly tower around which the landscape stretch, poised against the grey skies which she is not suppose to see but listen the reapers reaping barley as they sing throughout the day. Through grey haze of the heavens, the tall trees sweeping by reflected in her mirror, makes her sick and weary.
The Curse
She was aware of the curse set upon her through which she to die the moment she looked down to Camelot. She had very little life left. It was a matter of time when death would come riding by…
Hoofbeats clattered on the winding roadway to Camelot. She winced as the horse galloped in the sunling. The nightmare had not ended. It was the beginning to eternity if that is where the boat was heading with her afloat. She left behind the casement window that forbade her to look down to Camelot as in patience she waited for Lancelot. The dormers beneath the window spread in wild profusion as the river circled her tower. The high castellated turrets rose into the afternoon sky which the Lady of Shallot hardly noticed as she lowered herself into the boat with the feel of the curse on her. A powerful sensation was moving towards as the bare Birch trees sped fast against the boat.
Yes; she had seen Lancelot just once and experienced a disquieting phenomenon. She knew the time was nigh; Lancelot was riding towards her and the rest through to Camelot while others continued, he paused a while to take a look into the boat.
