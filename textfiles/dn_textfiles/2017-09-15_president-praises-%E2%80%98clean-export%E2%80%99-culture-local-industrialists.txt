President praises ‘clean export’  culture of local industrialists

The dedication and sacrifice made by local industrialists and investors towards ensuring a clean export industry is a very important factor, President Maithripala Sirisena said presiding over the 21st Presidental Export Awards ceremony at the BMICH Colombo yesterday.
The awards ceremony was organised by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board. To do this they should pay attention to the criticism and praise received from the international market for our export goods.
He said Sri Lanka should achieve excellence in the export sector within the economic trends in a fast developing technological sector.
He also said that the dedication and contribution made by private sector businessmen engaged in the export industry superceded that of the state sector.
