Europe’s migrant crisis

Ever since the fall of the Belin Wall in 1989 Europe has seen a continuous influx of migrants. The open border policy of the European Union was an incentive for the immigrants. According to law immigrants seeking asylum should apply to the first country they enter but many wish to move on to more developed or economically well off countries before applying.
The first crisis situation developed in 2015 when 1,257,000 applied. It was more than double the 2014 figure of 562, 700. This was the highest since the end of the Second World War. The figure was a little lower in 2017. It was only 1,204,300.
Of the migrants’ majority were Syrians. According to Eurostat, the official statistics agency of the European Union, in 2016 they numbered 334,000. Next came the Afghans, numbering 183,000. Iraqi immigrants were 127,000. Together they comprised more than half the total number of immigrants. These immigrants were fleeing from the war or violent conflict zones. Many perished in crossing the Mediterranean ocean. International Organization for Migration (IOM) states that more than 1,000 perished in 2016 alone. There is big scale trafficking in persons by organised groups, who benefit out of the plight of the displaced persons.
Of EU countries Germany received the highest number of applications seeking asylum. It received 8,789 applications per 1 million of its population. Slovakia received the lowest number – 18 per 1 million population. France received 10 %, Italy 6%, Greece 4%, Britain 3% and Austria 3% respectively. The large influx of immigrants amidst deteriorating living conditions of the European Union has caused a huge political problem. Nationalist and far right political parties have made headway during elections giving rise to ears about a resurgence of fascism. Germany has been the most liberal in accommodating the migrants but Angela Merkel’s party had suffered heavy losses because of it.
Germany could not form a new Government for several months after the elections because differences over migrant policy prevented a coalition agreement until Angela Merkel agreed to limit migration.
A European Summit on Migration this week may find it difficult to come to any agreement.
While Germany, France and Spain seek a common solution within the EU framework Italy is unlikely to agree. Poland, Czech Republic and Slovenia have also refused to consider any agreement on taking refugees.
UN summons anti-terrorism Conference
The first-ever United Nations High-level Conference on Counter-Terrorism has been summoned this week in New York by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
Heads of national counter-terrorism agencies and representatives from international institutions and civil society will discuss how to improve international cooperation and build new partnerships.
According to the UNSG, “the conference will focus on four key areas. First, it will consider how governments, security agencies and law enforcement bodies can improve the exchange of critical information and strategies to detect disrupt and prosecute terrorist networks. Second, the conference will discuss how the United Nations can do more to assist countries around the world affected by terrorism.
“Third, it will address the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters. With the military defeat of ISIL in Syria and Iraq, large numbers of these ideologically-driven mercenaries are relocating to other theatres of conflict or returning home, passing on their battlefield expertise, recruiting new followers and planning further attacks.
“Fourth, I intend the conference to focus on how we can prevent terrorism and violent extremism. Improved security will never be enough. We need to address the underlying conditions that make people susceptible to toxic ideologies.”
The UNSG also notes that terrorism is a transnational threat that cannot be defeated by any single government or organisation. “It needs a concerted multilateral response at global, regional and national levels. It is essential to strengthen counter-terrorism structures and institutions. But we must also address root causes by promoting education, tackling youth unemployment and addressing marginalization,”he concludes.
Trump-Putin Summit
A month after the historic Trump-Kim Summit in Singapore President Trump will meet Russian President Putin in an effort to normalize relations between the two countries. Of late the relations between the two countries have worsened with the United States imposing sanctions on Russia and carrying on a policy of containing Russia through eastward expansion of NATO and intensification of the arms race.
It has also had several skirmishes with Russia on Syrian territory where the US is supporting some Islamic militants opposed to the Syrian Government.
In this context any meeting, even with mediocre results would be a step forward and away from politics of belligerency and confrontation.
Conservative sections in the United States are displeased with the prospects of the meeting as they charge that Russia interfered in the last US Presidential elections. Russia denies the charge.
