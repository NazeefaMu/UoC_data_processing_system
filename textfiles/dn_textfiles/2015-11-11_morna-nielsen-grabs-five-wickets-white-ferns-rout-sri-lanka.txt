Morna Nielsen grabs five wickets as White Ferns rout Sri Lanka

Spinner Morna Nielsen grabbed a five wicket bag as the New Zealand White Ferns women's cricket team cruised to a fourth consecutive win over Sri Lanka.
The left arm orthodox bowler had the hapless Sri Lankans under her spell at Bert Sutcliffe Oval at Lincoln on Tuesday.
Nielsen, 25, took five wickets for 21 runs as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 126 in another ten wicket defeat. The Hamilton-based structural engineer, who plays her provincial cricket for the Otago Sparks, snatched the prized wicket of Sri Lankan skipper and opener Chamari Atapattu, who top scored with 56 runs.
Atapattu, who took over the leadership when tour captain Shashikala Siriwardene fractured her thumb in the third one day international, hit seven fours in her 89 ball innings. Only Ama Kanchana, with 31 off 37 balls, offered any real runs support. While Nielsen was the star of the White Ferns' attack, medium pacer Sophie Devine took two wickets for 30.
New Zealand coach Haidee Tiffin rested regular opener Rachel Priest, who had hit two centuries and a 50 against the tourists earlier, but there was little respite for the Sri Lankan bowlers.
White Ferns skipper Suzie Bates and Canterbury stalwart Amy Satterthwaite reached the 127 run target in the 19th over. They brought up the 100 in 62 minutes off 95 balls with Bates 70 not out at the end after hitting 10 fours and Satterthwaite smiting six boundaries in her 49. stuff.co.nz
