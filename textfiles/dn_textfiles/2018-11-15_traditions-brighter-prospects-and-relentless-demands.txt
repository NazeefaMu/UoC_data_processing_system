Traditions, brighter prospects and relentless demands

History will record that Sri Lanka rugby kicked off a spanking season 2018/19 in spite of speculative rumblings.
Plenty of experts and pundits on the expat players’ platform...is required? Should Sri invest? And what next to get us the respect and ranking we deserve in Asia?
We have to blood newer skill and pathway players into the club system ... so that our DNA pool is full of solid quality and able to match the likes Japan, Hong Kong, Korea etc...
We must aspire to the top and enough rhetoric ...skills and discipline the best way to stamp our class.
Many seasons have half marched past us and not much to brag about the depth of quality or encouraging results.
Time to leave our old baggage in the parking lot and calculated risks to become contenders.
If indeed the club format has the plan in hand covered, then our prospects to match Japan ... lunge forward knowing and able to tap our resources as demanded.
Do hesitate before you pace up to brand me a purveyor of gloom...
Understand the prospects and player environment, compared to 10 years ago.... are admirably better.
But that does not give us more clout to outplay them or match them.
Our reality stops dead here...and ...comparisons generally are pretty on paper... reality its own unforgiving self.
The Sri Japan divide is huge and for us players... massively intimidating.
Japans RWC was magical and carefully Eddie Jones structured to perfection.
Full credit beating the South Africans and giving Ireland a run for their money....
Now realistically translate that exact match up ...to Sri Lanka.
Ask yourself and consider us vs SA or Ireland?
The mind boggles....as the boys amble to a short line out just outside the Irish 22m....
The dream saps the reserve and more energy to contemplate such a fab day for our glorious rugby
Asia awaits that grand metamorphosis...
Reality on the deck is far from such speculation as the club season kicked off last weekend... Kandy the defending champs played and nudged past a gutsy Air Force under Fijian coach Ferretti... pleasing start upfront at the turbo arena in Ratmalana.
Navy huffed and puffed against a new look Police at their running park, surviving the battle to sneak home and plenty for coach Jayatilake to analyse and deliberate.
The traditional Colombo 7 grudge match ..Longden Place vs Maitland Crescent was a real test for fans and harder upfront than anticipated.
A Ratwatte inspired kick settled in the last 5mins of play and a famous big W for CR to celebrate and CH to contemplate the power of thinking under pressure.
Team effort has no name on it ...and CH will start to understand the value of commitment and skills under pressure.
National rep players need to stand apart at most times and display the sharp potential that makes them proud Sri islanders.... especially for young school kids on their inspiration trail.
As the weeks line up ...we will begin to understand the demands on clubs, management, leadership and all players.
The secret is defined by the depth of your reserve bench and the 23 listed for the game each weekend.
Injury and damage control to key players ...the vital oxygen for a consistent season.
I anticipate a big challenge for Kandy to defend their title... and the decent prospect of CR, Navy, Havies or CH stepping up to carve some new history for their faithful.
Bula bula the fantastic skills that will shape this season beyond words and heartache .
Cheers islanders for fairplay and respect.
