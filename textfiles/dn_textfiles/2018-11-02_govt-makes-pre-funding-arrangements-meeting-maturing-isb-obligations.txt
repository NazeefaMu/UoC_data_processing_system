Govt makes pre-funding arrangements for meeting maturing ISB obligations

The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) has been issuing International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) since 2007. GOSL has maintained an unblemished record on servicing of its debt obligations timely, including ISBs, since independence.
ISBs issued in January and April 2014 in United State Dollar (USD) 1,000 million and 500 million, respectively, are due to mature in January and April 2019 according to a release by the central Bank.
The Government has already made pre-funding arrangements for meeting the maturing ISB obligations in 2019 through proceeds of divestment of non-strategic assets and funding through syndicate arrangements.
While exploring an ideal window to further access international capital markets, GOSL and Central Bank of Sri Lanka have already initiated necessary actions to further diversify international market based foreign funding sources to jurisdictions outside conventional Eurodollar ISB issuances.
