Grammy Awards is coming back TO New York!

After spending 14 years in Los Angeles, the 60th edition of Grammy Awards 2018 ceremony would be held in New York.
Mayor Bill de Blasio and executives from Madison Square Garden, CBS and the Recording Academy announced on Tuesday that the Grammy Awards ceremony would be held at Madison Square Garden in New York on January 28, returning the event to the city for the first time in 15 years.
In a statement, de Blasio said that there is no better place for music’s biggest night than the world’s greatest city and bringing these awards back to the city would allow them to further support and foster the music industry in New York.
Nominees for the 60th annual Grammy Awards will be announced later this year.
