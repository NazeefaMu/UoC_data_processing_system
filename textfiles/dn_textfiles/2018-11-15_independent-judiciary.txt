An independent Judiciary

Yesterday’s verdict of the country’s Apex Court that went against the Government, as things stand for the moment, is a clear demonstration of the independence of the Judiciary post January 2015. For this, all independent minded citizens, no doubt, would salute President Maithripala Sirisena. He never sought to interfere in the affairs of the judiciary since his election as President, not even when his own tenure was circumscribed by a Supreme Court ruling which held that his term will be confined to five years under the 19th Amendment and not six as was originally thought.
Legal analysts expressing their opinion, as reported in our front page yesterday, was emphatic that the President never influenced the work of the judiciary in anyway after he came to power in January 2015. They all appreciated the President’s stance of non- interference in the affairs of the judiciary regarding a decision that he has made. The President’s upholding of the supremacy of the people should be admired by all, they say.
There was not even a whiff of scandal so far during his tenure where the rulings of the Supreme Court have been called into question. Even the Bar Association of Sri Lanka which normally is at loggerheads with the incumbent Head of State over alleged interference in the affairs of the Judiciary has had no issue with President Sirisena in this regard. On the contrary, relations between all arms of the judiciary and the President have never been so good. No judge has been accused of belonging to any one of the political camps as in the past.
In fact, even the appointments to the Supreme Court were done by the President in terms of seniority. He did not consider factors such as political affiliation and ethnicity in this process. There was not even a hint of threat or intimidation directed at members of the Judiciary even when the rulings in certain cases- particularly those referred to the Supreme Court for determination by Parliament- were not favourable to the Government.
This was a far cry from the days when the homes of Supreme Court Judges were stoned by goons unleashed by the UNP Government for delivering an unfavourable verdict. Not only that, there were instances when Judges were summoned before the country’s leaders for ‘briefings’ on the way certain judgments have to be delivered. One Chief Justice, a handpicked appointee of JRJ, who, nevertheless acted independently, stepped down on his own accord before being summoned before Parliament for an inquisition.
As one of the three pillars upholding the people’s sovereignty- the others being the Executive and the Legislature- it goes without saying that the Judiciary is an organ that has to function independently and any leader seeking to trifle with this independence will only take the country downhill. Judges are a special breed and should be treated as such. On no account should the Executive is seen to be at odds with the judiciary.
Equally the judiciary should not appear to be doing the bidding of the State. Rightly or wrongly this has been the ingrained impression among the public at large beginning from around the 1970s when Felix Dias Bandaranaike who it was said made it a habit to be present in courts when important judgements involving the State were delivered. Many Governments that followed tried to intimidate the Judiciary when it sought to act independently. While some judges succumbed there were others who stood their ground and refused to be intimidated even though this harmed their prospects of promotion to the next tier.
Such a state of affairs would not only lead to a breakdown of confidence in the whole justice system but also belittle the crucial role of the Judiciary. Therefore, it is important that members of the Judiciary assert themselves and play the role the public expect of them. Thankfully, President Sirisena has prepared the necessary climate for this by his non-interference in the judicial process.
Equally the members of the Judiciary should also conduct themselves as befitting the exalted status attached to them. We have seen in the past how some of our judges have compromised themselves by the lure of various carrots dangled before them. We are not saying that their successors to the Bench were influenced by similar prospects awaiting them and delivered judgements in favour of the State. But it is important that they do not leave behind even a smidgen of suspicion as to their motives. This is more so because the Judiciary is the last bastion where those aggrieved by injustice by the State can turn to for justice.
It is hoped that Tuesday’s Supreme Court ruling will serve as a calming effect on three weeks of political turmoil that brought the State to a standstill and had a numbing effect on the populace. The warring factions should end the stalemate and set the wheels of State back in motion. Leaders of all political parties should act responsibly and restore order out of the present chaos. The people expect nothing less from their representatives in Parliament.
