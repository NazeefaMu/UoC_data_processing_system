Maldives, Sri Lanka eliminate filaria as a public health problem

The WHO South-East Asia Region is targeting the elimination of lymphatic filariasis, kala-azar, schistosomiasis, trachoma and leprosy as a public health problem. It is also seeking to end yaws. Out of the nine countries endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF) in the Region, Maldives and Sri Lanka have eliminated the disease as a public health problem, WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia statement said.
According to the statement, Thailand and Bangladesh have completed mass drug administration (key initiative for LF elimination) in all endemic areas, while India became the first country globally to be verified for yaws elimination and formally acknowledged to be yaws free in 2016.
The region is closer to achieving elimination of kala-azar as a public health problem.

The Region accounts for 74 percent of new leprosy cases reported globally, 41 per cent of global kala-azar cases and 42 percent of children who require preventive chemotherapy for soil-transmitted helminthes, the statement said.
Adopting a ‘Call for Action’ at a high-level ministerial meeting in Jakarta, WHO South East Asian Region Member countries pledged, according highest priority to accelerating efforts against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), added the statement.
