Pabasara bids farewell

The funeral of Liyanakutapitiya Arachchilage Savindi Pabasara Jayasekera alias Doni (17), a Grade 12 student of a Colombo school, who died after being run over by a train in close proximity to the Kottawa railway station on June 14 night, was held at the Makumbura public cemetery amidst a large gathering on June 17 afternoon.
Pabasara was run over by a train while she was returning home after attending a private tuition class in Nugegoda.
The Homagama Acting Magistrate who held the inquiry into her death sent the body to the Colombo South Hospital, Kalubowila for a post mortem examination. JMO Dr. H.K.R. Sanjewa conducted the post mortem and thereafter the Acting Magistrate returned an open verdict and sent her body parts to the government analyst for examination and report since Pabasara’s father in his evidence expressed suspicion over her death. Earlier, the train driver in a statement to Kottawa police had said he saw the girl keeping her neck over the rail track. The Kottawa police are investigating.
