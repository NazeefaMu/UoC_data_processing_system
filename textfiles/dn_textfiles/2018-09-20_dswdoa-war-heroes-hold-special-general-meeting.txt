DSWDOA War Heroes hold special general meeting

The Defence Service War Disabled Officers’ Association (DSWDOA) held its special general meeting on September 16 at ‘Ape Gama’ in Battaramulla with the participation of a large gathering of Commissioned Offices of the Army, Navy and Air Force who had sustained battle injuries and were later subjected to premature retirement from their respective services.
Despite their commitment to ensure freedom of the country and its people since 2009, these War Heroes who had suffered injuries and had to leave the service are facing a depressing plight, especially upon reaching their retirement age of 55. This is the time that they need the assistance of the government the most. Therefore, with the aim of obtaining the assistance of the government in resolving their grievances that these injured officers of the Tri forces, have formed this non-political association.
During their meeting, the group proposed and seconded the proposals to have their pay continued after the retirement age of 55, have the duty free vehicle permit re-activated for the disabled, be granted promotions, parallel to their peers upholding their dignity, be issued with a standard identity card, and permitted to contribute to the Army Benevolent Fund.
The DSWDOA expressed its gratitude to Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake for having taken immediate action to resolve their issues pertaining to the issuing of a standard identity card and permitting them to contribute to the Army Benevolent Fund.
During the discussion, the members reiterated the concerns and their difficulties on the treatment procedures for medically board out officers.
The theme song of the DSWDOA was also released and the official web site was launched during the meeting, which can be accessed on www.dswoa.lk
The DSWOA also unveiled their reforestation initiative under three phases titled ‘Green War’ supported by the popular musical group ‘Api Machang’. Phase one will clean and replant on the beaches, phase two will initiate the planting of trees on either side of selected roads and under phase three reforesting of national parks such as Vilpattu, Yala and Aththidiya would be carried out to benefit the country despite their disabilities.
The DSWOA has also organised a musical extravaganza with Api Machang at the Vihara Maha Devi Open Air Theatre to fund this ambitious project, of which the dates would be notified later.
