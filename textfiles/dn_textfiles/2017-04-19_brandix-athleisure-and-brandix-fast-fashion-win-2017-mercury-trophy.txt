Brandix Athleisure and Brandix Fast Fashion win 2017 Mercury Trophy

Competitive volleyball of the highest order was witnessed when the men’s and women’s finals of the Brandix ‘Rasadiya Kusalanaya’ (Mercury Trophy) tournament, the largest competition of its kind conducted by a single corporate entity in Sri Lanka worked off at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium recently.
In a repeat of last year’s men’s final, Teejay Lanka PLC - Avissawella met Brandix Athleisure - Polonnaruwa, but could not retain the trophy, succumbing 25–20, 22-25, 15-17 to last year’s losing finalist.
In the women’s final, Brandix Fast Fashion 2 - Mirigama overcame a spirited Brandix Fast Fashion, Minuwangoda 24–26, 25–14, 25–21 to retain the trophy its team won in 2016.
More than 350 players representing 17 men’s teams and 12 women’s teams competed in the preliminary rounds of the annual tournament’s seventh edition, demonstrating the depth of the Brandix Group’s commitment to the national sport.
Conducted for the non-executive employees (or associates, as they are referred to at Brandix), the Brandix Rasadiya Kusalanaya tournament is considered a significant contributor to the popularisation of volleyball and the development of players from rural areas while promoting employee interaction and team spirit within the Group.
For their individual performances in this year’s men’s final, Suresh Kumara and Amila Ishan of Brandix Athleisure - Polonnaruwa were adjudged Best Setter and Best Player respectively, while Haritha Fernando of Teejay Lanka PLC was declared Best Attacker. Among the women players in the final, Dilhani Gunasena and Oshini Chapa of Brandix Fast Fashion 2, Mirigama received the awards for Best Setter and Best Player respectively, while Harshani Kodithuwakku of Brandix Fast Fashion - Minuwangoda was awarded Best Attacker.
“Volleyball is the adopted sport of Brandix, and has helped the Group win many mercantile sector tournaments, while at the same time stimulating employee bonding and competitive skills,” said Colonel Sujith Jayasekara, Senior General Manager Group Human Resources of Brandix.
“The quality of volleyball played improves each year and we are happy to see that this tournament is contributing to build a pool of players for mercantile as well as national tournaments. It also helps build character, versatility and leadership skills among our associates.”
