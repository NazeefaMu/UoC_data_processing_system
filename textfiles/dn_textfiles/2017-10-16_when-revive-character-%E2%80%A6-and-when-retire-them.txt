When to revive a character … and when to retire them

This season’s foremost literary body-snatcher is John le Carré with his novel A Legacy of Spies. He has brought back, albeit in a supporting role, his most celebrated character, George Smiley, the “short, fat” and “owlish” spy who appeared in eight of le Carré’s novels between 1961 and 1990. The new novel has been well-received, perhaps because it gratifies the nostalgic reader not just with Smiley but with other characters from the story that made le Carré’s name, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.
This unexpected return at the far end of le Carré’s career made me think of other writers who return to characters over and over, why they do it and to what effect. Naturally there are good commercial reasons for doing so but let’s assume for the sake of argument that, unlike Hollywood studios for whom the sequel and threequel are essential bottom-line ballast, writers are generally not driven by avarice. (If they are, they’ve clearly never read any of those reliably grim reports on author earnings.)
Ever-expanding series
There are, let’s say, three main ways in which writers revisit their characters. The first is in the genre series, with crime and fantasy rich soil for returns. Clearly a hero who runs through a body of work gives the reader something to hold onto, and gives the author a central pillar around which to wind other characters and plots, as well as the continuity to drive longer story arcs from book to book. There’s a risk, however, of the writer falling too much in love, of the unstoppable force of an ever-expanding series meeting the immovable object of human lifespan – which is what happened to Robert Jordan, who died in 2007 before completing his twelve-volume Wheel of Time fantasy series.
One writer who did have the commitment to abandon his most popular character is Ian Rankin. Having decided early on to age his Edinburgh detective John Rebus in real time, Rankin realized he had to retire him when the character reached sixty. “I wasn’t bored with him. Each book added to my understanding of him. But he had to go.” This rigorous approach – with the demands of verisimilitude – did, nonetheless, permit Rankin to bring Rebus back again a few novels later, by having him staff a cold cases investigation unit, a plausible end for a retired cop. The challenges of keeping it realistic for a man past retirement age – his health is failing so “he isn’t able to intimidate suspects the way he once did”, as Rankin puts it – keeps the series fresh for both reader and writer.
Other writers create not just one recurring character, but a community of them, vanishing and appearing through a life’s work. Sometimes these are part of a formal series – Anthony Powell’s A Dance to the Music of Time, Olivia Manning’s war trilogies – but the ad hoc approaches are, I think, more interesting. Take Bret Easton Ellis, whose psychotically vapid LA-based characters have attended one another’s parties and cameoed in one another’s novels, getting busy and popping Xanax, throughout his career. The interchangeability of his characters – or, more charitably, the consistency of his vision – may make that easier, and indeed I read
Curious affirmation
The Informers (1994) as a novel, thrilled by my own thwarted efforts to connect the chapters, before realizing it was a collection of stories. But he has also written a formal sequel: his most recent novel Imperial Bedrooms followed the characters of his debut Less Than Zero twenty-five years on. It was a dud, lifeless in all the wrong ways, with little of the wit that is Ellis’s greatest strength – a curious affirmation of Ellis’s claim that his motivation for returning to Clay and friends was never about audience-pleasing. “I don’t think about the reader – ever – and I don’t care”, he said at the time of publication. The reader, this time, didn’t care back.
More amenable to the reader is Amanda Craig, with her satire-cum-mystery The Lie of the Land. On its acknowledgements page Craig lists the characters who have previously featured in her novels. Here, minor characters become major and vice versa. Craig cites influence in the books of Alison Lurie, and Balzac’s Comédie Humaine, where “as a reader it gave me delight to spot” recurring characters. And as a writer, “it helps turn the toil of writing into something more like a game you are playing in a parallel imaginary world”.
Then we come to the le Carré approach, which is to write a major character into books only occasionally. Smiley has recurred in increasingly tangential ways, just as Philip Roth’s fictional alter ego Nathan Zuckerman did: first front and centre in those dazzling reflexive novels starting with The Ghost Writer through to The Counterlife, then as little more than a framing device in the later surge that produced American Pastoral and others.
Changing America
There is a grand tradition of exploring an individual life in a series of books, the grandfather being John Updike and his quartet of novels about Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom. Updike’s genius was to take a character who in his first outing was unsympathetic, and in later novels build the reader’s empathy for him. Updike’s purpose was “giving the mundane its beautiful due” and if the second novel in the series, Rabbit Redux, was perhaps a little too mundane, all was forgiven with the third and best book, Rabbit is Rich. Updike, writing each book at the turn of a decade, gave us not just a developing character but a changing America: race conflicts, oil crises, and the rest. Even when he killed Rabbit in the final, fattest volume Rabbit at Rest (“enough. Maybe. Enough”), Updike, in Martin Amis’s phrase “a psychotic Santa of volubility”, couldn’t resist resurrecting him in the 200-page “story” ‘Rabbit Remembered’, a neat ten years later. Updike admitted it was “easy” to keep returning to Rabbit. “It was like coming home every ten years and paying a visit . . . It was a world that I had lived through as a child, and then it was a world that I had made.” Updike died in 2009, a year before we could find out whether he would have made one final trip.
Richard Ford did it too, driving even more mundanity into art than Updike did, with the story of the sportswriter-turned-realtor Frank Bascombe: a sort of Rabbit by Richard. (In fact, although he acknowledges influence by the existence of the Rabbit series, Ford has apparently read only one of them: Rabbit is Rich. A good place to start, and stop.) The Sportswriter (1984) and Independence Day (1995) were masterly, but after the final Bascombe novel, the long and slow The Lay of the Land (2006), I had had enough and it looked as though Ford had too. A couple of books later, though, he found himself with a certain itch. Readers were asking him to write Bascombe again, and he wondered about fictionalizing the effect of 2012’s Hurricane Sandy.
What he gave us was the excruciatingly titled collection of linked stories, Let Me Be Frank With You which had, at least, the virtue of brevity. But Ford denies any interest in developing Bascombe’s character: “I don’t really know how much Frank has changed. I just go on making him up”.
