Influenza A (H1N1), not an epidemic

Dengue has become an epidemic in Sri Lanka but not Influenza A (H1N1). Influenza A (H1N1) is not a public health issue in Sri Lanka, acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said since Influenza A (H1N1) is endemic and an ordinary seasonal disease, state health institutions do not keep track records on the disease. A majority of the infected are cured without any complications, Dr. Bandara said.
Allergies have been reported from the victims of the Meethotamulla tragedy but no other disease had been reported. Health authorities took immediate action to prevent diseases such as dengue, rat fever, etc. among the victims of the tragedy. Counseling services are also offered to them, Dr. Bandara said. The National Child Development Centre will be established at Mulleriyawa to assist children with autism. Child development centres will be set up in every province for the same purpose. Artistes, journalists, sportsmen and women can help children who suffer from autism to change their lives, he added.
