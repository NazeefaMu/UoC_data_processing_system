Minimum Standards of Medical Education must be gazetted: GMOA

Efforts are being made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe through intervening to gazette the Minimum Standards of Medical Education while the Health Minister is trying his best not to gazette it, the Government Medical Officers; Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference health at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the GMOA made a written request from President Maithripala Sirisena last evening to appoint a Presidential Commission to investigate SAITM, its past and present, similar to the Commission appointed to investigate the Central Bank Bond Issue. According to Dr. Herath, the Health Minister should immediately resign from his position if he fails to keep his own promise and gazette the Minimum Standards of Medical Education on or before August 14th. Three more working days and five full days are left for him to keep his own promise made to the country by stating that the gazette will be issued in two weeks. He is wasting millions of public funds on the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital.
The gazette on Minimum Standards of Medical Education will expose the low standard of SAITM and its education, prevent the birth of institutions similar to SAITM in the future, enable patients to obtain medical treatment from hospitals with confidence just as they did in the past and do now and they will not need to check the standard of the doctor they receive medical treatment from, he added.
