Regular checks of Kelani River water

The quality of water supplied from the Kelani River is tested regularly and distributed only if it is safe for consumption, Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauf Hakeem said.
He said the odour and change in colour was reported in the water from the Biyagama and Kadawatha areas.This was due to contamination of oil and debris to stream water. He added the National Water Supply and Drainage Board took prompt action by placing sand bags to prevent the contaminated water from flowing to the Kelani River after it was reported. Minister Hakeem said the contamination of water was a result of the recent flood situation in the country.
The Minister requested the public not to panic, adding that the water quality is being constantly tested at treatment plants. He stressed that the Water Board distributes water from the plant only if it is safe for consumption.
