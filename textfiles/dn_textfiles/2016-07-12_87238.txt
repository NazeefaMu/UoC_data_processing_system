Remember Anura Ranasinghe the great all-round cricketer: REMININSCING  WITH TILAK

 
Anura Ranasinghe was a fearless fighter to the core. His never say die attitude is what drew so many cricketers and friends around him.
Those who have seen and played with him did not describe him without doubt or hesitation, as the most talented batsmen to come out of the Nalanda Stables at the time. It was a tragic loss to cricket when he and a host of other highly talented cricketers including Bandula Warnapura were banned from all forms of cricket. This ban was for a considerable time for taking part in the “rebel tour of South Africa.” Anura passed away at a young age. He played 2 Tests and 9 ODI’s and was a five-star all-rounder at the time. If the IPL was in existence then, he would easily have been hot property.
I saw Anura Ranasinghe only three or four times, when I came down on vacation from UK. He was a born cricketer and a leader. As a youngster at the tender age of 14, Anura was capable of walking into the Nalanda First Eleven team. On his debut he sparkled with an unbeaten innings of 115 against Maliyadeva College. He followed this up by leading the Nalanda College team, Sri Lanka under 19 team and Sri Lanka under 25 teams with success.
Anura Ranasinghe
 
In 1975 Anura leading Nalanda broke the Ananda-Nalanda bowling record of P.W. Perera which stood for over 30 years. Anura scored a swashbuckling 77 n.o. against India and lusty half centuries against England and Australia. These three gems of batting are still etched in the memories of his fans.
The turning point of Anura”s life was axing him from the inaugural Test against England. This was even after scoring a fifty against the same opposition a few days earlier. A cricketer who put country before self, Anura was lost to Sri Lanka cricket due to the action administered behind the curtain.
Anura was the most feared all-rounder in school, club and international cricket. He gained everything from cricket and also lost everything because of cricket. Once Anura mentioned that, “The first Test is over, but the scar in my heart can never be cured, and once a heart is broken it is shattered forever.”
My observation of him was that he played late like all great batsmen, timed his strokes to perfection and picked the gaps with pin point accuracy. His left-arm medium pace bowling was sharp and he could swing the ball late both ways. He was also lithe and wiry which made him a brilliant fielder. The total package was devastating to the opposition.
Anura was 26 years old at his prime when the curtain came down on his career drastically. The Sri Lanka Cricket Board’s 25-year ban imposed was too harsh. Cricket was his life. He was devastated and he passed away at the age of only 42. In my book, Anura Ranasinghe was the best All-Rounder produced by Sri Lanka up to thus far. ”They say the good die young.”
