Call to serve

The recent decision given by the Colombo High Court regarding the criminal misappropriation of funds by the former Presidential Secretary Lalith Weeratunga and the other has revived an old debate over the relationship between the senior public servant and the politician.
The High Court action should shake the entire bureaucracy, especially the senior officers of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS), out of their complacency. It should make them introspect on how they should regulate their responses to ministerial demands for unequivocal compliance of directions.
The relationship between senior public servants and their political masters is one of the central issues in our contemporary governance. To a certain extent, the neat distinctions of the original public administration thinkers - politicians make policy, public servants implement policy –has become more theoretical than real.
In political sense, both groups of actors can claim a legitimate role in policymaking. However, in democratic terms, the claims of the political leaders may carry greater weightage. They have a popular mandate through elections and therefore can claim to represent the will of the people.
The main claim from the senior public servants for involvement in making policy is the expertise of the bureaucracy. They believe most politicians are amateurs in the policy areas and only the experienced public servant can offer direction and advice to make the best possible political decision.
Delicate balance
All politicians, by their inbuilt nature, are eager to pursue their political ambitions. They want to be in the limelight not only in Parliament but with media and across their constituents. In the process, most of them would like to have the allegiance of the senior public servants to make their political ambitions realised.
By convention, however, government servants are excluded from helping politicians directly to fulfil their political ambitions. Particularly, a public servant’s role is such that he must maintain a neutrality in political matters, in order to ensure confidence in the political impartiality of the Administration Service.
The challenge in this broader perspective is how to create a willingness between politicians and senior public servants to embrace the virtues of consultation and consensus. In principle, the senior public servants should never be coerced by politicians, to fulfil their political dreams. In short, the public service must be free from all political affluence. The strength of this position is that it will enable politicians and senior public servants to address national problems jointly, and to know that public policy is grounded in the concrete experiences of the community.
Neutrality
At this point, it might be appropriate for us take a brief look at how the relationship between politician and public servant operates in the UK.
Public Administration Select Committee of House of Commons, Politics and Administration: Ministers and Civil Servants. Third Report of Session 2006–07 – (Volume I) states:
“The civil service’s relationship with government has long been recognised as more complex than simply being the enthusiastic instrument of government policies. As Dr Matthew Flinders of Sheffield University put it: “In practice, it is quite clear that the bureaucracy has its own implicit values, wants and desires and these may on occasion conflict with the instructions of ministers”.
“Yet the only explicit acknowledgement of this potential for conflict within the current system is when civil servants act in the role of Accounting Officers. In that context, they have a clearly defined role as the guardians of propriety in public expenditure. If they believe a particular expenditure would be a misuse of public funds, they may formally note the fact. The minister may override their objections, but the note is sent to the Treasury and the Comptroller and Auditor General. Such a note will inevitably come to the attention of the Public Accounts Committee.” It is quite clear that according to the British government’s view, the civil servant is responsible to ministers, but, as the role of Accounting Officer, that responsibility is complex, and not limited simply to implementing government policies.
Carltona doctrine
In UK, The Carltona doctrine is the legal principle under which civil servants exercise power on behalf of ministers. It expresses the idea that the acts of government departmental officials are synonymous with the actions of the minister in charge.
The point was established in Carltona Ltd v. Commissioners of Works. The judgment states:
“In the administration of government in this country the functions which are given to ministers (and constitutionally properly given to ministers because they are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious that no minister could ever personally attend to them. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case.”
“Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The minister is responsible. It is he who must answer before Parliament for anything these officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament.”
Sri Lankan context
Sri Lanka’s public service has experienced several changes in its chequered history during the post-independence era. With the independence in 1948, one of the political issues which cropped up was whether Sri Lanka should continue with the Civil Service. Accordingly, in 1959, Wilmot A. Perera Commission was appointed to study the existing system and make suitable recommendations. In their report, the Commission stressed the need for unification of the Government administrative grades.
What the Commission meant by the term “unification” was the absorption of the Ceylon Civil Service and all other officers performing administrative functions in various departments, who do not belong to the Ceylon Civil Service, into one common group of officers. In 1963, the government abolished the Ceylon Civil Service and a created a unified administrative service to be termed as Ceylon Administrative Service. In 1972, the name was changed to Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS). Along with this change, Public Service Commission (PSC), the constitutionally mandated independent body was also abolished and the powers of recruitment, transfer and disciplinary control of public officers had been vested in the Cabinet.
In 1978, PSC was re-established but powers of appointment of secretaries was retained by the cabinet. Independent political analysts believe this provision paved the way for legitimization of political interferences at high levels of appointments. The present government has repeatedly said that steps will be taken to depoliticise the system.
Today, SLAS officers hold key positions in the Central Government, Provincial governments and Public-Sector Undertakings.
Reasons
Fifty four years after the establishment of SLAS, we have to ask ourselves two simple but practical questions. What was the impact of five decades of involvement by the SLAS bureaucrats in nation-building and socio-economic development? Were the expected objectives of forming a unified Administrative Service achieved?
Some fifty odd years ago, we had an enviable public administration system considered to be one of the best in Asia. Going by the severity of the public dissatisfaction during the past decades, it is obvious the quality of service has plummeted down.
Other than the political interferences, there are other reasons as well for this downfall.
(1) Most of our political leaders do not demonstrate high standards of propriety in the discharge of their official duties
(2) Most of our public officials (including seniors) act ignorant the fundamental values of the public service and standards of integrity and conduct to apply in their daily work?
(3) We have not properly identified the risks to integrity in key government activities and have not developed countermeasures to manage these risks?
(4) We have failed to place fool-proof solid mechanisms to enable civil society organisations, media and the wider public to scrutinise government Public servants’ actions.
There has been a growing debate over politicisation of public administrative service which is damaging the service. Apparently, the gap between politicians’ rhetoric, public expectations and the day-to-day dilemmas facing senior public servants wanting to improve the quality of the public services is increasing. Despite a Ministry of Public Management Reforms, the SLAS still essentially constitutes a system of public administration rather than of public management.
The need of the future is a cadre of dedicated SLAS officers based on a professionally oriented, technically competent, politically and ideologically neutral bureaucracy.
