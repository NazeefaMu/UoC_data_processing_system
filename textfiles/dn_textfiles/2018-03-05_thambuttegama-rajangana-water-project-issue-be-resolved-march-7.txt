Thambuttegama-Rajangana Water Project issue to be resolved on March 7

The fate of the controversial Thambuttegama-Rajanganaya drinking water supply scheme will be decided on March 7 at the Anuradhapura District Coordination Committee Meeting.
President Maithripala Sirisena will chair the session and the WSDB Irrigation Department officials, Anuradhapura Government Agent and representatives of the Rajangana Farmer Organisation would submit their reports and recommendations at the meeting.
The water project was suspended by the Water Supply and Drainage Board, adhering to the instructions given by Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M.Wanninayake consequently to the chaotic situation created by Rajanganaya farmers opposing to the intake of water for the project from the Rajanganaya Reservoir.
NWSDB North Central Provincial Manager S.C. Lokubarana said the construction work of the scheme was about to commence by the contractors when the picketing was launched.
The Chinese Government has granted a Rs. 17,000 mn loan for the project.
“The Rajanganaya Reservoir can hold 86,000 a.f. of water whereas the proposed drinking water project requires only 15 a.f. water from the tank amounting to 5400 a.f. annually. If this project materialised, over 30,000 families undergoing scarcity of water amidst fast spreading CKDu menace in the Rajanganaya, Thambuttegama, Nochchiyagama areas will get purified drinking water.
We are running a mini water supply project catering to only about 5,000 families with minor irrigation tank, Nallchchiya, Lokubarana said.
The District Agriculture Committee Session held on September 19 chaired by the Anuradhapura Government Agent discussed the issue of Thambuttegama-Rajanganaya Water Project and Anuradhapura Zonal Irrigation Director M.W.P. De Silva has stated that the preliminary studies regarding the project were done and the intake of water for the project would affect agriculture”. It has been agreed that this project would be executed if only additional Mahaweli water is available to Rajanganaya.
