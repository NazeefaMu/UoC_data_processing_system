People have not benefitted from wheat flour tax reduction - MP

Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardana yesterday said that political parties in the government are divided following President Maithripala’s decision to seek a Supreme Court interpretation over his term of office.
He said that the government took the people for a ride by introducing 19th Amendment to the Constitution. “What has happened to the independent commissions established under the 19th Amendment to the Constititution?, he queried.
Addressing a press conference organized by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s election office in Battaramulla, Abeygunawardena said the government removed the import tax on wheat flour by Rs. 9 per kilo but the people did not receive the benefit. “The government loses an income of Rs.18 billion with the removal of import tax on wheat flour. But the price of wheat flour were not reduced in the open market”, he said.
Abeygunawardena replying a statement made by Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya, said that the members of the Rajapaksa family will never betray their relatives or the people with an aim of amassing money or positions. Ratnapura district MP Pavithra Devi Wanniarachchi said the government has failed to maintain proper fiscal management in the country even after two years in office.
