Manusha naive to resign based on Speaker’s statement - MP

“The President has acted in compliance with the Constitution and he has exclusive authority to prorogue parliament,” former Minister and Kurunegala district MP Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said.
Yapa said that Galle district MP Manusha Nanayakkara seems to have forgotten about presidential powers on proroguing parliament, when he was sworn in as Deputy Labour and Foreign Employment Minister.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena appointed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and the entire country endorsed this appointment.
The Labour and Foreign Employment Deputy Minister has resigned from his post yesterday citing prorogation of parliament as unconstitutional, illegal and unconventional.
Nanayakkara said he tendered his resignation based on statement made by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who decided to accepted the status that existed previously.
“As the majority is of the opinion that all changes made in parliament are undemocratic and inconsistent with traditions of parliament and as the majority of parliament have requested that the status that existed before these changes were made shall be accepted, I emphasise that I am compelled to accept the status that existed previously until such time that they and the new political alliance prove their majority in parliament”
MP Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said Manusha Nanayakkara’s decision to resign from the post of Deputy Minister based on the Speaker’s statement demonstrateS that he does not have any understanding on the Constitution.
He added that he will not approve the Nanayakkara’s statement adding that Speaker has powers only to continue the parliament sitting after parliament is reconvened by the President in accordance with the parliamentary traditions.
