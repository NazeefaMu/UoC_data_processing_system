For whom the apocalypse tolls

Despite numerous disasters, Sri Lanka is yet to see a proper contingency plan. People have lost their lives, Properties, owned by both government and private institutions, have been damaged. Politicians and officials, who are supposed to take necessary actions during a disaster, seem to capitalise on the disaster with their media shows of helping the affected.
Several announcements, in the meantime, have been made to advise people to evacuate their residential areas. However, have they been informed of any particular destination in advance and what to take before evacuating?
The Buddha once spotted a queue of black ants and gave a smile. Venerable Ananda Thera asked why. Each black ant, the Buddha explicated, had been a celestial king in a previous birth. The karma leads one to either hell or heaven in the next birth, irrespective of whatever position they currently hold.
Hence, one needs to understand the danger and suffering of this long samsara journey.
AWARENESS
The people in identified areas should be made aware in advance by:
1. Pasting a notice in all such houses informing them the place allocated for them to go for shelter and advising them what should be taken along with them including the documents
2. Issuing identity cards for them to wear
3. Issuing life jackets to each person with instructions how to wear
4. Pasting a notice referring to important contact numbers. These contact numbers could be approachable before or during the disaster
5. Pasting notices on how to protect properties of people leaving their houses.
MANAGEMENT OF REFUGEE CENTRE
Refugee Centres in each divisional secretarial areas should be identified. The following factors should be attended to.
1. Have a record of how many male and female refugees can be accommodated
2. Plan temporary separations for changing clothes
3. Install permanent generators
4. Prepare names and addresses of people with their working skills to be accommodated with copies to be given to Divisional Secretary, Grama Sevaka and heads of centre.

7. Construct male/female toilets on a permanent basis with water tanks, shower cubicles, store rooms, working staff accommodations, doctor-room with the clinic, sick room and kitchen facilities.
8. Install temporary radio communication sets.
9. Lockers to keep valuables and store during the occupation.
10. Temporary water bowsers.
11. Deploy security staff 24 hrs at entrances.
12. Adequate staff to manage during operations. Government officers can be detailed similar to election duties.
13. Provide adequate lights, plug points etc.

18. Activate operation centres for 24 hrs. Managed by the Police and Grama Sevaka.
19. Whenever possible, a study room for students.
20. Receipt books and registers to acknowledge all donations.
21. Appoint committees that consist of the head of the centre, the police and the Grama Sevaka. A few civilians should be chosen from the area to meet daily and monitor operations of the centre and take suitable action when necessary.
22. Provide petty cash through the Divisional Secretary.
23. Common standing order/ circular must be issued to all centres regarding its management.
ROLE OF THE DIVISIONAL SECRETARY
Each office must have a generator in case of electricity failure. The DS offices of all affected areas must have an additional building with space for storage of goods such as cooking utensils, holdalls and tents. A room should also be allocated for the DS who should be on 24-hour duty to rest. A standing order/circular should be issued offering the DS more powers in spending and hiring during the disaster period. Detailed lists of all people with their addresses, skills, contact numbers, under each refugee centre under each Divisional Secretary, should be provided. Identify the requirement of staff to each centre and how their services can be obtained. Identify the requirement of vehicles and logistics and how and from where they can be obtained or hired. All emergency and contacts where services can be obtained should also be explored. Activate the operation Room for 24 hours.
A Radio communication set should also be installed permanently. Preparation of common standing orders, circulars regarding the responsibilities of the DS and the Grama Sevakas during the disaster period is also necessary. Have maps of affected areas indicating the refugee centres, place of floods, landslides etc with the number of females and males to be given shelters.
Appoint officials to accept donations to manage stores, distributions and maintaining records and issuing receipts for all donations. Provide petty cash to each centre with a standing order to manage. Prepare lists of requirements to each centre including repair work and how and from where such facilities can be obtained. Have a list of standby electricians, plumbers, civil workers and generator technicians to obtain services during the affected period on payments.
DISASTER MANAGEMENT CENTRE
Activate the operation room 24 hours with representatives from all government and private agencies involved in disaster management work.
Have adequate telephones and radio communication sets of police and three forces operated by those officers. Maintain all records of affected areas including people and properties. Appoint a media officer with staff. Arrange daily discussions. Prepare a standing order/circular as to how the management centre should be operated. Appoint staff to obtain foreign donations, store and issue through the relevant officials. Rent or purchase a large storehouse to store the foreign donations and other purchased items which can be used during a disaster. Prepare a detailed work plan regarding the prevention of disasters in consultation of professionals and ensure implementation.
Appoint a team of Architects, structural engineers and civil engineers to plan out to build houses on concrete columns with costs and provide free professional services to the public. When possible, arrange bank loans and provide financial assistance. Prepare a detailed plan regarding post-disaster period for implementation.
COLLECTING CENTRES
All private collecting centres, collecting donations, must be registered with the Disaster Management Centre in advance. A form should be issued for all, who seek registration and the local police and the Grama Sevaka should make their recommendation before accepting them as collecting centres.
All such collecting centres should be made accountable for all collected donations.
A circular must be issued regarding the management of such centres and the records to be maintained. The collecting centres, once registered, should be issued with a registration number and a certificate.
RESPONSIBILITY OF POLICE
The police at station, division, range and headquarters levels, must activate operational rooms. Sufficient boats with life jackets should be issued to all police stations in the affected areas since they will have difficulty in transportation. All station OICs should ensure protecting the lives of the affected and their property. The police personnel also should be deployed to provide security to all refugee centres and also to manage the operation room of such centres with a police radio communication set.
RESPONSIBILITY OF ARMED FORCES
The officers of armed forces have carried out their duties satisfactorily in the past and will continue the good work in a more planned manner. However, the army personnel must be issued with adequate boats and life jackets to carry out their duties more effectively.
RESPONSIBILITY OF MEDICAL STAFF
A doctor and at least two nurses with adequate medical equipment and drugs should be made available at all refugee camps during the activated period. The arrangement must be made to have the services of an ambulance in a short period to all centres. All government hospitals must have adequate staff, equipment and drugs.
I have given a very brief report above and recommend appointing a team of professionals and administrators to study and prepare a detailed report. The report can indicate guidelines, instructions, logistical and human resources requirements under each responsible person, organisation, institution and refugee centres.
This subject should be treated as urgent and important in view of all damages caused to human lives and the private and government properties.
