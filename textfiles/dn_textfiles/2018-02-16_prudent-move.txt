A prudent move

President Maithripala Sirisena is set to address the nation today, where he is expected unravel the future course of the unity government. The immediate aftermath of the LG election has brought with it a near paralysis of the entire state apparatus, with confusion reigning over the uncertain political situation. The talk in the offices, buses and the market place is about who will be the Prime Minister, or, who will form the government. Little work is being done while the rumour mill is working overtime.
The jockeying by the partners in the Yahapalanaya government for the Prime Minister's post, no doubt, has compounded the situation. The general public too are finding it difficult to come to terms with the true political situation, what with the local bodies dominated by the Opposition, while the state machinery is in the hands of the central government. The rupee has gone into a tailspin vis-a-vis the dollar, and, the share market too has become vulnerable in the wake of the prevailing political uncertainty. Investor confidence, needless to say, would be at a nadir, as a result of the unity government pulling in different directions, in the aftermath of the LG poll. Even the mundane task of garbage disposal, that went without a hitch in the pre-poll days, has come to a standstill, in certain areas, with the municipal labourers none the wiser as to who is in control. In sum, the country is in a chaotic state, the public keeping their fingers crossed for things to unravel in their proper perspective.
It is in this context that the President's address to the nation carries with it great significance. His, no doubt, will be an unenviable task, given the dynamics at work. However, a firm verdict is expected of him in order to end the current imbroglio. The stalemate cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.
Above all, the issue of the Premiership should be sorted out sooner rather than later. If the matter is allowed to drag on interminably there is no knowing what chaos the country will be plunged into. This is because it is the Prime Minister, as the head of the Cabinet, who is the captain of the ship, issuing the necessary directives and coordinating the affairs of the state. Besides, a beleaguered Prime Minister cannot be expected to perform efficiently, with a pall hanging over him, though it has to be noted that Premier Wickremesinghe is made of sterner stuff.
We are seeing a rerun of the situation that prevailed in 2002-2004 where the President and PM were at loggerheads. On that occasion, though, the UNP commanded a majority and could not be dismissed, until it eventually was, when CBK, wielded her constitutional powers, after two years. In this instance, President Sirisena is hamstrung, having to wait until February 2020 to dissolve parliament, if he so desires.
While this is being written, talks are continuing apace to fashion out a settlement agreeable to both sides. The President has left the option open. It is reported that he has called upon both, the UNP and SLFP/UPFA, to come up with the numbers. This is after both sides have declared their intention to form a government of their own. Hectic criss-crossing from Paget road to Temple Trees and vise versa by various actors in the current political drama had been taking place during the last few days, in order to patch up differences, or, strike new deals, all of which have left the public more confused and out of their depths.
The bone of contention, of course, is the premier stakes, with various options being floated, the UNP even reviving its Leadership Council proposal that entails decision making powers vested in the Council.
Amidst the tumult, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has lent a sober voice calling for the continuation of the unity government for the full term of the current parliament. Speaking to the media after unveiling a statue of Sir D. B. Jayatilaka to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of the freedom fighter, the Speaker said that it was his fervent wish that the President and Prime Minister bury the hatchet and work together in unity. “I earnestly wish that the two leaders will continue to work together. Let them discuss and arrive at a settlement”, he said.
Both leaders should take heed of the Speaker's counsel, ignoring the strident war cries from both sides of the divide. The country cannot be allowed to drift simply because the results of a local government election did not go the government's way.
This would also be the sentiment of all right thinking members of the public holding moderate views, who crave for stability, which is vital for progress.
There is over two years to go before the next parliamentary election and if this infighting is going to continue there is no knowing where the country will be headed for. Both sides should put aside their differences born out of parochial considerations and work as a unit, with the country's future well-being in mind.
