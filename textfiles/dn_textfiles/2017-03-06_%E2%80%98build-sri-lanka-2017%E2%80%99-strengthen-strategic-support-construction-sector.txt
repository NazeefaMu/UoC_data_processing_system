‘Build Sri Lanka 2017’ to strengthen strategic  support for construction sector

‘Build Sri Lanka - 2017’, the premier Housing & Construction Exhibition is organized by the Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka (CCI), the apex representative body of all construction industry stakeholders which is recognized by the government.
The exhibition will be held from May 26 to 28, 2017 at the BMICH for the 13th consecutive year. ‘Build Sri Lanka Exhibition’ is today regarded as the most dynamic Building and Construction Trade exhibition in Sri Lanka.
Build Sri Lanka 2017 will host over 300 exhibitors from various sectors of the construction industry island-wide. An impressive country specific pavilion will be a novel feature of Build Sri Lanka 2017, with over 20 Chinese companies registered as part of the ‘China Pavilion.’
The China Pavilion will comprise delegations of these companies looking to expand the country’s ever growing presence in the building and construction sector of the country with innovative, cost effective materials, products and services.
This has much significance in the light of major industrial developments based on Hambantota Port and Colombo Financial Port City Project undertaken as foreign direct investments from China totaling US$ 17 billion (Rs. 2550 billion).
As a proven platform for business transactions, Build Sri Lanka 2017 will showcase the latest developments in the building and construction industry, with eminent industry experts, stakeholders and decision makers in attendance, making it an ideal event to source new products, network and usher in new contacts and business opportunities.
Over 20,000 trade visitors are expected over the course of the event, looking to source the latest, inventive products on offer, not accessible otherwise in the local market, in addition to new product launches and added features, making it an ideal event to source new products, network and usher in new contacts and business opportunities.
“Over the years, we have expanded to cater to the demands not just of the local market, but of the whole Asian region as well. This mega expo is the ideal forum for international players to showcase their products and services to the mutual benefit of both markets,” said Eng. Nissanka N. Wijeratne, Secretary General/ CEO for CCI Sri Lanka.
“Sri Lanka is an ocean of opportunities and ‘Build Sri Lanka’ offers a great platform for the construction industry, with a high potential for business networking, investment and exchange of ideas and information,” said Prasad Perera, Marketing Manager of CCI Sri Lanka.
CCI Sri Lanka is the sole national body, for all construction companies, architects, engineers, quantity surveyors, town planners, land surveyors, valuers, insurers, builders, interior decorators, construction material manufacturers and suppliers, in short encompassing all in construction sector and forms the focal point and voice of construction industry stakeholders in the country.
Apart from holding Build SL Expo annually, CCI Sri Lanka is publishing the one and only Trade and Business Directory specifically targeting the construction sector once in two years. This Directory for the years 2017 and 2018, published for the 5th time, is due to be released during last week of April 2017.
This new Directory will be uploaded to the CCI web site www.ccisrilanka.org and the dedicated web site www.constructiondirectory.lk with a search facility.
Now, CCI Sri Lanka has evolved to become the premier organization facilitating the advancement of the building & construction industry in the country.
