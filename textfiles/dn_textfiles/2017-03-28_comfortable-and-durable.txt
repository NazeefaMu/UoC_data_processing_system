Comfortable and durable

Clarks launched its third store in Colombo 4 recently. It offers a premium range of British key signature styles for the season. The brand juxtaposes vintage British styling with contemporary tailoring to fulfil everyday requirements of work, leisure and travel. Clarks shoes have become synonymous with durability and comfort. It has a history of nearly 200 years bringing the best of Britain and a very unique heritage in shoe design. Clarks has delighted consumers since inception, and very few the world over are unaware of the brand. Premium quality footwear that blends British traditional craft and innovative technology distinguishes and sets Clarks apart.
Kaushalya Perera, Director of D. Samson & Sons (Pvt.) Ltd said, “The Clarks brand has been for ages and customers know about it. It is a durable brand and is known for durability and comfort. Over the years it has revolved into a fashion brand. If we look back 50 years, the brand was there but it was not a fashionable brand. Today it is very much into fashion. We were able to open the third store because the Sri Lankan customers really accept this brand. All three stores are in Colombo. The next one would be in Kandy. The brand is in premium pricing but it is worth it. It is long lasting shoes and the customers do not look into the price and hesitate instead they look into the comfort. The other two Clarks store is available at Crescat Boulevard and Maitland Crescent.”
Speaking on this occasion, Sanjay Pandey, Business Head, Clarks India said, “We have received a very positive and encouraging response from this market and we are very happy to be expanding our footprints in Colombo. Being the experts in footwear industry coupled with beautifully crafted shoes that are on trend, we are hopeful to cater to the needs of the city. With a great partner here in Colombo, we are certain this store will be welcomed warmly.”
Thusitha Rajapaksa, Managing Director, D. Samson & Sons (Pvt) Ltd. added, “We are very happy to announce the launch of our third store in Colombo in association with Clarks. We have had a great partnership with Clarks and we hope to continue bringing the best of footwear trends to Colombo through this partnership.”
