Portrait conquered

Art lovers had the opportunity to view and enjoy a series of paintings done by Dr Shanaka Kulathunga, when his exhibition, Concealed, was open to the public at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery. He has confined this exhibition solely to portrait and figure paintings, a rare attempt by most artistes.
A great portrait, not only brings out the physical form, but also gives us an insight into the character and the personality of the sitter. It is in this respect that the present collection of portraits succeeded in giving us the true quality of portraiture in keeping with the great tradition. This he seems to achieve by his acute observation and following the steps taken by the great masters of this genre. In fact, observing his work he seems to follow on the footsteps of the great masters.
This artist seems to have gained so much not only by art, but also from his study science (medicine) leading to the observation and depiction of the details of a personality. This I feel is a rare advantage he enjoys as a portrait painter.
While concentrating mainly on portraiture, he has presented a single landscape, which proves his ability in that sphere of painting as well. I have noticed in his previous exhibition his skill as a painter of a landscape was widely admired. On this occasion, however, he has offered a single landscape which proves his prowess as a landscapist as well.
