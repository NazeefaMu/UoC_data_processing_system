Sri Lanka Unites to fete eminent  persons on 10th anniversary

Sri Lanka Unites is a movement started by Prashan De Visser as he took the opportunity to replace a culture of divisiveness and conflict and be a voice for change, hope and reconciliation.
As the name suggests, SLU's vision was to unite the youth of all ethnic and religious groups across Sri Lanka, creating a peaceful and prosperous nation for future generations.
As the civil war drew to a close, the initiators of Sri Lanka Unites (SLU) recognized the need for reconciliation amongst the younger generation in order to ensure that the wounds of prejudice do not deem the country to be divided for years to come.
The movement began with a small team of volunteers but 10 years on, due to its growth and impact, SLU now has small team of full-time employees who work alongside to oversee projects throughout all 25 districts.
SLU describes the heart of their movement as the SLU clubs in schools throughout all districts, which now has 20,000 members of different gender, race, and religion, all working towards one goal; a united Sri Lanka.
Through events such as the Future Leaders conference, which brings together the top student leaders from around the country for 5 days, SLU catalyses the process of integration and reconciliation. The conference enables student leaders to meet their peers from various parts of the island and provide the students the opportunity to challenge the prejudices that they may have inherited, empowering them to be agents of change and be a part of the solution.
The recently established reconciliation centres in Mullathivu, Kalmunai, Matara and Moneragala aim to provide education to youth in these districts through Information Technology, language skills and entrepreneurial education skills.
