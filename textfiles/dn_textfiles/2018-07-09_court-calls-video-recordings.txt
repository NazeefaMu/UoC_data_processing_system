Vijayakala’s controversial statement:
Court calls for video recordings

The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court yesterday issued an order directing several media institutions to produce their unedited video footage and paper articles pertaining to the statement made by former State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran regarding the resurgence of the LTTE at a public gathering held in Jaffna.
Filing a B report regarding this incident, the Organized Crimes Prevention Division alleged that the former State Minister could be charged under the offences that appears to have been committed under Section 115 and 120 of the Penal Code, violating the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and provisions stipulated under Article 157A of the Constitution. Article 157A of the Constitution provides Constitutional provisions for prohibition against the violation of the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.
Article 157A(1) of the Constitution cites that no person shall, directly or indirectly, in or outside Sri Lanka, support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka.
The Organized Crimes Prevention Division informed Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake that Police have commenced investigations into this incident pursuant to a complaint made by Sinhala Ravaya General Secretary Ven.Magalkande Sudaththa Thera.
State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheshwaran decided to temporarily resign from her ministerial portfolio following a huge outcry in the country.
Addressing an event held at the Weerasingham Hall in Jaffna on July 2, former State Minister had allegedly said she would like to see the resurgence of the LTTE.
