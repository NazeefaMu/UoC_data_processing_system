Toe catch gives New Zealand series over Australia

Hamilton, Monday: A bizarre off-the-toe catch by Matt Henry brought a fairytale end to Brendon McCullum’s ODI career when New Zealand beat Australia by 55 runs in Hamilton Monday.
The victory in a game that was in Australia’s favour until Henry’s dismissal of Mitchell Marsh, saw McCullum end his limited overs career with a 2-1 series win over the world champions and the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy.

Australia, set a target of 247, had their tails up when they needed 83 off the last 16 overs with five wickets in hand and Marsh, their match-winner in Sunday’s second tie, in full flight.
But the momentum swung back in New Zealand’s favour when a Henry delivery edged off Marsh’s bat, on to his foot, and rebounded back to the bowler.
The umpire turned down an appeal from Henry.
But when the replay on the big screen confirmed what Henry suspected the umpires called for an official review which showed the ball had not touched the ground and a clearly angry Marsh was out.
Australian captain Steve Smith ultimately backed the dismissal but there were questions over whether the review would have been called had there not been a loud crowd reaction to the replay on screen.
“The right decision was made. He was out. There was no doubt about that,” Smith said.
“I think Mattie Henry sort of thought there was a little something and it wasn’t until we saw something on the big screen that the decision actually went upstairs so I was a little disappointed with that.”
With Marsh’s decision the Australian innings collapsed with their last five wickets falling for 27 runs in 10 overs.
New Zealand’s innings had suffered an even worse meltdown when they lost their last six wickets for 23 to be all out for 246.
McCullum, one of the biggest hitters in the game, reeled off 47 in 27 deliveries to give New Zealand a flying start.
His innings included three sixes to give him 200 sixes in his 260-match ODI career which leaves him fourth on the overall list headed by Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi with 351. With McCullum at the crease the New Zealand run rate was near 8.5 but slowed after his dismissal.
