‘YAMAHA Wave Runners’ stirs up Gregory Lake

‘YAMAHA Wave Runner’ succeeded in winning the over-all championship at 2018 Navy Cup Jet Ski competition series. These competitions were held recently, parallel to the Nuwara Eliya Spring Festival. This victory is especially outstanding because it was achieved by winning the over-all championship in the YAMAHA FX Cruiser SVHO Series and by acquiring the first place and the third place in the over- 130 HP Drag category and by overcoming all the world renowned JET SKI brands.
YAMAHA Wave Runner that occupies the front rank among the JET SKI brand, is the first choice of the World’s best JET SKI.
This special championship had been organized by the JET SKI water sports section of the Sri Lankan Navy, for the fifth time. Members of the Armed Forces and a large number of sports personnel, both local and foreign, participated in the event. Local and foreign sports-personnel crowded around the Gregory Lake to witness this series of competitions, which is currently the only JET SKI Championship series in Sri Lanka.
AMW, long-reputed for their pioneering introduction of the latest and the most sophisticated YAMAHA Marine products to Sri Lanka, has once again set up a bright record by presenting the most advanced YAMAHA Wave Runners and high horsepower OBM models, to discriminating Sri Lankan JET SKI fans. As is well-known, YAMAHA is the leading Marine brand in Sri Lanka.
