Lewis, Manomi win Elephant House F5 Duathlon

Lewis Chalk (01:13.54hours) and Manomi Kumari Bandara (01:33.44hours) won the Elite men's and women's inaugural Spinner Duathlon conducted at the Spinner Sports Centre in Madiwela recently.
Elephant House F5 recently signed on as the main sponsor of the first-ever Sri Lankan Duathalon, a run/cycle/run sporting event held on Valentine's Day. It promoted the need for physical activity for loved ones, with many kids and even families taking part, in addition to top national athletes.
The Duathlon featured over 125 participants of all ages and skill levels, with more than 200 spectators cheering them. This event was organised by WrooM Cycling, and Spinner Cyclist Cafe and Bike Fit Lab.
Elephant House F5 supported Sri Lanka's first-ever Duathlon to encourage an active and healthy lifestyle, with many different communities, and a large number of people, positively influenced to take part in cycling and running.
A Duathlon is a sporting competition that comprises three activities. First running, then cycling and, last, running once again. This event is growing in popularity worldwide since many already know how to cycle and run and can train without specialised equipment or venues. The Elephant House F5-sponsored Duathlon 2016, specifically, featured three major categories: Elite, with 5km of running, 25km of cycling and 5km of running; Amateur, with 2km of running, 10km of cycling and 2km of running; and Kids, with 500m of running, 3km of cycling and 500m of running.
Commenting on this exciting partnership, Ceylon Cold Stores PLC Head of Beverages/John Keells Holdings Vice President Daminda Gamlath said, "As the main sponsor of Duathlon 2016, Elephant House F5 was able to create a solid impact on the event, not only raising awareness about the need to re-hydrate after any sporting activity but also aiding in WrooM's and Spinner's efforts to facilitate an active and healthy lifestyle culture amongst all Sri Lankans."
