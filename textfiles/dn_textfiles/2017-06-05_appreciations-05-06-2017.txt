Stanley Dunuwille
Resilient heart
The 44th death anniversary of the late Rajakarunadara Dharmakeerthi Ekanayake Wasala Panditha Mudalige Stanley Jayampathy Millawa Dunuwille of Katugastota fell on May 29.
The initials SJM symbolizing the name had to be confined only to officialdom, as the casting of the horoscope by the astrologer remained at a dead end due to the situation that “SJM” was born on a Vesak Day and the observation of sky and planetary influence annulled such casting of a horoscope. The adoption of the alternative name SJM was the only parental via media to prevent a calamity of intense magnitude. The irony of this fiasco is a matter for conjecture, but when viewed from the point that SJM was born also in the month of May i.e. May 19, 1927, a rarity quite perceptional from a humane point of view there emanates and arises the brilliance of the intellectual thinking of supremacy of lordship we as Buddhists respect, adore and honour.
SJM's life and times as a schoolboy at St. Anthony's College, Kandy and as an adolescent, was power-packed with anecdotes, as was his public service, till his demise. During his hectic but stormy sojourn in Samara, Dickie achieved greatness in his own inimitable style. He was a daring young man who came to the rescue of the innocent and the under-privileged, often looking after the sick in hospital during nights. Leadership was thrust on him as he was fearless and forthright, having an inborn capability to command in any given situation with his acumen in militarism.
Soon, SJM made his mark as a person to be reckoned with, both, at St. Anthony's College, Kandy, where he was schooled and later on as a Post Master attached to Kandy, the CTO and the up country. He took to sports in a very big way at SACK and as a loyal public servant, deeply participating in public service sporting activities. He forced his entry as an ace swimmer, crossing the mighty Mahaweli river bordering SACK, often coming to the rescue of learners and new comers in tight situations, enjoying water bouts with his school friends in the small silent within the Mahaweli which is no more today. Cadetting was his forte during the war years, attending the Diyatalawa Camp and before long, at 14, was the SACK Sergeant Major with the enduring ability and affinity within the allied forces stationed in the College grounds. Simultaneously, he served his alma mater (SACK), astounding critics and beating seniors at will to bag prizes and trophies offered by the forces.
He entered the playing fields of Katugastota with a bang as an ace all-rounder; SJM was adept at everything and anything he pursued; brought merit both to him and the team he represented.
As a schoolboy, he played 1st XI cricket and Soccer for the College. He was also a champion athlete, a champion boxer of the light heavy weight class and above all, a commanding leader of the then Ceylon Cadet Battalion, who led all school ranks as a Sergeant Major.
His crowing glory was when he commandeered the combined Battalion of all island Schools and College at the first Independence Day Parade at Bogambara on the 4th of February 1948, taking the salute from D.S. Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of Independent Ceylon, which he cherished to his last days. He was such an admirer of the late Dudley Senanayake that against heavy odds, he had the courage and affinity to replace the fallen photograph of Dudley back in position and face the wrath of opportunism and opposition who were putting expediency before principle such as political time serving facing all concerned at the turn of events aftermath of the United Front victory of 1970.
SJM Dunwelle is remembered by Antonians young and old for his magnificent bowling effort 6 for 10, 2 for 27 and 28 runs in two overs against Trinity in the 1948 Trinity-Antonian big match played at Katugastota and won by the Antonians after 18 long years. St. Peters and St. Benedicts lost their encounters with SACK because of SJM's bowling.
This trinity victory is all the more great because SACK overcame hostile opposition from leading Colleges and since then, leading Colleges have faced defeats every now and then.
Antonians have never looked back and can be proud today that many Antonians have played Test Cricket for Sri Lanka with outstanding success.
Credit for this pioneering efforts goes to the then Principal late Father D.A. Roasti, the Prefect of Games Fr. D.C. Mackey, Robert Wright and Kanniath the ace footballer. The 1948 cricket Captain Lionel A. Pamunuwa deserves the highest praise along with the rest of the team for SACK's outstanding success as a leading College.
Trinity, at that time, was studded with stars like Lala Wadsworth, their Captain, who later captained the Combined Colleges Etam Eustace Rulach, batsman of the caliber of Sirimanne Pilapitiya and two outstanding personalities in terms of today's reckoning such as the later Kakashman Kadirgamar and Lakshman Jayakody.
What is morale-boosting is the fact that the later John Hallangoda, the famed Trinitian was the Antonian Coach who planned and destined the Antonian victory.
Unfortunately, there is none to vouch for SJM's outstanding herculean qualities of sacrificial acts.
An offer of alms to the Maha Sangha (Sangika Daval Dana) will be held on September 7 remembering SJM's mother, father, SJM himself and his departed brothers, sisters and relatives, at the residence of the writer at 180/2/G, Molewatte, Amunugoda, imbulgoda.

Dunstan Fernando
Natural leader
It was the 100-year birth anniversary of our father Warnakula Weerasuriyage Captain Lodwin Wilfred Dunstan Fernando of Kumbukgahamulla Group Walauwwa, Nattandiya and of St. Winifred House Walauwwa, Marawila, born in May 16, 1917. He was the only child of Warnakula Weerasuriyage William Rovinu Fernando. His mother, our grandmother, Clotilda Peiris of Moratuwa; such a pretty lady, converted to Catholicism from the Anglican Faith. She was a lady of classics and refined tastes.
Thaththi faced the reality of being a single child when his father passed away in 1928. He was only 11 years. The wealth and estates intact and well administered by Carsons Cumberbatch Co. Ltd, a Scottish company. According to the last will, at the age of 21, his inheritance in wealth and estates was gracefully handed over to him.
St. Anthony`s College, Kandy, became his alma mater; opening bat for the first eleven with M.D. Banda (Minister of Food and Commerce–UNP, MP for Mathurata; DS as Prime Minister). Cricket and sports was in him and encouraged us to see through any game well. With his interest for agriculture and animal husbandry, he was lined up for his career and obtained a Diploma in agriculture from the School of Agriculture in Kundasale, Kandy.
His academia and interest saw him demarcating 10 acres of coconut land for experiments and growth of plants, flowers and vegetables. It was called the uyana. Variety in flora attracted birds and bees; it was a colourful sight. He encouraged and invited the village people and schoolchildren to see what is going on and wanted them to take an interest.
Thaththi initiated the idea of the “Weekly Pola;” earmarked two acres from his lands as a trial project until further. 'A place for the village to meet and people to do business' was his aim. On some “Pola” days, senior management from Carsons, Cargills (Scottish) were in attendance. Some of the Livestock as exhibits with links to the School of Agriculture as subject matter guided many, boosting it's acceptance as priority for the area.
His thoughts for better coconut growing through organic farming, having a grazing area, water and poonach for livestock were good enough and was brought to the notice of people and farmers alike. His own herds; 650 cattle (imported from India/Pakistan Sindh breeds added to local), 350 buffaloes, 5,000 goats, 9,000 sheep, grazing in different parts of the estate created an impact for the subject. The Nalla Waddakkiyas was magnificent. Monks at the Temple were happy to receive two of them and a Thirakkaleas a donation.
When World War ll broke out in 1939, Thaththi too, like few of his friends, joined the Volunteer Defence Force of the Ceylon Light Infantry (CLI)—1940-1947—present day Sri Lanka Light Infantry (SLLI). The role of the Army and the fear of the British Administration for it's colonies, India and Ceylon, intriguing tales by him of Military intent was sometimes breathtaking. Powerful stories which many of us cared to listen, knowing now, facts were so real in the past and today, the future too, has so much to resemble of the happenings of the past.
After he resigned his commission in 1947, Thaththi entered local politics coaxed by S.W.R.D. (Minister of Local Government in DS Government ), while few of his friends in his Regiment CLI moved into National politics. Thaththi was returned un-contested at the local government elections 1949 (UNP), as the first Village Council/Village Committee (VC) Chairman of Udubaddawa VC, near Kuliyapitiya in the Kurunegala district. According to my mother, people tried to carry him, but had to put him down; this giant of a man of 6ft.7 inches.My father used his wealth, authority and influence in creating the required amenities for the village people and area; co-ordinating activities to Military precision; 'the Army matters' he had said a few times. Now and again, he would use the very liked words of his 'Ich Dien,' Germanfor 'I Serve;' the motto of the oldest infantry of the British Army; Light Infantry and the CLI/SLLI. He was proud of his Regiment CLI being the “cradle” of the Ceylon Army. He would keep a track of his friends: “Remember your friends. Talk about them often.”
Much village activities were established at the temple where he would summon the church (St. Anthony's Church in Dunakadeniya) which was donated by his father William where the Parish Priest was his cousin. He made sure to have the mosque at these meetings. Temple lands and buildings, the land for the mosque, were linked to his father's generosity: the temple which taught us the first letters of Sinhala.
The idea of monks going on Pinna-pahthe to fetch Dhanne,was not liked by my father. He persuaded Loku Hamuduruwo to accept Dhanne brought to the temple by villagers. The villagers' access to the temple became a fact. Having his paddy fields manned by Muslims, he made sure to have them provide a small quota of Wattalappan to the temple at the end of Ramadhan. Likewise, the Temple took everything, kiribath, kavum, kokkis etc, to the mosque; what it received from the village for the Sinhala and Tamil new year. Reflecting his discipline and military humour, he had once frowned on his chain-smoking cousin priest at temple discussions: “Father, your lungs are full of sin.”
Agricultural policy of the government was opening up the East, Gal Oya etc. My father wanted to do just the opposite, establishing livestock farms in the Puttalam District on crown lands which were getting squandered. He wanted to settle people on six months to one year contract basis, temporary stay on these lands and having them return to their respective areas in the province on a job rotation basis. The idea was to get them to start their own little farms in their areas on their return with government assistance on gained interest, guidance and knowledge. The government of the day had no objections and was fully supportive. When it came to the poor: “one must look for initiatives and talent and support them,” he told us.
Gentleman, honest to the core, attentive father to his children, natural leader, known for his suits from Saville Row. To impress his new bride, our mother, he was the first person to import a Riley Sports Motor Car to Ceylon in 1936. He would sing 'It's a lovely day tomorrow' and 'Up the wooden Hill to Bedfordshire' by Vera Lynn; such favourites of his and also play them on his Masters Voice gramophone. Fate in life overtook him and the latter end of his life was not a bed of roses, but he fought back well.
Sounding the 'last post,' my own duty: I have to.
May your soul rest in peace!

Guiding star
Three months have gone, since the day my beloved Thathi (father) passed away, leaving our family with a profound sense of sadness and deep shock. Thathi passed away unexpectedly on 6th of March 2017, while he was being treated for his illness at a private hospital, in Colombo. Though he was undergoing treatment for few years, he was capable in managing his work at home and had the grit and determination to move on.
During his illness, I was always at his side, ensuring that due medical care was being provided by the doctors and other medical staff, on time. As a result Thathi, did not experience any complexities during his time of ill health and I was pleased to see him leading a peaceful retirement life. As a son, I always looked after and cared for Thathi during his time of need, simply out of love and affection and never considered it as “my duty” to provide him with the best medical care and attention.
As a learned person, he gained much respect in the financial sector, especially amongst the professionals in the Leasing and Hire Purchase industry for his wealth of knowledge, expertise, experience and commitment displayed to uplift the profession. He held the Chairmanship of the Finance Houses Association and also the post of Secretary of the Leasing Association during his career in the financial sector. With the help of few of his reputed colleagues in the industry, Thathi was instrumental in establishing the Sri Lanka Institute of Credit Management and he was also one of the most sought after “resource persons” (lecturer) to conduct seminars, for persons in the Finance and Leasing industry. As a career-minded individual, his dedication to his employers was recognised and appreciated by his superiors and peers. He was much loved and respected for his integrity, guidance, wisdom and even after his demise, his assistants and colleagues and those who have dealt with him speak of his legacy of honesty and transparency and recall his relationship with pleasant memories.
In spite of his busy career, he always had time for his family. His sudden demise has created an emptiness in me as he was my 'guiding star' from my childhood days. Thathi and I had a special bonding and a close relationship which cannot be explained in words and I feel that, he is still with me in my heart, guiding me on the righteous path of life. When I had questions, Thathi would always answer them. He always had answers for my questions! I should say that, it was like a 'ritual' for me and Thathi to have dinner together and ponder over the things that transpired during the day. He always used to wait for his 'Putha' to come home after work to enjoy his meal and if I do get late due to some commitment, he used to still wait for me to turn up at his bedside and say good-night to him, so that he knows I have come home safely. He used to be so fond of me that whenever I travel out of Colombo, he gets worried and keep calling every half an hour until I reached my destination.
He was very helpful to his relatives and whenever they needed his assistance, Thathi was ever willing to help them and was happy to see them doing well in their personal lives. He gained immense pleasure in assisting all who sought his professional advice and his irreparable loss is still being felt not only by his family, but by his friends, colleagues and assistants.
After the funeral, I realised that not only I had lost a parent, but my hero and teacher as well. My mind starts wondering and at times I am in deep thought as to what happened to my Thathi and why he left me. Just two days prior to his death, one day he called me from his hospital bed and said that he really loves me and he also knows that I love him a lot as well.
His loving words still keep echoing in my ears whenever I wonder as to why I could not save him this time. Like those days, I still have plenty of questions, but now nobody to answer them! Though my relatives and friends have kept on telling me to make up my mind and move on, I have realised that one of the hardest things about losing a parent is feeling that nobody understands the loss.
My dear Thathi, I will never be the same as I was before and I feel as if I am incomplete without you. We shared memories that nobody else shared, which means you knew me differently than anyone else. We were a close-knit family and you and Amma had a happy married life of 52 years together. Now, when it gets dark in the evenings, Amma and I stare at the chair in the living room and wonder as to what happened to you and we terribly miss your words of wisdom.
During the past few years, you have been telling me that according to Lord Buddha's teachings, one day, we need to leave this world in order to escape samsara and attain nirvana! However, the past three months have been hard for me to get over your death as I realised that when someone you love dies, that part of you dies a well.
When you left us, I used to cry because of the void left by your death, but now I have gradually realised, it is easier to smile at the memories. Several years ago, you told me the day you pass away to cremate within twenty four hours ,which was done according to your last wish.
Thathi, if you can see me, I want you to know that you are still guiding me and still answering my questions. I will always miss your blessings which helped me to overcome the difficulties that I faced in my life, but I know that you will always be there watching upon me. The gap that has been created is hard edged and it is something which has been chiseled by you into my life and now that you have left me, your memories are enduring.
Thathi, I am ever so grateful to you for being my father and I hope that I will meet you again in this journey of samsara once again as my Thathi, prior to attaining nirvana which will be my happiest moment.
May you attain Nibbana.
Your ever loving and grieving son,
Thusitha
Chrissie Aloysius
Founder president of Doctor’s Wives Association
When I received a call around 9pm that night conveying the sad news of our past president Chrissie Aloysius’s passing away, I couldn’t believe it. It was totally unexpected.
The Doctor’s Wives Association was formed by Chrissie in December, 1985. She was keen to promote fellowship amongst all the Doctor’s wives and also to bring them together to work towards helping the community in the field of health care.
The very first time I met Chrissie was at a doctor’s wives function. I was standing in the queue to serve dinner, when I noticed a well-dressed smart lady talking to each one in the queue. As she reached me, she introduced herself as the president of this association. I told her that I was aware of its existence and would like to join. Then she invited me to their meeting. I contacted my friend Vasanthy Rajaratnam and she agreed to come with me.
As both of us walked into the room for the meeting, Chrissie welcomed us warmly and introduced us to the council members. Next minute, Chrissie proposed our names to be included into the social activities committee.
Several healthcare programmes and exhibitions were organized over the years. The ‘Jewelerama’ was organized by Mallika Hemachandra in 1986, an evening together by Fashions and Music in 1988 and ‘Barbecue Nite’ in 1991. These were a tremendous success and Rs. 100,000 was donated to the Sri Lanka Medical Association, Rs. 25,000 to Sevena Foster parent home, Rs. 25,000 for the UNIAID project of Colombo University and Rs. 25,000 to the institute of Neurology. The hobbies exhibition which was held in 1992 provided a forum to display the talents of the members. A book project was started in 1995—pencils, pens and books were distributed to over 100 needy schoolchildren which is being continued till now.
Chrissie was very keen on helping the poor and worked enthusiastically and tirelessly by organizing healthcare, eye camps and also dental care. Spectacles, toothpastes and medicines were distributed. We used our tsunami funds to buy all the necessary equipment and distributed to several fisher folk. I am happy that I took part in all these camps.
My association with Chrissie started in 1998. A year later, I had to undergo surgery and was discharged on the third day. I was about to leave the nursing home when Chrissie rushed in a bouquet of flowers. After apologising for her late arrival, she told me that the current secretary of the association was migrating to Australia and that she wanted to propose my name to fill that vacancy. I was so surprised, I immediately told her that my sons were still small and that I had to take them to school and back and help with their home-work and also attend PTA meetings etc., as my husband Vasanth was working in the periphery and was on transfer every four years. Chrissie was expecting my refusal and replied that I had to only write and read the minutes and that she would help with addressing half of the circulars sent every year for the get-together. She just wouldn’t take no for an answer.
Over the years, I got to know Chrissie very well. She was a very caring, understanding and affectionate lady. She was an excellent organiser and planned everything meticulously which made my work easier. Since I am a perfectionist too, we made a good team. Chrissie came to realize that she could rely on me to make sure everything was attended to in order to make each event a success.
Chrissie, like everyone else, had to deal with a few tragedies during her time starting with her youngest daughter Ruwani’s accident at a very young age. Chrissy never left her side. More recently, her granddaughter was very ill and it hit Chrissie very badly. Being a devout Catholic, Chrissie found her strength to carry on through it all.
Our annual members get-together was a grand affair carefully planned with entertainment by the doctors’ families. Chrissie had written the skits for the plays and doctors and some of their wives had given their free time to make these plays a success. Chrissie organized picnics annually for the council members. She arranged the hotel, the games and also provided music for a Baila session inside the rooms given to us.
She looked after her husband Dennis so well by making sure their house was well organized, so that Dennis did not have anything to worry about. They have never been parted, except once when she had to go Australia to help one of their daughters. Reluctantly, Dennis agreed to her trip abroad. The moment she landed in Australia, there were calls from Dennis wanting to know where his clothes were etc. Chrissie took the next flight back to Sri Lanka. Our thoughts and prayers are with her husband Dennis during this very sad period. We convey our deepest sympathies to their children.
Thank you Chrissie for forming our association which you managed to keep alive for 32 years. It is a great achievement, only you could have done it. There will never be another Chrissie Aloysius during our time.
May your soul rest in peace, you richly deserve it. RanjiniThuraisingham,
Jt. Secretary,
Doctor’s Wives Association.
