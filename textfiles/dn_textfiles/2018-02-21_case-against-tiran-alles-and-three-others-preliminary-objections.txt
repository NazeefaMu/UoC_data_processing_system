Case against Tiran Alles and three others: Preliminary objections overruled

 
The Colombo High Court decided to overrule preliminary objections raised by former MP Tiran Alles and three others today in connection with the Rs.200 million fraud that had allegedly taken place at the RADA in 2006.
While overruling preliminary objections raised by defence, High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi fixed the matter for trial to be heard in due course.
The case will be taken up again on March 23.  
The Attorney General filed indictments against the four accused, former Chairman of RADA Tiran Alles, former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of RADA Saliya Wickramasuriya and Dr. Jayantha Dias Samarasinghe in connection with controversial RADA fraud.
