Fostering creativity, adapting to change

On Saturday, the second International Forum for Teachers (IFT) was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. Hosted by Pearson Edexcel, the University of Nottingham, and Gateway Graduate School and supported by the British Council and Microsoft, the theme of the forum was ‘Touching Hearts, Transforming Minds.’ Its chief guest was Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi.
The forum, which gathered over 350 teachers from schools across the island and ran all day, featured an array of speakers qualified to talk about the current state of education in the country and around the world—and also about where the future of education is heading.
Listening to Experts
A large part of the day’s programming was dedicated to interactive talks and presentations. First up was Professor Dr. Ganakumaran Subramaniam, Head of School, School of Education for the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus. His talk was on how to creatively transform the learning experience. He emphasized the difference between teaching creatively, which many educators as of late do, and teaching for creativity, which requires teaching in ways that foster creativity within students themselves.
Professor David Shaw, the President of Unicorn ARC and a visiting professor at the Aberdeen Business School, spoke next, and hearkened back to the forum’s theme on touching hearts and transforming minds. Using real cases to help “uncover the magic” that some teachers bring into their classrooms, Shaw engaged with the teachers in the audience to explore how students’ educational targets and achievements could be expanded.
Then Professor Mark Carroll, an Associate Dean at the University of Adelaide’s Faculty of Arts, zeroed in on the role music plays, or rather should play, in the classroom. As a universal language, part of every civilization and culture in history, he demonstrated how music could be used to enhance students’ learning experiences.
The last speaker presenting was Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala, a mountaineering professional and women’s rights advocate. Her presentation was on “Climbing Your Own Everest”—an apt title considering that Kuru-Utumpala is the first Sri Lankan, and first Sri Lankan woman, to summit Mount Everest, a record she achieved in May of 2016. In her presentation, she took the audience along her journey and focused on the importance of dreaming big and nurturing such dreams. She also focused on the need to challenge gender stereotypes and eliminate gender-based discrimination.
Panel discussion
After the speaker sessions came a highlight of the event—a panel at the end of the day, titled, “Transforming Learning Experiences: Placing Learners First.” The panel was moderated by Professor Dr. Ganakumaran Subramaniam and its members were four diverse education experts: Professor Andrew Walker, President and Pro Vice-Chancellor (Interim) at Monash University Malaysia, who specializes in educational innovation; Associate Professor Dr. Cynthia Yolanda Doss, Director of the Post Graduate Certificate of Higher Education Programme at the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, who specializes in brain-based learning, among other topics; Nirmali Wickramasinghe, an educational consultant with 40 years of relevant experience in government, private, and international schools here and abroad and Felicia Brown, Asia-Pacific Senior Teacher Engagement Manager for Microsoft, who specializes in effective technology usage in the 21st century classroom.
The four panelists put forth their own ideas on how to center students in education before answering questions from the audience. Walker went first, defining innovation and emphasizing three main reasons why educators must innovate.
“Why do we need to do this? First, because we are operating in a dynamic and innovative environment and that’s the environment in which our students will have to find jobs,” Walker said.
He used Sri Lanka as an example, noting that the country is currently going through the transition from being a lower-middle-income economy to an upper-middle-income economy. Those sorts of transitions, he said, involve a fundamental shift in the structure of the workforce.
“As educators, we need to be quite humble in acknowledging that in many respects, especially those of us teaching younger students, we are preparing them for jobs that we can’t even imagine existing now. So that’s one reason we need to innovate: because we’re operating in a very innovative environment.”
The second reason he gave for educators to innovate is that young people, with easy access to technology and the worldwide web it opens up, are now learning in new ways.
“One of the most profound things that’s happening is that we teachers have lost our monopoly on information. They now have it literally at their fingertips,” he said. “So as teachers and educators, we now need to move from being providers of knowledge to being guides, navigators, and curators to help students assemble knowledge in a critical way.”
The third and final reason he gave was that if educators don’t innovate, someone else will do it for them.
“Let’s think of ourselves as educators as the taxi industry, ten years out from the invention of the app, Uber. What will Uber in education be like? The answer is that we don’t know. And that’s why we have to be nimble, adaptive and innovative. Because if we don’t, along will come Uber.”
The next panelist was Doss, a specialist in brain-based learning and teaching.
“What’s it all about?” she asked, “It’s basically knowing about the brain, knowing how it works, how it stores information, how you recall, and then applying those principles into planning and teaching the curriculum.”
Doss explained that due to the advent of the MRI and PET scan 30-40 years ago and their applications to brain-based learning, several principles have been developed that can help educators understand the physiology behind effective learning. Doss first touched on the division between the functions of right and left brain.
“What is important today, as teachers, is that we don’t just develop the left side or the right side. What the PET scan and the MRI showed is that we need to use both sides of our brain simultaneously. Say you only develop the left, which is logic and analysis, and gear the child toward mathematics, or the child is good at music or art so you develop the right—no, not today. You need to develop both sides to fully utilize the potential of either side.”
Doss also expounded on two principles that govern how the brain operates.
“One of them is that the brain searches for meaning. You cannot just give information, you have to make meaning out of that information for the brain to take it from short-term memory and put it into long-term memory,” she said, emphasizing that if students aren’t finding meaning in what they’re learning, they will actually be less likely to learn it successfully.
“The other [principle] is the brain searches for patterns. Categorizing is a very powerful tool in teaching and learning. Why? Because it helps with memory.”
Wickramasinghe, who has been an educator in Sri Lanka for four decades, took a decidedly different approach with her advice than the previous two panelists. Speaking in broader strokes, she touched on the idea that students, rather than teachers, should be the ones leading the way forward.
“Like Professor Walker said, you can’t even imagine what learning is going to be like in another 10 years, because we never imagined ten years ago that learning would be what it is like today,” she said. “So much terminology that used to be new is being used in our classrooms very freely now. So I think leading the learning has to be from our students.”
To conclude her remarks, Wickramasinghe posed two questions and a final appeal to the teachers in the audience.
“How much are we ready to learn from our students? Because I think they have a lot to give us. And are we ready to open up and let our students transform our minds and touch our hearts? Because it should be a two-way process. Please allow your students to touch your hearts and transform your minds so that they can help you lead learning.”
The final panelist to speak was Brown, from Microsoft. She emphasized that education was one of the company’s core values and that is has done much work in many areas with regards to technology in education. One such area, she said, is around teacher preparedness and helping to build the capacity for teachers to use technology in the classroom.
“I don’t think we can think of one single career or job today that is not touched by some form of technology skills. Gone are they days when technology was limited to students who were studying computer science or engineering. Today, students of all levels need to have some form of technology skills.”
“But,” she continued, “I want to make one point very clear. Technology is not the answer, it’s not going to improve teaching, if it’s not used in a thoughtful manner.” Giving an example of an effective and thoughtful use of technology in the classroom, Brown referenced a teacher here in Sri Lanka, who has been using Skype to connect his students with other students around the world.
“And if you track the number of kilometers that the teacher and his students have traveled through Skype, it’s over one million kilometers. Imagine how the world has opened up for those students, and the opportunities they have.”
After all four panelists had spoken, the floor was opened for questions.
Teachers spoke up, pressing the panelists on how to better engage parents in their children’s education, and on whether universities might soon give more weight in the admissions process to certain creative skills, which the panelists and speakers before them said were important but which are often neglected in the face of standardized test scores.
As the day’s programming came to a close, the hundreds of teachers in attendance left the committee room buzzing amongst themselves, all motivated to put into practice the skills and advice they’d gleaned from the day.
