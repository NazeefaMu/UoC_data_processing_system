Hasitha Abeywardena is Microsoft country manager for SL

Microsoft has appointed Hasitha Abeywardena as Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives. Abeywardena, who joined Microsoft Sri Lanka in 2015 as the Director for Enterprise Business, will take over the role from Brian Kealey.
Kealey, in turn, will take up his new role as APAC Pursuit Lead in the Emerging Markets Digital Transformation Organization established within Microsoft Singapore.
Abeywardena will be tasked with leading the software giant's commercial and consumer product profile, service offerings, corporate reputation, company performance, customer and partner experiences in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
Apart from leading Microsoft Sri Lanka's Enterprise division, he has held a number of key roles in senior executive positions, making him a suitable candidate to fortify Microsoft's regional mission in empowering businesses in developing markets.
After graduating from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura with an MBA in Marketing, Abeywardena worked as Marketing and Sales Director at Suntel, and subsequently as Senior General Manager for Large Enterprises at Dialog Axiata.
“I am honoured to take up this new role at a time when Microsoft, and the entire industry is transforming more rapidly than ever before,” said Abeywardena. “The company's mission to empower each and every person is truly inspiring and I hope to lead its efforts by engaging with our extensive partner community and empowering youth to seize innovative technologies in order to change their world. With Microsoft's world-renowned reputation, reach and global footprint, I believe countries like Sri Lanka and the Maldives have an enormous potential to grow technologically, increasing what we as a community can offer the rest of the world.”
