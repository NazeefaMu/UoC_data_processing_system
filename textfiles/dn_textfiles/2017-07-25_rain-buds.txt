Rain on the buds

National Institute for the Improvement of Children's Literature was proposed by the academia and educationists in the country recently to promote the reading habit among children.
The proposal came with the commemoration of Munidasa Cumaratunga's service and to mark his birthday (July 25, 1887).
The main functions of this institute,it was proposed, would be to help writers and work together with them to promote reading habit among children; develop children's literature; identify creative skills and literary forms that enable the child to grasp innovative competencies; serve as a national and international organization and as a centre for cooperative activities among other relevant bodies; hold seminars, workshops, discussions and to carryout awareness programmes; publicize, educate, research and help such activities and financing and leading; serve as a central body in the present library network to disseminate relevant publications' make literacy development activities and programmes through schools, public libraries and other organizations and to launch collaborative programmes with relevant organizations to develop inter-cultural relations, ethnic cohesion and pluralism.
Society needs creative people for cultural, product and service development. Bringing a society to a higher standard of creative ability in literature is a uphill task for a country such as Sri Lanka where the traditional west-oriented educational pattern is predominant. World history has proved that any civilization with creative people is independent.
Literary creativeness can be developed by improving reading consciousness of children from their childhood. Therefore, implementing a children's literature programme is timely. The outcome of the venture is to enhance not only the creative ability of children in literature, but also in science and technology.
Children should have an understanding of their country, such as its socioeconomic, historical and geographic aspects, as well as cultural and national values. When they become responsible citizens, they can decide what society needs and work accordingly. They would understand their responsibilities and their elders.
Better reading patterns
They would learn to respect norms and values in society and for them, racial disparity would be insignificant. In a society with people who value literature, it is easy to improve character and capabilities of children in innovation, loving kindness, brotherhood, tolerance, self-esteem, morality, and educational and worldly attainments.
It is needed to observe the avenues to develop children's literacy activity that lays the foundation for a better reading pattern. Therefore, reading as well as information and communication literacy coupled with moral values would make children fit for the emerging ethical and knowledge societies.
In this respect, the mass media can play a major role. The library service should be used to improve readership and creativity among children. The library system in Sri Lanka has two parallel services; the public and the school.
In this respect, the collection of children's literature should be balanced, multiple and pluralistic to offer a better library service for the juvenile.
The writers must have a sound understanding to produce literary works to fulfill the interests of children and to use a simple language style to explain stories and incidents which inculcate good characteristics and abilities in children.
Many of our writers in juvenile literature use a language which is more suited for adults. Munidasa Cumaratunga. Martin Wickramasinghe and Ven. S. Mahinda Thera used a simple linguistic pattern during the 1920s’ and 1960s'. The contribution made by later writers is appreciable. Our writers have a great opportunity to make use of the literary tradition devised by Munidasa Cumaratunga and the like.
Literary forms such a translations, short stories, folklore, culture and national history are important. Adapted works from science writings and works on other cultures are also useful to make children have a balanced mind. In India, a device called “Talking books” have significantly improved children's reading skills. Patriotism is promoted through the epics of Mahabharata, Ramayana, Jathaka and biographical stories such as Mahatma Gandhi and other writings available from the Indian literary market. Children have been well trained in reading, and guided to improve their reading skills in developed countries.
The United States, Russia, Japan and China are some examples. Reading is done with the help of audio-visual material and other illustrative aids such as handbooks, pictorials illustrative and comical items, paintings, maps, the internet and modern IT technologies.
Sound library framework
The collection of children's literature in Sri Lanka is inadequate. Its organization, management and dissemination have to be carried out scientifically within a better library framework. Moreover, the selecting and developing a juvenile literature collection and an allied tradition is a must.
Producing reference materials and sources related to children's education is an area that needs attention. Popular world cartoons and strip comic weeklies could be used for children, if they are adapted suitably to the Sri Lankan context.
Difficulties faced by a writer or a literary creator in juvenile literature should be promptly taken into consideration. Responsible parties must take steps to lay a healthy foundation in this regard. This type of activity is an urgent need to improve educational perspectives.
Establishing an organization to develop children's literature under the sponsorship of the government is urgent. The Sri Lanka Child Protection Authority's mission is to safeguard and protect child rights. It should be the central unit that cooperates with relevant departments and sections in juvenile literature locally and abroad. The service of the Sri Lanka Book Publishers Association has to be applauded in this regard.
The National Youth Council, National Institute of Education, Sri Lanka National Library and Documentation Services Board, mass media, Ministries of Education, Educational Services, Cultural Affairs, Social Services and the entire library system are basic units which could shoulder this activity. Support from global organizations such as UNESCO, UNICEF, UNDP and non-governmental organizations can be immensely useful to realize the purpose.
