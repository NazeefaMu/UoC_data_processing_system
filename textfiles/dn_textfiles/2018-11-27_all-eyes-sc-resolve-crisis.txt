Legislature at loggerheads with Executive
All eyes on SC to resolve crisis

All eyes are set upon the Supreme Court now to resolve the existing rift between the legislative arm and the executive arm of the government, political analysts, social engagers, intellectuals, critics and top notch politicians yesterday said.
They said neither the legislative arm, that is Parliament nor the executive arm, whose head is the President, are unable to resolve the present crisis, therefore all eyes are on the Supreme Court to resolve the current crisis.
The people of this country will look at the Supreme Courts with high hopes that it will give due consideration to where those two pillars of democracy, the legislature and the executive are emanating from, which is sovereignty of the people, they said.
The 225 representatives in Parliament are at their wits’ end and Parliament is in a blind alley with the conduct of the Speaker in disarray, they pointed out.
An election would be inevitable, said senior politicians and social engagers. The situation, however, would have been different, had the Speaker got his act together and had respected the country’s Parliamentary traditions.
He has turned Sri Lanka’s Parliament into a United National Party rally, said Minister Gamini Lokuge. According to international law Prof. Dinesh K.Gunasekara, Speaker Jayasuriya is conducting an international Parliament for foreign ambassadors.
The Speaker has worsened the situation by having sessions in Parliament following the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court to suspend the dissolution of Parliament by the President. The Courts granted leave to proceed until they hear the case on December 2, 3 and 4, and pass a verdict on December 7.
Judicial officer of the European Court of Law, Prof Gunasekara asked what if the Supreme Courts decided to dismiss the petition and allowed implementation of the dissolution of Parliament on the coming days.
“Who will take the responsibility for all those chaos created in Parliament and tensions created in the country up to now?” he questioned.
Foreign Affairs analyst and critic Mohan Samaranayaka said, the country’s Parliament should be dissolved without delay for the reason that almost all the public representatives in there, have become partly or fully sold out.
“An election must be given to the people to select their representatives as there is hardly any representation of the people in Parliament as of today,” he said.
The country is now in a quagmire, that the judiciary‘s deliberations and its verdict on FR petition on the dissolution of Parliament by the President is of great consequence to the stability of the country.
