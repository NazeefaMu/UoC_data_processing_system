Melbourne Park carnage as top seeds topple

MELBOURNE, Sunday - The whiff of sporting upset hung around Melbourne Park on Sunday after top seeds Andy Murray and Angelique Kerber were handed stunning defeats in the Australian Open fourth round.
Britain's Murray was bamboozled by the serve-volley game of Mischa Zverev to exit after 3-1/2 hours on Rod Laver Arena, while fellow world number one Kerber's title defence was ended in little more than an hour by Coco Vandeweghe.
Murray was the first top seed to depart before the quarter-finals since Lleyton Hewitt in 2003, while Germany's reigning women's champion was last sent packing before the second week a decade ago when Amelie Mauresmo went out in the fourth round.
Murray and Kerber were playing their first grand slams as top seeds and both looked all but powerless to deal with the style of game they were confronted with from across the net.
Zverev, the world number 50, rushed the net 118 times to keep one of the best defensive players in the game on the backfoot for much of the contest before holding his nerve to close out the contest 7-5 5-7 6-2 6-4.
"Credit to him," said Murray. "He came up with great, great shots and played a really, really good match. You know, you always finish matches you lose with things you maybe could have done a bit better, but he played some really good stuff."
The German, ranked outside the top 1,000 in the world after wrist surgery two years ago, will face Roger Federer in his maiden grand slam quarter-final after the Swiss master outlasted Kei Nishikori 6-7(4) 6-4 6-1 4-6 6-3.
New Yorker Vandeweghe later hammered down 30 winners to Kerber's seven, overpowering the U.S. Open champion 6-2 6-3 to set up a meeting with Spanish seventh seed Garbine Muguruza in her first trip to the last eight in Melbourne.
Kerber made 15 unforced errors in a contest lasting little more than an hour and admitted it was simply not her day.
"It was a tough match and, of course, I'm disappointed," she said. "But I was not feeling the ball at all tonight. I was not playing good from the first point. – Agencies
