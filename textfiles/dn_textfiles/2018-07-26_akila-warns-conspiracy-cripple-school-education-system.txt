Akila warns of conspiracy to cripple school education system

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam on Tuesday warned of a conspiracy by certain trade unions which are trying to cripple the school education system by making unfair demands.
Minister Kariyawasam while requesting the trade unions in the education sector not to use school children as a cat’s paw to achieve their narrow political objectives, stressed that an investigation would be initiated against those who are attempting to cripple the school education sector.
The Minister was speaking at a press conference at the Ministry premises yesterday. He condemned the Trade Unions’ attempt to go for a strike on July 26, obstructing the school examinations.
Kariyawasam added that the Ministry has received a number of complaints against educational authorities who have intimidated principals,teachers and students with the backing of certain trade unions.
The Minister added that the trade unions in the education sector have degenerated to such levels that they have resorted to threaten the teachers and principals who are prepared to report for duty on July 26 .
“The Ministry is making arrangements to provide delayed promotions, increments to officials in the education sector who were penalised due to political and other reasons during the previous regime,” Minister Kariyawasam added.
He added that this process is implemented in a transparent manner and no such officers have been granted posts.
“Only those who were proved to have been political victimised during the last regime have been granted grade promotions and the relevant salary increments.
The Education Minister added that trade unions can go before courts, if Ministry has granted grades or promotions to unqualified officials.
