Gongawela bus stand dilapidated

The Gongawela bus stand in Matale is currently dilapidated, while pollution in its vicinity was also on the rise, residents said.
Stray cattle frequent the premises and surrounding drains had also not been maintained so far, commuters said, adding that the bus stand had become a breeding ground for mosquitoes.
The said bus stand had been erected several decades ago and was the only one of its kind in the area, residents said.
However, it had so far been neglected, they added.
They urged the relevant authorities to take immediate measures to address the matter.
