Puttalam Police serve refreshments to weary drivers

Puttalam Traffic OIC S. I. Nasheed and his team, in the early hours of Monday (15) morning, stopped traffic to serve tired drivers on the Puttalam - Anuradhapura road with herbal drinks and biscuits, in order to aid them on their journey.
S. I. Nasheed said the programme was of their own initiative, and his team had collected funds among themselves to conduct the programme. He added that in recent weeks, the rate of road traffic accidents on the road had increased, and their programme conducted twice a week, had helped tired drivers recover from their long drives.
