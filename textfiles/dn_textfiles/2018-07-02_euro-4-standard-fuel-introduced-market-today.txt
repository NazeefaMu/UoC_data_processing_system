Euro 4 standard fuel introduced to the market today

 
The new Euro 4 standard fuel was introduced to the market in lieu of the Euro 2 standard Super Diesel and 95 Octane Petrol, today.  
The new standard fuel was introduced at a ceremony held in the presence of Petroleum Resource Development Minister Arjuna Ranathunga, in Colombo.
The Petroleum Resource Development Ministry said that the new standard fuel will be sold to the prevailing prices.
The Euro 4 fuel is a more environmentally friendly and cleaner fuel source.
Vehicles with engines that meet the Euro 4 standard emit 68 percent less particulate matter (PM), 57 percent less nitrogen oxide and 50 percent less carbon monoxide than the Euro 2 standard that is currently in use in Sri Lanka since 2003.
