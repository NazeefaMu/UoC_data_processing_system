SriLankan flights delayed due to several reasons

A variety of reasons had caused delays to several SriLankan Airlines flights yesterday, May 3.
The untimely sickness of a passenger inbound from the Gulf initiated a diversion to Cochin on one flight.
Another aircraft inbound from Kuwait was caught in a dust-storm and required attention from Engineering. Two other aircraft were delayed for technical reasons that have since been resolved. The lack of aircraft meant that a number of flights, namely UL884 Colombo-Melbourne, UL281 Colombo-Jeddah, UL314 Colombo-Kuala Lumpur, UL406 Colombo-Bangkok and UL 604 Melbourne-Colombo suffered prolonged delays.
“SriLankan Airlines deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to our valued customers.All passengers who had checked in were provided complimentary hotel accommodation and or meals at the airport by the airline,”the company said in a press release.
