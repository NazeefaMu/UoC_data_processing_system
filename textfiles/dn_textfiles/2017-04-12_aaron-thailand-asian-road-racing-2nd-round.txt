Aaron off to Thailand for Asian Road racing 2nd round

Aaron Gunawardena will compete in the second Round of the 2017 Asian Road racing championship scheduled in Buriram International Circuit on April 14 and 15.
The Suzuki Asian Challenge (SAC), established in 2015, is now entering its third season as one of the category in FIM Asia Road Racing Championship. The SAC is produced by Yukio Kagayama, who is geared to train young Asian riders to one day become a world-class rider. SAC, in its third year, boasts 16 riders from 9 countries – namely Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, India and Japan.
“Aaron Gunawardena” the only Sri Lankan who was selected to represent Sri Lanka at the Asian rounds has secured Sri Lanka with 24 points in the opening round finishing 4 th and 5 th in the curtain raiser in Malaysia.
Sri Lanka currently is ahead of Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, India and Nepal on the points table and shares the same points as Japan at the moment. Young Aaron says Buriram is a very fast circuit and the competition is going to be quite tough this time, but hopes to give it his best shot. I’m happy that the lubricant specialist from Ulm, Germany “Liqui Moly” has shown interest in partnering me and my brother in our international racing career and we hope there would be other non competing brands that would come forward to help us in our expensive sport.
