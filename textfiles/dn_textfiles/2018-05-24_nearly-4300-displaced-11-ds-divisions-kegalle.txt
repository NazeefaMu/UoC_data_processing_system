Nearly 4,300 displaced in 11 DS divisions in Kegalle

Nearly 4,300 people belonging to 1,100 families displaced in 11 divisional secretariat divisions in Kegalle due to floods, landslides and other natural calamities have been accommodated in 12 relief camps, Kegalle District Disaster Management Centre Director Anushka Chamila said yesterday.
The largest number of 351 affected families out of them are from the Dehiowita DS division while three deaths were reported from Bulathkohupitiya, Rambukkana and Ruwanwella DS divisions.
He said Kegalle GA Chandrasiri Bandara has directed all divisional secretaries to ensure the supply of cooked meals to the affected families.
Meanwhile, state institutions have come forward to assist in rebuilding damaged houses, business places and roads and restore normalcy in the affected areas. Divisional Secretaries have also directed Grama Niladharis to evict people from landslide and other danger-prone areas to safer locations.
Aranayake District Secretary has set up three relief camps at Elagapitiya Kanishta Vidyalaya, Wiyan Eliya Viharaya and at Deiyanwala to accommodate people moved out from the foot of the Samasara Kanda area in Elagapitiya, Pallebage and Debathgama and provide food and other requirements.
The security wall of the Dippitiya Rajagiri Primary School has collapsed in the heavy rain while the Kegalle Debathgama and Ambalakanda-Aranayake roads have been obstructed by the debris of minor landslides interrupting transport. Steps were underway to clear the roads for vehicular traffic yesterday.
Several houses, shops, agricultural lands and roads have been inundated by the flood waters of Ma Oya and Kuda Oya and the flood waters were receding yesterday afternoon. Community life was also returning to normal yesterday in spite of intermittent rain experienced in the region.
