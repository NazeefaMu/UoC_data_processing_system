Changes to Constitution could not be decided on a whim: Hakeem
Changes to the Constitution could not be decided on the whims and fancies of individual political leaders, SLMC Leader Rauff Hakeem said.
Participating in the Adjournment debate moved by the JVP on abolishing the Executive Presidency, the SLMC Leader pointed out that the three leaders, President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa are looking at their own political future.
“The Constitution is not a property of any of them. It is a sacred document upon which this entire country’s governance is conducted on. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa wishes to abolish the Executive Presidency because he is unable to contest once again for that position, which is an issue to him. PM Ranil Wickremesinghe is a leader who does not believe in emotional sentimental propaganda or irrational campaigns to mislead the masses. He feels that he is a political leader who appeals to the intelligentsia of the country. Therefore, he himself did not contest the last two Presidential Elections and let others contest. He has an interest in restoring Parliamentary democracy so that he could get himself re-elected to Parliament and control executive powers through Parliament. President Sirisena, having promised the country to abolish the Executive Presidency, now wants to try and contest for a second term. This was despite his promise that he would not seek re-election,” Hakeem remarked. The SLMC Leader, advocating for comprehensive reforms to the Constitution, said that they have come to some understanding with the TNA to put forth the draft new Constitution to Parliament by February, to attempt to see whether it could be endorsed with a two thirds majority in the House.
Commenting on President Sirisena’s actions during the last 50 days, Hakeem said those could be best explained with the Sinhala idiom “Natapu netumakuth ne, bere paluwakuth ne.” He also pointed out that the ill-advice of some MPs had pushed former President Rajapaksa into a serious political debacle.
“The man who was riding the high wave of popularity, has compromised his popularity unnecessarily, trying to grab power through the backdoor to satisfy a few of his fellow MPs who had misled him. That is his fate. I hope he will see some saner counsel soon,” he added.
Sumanthiran on abolition of Executive Presidency
Speaking on the Adjournment Motion to abolish the Executive Presidency, TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran said that the abolition of the Executive Presidency should be brought in as an integral part of the new Constitution.
“This issue of the abolition of the Executive Presidency has been there for quite sometime. It has not just been there but it does had the endorsement of our people at every Presidential election and so the mandate of the people to abolish the Executive Presidency has been with us for quite sometime,” Sumanthiran said.
“In fact when the Presidential election was held in 2015, we thought the Executive Presidency as a system of government will be abolished very soon. But, unfortunately through the 19th Amendment we were able to do only part of what we wanted to do. If one remembers the day the 19th amendment was passed, repeatedly this House was assured that through a new Constitution whatever that could not be accomplished with the 19th Amendment would be addressed. The abolition of the Executive Presidency is one important fact,” he pointed out.
“This has dragged on for some time. We have in the Interim Report concerning the new Constitution pointed out that the Executive Presidency be abolished. In arriving at the Interim Report, in the Committee discussions all parties agreed for the abolition,” Sumanthiran said.
“However, subsequently some of the political parties made certain reservations with regards to the abolition of the Executive Presidency. The very recent incidents that have come to take place, these parties have also reconsider their decisions. We should now without any further delay abolish the Executive Presidency,” he continued. The new Constitution must also be drafted as promised to the people and as an integral part of that should be the abolition of the Executive Presidency,” Sumanthiran pointed out.
“While the process to enact a new Constitution was delayed, we saw some other incidents over taking us.
The acts of the President himself are an important part of that. We are here today after almost two months of the Constitutional crisis that was triggered by the Executive President who purported to exercise powers which he did not have. Perhaps labouring under misconceptions or wrong advice,he purported to remove the sitting PM and appointed a new one which was clearly against the 19th Amendment to the Constitution,” Sumanthiran said.
UNP calls on MPs to support abolishing of Executive Presidency
The UNP yesterday, called upon all Members of Parliament to extend their support to abolish the Executive Presidency.
UNP MP Malik Samarawickrama taking the floor in Parliament during the Adjournment debate in support of abolishing the Executive Presidency, pointed out that the events of the last 51 days in the country showed that “the concentration of power in one office is a recipe for disaster.”
The debate on the Adjournment motion moved by the JVP would also be continued today.
“Abolishing the Executive Presidency was a cornerstone of the Yahapalana Government’s plan, guided by the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera and it is now time to re-commit to that goal. After having witnessed the ill-effects of the system of Executive Presidency, we are unable turn a build eye to it. We have to act now,” he urged.
“We need to double up and commit to abolish the Executive Presidency. We commenced on this path through the 19th Amendment and during the last 51 days one could see how vital this Amendment was. Now it is time to complete the job. We should not let go of this renewed opportunity, this renewed rationale. I call upon all members of the House to vote for this motion and campaign when a referendum is brought in,” he added.
MP Samarawickrama also pointed out that the Executive Presidency did not lead to a stronger State, a more stable Government or strengthen the Unitary Status of the country, as often claimed by those who argue in favour of the Executive Presidency.
“The Executive President must go. An argument that had been put forward for a while, is that a strong State required a strong Executive President. But look at the last 51 days.
What kept this State strong was only the strong Legislature, Speaker and a strong and independent judiciary.
In fact, actions of the President weakened our State economically and in the International Community.
We need to bust some myths today. We must bring in primacy to this Parliament, the elected representatives of the people from all corners, ethni cities and religions of our country,” he noted.
