Jewellery and money hidden in house ceiling stolen

Gold jewellery worth Rs. 200,000 and Rs. 78,000 in cash hidden in a ceiling of a house at Gonagala in Nagoda, Galle had been robbed by two persons who arrived in a motorcycle.
The householder, an elderly mother was at her son’s place about 100 metres away from her house at the times of the robbery, Nagoda Police said.
The jewellery and cash were kept in the ceiling for safety from floods that lashed the area recently. The aged mother who kept her valuables and money in the ceiling had gone to see her son who was residing close to her house on the day of the incident. However, on her way back, she had noticed two unidentified persons, who stopped their motorcycle in front of her house, fleeing as she came. She had noticed that the back door of her house was open and later found the jewellery and money in the ceiling had gone missing, according to her statement to the police. Police investigations revealed that the thieves had entered the house from the roof and after collecting the assets, they had exited from the back door.
Nagoda Police are investigating.
