Plans to scuttle JO rally: Wimal

 
 National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa said news has been received from reliable sources that there are plans to scuttle the May Day Rally of the Joint Opposition by an organised group.
Addressing a media briefing at the N.M.Perera Auditorium yesterday, he said the government’s planned obstruction of the Joint Opposition rally demonstrates its fear for the Joint Opposition rally and their first step was to cancel the reservation of the Shalika Grounds in Narahenpita.
Weerawansa said numerous efforts are being made by the government to collect crowds for their rally while spending a huge sum.
“Last year Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri was sent to the Joint Opposition May Day Rally along with a group of men wearing blue T shirts who themselves assaulted him. Therefore, we request Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri not to come to our May Day Rally to create a political drama,” he said.
Federation of University Teachers’ Association (FUTA) spokesman Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri, was assaulted near the Lalith Athulathmudali Grounds in Kirulapone, the venue of the Joint Opposition May Day rally last year.
Weerawansa also said the government had violated democracy by appointing Heads of Government Departments according to their own whims and fancies.
These heads of departments nod like lamp posts to any decision taken by the government, he said.
“Even though the Constitutional Council (CC) is called to have made independent and fair decisions we did not experience it either in the appointment of the Attorney General or the IGP. Although the historical tradition is to offer the post to the most senior officer among all, the CC did not follow that procedure on the last two occasions,” he said.
“The new IGP Pujith Jayasundara himself stated that the Head of the Police FCID Division has been appointed by the President and the Prime Minister after considering many factors correctly. However, the CC or the IGP has the power to appoint the Head of Police FCID. This statement itself proves that the government is in the process of making the FCID as an instrument for a political witch hunt,” he said.
