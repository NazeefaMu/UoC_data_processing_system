Relief for drought-affected families

Rs. 485 million in drought relief has already been granted to 167,000 families in the Puttalam district, said Power and Renewable Energy and Disaster Management Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
The minister also instructed officials to prepare a Cabinet paper for provision of compensation to those drought-affected families who have not yet received compensation.
Minister Siyambalapitiya issued these instructions during a meeting held at the Puttalam district secretariat on the issues of the drought-affected people in the Puttalam district.
The minister also stated that water would be provided to 25,000 families who have been severely affected by the drought in the district.
When the issue of coal dust from the Norochcholai coal power plant was taken up, Minister Siyambalapitiya said that all the measures have been taken to construct a wind barrier to prevent the minimal coal ash that is being released to the environment at the moment.
However, earlier the CEB stated that the rumors and several reports on the pollution from the Norochcholai coal power plant was an exaggeration.
CEB officials said the stories fabricated in media are untruths as anyone could see that maximum efforts have been taken and monitoring is carried out to ensure there is no damage to people’s health as well as to the environment.
