Nail  necessities

With colour splashes and nail art crazes booming, hands are on display big time. A combination of features like a well-balanced diet, a thoughtful beauty regimen, and good personal hygiene can result in salon-worthy nails. Pamper your nails with a stylish makeover and you will never shy away from flaunting them.
 
Tight and ragged cuticles
 
Moisturize with an over-the counter cuticle oil or make your own just as easily. A combination of unpasteurized honey, aloe vera juice and olive oil keeps the cuticles moist and prevents painful cracks. Mix a small amount of each in a bowl or cup, then massage the mixture into the skin around your fingernails for about five minutes. Repeat two or three times per week. Alternatively, soak your fingers in a mixture of equal parts of olive oil and warm water. You can also massage a drop of olive oil or a dab of petroleum jelly into each cuticle after bathing,
Making your nails grow faster
 
Biotin helps in the growth of nails, hair, and skin. Biotin can be consumed either through foods or in the form of supplements. Biotin can be found in foods like bananas, avocado, and salmon.
Getting a manicure
 
If you prefer absolutely perfect polish and medium to long nails, you will need a professional manicure once a week. If you favour shorter nails for a more active lifestyle, and you can do polish touch-ups at home, you may need a professional manicure only every two weeks.

Nail polish separation
 
Putting nail polish in the refrigerator can actually cause it to thicken and separate faster. There are a few methods you can use when storing your nail polish that will keep it from becoming thick and separating. When nail polish has separated, it will have a layer of oil on the top.
 
To prevent nail polish from separating: 
* Store your nail polish in a cool, dry place. A medicine cabinet or makeup box is an excellent location. Placing your nail polish on a surface where heat or sunlight can reach it will cause separation.
* Store your bottles of nail polish upright. This may seem obvious, but if a nail polish bottle falls over, set it back up right away. It will keep the ingredients properly layered and prevent separation.
* Invest in quality nail polish. Cheap nail polish is more likely to separate and is harder to fix. More expensive nail polish will be a better investment in the long run, and it stores well.
 
To fix nail polish which has already separated: 
Step 1: Open the nail polish and check if it has separated. If the nail polish is stringy, it can't be salvaged and needs to be thrown away.
Step 2: Add two to three drops of nail polish thinner to the nail polish, and place the lid back on.
Step 3: Roll the bottle of nail polish between your hands to pick the thinner. When you open the bottle, the polish should have mixed back together. If not, add another drop or two of thinner and repeat this step.

Tips to make a manicure last
 
 
 
 
At the end of the day, polish isn't meant to last forever and that's probably for the best. However, you can save a good chunk of change and time by knowing how to maximize the life of your manicure with these tips:
 
* The alcohol in hand sanitizers eats away the topcoat and causes your colour to fade and become dull. Exfoliators in body and facial scrubs are also a no-no, as they remove both the top layer of your skin and your polish.
* Wash your hands with a mild antibacterial soap to avoid colds and germs and to preserve your mani. Reach for alcohol-free lotion. If it has a fragrance that means that it contains alcohol.
* Wearing rubber gloves while you do the dishes or clean the bathroom will definitely help your polish stick around longer.
* Reapply a layer of clear topcoat every two to three days to prevent chipping and enhance the shine.
* Apply nail oil daily to prevent your nails from drying out and splitting.
* Close up the nail edge, where it’s been clipped or filed down, with polish and topcoat. This keeps water out and provides a barrier against everyday bangs and dings that would cause a manicure to chip.
