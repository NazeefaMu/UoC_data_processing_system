CSE net foreign inflow Rs. 26.7 b this year:Dr Harsha de Silva
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has recorded a net foreign inflow of Rs 26.7 billion so far this year, recording the second highest amount in its history, Policy Planning and Economic Development Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said. He was responding to a question raised by Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said the surge in foreign investments in the CSE, shows that the Government has been able to boost investor confidence. He made this observation refuting JO allegations that the investors had lost confidence in the CSE following the Treasury bond controversy.
“In 2015, a total of Rs 5.3 billion in foreign investments had been withdrawn from the share market, but in 2016, it received Rs 383.5 million foreign investments. By August 11 this year, the CSE has received a total of Rs 26.7 billion foreign investments. This is a significant achievement,” he said. He said the record for the highest ever net foreign inflows was in 2012 and that amount was Rs. 38.6 billion.
The Deputy Minister said a new Securities Exchange Act to regulate and modernize capital market would be brought into force within another month, adding that it would help revive the share market of Sri Lanka.
He said demutualization of CSE, setting up of Central Counter Party, improving Liquidity, introducing Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) system, raising awareness of the public on share market transactions and revising the out-dated laws are other measures proposed to revive the share market. He also stated that the Government did not intend to introduce the Capital Gains Tax proposed from the Budget 2016 to the share market in the future.
“It was during the previous regime the ‘pump and dump’ policy was followed and those black monies were exempted from taxes. Our policy is to give concessions to small and medium scale entrepreneurs, while imposing taxes on areas where necessary,” he added.

Heavy fines for reckless driving or walking across rail crossings:Transport Minister
A fine of Rs 25,000 would be imposed shortly on those who carelessly drive or walk across railway crossings, Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Minister De Silva said that new laws were being formulated to increase fines in this regard.
The minister made this observation in Parliament yesterday, responding to a question raised by UPFA MP Douglas Devananda under Standing Order 23 (2).
“Even at level crossings protected by the ‘bell and light’ system and gates, some people carelessly drive or walk across risking their own safety. People walk across and try to creep through their motor bikes despite the gates being closed. That was the reason why we thought of imposing heavy fine as a penalty,” the minister stated.
The minister observing that there were 876 unprotected level crossings, said the installation of the ‘bell and light’ system would be completed by another two years. “Installation of the bell and light system to 200 level crossings is in progress and tenders would be called shortly for another 200,” he said.

Govt. should help drought hit farmers to overcome difficulties:JVP Leader
Farmers almost in nineteen districts have been affected by the drought, while their economy had so dropped that the government should intervene to solve their issues, said Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He said that farmers from some districts had not been able to cultivate paddy for three consecutive seasons. He also added that in some areas irrigation work had not been done properly. He alleged that the government had not been able to solve their problems.
JVP MP Dissanayake made these observations moving an adjournment motion on the drought situation that had affected agriculture and the economy of farmers.
He also said that although the President had promised to grant Rs. 10,000 for those affected farmers in March, it had not been fulfilled. "The farmers in Trincomalee and Kantale had only been provided with Rs. 8,600 at one occasion," MP Dissanayake said. "But it was only in April and had not continued."
He said that the situation was catastrophic. He also said that those farmers had fallen from the frying pan in to the fire, as farmers who go to hospitals are compelled to do their tests and purchase their medicine from private pharmacies.
Health Minister: "Where are the hospitals without medicine? Tell me where?" queried Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
MP Dissanayake answered that it was in Moneragala, to which the Health Minister responded that he would conduct an investigation against the director of that hospital.
"The Government boasts that there were plenty of medicines in hospitals," Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
"They also say all laboratory services are been provided in hospitals free of charge.
If the government health services is so good, then how come there are laboratories surrounding the hospitals to check urine and blood? If the government hospitals have ample stocks of medicine free of charge, how come there are pharmacies around hospitals? In the past, we had funeral parlours or casket palaces near hospitals, because the hospitals did not provide the coffins for patients who die.
Today there are private laboratories and pharmacies opposite hospitals because hospitals do not give those services and medicines."
MP Dissanayake queried if the hospitals could offer better services, then as to why the Health Minister took ten million rupees from the President’s Fund to travel to Singapore seeking treatment at the Mount Elizabeth hospital?Anura Dissanayake also said that while he was fisheries minister, he rented the Mutwal Fisheries Harbour.
The estimate was at Rs 1.7 million per month. But he gave it away for Rs 125,000 for 300 months.
