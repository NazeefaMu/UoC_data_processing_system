[CITIZENS' Mail - (20-03-2017)]

Right supervision of student discipline
The student conduct should first be examined by looking at the relevant environment. This is an essential requirement to understand the student behaviour. The analysis must be supported by an assessment of the environmental influence.
The influence can vary, depending on the societal expectations of universities as well as colleges.
For that we must shift into the in loco parentis perspective.
The term in loco parentis, which in Latin means ‘in the place of a parent’ refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organisation to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent.
It allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the students as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students’ civil liberties.
We should focus more on entrusting leadership with students, which has been lacking so far.
Such a paradigm shift may reinforce proper discipline, a fundamental requirement of any educational institute.
Over to you Education Minister and other authoritative personnel who can take decisions on the country’s education.
