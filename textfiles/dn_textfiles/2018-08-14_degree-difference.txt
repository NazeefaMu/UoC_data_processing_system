Degree of difference

The British School in Colombo paid tribute to 59 outstanding individuals at their 24th Annual Year-13 Graduation ceremony which was held at the School Auditorium recently.
The awards were presented in different categories including academic, sporting, competitive and Inter-House achievements for the Graduation Class of 2018.
This year’s event was even more significant as the British School had the honour of welcoming Alumnus Thilan Wickramasinghe, CEO and Co-Founder of Create Lab Singapore as the Chief Guest for the occasion.
Thilan, a member of the Class of 1997, shared truly inspirational thoughts with the graduating class that perfectly captured the mood and moment of the Graduation Ceremony. Pictures by Ranjith Asanka
