Petform introduces eco-friendly green packaging

Petform (Pvt) Limited, a leading package solutions provider, has embarked on a new programme to introduce environmental friendly “green packaging solutions” to the country.
Petform Chairman and Managing Director P. Mathytharan speaking about the new initiative said his company strives to do their part in preserving the environment through sustainable packaging products that are not only cost-effective but consistently eco-friendly.
Petform last week unveiled several environmentally friendly packaging products including paper cups and bags made with recycled waste in the presence of its customers at its head office in Biyagama.
Speaking at the event Mathytharan said paper products made using waste paper (recycled paper, paperboard, cardboard products) do not harm environment. "We expect to produce a range of environment-friendly packaging material for local and foreign markets,” he said. He said paper based packaging made of recycled material and has an excellent environmental record.
He added that paper based products will be making a valuable contribution to the environment and the wider society by reducing pollution and landfills.
He noted that his company was planning to export eco-friendly packaging products to several countries.
