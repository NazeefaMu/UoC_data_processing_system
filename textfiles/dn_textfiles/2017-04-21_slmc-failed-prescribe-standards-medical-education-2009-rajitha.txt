SLMC failed to prescribe standards of medical education since 2009: Rajitha

Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has failed to prescribe standards of medical education since 2009.
He said Dr Neville Fernando too had requested the Sri Lanka Medical Council to set standards for the same. The Minister explained that he had asked the Medical Council to look at the guidelines given by the World Federation of Medical Education. Referring to the Medical Faculty of the Kotelawala Defence University, he said the GMOA was opposed to the move at that stage but when the former Defence Secretary summoned them and queried as to why they were opposing it, the GMOA was submissive and agreed to the former Defence Secretary’s proposal without any objections.
