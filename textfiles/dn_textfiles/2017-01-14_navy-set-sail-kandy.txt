With the weather ideal for rugby a good game is in store for the Kandy rugby fans. In the first round game played at Welisara, Navy SC pulled off a surprise win. In this game both sides, however, have the ability to give the ball plenty of air so don't be surprised if this is an entertaining affair with the teams attacking from all fronts with Kandy out for revenge. The home team skipper Roshan Weeraratne is happy with the team's make-up and expects them to do well. Kandy is a good blend of experienced ruggerites. A lot of them have played good rugby and have really stepped up and that's why this club is doing well. Roshan says he is excited about the new team and the blend and mixture. The game will be a battle of the forwards and play should be an explosive one as both teams have some excellent players and also they are solid in defence. Both play an exuberant brand of rugby, and as a result, fans should expect plenty of points today. The sailors will go all out to upset the host team, but at home Kandy will be difficult to sink. Kandy have shown enough good form to go out as firm favorites. Most clubs say they would like to beat Kandy more than any other team, so the home side has that pressure and weight of history. Every team lifts themselves when they play them. So, in this game the winners will be the team that makes the fewest mistakes and takes its chances.
