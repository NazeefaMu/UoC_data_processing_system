Human Rights and Reconciliation: a reflection on 2016

A reflection on human rights emphasizes that people must be protected when facing sudden and profound reversals in economic and social life. The four basic standards drawn are: Respecting all human rights and fundamental freedom, Nurturing of unity in cultural, religious and ethnic diversity, Realizing social justice by enshrining the rights of vulnerable and marginalized groups and Ensuring democratic participation and the rule of law.
In early March, 2016 I alerted an advisor to the Prime Minister the need to revisit and draw up a new national Human Rights action Plan given the expiry of the existing plan. I was involved in parts in the drafting of the previous plan. The Foreign Ministry is anchoring the new plan.
A new position
The country has been on the dock before UN Human rights bodies for decades. With sharper exchanges and pronouncements since 2010. A new plan must reposition our framework to an era outside of war which protects all, delivers on Constitutional promises, prevents recurrence of past abuses, has specific references to constituencies such as senior citizens and is bold in adopting the best of practices of the best in the world. The Government's job is not to defend its human rights record but to defend human rights
Low hanging human rights fruits
The non-emotive essentials include de housing inmates in correctional facilities, ensuring children are not separated from families in homes unless critically important, hearing those tortured, compensating for their suffering, addressing their trauma, banishing the Vagrance Ordinance, protecting the homeless poor, implementing without delay the revised strengthened legislation to protect animals, creating a policy for persons with special needs where in 361 towns under six categories 2million live. The Samurdhi Bank has billions to take as loans. The poor need to be supported to access them and repay. 250,000 Housing loans at 7% with 20 year tenure for 1Mn loans with land free for low income groups cannot be any better. Our Official Languages Commission Act is 25 years old. A time to seal forever the issues by enacting the Language charter. I have studied every paragraph in the budget proposals of 2015 and 2016. They provide ample scope and opportunities for balanced inclusive development. What's unknown is the extent of use of funds allocated to derive maximum benefits.
Reconciliation
Wars are crimes. No war is just if you have to kill, maim, displace and terrorize. Our history since 1971 has narratives of our failure to prevent dissent from becoming violent. We need to remind ourselves recorded narratives of several Presidential Commissions awaiting implementation of recommended steps including prosecution due to disappearances. Human rights cannot be selective in its memory.
Former Presidents,Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa and Minister Mangala Samaraweera have at different times championed human rights and reconciliation. Our current four pillar approach provides ample coverage but suffers from insufficient messaging. In 1995, President Kumaratunga declared," effective constitutional framework for devolution of power to regions based on an internally consistent and coherent value system, just resolution of centre-region disputes; encourage regions and communities to become constructive partners of a stable and pluralistic democracy; ensure that all persons may fully and effectively exercise all their human rights and fundamental freedoms without any discrimination before the law; accord equality of status to these languages, and to recognise English as a link language; protect the identity of distinct communities and create conditions for the promotion of that identity, and to transact business with the state in the national language of their choice.". Utterances which remain relevant to date. Tragically Prabakaran and the Government could not embrace these concepts and bring a halt to the war in 1995 with horrendous consequences later including for Prabkakaran and family.
Notwithstanding a history littered with outrageous excesses against rights of so many our political firmaments still struggles to give us a new deal. If with President Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Leader of the Opposition Sambanthan, backed by smaller parties and efforts of former President Kumaratunga do not bring forth a Constitutional arrangement for the future when will we see another opportunity as we have now? All these leaders have stayed consistent to-date in the crafting process the past year. We have to ensure that our diverse societies truly welcome and respect people of all faiths and backgrounds, and our leaders continue set the tone on this issue.
Reconciliation is not a matter confined to reports and depositions. It also means people grieving, expressing themselves in song and in verse. Understanding violent extremism requires delving deeper into causes if we are to prevent regress or recurrence.
When my boss was blown up I wondered about the compulsions of the assassin who died. President Obama said, "when people -- especially young people -- feel entirely trapped in impoverished communities, where there is no order and no path for advancement, where there are no educational opportunities, where there are no ways to support families, and no escape from injustice and the humiliations of corruption -- that feeds instability and disorder, and makes those communities ripe for extremist recruitment.
When people are oppressed, and human rights are denied -- particularly along sectarian lines or ethnic lines -- when dissent is silenced, it feeds violent extremism. When peaceful, democratic change is impossible, it feeds into the terrorist propaganda that violence is the only answer available."
As Desmond Tutu in The Book of Forgiving: The Fourfold Path for Healing Ourselves and Our World says, "The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen."
We sadly lost a giant in Professor Weeramantry who could have guided us. We need such people to lead us in all the elements constituting our domestic process of reconciliation.
