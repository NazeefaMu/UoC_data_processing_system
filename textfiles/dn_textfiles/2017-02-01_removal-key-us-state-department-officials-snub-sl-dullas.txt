The Joint Opposition yesterday identified the removal of Key US State Department officials such as Samantha Power, Nisha Biswal, Tom Malinowski and Susan Rice who were closely associated with Sri Lanka as a snub on the Sri Lankan government.
JO member parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma told the media in Colombo that the recent action taken by the new US administration under President Donald J Trump shows they had no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Alahapperuma said that the above four officials closely associated with Sri Lankan affairs under the previous US administration and often influenced some key decisions made by the government.Speaking on other matters Alahapperuma noted that the recent rally in Nugegoda held by the JO was an overwhelming success.
