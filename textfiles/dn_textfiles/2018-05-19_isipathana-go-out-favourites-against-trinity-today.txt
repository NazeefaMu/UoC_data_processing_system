Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league rugby 2nd round:
Isipathana go out favourites against Trinity today

Isipathana College will go out as clear favourites against Trinity College, Kandy when they scrum down in their second round Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league rugby encounter at Havelock Park at 4pm today.
The two teams look almost even but Isipathna has a firm edge due to having a better winning record thus far.
Trinity has managed to win only two games from six matches while Isipathana has five wins under their belt from the same number of matches.
Isipathana are also playing in front of their home crowd in Colombo which is also an added advantage.
Trinity will make every effort to upset the odds and beat the Isipathana lads in their own den. But for that to happen it would mainly depend on how the Trinity three quarters will make use of the good ball.
Trinity has always enjoyed the luxury of speedy and penetrative set of three quarters and there will be no exception this time too. If the Trinity forwards could secure good ball and feed their three quarter line more often, then Isipathana will face a tough task.
Nevertheless the green machine has its own strength to give the Lions a testing time as they could boast of a mobile eight who will use their heavy forwards to score through the famous rolling maul – a tactic used successfully by their forward coach Henry Terence.
The team that takes control of the game within the first 30 minutes should hold the key to winning this encounter.
Royal holds clear edge over Wesley
High riding Royal College Colombo will go out with a clear edge against unpredictable Wesley College in their Singer ‘A’ Division inter school league rugby tournament second round match to be played at Longden Place at 4 pm today.
The Royal lads under the leadership of winger Sabith Feroz have an immaculate record in this year’s ongoing league rugby tournament where they are yet to lose a game being unbeaten.
Royal’s cause has been bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards who have carried out a sensational display this season together with their whole ‘eight’ dominating the set pieces and having abundance of ball position through line outs, rucks and mauls spearheaded by crack flanker cum vice-captain Maleesha Madumevan and prop forward Sasitha Siyath.
They have also been helped by their speedy three quarter line scoring tries through their famous three quarter moves. They also have a reliable place kicker in full back Dulan Gunawardena and his contribution in this match will be highly vital for a Royal victory.
On the other hand Wesley College possesses a good team with play maker Murshid Doray along with their entire three quarter line capable of playing an outstanding game to bring victory to their school. But their performances have been blow hot and blow cold and they are feeling the string of losses suffered at the hands of St. Peter’s, Isipathana and St. Joseph’s.
This will be a do or die battle for the Campbell Park school for if they lose this battle to Royal it could be worse for them as they will slip further down in the standings.
Joes look for runaway win over hapless Zahira
The confrontation between St.Joseph’s College Colombo and Zahira College Maradana in the Singer 'A' Division inter-Schools league rugby second round match at Zahira grounds today, should turn out to be a one-sided affair. The match will kick off at 4.00 pm.
St.Joseph’s who beat Wesley last week under the coaching of former national rugby coach Nilfer Ibrahim will go out as firm favourites. The forte of the Joes has been their speedy three quarter line who are certain to give a torrid time to the Zahirian outfit.
Zahira will have to be at their very best if they are to at least make a match of it against this formidable Joes side. Going by the two team's starting line ups and the performance so far in the ongoing league tournament, Joes will completely go for a thrashing of Muammar Deen’s Zahira outfit today.
