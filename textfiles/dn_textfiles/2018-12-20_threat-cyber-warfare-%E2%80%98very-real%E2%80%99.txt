Threat of cyber warfare ‘very real’

Today life without the internet is something unimaginable and there is no way we can keep up with development without the use of the internet. Global computer networks provide us various communication and information exchange facilities. With the increase in internet usage for numerous data transfers and even transactions such as payments using credit cards, it is unavoidable that cyber and computer crime is also on the rise today.
Moreover, hackers have also devised means of illegally assessing other websites and private and confidential data sources in order to collect confidential information from any country. These are the reasons behind the importance of internet security today around the globe.
While internet technology is an integral part of our lives today, it is also important for every citizen or country to use the internet safely and securely without leaking private information. With this concept in mind, the Sri Lanka Army Signal Corps recently organised a Cyber Security Symposium under the theme, ‘Cyberspace, Perpetual Battlefront for the Future’.
Generally, the internet is not harmful until we choose to react to suspicious content and websites. The first reason the internet becomes harmful is when you don’t know what you’re doing. The second reason is when others force or entice you to react or click on links such as attractive ads, infected software, and messages.
Cyber criminals can range from professionals and big companies to even teenagers and young children. They use fake IP addresses, email accounts, and social media profiles to track people.
Three eminent speakers took the stage at this symposium to render their views on cyber security and how Sri Lanka should be geared to face the future, safeguarding personal, institutional and military information of the country.
Chairing the first session, Major General N.M. Hettiarachchi said cyber security is the day’s need and every person in the world is connected through his or her laptop, palmtop, iPad and mobile phone. Therefore, it is the need of the day to ensure our connectivity is secure. “If we don’t protect our information, there will certainly be a problem. All our services including education, transport, and health are vulnerable. We cannot avoid the incoming applications which are developed by other nations. Therefore, we must understand that all our day-to-day activities on the internet need to be protected by all means.”
Readiness for cyber defence
Speaking at the first session, Dr. Sanjiva Weerawarana, an eminent IT specialist and long-time open source developer and IT advisor to the Sri Lanka Army, outlined what cyber threat means and how internet users can take precautions to avoid falling victim.
The internet is part of everything now and it is something that we cannot live without as every part of life is connected to the internet. The dependency on the network is ever constant and even with something as basic as the mobile phone, the technology provided is constantly aware of the user’s exact location. “Beyond that, even the operator of the technology knows where the user is. They can also know the number of people gathered at any event and through phones know who is there, so they can figure out what that event is all about.”
“Being connected to the internet means a lot of private information is public. When certain parties can get information on a certain group that is present at a particular place, that information can sometimes be abused. Therefore, when you can capture that sort of data, a lot of analytics can be derived from that and that information can be abused for various purposes. So the connectivity of the internet, while it brings incredible benefits for humanity and is something that we cannot ever back away from, is also a threat in terms of how vulnerable you are, because the reality is that you are now part of an entire global eco system.”
Dr. Weerawarana also touched on ‘digital transformation’ which is used quite a lot these days, adding that it is similar to the industrial revolution that happened a few hundred years ago.
“Digital transformation is the application of digital technology to every part of life. What that digital transformation does in increase dependency on technology. But digital transformation is also incredibly beneficial because it makes things which were difficult, very easy, improves productivity, and lessens the time it takes to do something. The terminology is relatively new, but with the extremely low cost of computing hardware, bandwidth, and so on, within the next 10–15 years, everything will be digital, and once that happens, the dependency on digital technology will be even greater.”
In fact, the country’s travel industry, banking, retail and other services are increasingly becoming dependent on the internet. Dr. Weerawarana noted that without internet accessibility, all these service sectors would come to a halt. However, he acknowledged that Sri Lanka is still way behind in comparison to developed countries, but noted that the country is fast getting there.
Cyber warfare is something very different from the usual kind of warfare we are used to. “In normal warfare there are well-defined participants, but in the cyber world, none of those things exist. First of all, there is no difference between a state actor and a non-state actor. A government, a military, an organisation or an individual can be a player in the cyber warfare world.
Anybody can participate. An attack can also happen anywhere, at any time. In other types of warfare, you need to prepare and plan before you take a step forward, but this infrastructure is always in space and the ability to decide is just a matter of one’s need. Size also does not matter, just one person can bring down an entire country’s infrastructure, if they know what they are doing and they have the right kind of tools available,” he warned.
Military and civilian collaboration
Adding to the forum, Roshan Chandraguptha, a Cisco-certified security professional, ethical hacker, and computer hacking forensics investigator and the current principal information security engineer at CERT, said ICT is an important area for any sector. “In protecting a nation, the military needs to have a reliable and accurate set of information from all over cyber space to know and predict the next move.”
He said in order to assess our vulnerability, it is important to first identify the numerous cyber threats we face. “Cyber criminals are those who commit cybercrimes for personal gain. Cyber espionage is also another area of concern which illegally accesses confidential or classified information. Be it the military or any other organisation, they should know how to ensure their data classification; they should know which information to protect thoroughly and which information can be public.
The other type of threat is cyber terrorism carried out by an ideologically motivated group of people around the world who would target individuals, systems, or critical infrastructure. To counter this kind of attack, one needs to understand their motives and their capabilities. Then there is cyber warfare where the next war the military would have to face would certainly be this type of warfare and not conventional warfare.”
At an age when we are so dependent on cyber space, to counter the threats we need to invest in advanced technology. However, Chandraguptha said this technological advancement has to be done while maintaining a degree of human intervention. A computer can only provide programmed answers. Therefore, human intervention is vital to ensure protection.
He said practically, it will be difficult to have the technical means to monitor the entire cyber world simply because of its scale. Therefore, he said if we have a proper framework where civilians can collaborate and provide much-needed visibility into the activities of the cyber world, then greater advantage could be derived.
Meanwhile, Senior Lecturer at the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Moratuwa University, Dr. Chandana Gamage said the clear boundaries that once existed between the physical world and cyber space has now blurred or completely disappeared.
“The cyber security problem has deepened due to the existence of attackers who span a wide spectrum from individual hacktivists, organised criminals, terrorists and state actors. In an era where every one of these antagonists has easy access to sophisticated cyber technology and resources, the notion of defenders having to cover all points of attacks while the attackers only have to find the weakest point in the security coverage, has become acutely relevant.”
Talking about Trojans, he said while they appear to be quite useful and harmless, they are a primary source of the loss of security. The problem is compounded by the fact that while people know about all these dangers, they would still do the unthinkable. “When you get emails with links that you are asked not to click on, curiosity makes a person click on it to see what happens, and this makes the user vulnerable,” he said.
Dr. Gamage said when it comes to data, there is no way to figure out if someone has lost data as it is a virtual resource. “Even if someone takes a full copy of your data, your copy still remains intact. That is a huge problem as once that data is stolen, identities can be stolen, money can be transferred, and so on, but you would not know that unless you have systems in place to detect and inform about data breaches,” he said, adding that however, more than 80 percent of users do not have such capabilities.
He said more than 50 percent of these attacks are by Trojans. More than 400 attacks per day are being reported and unlike in the physical state, we do not hear of kidnap attempts for ransom, but in cyber space it is a daily occurrence.
Dr. Gamage said the 25th largest economy is the cybercriminal economy. “Therefore, it is not meaningful for us to keep following through a failed approach of expecting the users to do the right thing and be careful.”
“We have to build tools that perform a ‘white hat’ security approach on the systems. That means continuously looking for ‘holes’ in the systems and then fixing them. To automate finding weaknesses in our systems is one of our tasks,” he said.
