EZY Wolves, Sri Lanka Super 7’s Leg 2 heroes

EZY Wolves unleashed a ferocious brand of rugby to outplay the defending champs Mobitel Eagles 26-12 to win the Cup Championship in Leg 2 of the Sri Lanka Super 7’s series.
The EZY Wolves who had an ordinary outing in the 1st Leg in Kandy, unveiled an entertaining brand of rugby right from the first whistle of their secodnleg first pool game against the Walkers Vipers, to defeat them by 31 points to 12.
Thereafter EZY went onto dominate the days play by winning comprehensively against the Cargills Gladiators to fight the Mobitel Eagles 21 Points to 24, thereby taking the lead on the Group A.

More known for their prowess in motor racing, EZY Wolves who are owned by the founding CEO of EZY Racing, Shafraz Hamzadeen, displayed some of the inspiration through their speedsters Dinusha Chathuranga, Sudam Sooriyaarachchi and Kenyan National star Nelson Oyoo, who scored a bulk of the tries to provide EZY Wolves a clear advantage over the other teams.
The Wolves who were previously beaten on two occasions by the Mobitel Eagles, once by 2 points and another time by 3 points were the clear underdogs in the final. However, Sudarshana Muthuthantri lead the team of EZY Wolves as they played with vengeance and clearly demonstrated their passion and grit through superiority in defense, attack and decision making to come out victorious.
Speaking after the game, Muthuthantri stated that they made a master move in starting Kenyan captain Andrew Amonde off the bench and moving speedster Dinusha Chathuranga into the forwards that provided them speed at each end.
This clearly played off when playmaker Chanaka Chandimal changed the direction to provide a long pass to Chathuranga who ran over 60 meters to score under the post in a crucial moment in the first half.
“We had a leadership team comprising of a few locals and foreigners. We came up with the game plan for the final where we decided to put two Kenyans in the back line to add strength to our defence. We also moved Chanaka (Chandimal) to Center from his usual fly half position to allow better ball movement. This paid off.”
Muthuthantri who demonstrated passion and exemplary leadership skills was later awarded the player of the tournament.
The tournament, which takes into count, the points accumulated in both Legs to award the overall winner, found EZY Wolves finishing Runner-up to Mobitel Eagles in the overall standings.
