LocoMole Sri Lanka digital App launched

The Government’s target of making the Sri Lankan tourism industry as the top foreign exchange earner will come into live with the launching of the new LocoMole Sri Lanka Digital App, Tourism Minister John Amaratunga said.
Minister Amaratunga was addressing the launch of Sri Lanka’s first-ever mobile technology LocoMole Sri Lanka App . The App will enhance foreign travelers visiting Sri Lanka to locate their travel destinations and other relevant information during their stay in the country .
The LocoMole Sri Lanka digital App was launched by LDR Technologies with the partnership of Mobitel. LDR Technology is a mobile technology company specializing in location –based services and technology –enabled learning solutions.
Minister Amaratunga highlighted that the country’s tourism industry could be further expanded with the launching of many such new innovations in future.
He said with the help of this new LocoMole digital App, foreign travelers could easily find out local travel destinations and it will also help local tourists as well as all stakeholders who are engaged in the industry. He said although many such Apps are used in Sri Lanka today they have only one dimensional experience to the user.
“ But, the LocoMole Sri Lanka digital App has unique features as it covers almost all territories in Sri Lanka, especially many places of interest such as Sigiriya, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Dambulla. “
Minister Amaratunga said the Government is focusing attention towards passing more benefits even to develop the tourism sector in rural areas to uplift the rural economy.He said unlike in the past foreign tourists mostly love to visit the country’s rural and remote areas where very famous tourist interested sites are located.
“As a result of this even Colombo hoteliers are complaining that almost all foreign travelers seek to visit tourist locations miles and miles away from the city,”.
The Minister also said the newly launched digital App will not only provide travelers all relevant information about the places where they visit in the country but also they will get to know about details of local service providers such as hotel accommodations , tour guides, retailers, craftsmen etc.
