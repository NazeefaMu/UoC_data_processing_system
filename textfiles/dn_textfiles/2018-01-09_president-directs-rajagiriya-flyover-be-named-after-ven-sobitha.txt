President Maithripala Sirisena after opening the Rajagiriya Flyover yesterday told the relevant authorities to name the flyover after the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, who was in the forefront in efforts to usher in a democratic government on January 8, 2015.
The ceremony to open the Rajagiriya Flyover, constructed with the aim of providing long term solutions to the heavy traffic congestion in the area and Colombo city was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last morning.
The President said that the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera was in the forefront of the peaceful people’s revolution which ushered the unity government on January 8.
President Sirisena said the Ven. Thera had been able to unite various political groups, trade unions, rights groups, artistes, professionals and academia to usher the January 8 revolution.
The President said, it was highly appropriate to name the flyover after Ven. Sobhitha Thera as an appreciation of the services rendered by the late Thera to the nation.
He also asked Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to take necessary measures in this regard.
The President further said that January 8 is an important day in the country’s political history. Late Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike who led the social revolution of 1956 was born on January 8.
“During past three years we were able to overcome the country’s biggest challenges in making the country move forward. We were able to maintain healthy relations with all the countries,” Pesident Sirisena said.“Another massive peaceful revolution that took place on January 8, 2015 was born out of the need to rid the country of rulers who undermined democracy, freedom, social rights, human rights, fundamental rights and media freedom. On that day people of this country elected me as the President habouring various expectations,” the President said.
“As a result of winning international recognition, we were able to solve the long drawn out issues confronting the country. The present government was formed at a time of a hostile international reception towards Sri Lanka, threats, intimidation and the country being given the cold shoulder internally.
But today, the majority of countries have pledged to extend their assistance for the development of the country.
The flyover which has been constructed with financial assistance of the Government of Spain will be a long term solution for the heavy traffic congestion in the area that also caused environment pollution and economic losses.
