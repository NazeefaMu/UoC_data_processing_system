All Parliamentarians should join hands to diffuse tension : Chief Prelates

Parliamentarians affiliated to all political hues leaving their political and other parochial differences aside and joining hands to take the forefront in diffusing tension and forging national unity is a good omen for the country's future development and progress, the Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter, Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter and Mahanayake Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Mahanikaya said.
The Prelates expressed these sentiments when an all party delegation of Parliamentarians belonging to different ethnic and religious groups led by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya called on their respective temples and received their blessings before undertaking a tour of Kandy to diffuse tension and workout a programme to restore lasting peace in the area after the recent turmoil. The team led by the Speaker met Islamic clerics and Civil society representatives to discuss a lasting programme of work to prevent a repetition of such ugly incidents in future. They also inspected the religious places, houses and establishments damaged during the recent incidents as part of their tour. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya earlier told the Prelates that their endeavour was to work out a programme to prevent a repetition of the recent ugly incidents. They had come to a united stand to work together to resolve a national problems and they hoped to march forward by safeguarding this unity among themselves during problems of national significance.
