Ranjan stands firm in SC

Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday reiterated that he stands by what he had said regarding the judiciary and lawyers of Sri Lanka recently.
Addressing media outside the Supreme Court premises, Ramanayake said he is not afraid to tell the truth that ordinary people and corrupt politicians are treated differently by the judiciary.
“A poor who commits a minor offence such as stealing a street light bulb had been jailed for several months, under the Public Property Act. Corrupt politicians who stole millions of rupees in public funds can get anticipatory bail to avoid being arrested, after retaining a President’s Counsel,” Ramanayake said.Two petitioners had made complaints to the Supreme Court seeking a contempt of court action against Ramanayake for allegedly making disparaging remarks on the reputation of the judiciary and lawyers, at a press conference held on August 21.
