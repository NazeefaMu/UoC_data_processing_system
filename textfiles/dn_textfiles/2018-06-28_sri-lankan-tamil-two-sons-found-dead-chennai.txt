Sri Lankan Tamil, two sons found dead in Chennai

A 38-year-old Sri Lankan Tamil man and his two sons, aged six and four, were found dead in their house at Maduravoyal, Chennai, on Tuesday (26).
Police suspect that the man, identified as Habib Rahman, had killed his sons by forcing them to drink poison and proceeded to commit suicide by doing the same. However, police did not find any suicide note in the house.
Rahman’s estranged wife is living in Sri Lanka. Neighbours last saw Rahman and his children on Sunday (24) and the house had been locked from inside since.
As there was no response when they knocked on the door on Tuesday morning, neighbours had alerted Maduravoyal Police.
Police broke open the door and found the bodies of the trio. The cadavers were sent to the Kilpauk Medical College Hospital for a postmortem. (The Times of India)
