Both leaders, during the bilateral discussions held last morning at the Indonesian Presidential Palace, entrusted their Foreign Ministries with the task of preparing a plan to proceed with the FTA talks.
“The FTA is a win-win deal for both parties. Indonesia its keen on consolidating its position in the Indian oceanic region of which Sri Lanka is a key strategic partner.
