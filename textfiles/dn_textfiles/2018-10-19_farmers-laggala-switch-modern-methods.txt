Farmers in Laggala switch to modern methods

Chena farmers in Laggala have switched from traditional methods to modern ones to reduce the impact on forests and wildlife.
Farmers in villages such as Narangamuwa, Atanwela, Ranamure and Ilukkumbura are among them.
Furthermore, boosts in tourism had also changed the lifestyles of farmers in those areas.
