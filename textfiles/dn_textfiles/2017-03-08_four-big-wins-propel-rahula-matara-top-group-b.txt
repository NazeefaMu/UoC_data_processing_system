Four big wins propel Rahula Matara to top group B

Four three innings outright wins against S de S Jayasinghe MMV Dehiwela, Tissa MV Kalutara, St Peters College Negombo and St Xaviers College Marawila and first innings wins against St Thomas College Matale and Royal College Panadura propelled Rahula College Matara to the top of group 'B' of the 2016/2017 All Island Schools under 19 division II cricket tournament conducted by the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA). The only match they lost was their opening game of the tournament with St Annes College Kurunegala.
With this great performance Rahula College have qualified for the quarterfinals of the division II tournament and if their good form persists and lady luck looks kindly on them, they are just two games away from securing a place in the elite division one tournament next season.
The Rahula first XI led by Pasan Samarathunga is made up with Piruna Thilak Kumara (vice captain), Uraj Chalaka, Nuwan Madhusanka, Hasindu Chanaka, Pasindu sasanka, Sasith Manuranga, Bhagya Himath, Uditha Induwara, Ovin Nuwanjith, Lakindu Chamodya, Tharindu Rajapaksa, Heshan Dilhara, Binara Sanketh, Janidu Mihiran, Sajitha Madumal, Vinushka Chathuranga and Chamodya Dilshan.
The Rahula team is coached by Indika Jayasekera with the assistance of Ranil Rasanjana.
