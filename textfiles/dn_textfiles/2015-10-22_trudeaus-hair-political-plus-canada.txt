Trudeau's hair: a political plus in Canada

CANADA: It was his hair that seemed to do their heads in. Ever since Justin Trudeau, the 44-year-old who has just led Canada's centre-left Liberal Party to an overwhelming victory, appeared as leader, conservatives sniped at his hair.
One Tory attack ad aired during the northern summer showed everyday people inspecting Trudeau's resume and finding it wanting. "Nice hair though," one of them says at the end.
It is true, Trudeau has a wonderful head of hair, but the conservative leader Stephen Harper - something of a northern Tony Abbott - was getting at something more when he brought up the hair.
Harper hoped he could make Trudeau's hair emblematic of his opponent's youth, inexperience and even his dynastic privilege. "He's just not ready," was another slogan the Conservatives deployed. Trudeau brushed it all aside, saying in one effective social media response that Harper was focused on him, while he was focused on the Canadian people.
Trudeau was born in 1971, when his father Pierre Trudeau was still in office, a charismatic, pluralistic Liberal Party prime minister who dominated the Liberal Party and Canadian politics well into the 1980s.
By 2006 the Liberal Party of Canada was lost in the wilderness when Justin Trudeau, by then a teacher with a degree in literature, was invited to chair a task force on attracting young voters. Two years later he won a seat in parliament
Like his father Trudeau quickly proved to be a charismatic force in Canadian politics, so much so that within two and a half years he was offered - and rejected - his party's leadership.
It did not take long though before he was lobbying for the job, which he secured easily in 2013.
By then Stephen Harper had been in office for over six years, and given the three-way nature of Canadian politics, cracks in the Conservative Party's hold on power were beginning to show.
Harper responded by moving toward the populist right. His party rejected climate change and demanded ever more belligerently that the Obama administration approve the controversial Keystone pipeline through the US for the export of Canadian tar sands oil via the Gulf of Mexico.
Harper also turned to the culture wars in an effort to maintain support, passing Patriot Act style laws to protect the homeland, cracking down on immigration, blocking abortion funding in developing countries, joining the fight against ISIS and in the end focusing the party's attention on an effort to ban the niqab during citizenship ceremonies, a fringe issue that seemed designed to appeal more to his own party's hardliners rather than the average Canadian voter.
All the while Trudeau stayed his course. Appearing with Julia Gillard and the former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright on a think tank panel in Washington, DC, in 2013, he outlined his vision.
He said that it was easy for the fringe elements of on both sides of politics to attract votes by declaring what they were against. Progressives, he said, had the more difficult task of selling complex solutions to complicated problems.
To this end he supported some of new anti-terrorism laws, and even sought to support both the construction of Keystone and serious action on climate change.
