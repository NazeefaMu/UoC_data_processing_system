Ministry Secretaries to be summoned - Patali

Steps would be taken to summon several leading public servants before the Finance Committee and the Public Accounts Committee shortly, Parliamentarian Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Speaking a press conference held at Temple Trees yesterday, he said the public servants to be questioned are S. Amarasekara who functioned as Secretary to Mahinda Rajapaksa, S.R. Attygalle who functioned as Secretary to the Finance Ministry, Vasantha Perera who functioned as Secretary to the Commerce, Trade and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry, Upali Marasinghe who functioned as Secretary, Housing and Social Welfare Ministry and Kodikara who functioned as Secretary to the International Trade and Investment Ministry.
He said a motion would be tabled in this connection in Parliament signed by him together with Parliamentarians Lakshman Kiriella, Ravi Karunanayake, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and Arjuna Ranatunga.
Ranawaka said they properly tabled a no-confidence motion in Parliament against the pseudo government on November 14. Thereafter on November 15, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the no-confidence motion had been duly passed.
Various views were expressed on this issue. Some argued that the no-confidence motion was not properly submitted and approved in Parliament and it was not mentioned in the Hansard, he said.
But the Speaker said the Hansard reported that the no-confidence motion was passed properly according to Standing Orders.
Thereafter, this issue went to court and the Court of Appeal accepted the Hansard report as an official document and issued an interim injunction on the purported Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, Ranawaka said .
On November 29 and 30, they passed a resolution to cut off the office expenses of all Ministers according to powers vested in Parliament under Section 148 of the Constitution.
If the aforesaid Ministers had acted in violation of the resolution passed on November 30, they would take action against them. They hoped to inculcate some discipline by such action, Ranawaka said.
