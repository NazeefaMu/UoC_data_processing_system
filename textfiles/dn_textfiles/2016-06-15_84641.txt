Royal Turf Club commences work on new Sand Track

Swifter, higher, stronger – three words that are the very epitome of the Olympic Games, and the Royal Turf Club in Nuwara Eliya is set to make the same commitment, albeit to athletes of a different form, namely the Thoroughbred Race Horse, often described as the ‘Ultimate Machine’ .
The picturesque Race Course in the town of Nuwara Eliya, now the headquarters of the Royal Turf Club , will see yet another huge step in the right direction with work starting on the construction of a new Sand Track. This will be laid out on the inside of the current Turf Track and it will be available as an exercise cum training track for horses stabled there. It will be a huge benefit in improving the fitness levels for horses and preparing them to race. The Sand Track will be designed and laid down as per international standards in keeping with the aims of the Royal Turf Club, which ensure that the equine athletes stationed will be getting swifter, higher and stronger.
“A Sand Track is one of the basic essentials for training a racehorse. Getting a horse ready and fit to race involves exercising them. A Sand Track depending on the depth of the sand is more taxing on a horse and yet is easier on his legs. It helps get him fit quicker. Moreover with the number of horses increasing in Nuwara Eliya means that they will now have an additional surface to train on. This will help preserve and save the Turf Track which should ostensibly only be used to race on ”, said CEO of the RTC, Wayne Wood. Wood said they hope to complete the Sand Track in three months - mid September as the rains were causing a delay. The laying of the Sand Track is being handled by Mr Raman from India, a reputed Track consultant, who was responsible for laying the Hyderabad Monsoon Track and Working Track. He was also in charge of the Bangalore Race Track for 25 years and the Mysore Race Track for the last five years. The cost incurred for the Sand Track is approximately Rs 30 million for the track, while the railing will incur a further Rs 13 million.
Racing will commence again 6th August this year with the Royal Turf Club even more committed to ensuring ‘ racing at the highest level’.
