The carcass of the much talked about Galgamuwa tusker has been found in the Kahalla - Pallekelle sanctuary yesterday.
The Galgamuwa tusker’s carcass was found at Horowwewa area in the Kahalla - Pallekelle Sanctuary by a Special Task Force team deployed for the purpose. The search for the Galgamuwa Tusker continued for several days by a team consisting 90 officers of the Wildlife Department and 50 police officers.
Wildlife Department’s Wayamba Region Assistant Director A.H. Sumanasena told the Daily News that the carcass was found from the Kahalla - Pallekelle Sanctuary. It was identified as that of the Galgamuwa Dala Poottuwa. The identification has been done by examining an old injury sustained by the tusker earlier.
