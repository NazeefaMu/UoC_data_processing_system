COLOURFUL THINGS at Barefoot at Barefoot

4 pm - not the best time of the day to see customers jostling around to grab the best deal. Too tired sales staff after hours of work, too many walking on pavements here and there, Traffic and that’s the time office ends for most of the workers. It’s a time to hang out with friends. For some it’s the time to do a bit of shopping. Get the groceries and other items they may need for home. But for Jane and the others, rise in sales and customers was beaming. The weekend has been a good one. I bet.
A holiday in Colombo won’t generally be complete unless it accompanies some vibrant textiles from Barefoot. Colombo’s holiday makers flock in to the Barefoot Gallery on Galle Road. And while this store remains popular, there are two other stores to make shopping easier for people -one in Galle and the other at the Dutch Hospital shopping complex.
The Dutch Hospital Barefoot is small compared to the Galle Road store. But still you would find enough of textile in brilliant eye popping colour, surfacing all linen, toys, notebooks, bags, pencil cases and cushion covers. They have a few new things in the line now such as Tea and Spices. Their products are cultural, artistic, vibrant and of quality.
Barbara Sansoni, Founder of Barefoot was creative and had an intense love for colour. She drew and painted since her early childhood. Later in early 60’s at the suggestion of a family friend, Good Counsel of the sisters of the order of Good Shepherd she started learning to weave. Weaving is not an easy thing. It should be done with a lot of care. Only those who weave will know the art of running needles through fabric. Sansoni was patient, committed and watchful. She is clearly made of hard –wearing hands.
And this is how Barefoot has become brave leaders in cotton handloom. Her creativity is functional and you can have them in your home as towels, napkins, table mats, cushions, bedspreads or anything. Their clothing includes handloom finished, well draped garments constructed from simple geometric sections of cloth. Every bit of fabric is used. Pencil cases and other collectibles are made of leftovers. And everything is handmade. The natural yarns they use are dyed and woven by hand. Everything that you find in Barefoot is made here by them and not in a factory. They are made in rural industry and cottage industry where workers take work home teaching skills for the needle woman.
Their design is all about persistence and tumouring. They know how a hand is important as much as a heart is. In Barefoot everything is about how hands can come in handy. It’s about people, their hands and innovation. This is why things are a bit expensive here. But one thing is for sure. They’d last a lifetime. Because their methods are remarkable and natural fabrics age well. And speaking of all this their handloom clothes go fast and 80 percent of their customers are foreigners and they love their linen clothes mostly. Everything pretty much starts from 500 rupees – so anyone can just walk in and grab something. Another thing, the Barefoot book collection is different from other bookstores. You will find coffee table books on art, architecture, photography, wildlife and biodiversity in Sri Lanka. Even sensational and vivid novels done by Sri Lankan English writers and self-help books like travel maps and travel guides.
Next time if you happen to go to Pettah or if you are somewhere near the heart of Colombo, drop by the Dutch Hospital Barefoot. They are open all 7 days from 10am to 8pm. And if you would do so, prepare to be shocked by their perfect use of colour and geometry.
