Coast Guard assists to douse fire onboard two whale watching boats

Sri Lanka Coast Guards in a joint operation with the Fire Brigade of the Matara Municipal Council controlled the spread of a fire that broke out onboard two whale watching boats ‘Speed Liner’ and ‘Deep Blue’ owned by Ceylon Speed Liner Pvt. Ltd at the Fisheries Harbour in Mirissa during the weekend .
Sri Lanka Coast Guard boat ‘CG 12’ and emergency platoon of the Sri Lanka Coast Guard Rohana, swiftly rushed to the location where the fire initially erupted and engaged in a fire extinguishing mission by using all available means. Subsequently, Fire the Matara Municipal Council Brigade also rendered its assistance deploying their firefighters and equipment to control the fire completely without allowing the flames to be disseminated to other boats stationed at the location.
During the joint operation, Coast Guard boat ‘CG 12’ helped in evacuating adjacent boats away from the fire. This move helped to protect a large fleet of whale watching boats and fishing boats which drifted at the Fisheries Harbour, Mirissa.
