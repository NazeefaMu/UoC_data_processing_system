HPV vaccination for all Sri Lankan women by 2018: Health Minister

The government does not do calculations by rupees and cents when it comes to health and education. Therefore, the Health Ministry is ready to provide free vaccination against HPV for all Sri Lankan women by next year, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after launching the vaccination against HPV for Grade six schoolgirls during a ceremony held at the BMICH in Colombo yesterday.
The minister said the money would be allocated through the Finance Ministry when the health officials formulated the programme. He requested health officials to formulate the plan to implement the programme and hand it over to him by the end of this year.
Minister Senaratne said that between 850 and 1,000 cervical cancer patients are detected in Sri Lanka annually and it can be prevented through the vaccination..
The coverage of the Sri Lanka’s National Immunity Programme is 100 percent. Even the late Prebhakaran gave a two-day ceasefire to carry out immunization programme in the North and East during the war. The refugees arrived from the LTTE held areas had the immunization cards of their children with them even they did not have their birth certificates.
Sri Lanka commenced a proper immunization programme in 1978, he said. Minister Senaratne said it will take some more time to use the French dengue vaccine in Sri Lanka because some issues there to be sorted out in the age groups. Now the Philippines are in the programme.
The French Ambassador held discussions with me about the delay, he said.
