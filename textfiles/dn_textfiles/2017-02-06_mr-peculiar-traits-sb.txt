MR with peculiar traits: SB

Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said he knew former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as a person with peculiar traits.
He said for instance, the former President did not prove by deed some of the words uttered on the spur of the moment.
“His statement about the Joint Opposition contesting the forthcoming local government election as a separate party may also be a statement made on the spur of the moment which may not materialise as some of his previous statements,” the minister said. Dissanayake said a majority of SLFP Members of Parliament in the Joint Opposition group were in secret talks with President Maithripala Sirisena on their possibility of joining the main SLFP group.
He said the Joint Opposition group would taste imminent defeat if it contested the local elections as a separate party.
Minister Dissanayake commenting on the future prospects of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, he said he could win if he contested the local elections but he had not clout to win a countrywide election like a presidential election.
