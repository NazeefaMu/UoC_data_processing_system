Massive grant dispersed among SP LG bodies

A record grant of Rs. 300 million was paid to the newly formed 49 Municipal Councils, Urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas of Southern Province at a function held at the auditorium of Dhakshina Paya in Labuduwa, Galle on Tuesday. It was reportedly the largest amount ever paid to LG bodies on a single occasion as unsettled dues by the Southern provincial Council in its 30 long history.
The grant was a long due arrears of reimbursement of stamp fees and court fines to Local Government Institutions of the South, due from the Provincial council. The grant was released by the Provincial Treasury following a request made by Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva.
All the Mayors and their Deputies, Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen of Local Government Institutions who took part in the event to receive the respective grants expressed their gratitude towards the Chief Minister.
The allocations of grants had been allotted in consideration of the institutional and people needs and revenues of respective institutions.
