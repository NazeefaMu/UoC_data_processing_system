Eastern Province HNDE holders meet Governor

A group of Higher National Diploma in English (HNDE) holders met Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama at the Governors’ Secretariat in Trincomalee recently.
They told the Governor that they were not selected at the recruitment of English teachers even though they hold qualifications.
The Provincial Public Service Commission called for applications to recruit English Diploma teachers and interviews for the posts were held in Trincomalee last month.
About 272 candidates were selected and about 120 were disqualified. They said they were put aside at the interviews even though they hold qualification for the posts.
They say HNDE holders have no other employments but to teach. Therefore, they request the Governor to resolve their issue and provide them with suitable employments.
