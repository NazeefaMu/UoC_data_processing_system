Weerakumara raises concerns on legal limitations

Presidential Commission on Treasury bond issue:
National Freedom Front Parliamentarian Weerakumara Dissanayake yesterday raised concerns on legal limitations under which the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue is operating.
MP Weerakumara was responding to the media after testifying before the Commission yesterday.
Weerakumara said the Commission informed him to give evidence under the limitations of a legal framework.
“I cannot give evidence without speaking of my conclusions. I saw the COPE subcommittee on the Treasury Bond issue being checked. I doubt that the Presidential Commission is also under legal restrictions. But I hope it will not be the case,” he said.
MP Weerakumara said the Commission will have a broader legal framework to operate. He said the Commission will not become a discussion as to what happened.
“I asked the Commission as to why I was summoned if they cannot question me. The Commission had the same problem. They should listen to the statement I have to make and filter what is important,” he said.
“I asked as to why only Arjun Mahendran had a lawyer representing him when there are about 15 primary dealers involved in the transaction.”
Meanwhile, at the Commission, while Weerakumara was testifying, objections were raised against his testimony. Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva and Nihal Fernando PC said Weerakumara is only making allegations and stating conclusions.
