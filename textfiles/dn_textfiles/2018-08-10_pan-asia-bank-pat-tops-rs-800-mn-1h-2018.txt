Pan Asia Bank PAT tops Rs 800 mn in 1H 2018

Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC reported its best ever profit recorded in a first half in 2018 anchored by solid growth in new loans, prudent margin and asset-liability management.
For the six months ended in June 30, 2018 (1H’18), the bank reported a profit after tax of Rs.819.6 million, up by a strong 33 percent from the same period in 2017.The net interest income rose by 18% on a year-on-year (yoy) basis to Rs.2.8 billion supported by better margins recorded amid the rising cost of funds. The net interest margin increased to 3.92% during this period from 3.61% in December 2017 as the bank continuously reviewed the pricing of its asset and liability portfolio and managed them efficiently. This improvement is a testament to the bank’s ability to recalibrate its asset portfolio from low yielding ones to high yielding ones in order to optimize the margins.
Meanwhile for the quarter ended in June 30, 2018 (2Q’18), the bank reported a profit of Rs.506.8 million on a net interest income of Rs.1.5 billion compared to Rs.263.5 million profit and Rs.1.2 billion net interest income reported in the same quarter last year. The better top line performance in the 1H’18 is also a reflection of relatively strong growth in new loans.
“We recorded a commendable growth in our loan book during the first half of 2018 amid the many headwinds we faced during this period. I consider this achievement noteworthy because we recorded it amid a moderation in sector loan growth and rising non-performing loans”, said Nimal Tillekeratne, Pan Asia Bank’s Director/ Chief Executive Officer.
