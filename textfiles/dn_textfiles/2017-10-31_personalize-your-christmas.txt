Personalize your Christmas

Come October. There is that chill in the air that signals the coming of the holiday season. Despite all the talk of commercialization and what not, Christmas is still about joy, peace, love, laughter and family. One of the oldest ways of spreading that joy to those closest to you and across the miles was by sending greeting cards. Dating back to the mid-19th century greeting cards have always been an integral part of the season.
This year Sri Lanka’s most sought after photographer and his team at TheFotoCube are giving everyone an opportunity to personalize their greeting cards in a unique way. TheFotoCube who are known for their innovative approach to photography and videography are introducing a special package for couples, families or even corporates to personalize their Christmas greeting cards.
TheFotoCube will schedule a convenient date and time for a shoot at their studio complete with Christmas props of your choice. The keen eye of the photographer will capture precious moments filled with joy and laughter without too much of static posing, a signature of TheFotoCube’s photographic excellence.
