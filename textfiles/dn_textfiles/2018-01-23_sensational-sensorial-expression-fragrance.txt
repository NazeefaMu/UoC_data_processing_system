Sensational sensorial expression of fragrance

Unilever’s iconic brand Lux, which has been a household name for generations and has a 75 year old presence in Sri Lanka, with a range of beauty soap and the latest eight hour long lasting fragrance of Magical Spell body wash, has now introduced a premium, perfumed soap, “The Lux Perfumed Bar Collection” to local users.
What is more, the whole range of Lux, was brought to life, at yet another spectacular House of Lux!  
House of Lux 2018 – an immersive fragrance experience unlike any other was brought to life on 16th January at the magnificent Shangri-La Ballroom. The space was transformed to offer a spectacular fragrance adventure, with four fragrance zones inviting guests to discover the fragrance that is best matched by their mood and personality, and to embark on a sensual fragrant journey like never before. 
“Lux celebrates the everyday woman’s extraordinary power through perfume. 
She’s more today than she was yesterday - and we’d like to remind her of that tomorrow, and for every moment thereafter”, said Category Head Skin Cleansing and Baby of Unilever, Dinusha Ekanayake.
