Pelwatte Sugar liquidation to end soon

Melstacorp Limited is looking at ways to make its fixed wireless operator ‘Lanka Bell’ a viable entity contributing to Melstacorp’s revenue stream, Melstacorp Managing Director Amitha Gooneratne said.
He made these views at a special market opening ceremony organised to mark the listing of the shares of Melstacorp Limited last Friday.
Lanka Bell was badly hit particularly due to tax structure, Gooneratne said adding that the firm is inundated with all other forms of taxation and quite a substantial amount of revenue generated by Lanka Bell fills the government coffers in terms of frequency fees, VAT and various other levies.
Lanka Bell has also made heavy investments aimed at developing LTE services.
In addition to this, the group is also planning to boost energy and tourism, finance sectors.
Disclosing future plans for Pelwatte Sugar, Gooneratne asserted that the liquidation process of the company will soon come to an end.
“Nonetheless, the compensation bureau which looks at the entire process hasn’t taken a final decision as to what form of compensation would be granted to the investors”.
Gooneratne is however hopeful that something will work out in that respect.Commenting on the alcoholic beverage sector, he disclosed that in the first half of 2016, market share of its alcoholic beverage sector has marginally increased and many actions taken by the new regime has resulted in a drop in activities of illicit alcoholic beverage segment.
“Various regulatory measures taken by the new regime has assisted a formal player like Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka (DCSL) to perform well.” Gooneratne noted.
However, the firm’s performance for the second half of 2016 has momentarily affected due to increases in excise duties and so on.
