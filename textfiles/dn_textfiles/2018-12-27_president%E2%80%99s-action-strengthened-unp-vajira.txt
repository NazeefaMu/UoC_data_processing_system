President’s action  strengthened UNP - Vajira

UNP supporters' bond with the party strengthened with the political changes made by President Maithripala Sirisena recently, Internal and Home Affairs and Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Vajira Abeywardena said.
The Minister was addressing a ceremony in Uluvitike held to welcome him after he assumed duties.
He said party members and supporters deviated from the UNP recently and with the President's attempt to change the government, the party members refreshed their loyalty towards the party.
Former Minister and UPFA MP Piyasena Gamage, former Deputy Minister and UPFA member Manusha Nanayakkara and former Minister Gunaratne Weerakoon joined the new government as a result, he said. "We don't know what the other members of their party would do in future," Minister Abeywardena said.
"Some of them would join us," he said.
He said he was entrusted with two powerful ministries this time and he already allocated Rs 700 million for the Ambalangoda Municipal Council.
The Minister said he would allocate enough funds for Galle and a significant development in the area can be carried out with the money.
Minister Abeywardena said the economy drew back in recent anarchy in the country.
“Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has over 40 years of political experience and he can revive the economy,” the Minister said.
“The people do not understand the January 8 constitutional changes. They think the country has the same Presidential system as earlier. But it was changed after January 8," Minister Abeywardena said.
The Minister said constructive changes took place following the latest constitutional issues. "One is that the world saw that Sri Lanka’s judiciary is independent," Minister said.
"Another is that international community told tourists that Sri Lanka was safe for them to visit," the Minister said.
“If the public elect members brake chairs and attack others with chili powder in the House, it is a tragedy,” the Minister said.
