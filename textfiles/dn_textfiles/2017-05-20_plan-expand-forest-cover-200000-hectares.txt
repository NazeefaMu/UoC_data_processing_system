Plan to expand forest cover by 200,000 hectares

About 200,000 hectares of forest land will be restored by 2020 in line with the Presidential Initiative “Sri Lanka Next: Blue Green Era”, Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayarathne said.
The Deputy Minister was addressing the Bonn Challenge Asia Regional High-Level Round-table meeting in Palembang, South Sumatra, Indonesia recently.
The Bonn Challenge is a global effort to restore 150 million hectares of the world’s deforested and degraded land into restoration by 2020 and restoration of 350 million hectares by 2030. The Deputy Minister said Sri Lanka will work as communicated in the Nationally Determined Contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC) by increasing forest cover from 29 percent to 32 percent by 2018. The Asia Bonn Challenge event brought together 12 Asian countries.
