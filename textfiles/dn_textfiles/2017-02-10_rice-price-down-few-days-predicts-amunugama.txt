Rice price down in few days, predicts Amunugama

The price of rice will come down within the next few days with the introduction of the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) for three varieties of rice by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA), Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
The CAA introduced the MRP for three varieties of rice from Wednesday issuing an extraordinary gazette notification to curtail the price of rice. Accordingly, a kilo of Nadu will be sold at Rs. 72 and a kilo of Samba at Rs. 80.
“The government has taken measures to import 150,000 MT of rice with immediate effect aiming to bring down the price of rice. The imported rice will arrive in the country in the next few days and the price of rice will come down,” the minister said.
Dr. Amunugama said rice production has come down this Maha season due to the prevailing drought.
Rice production had come down by 40 to 50 percent this year compared with last year. Meanwhile, the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) has set a guaranteed price for paddy aiming to protect paddy farmers. Under this, a kilo of Nadu paddy is purchased at Rs. 38 and Samba at Rs. 42. However, the PMB purchases only 10 to 12 percent of the total annual paddy production of the country at the moment, he said.
The minister said 258,000 MT of rice imported from India by Lanka Sathosa during the previous regime was stored in their stores for a long period. Sathosa had to later sell the rice as animal food as Sathosa had failed to utilise it, the minister said.
“Investigations revealed that this huge amount of rice was imported from a single rice exporter in India,” he said.
