‘LG elections in Anuradhapura proceed smoothly’

The Local Government election campaign in the Anuradhapura district has been quite, peaceful, and harmonious sans altercations, fisticuffs, and rivalry among major parties and suppporters, Anuradhapura Government Agent and the Chief Returning Officer R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News, recently.
Postal votes bundles were distributed among certifying officers at 68 centers in the district during the last two days. The number of registered voters in the district is 672,161, and 45,261 of them are eligible for casting postal vote. There would be 680 polling centers in the district, Wanninayake said further.
According to him, the casting of postal votes concerning the Kachcheri district elections office and all police stations, would be executed on January 22, 2018 and casting of postal votes relevant to all other government institutes, forces, and schools, would be finalized between January 25 and 26. The casting would be allowed from 8.30 am up to 4.15 pm.
Anuradhapura Divisional SSP Thilina Hewapathirana said a few minor offences, mainly possessing and pasting posters, were reported during the last week and offenders were released on personal bail. No major incidents of breaching or violating election rules and regulations so far, have been reported to any police station in the zone, he added, and hoped that this calm and peaceful situation would continue until the elections have concluded.
