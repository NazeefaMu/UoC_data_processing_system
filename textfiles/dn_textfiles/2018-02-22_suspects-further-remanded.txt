Posting New Year greetings with LTTE emblem:
Suspects further remanded

Two youths arrested on the charge of posting New Year greetings with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) emblem and a picture of former LTTE Leader Velupillai Prabhakaran on Facebook, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded until March 7 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
The two suspects, Dinesh Kumar and Vijaya Kumar Vidusha, residents of the Ratnapura area, were arrested by the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID), following a complaint that they had posted New Year greetings with the LTTE logo and a photograph of Prabhakaran in a manner which damages the peaceful coexistence of different communities in the country.
Meanwhile, the court was informed that the Attorney General has recommended to institute legal action against the suspects under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act No. 56 of 2007.
Taking into consideration the facts, Colombo Additional Magistrate Daminda Weligodapitiya ordered the suspects to be further remanded until March 7.
