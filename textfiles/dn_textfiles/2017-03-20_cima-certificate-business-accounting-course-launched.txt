CIMA Certificate in Business Accounting course launched

 A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with CIMA’s learning partners will promote CIMA’s Certificate in Business Accounting (Cert BA) as a stand-alone qualification in Sri Lanka.
Association of International Certified Professional Accountants Chief Executive Andrew Harding was in Sri Lanka recently to sign a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with CIMA’s learning partners in the country.
This MOA will promote CIMA’s Certificate in Business Accounting (Cert BA) as a stand-alone qualification, with Sri Lanka being the first country to launch this programme, followed by its expansion to other parts of the world.
The Cert BA offers an entry route into the CIMA professional qualification, it is also a qualification in its own right. Cert BA provides a solid understanding of fundamental accounting, management and business principles, supporting the development of skills in financial reporting, forecasting and data analysis.
Commending the quality of CIMA’s learning partners in Sri Lanka, Harding said: “I am extremely proud of the high standard of tuition provision by our learning partners in Sri Lanka and once again, they are trailblasing this new initiative of a standalone Cert BA. Sri Lanka is an important market for the Association.
Both CIMA and the American Institute of CPAs have established this new Association to combine resources, strategies and people which gives us more efficiency, effectiveness and far stronger influence. We are genuinely global, with 650,000 members and students in public and management accounting.”
Venkkat Ramanan, Regional Vice President, Asia Pacific of the Association was also in attendance for the MOA signing ceremony. Addressing the gathering of learning partners, Venkkat elaborated, “As a professional body, we are responsive to market needs.
It is a source of great pride to see the provision of educational services in the country. Wider reach of educational qualifications is important, and this programme is designed to give access to different segments of the market.”
