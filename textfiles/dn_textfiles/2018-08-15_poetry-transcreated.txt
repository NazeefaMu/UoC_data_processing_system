Poetry transcreated

I wish to translate a few poems taken from a book called Arraith Thingal written by a Danish Tamil lady. She was originally born in Lanka and now settled in Denmark with her family. Her real name is Jasmine Kennedy and uses her nom-de-plume as Nakkeeran Mahal.
The purpose is to show that some of the expatriate writers and poets have not forgotten their mother tongue and write appreciable poems.
This book of 80 pages published by Valary Eluthukkoodam in MaanaMathurai in India in 1916 contains 60 short poems. The publisher himself is a former Lankan now an Indian citizen, Aruna Sunthararajan. He has written a perceptive Introduction to the book while Dr Bhanumathi has written an analysis of the poems. The poet herself gives some information about herself and her purpose in writing.
Social evils
She was born in Postparty in Vadamarachi region in Yaalpaanam. The name her parents gave was Sivenewari. She studied in 5 schools there including Udupiddi Girl School and the Paruthithurai (Point Pedro) Methodist Girls High School.
Her purpose in writing is to shed away with social evils in her society: oppression, casteism, dowry system, female subjugation and the like. When she emigrated with her husband Robert Kennedy, who encouraged her to continue with her writing the late Balasubramaniam Sivakolunthu who edited a little magazine called Amuthu in Newbo in Denmark, her contributions were published. Her poems were used in foreign TV channels like TRT, ABC, IBC and TTN.
She worked for some time as a Tamil teacher in Demark. She wrote plays and poetry for the children there to improve their mother tongue. She has spent 23 years in a foreign clime. She made use of the social media like the Facebook to give expression to her thoughts and feelings via poetry since 2014. She has dedicated her book to her younger sister who died falling a victim to the lust of a sex maniac.
Poetry translated
Let us see through English what her feelings are as a poet from some lines from her poetry.
Conscience is the supreme witness to tell you what is justice coming from your inner heart.
Don’t think that no one will know what the wrong things we do within the four walls, there is one who sees that within you. You have to answer him.
When our nest was broken, when wings were cut and the hunter killed us, those that looked at us with curiosity say they will give us the nest and the wings to fly high. From the crow’s nests, some cuckoos too join in the singing.
Instead of filling the stomach of a lame man like me, they bypass me and are filling the tills in the temple. Is the God handicapper more than I?
The relationship is like a stick bound by the rope of affection and forms a cage called family.
The woman, why are your eyes wet? Aren’t you energy itself on this earth? Rise Up. Humans evolve within the portals of yours. Pure lass, do not bend any more. Don’t bow down, Stand straight. Don’t ask anyone for a solution. Burn the bad. Drive away the unbearable sorrow. Walk up the stairs and go high. Shed away your ignorance. Love your man as you like yourself. When sorrow comes join hands with the womankind. The world’s wealth may ignore you. Create history before those horrible men.
What Colourful dreams while waiting in the pedestal setup for the wedding, while she waits for the consummation, a screen called dowry came and disturbed her dreams. Today the dreams and the sideburns have gone grey. She is a not a matured but a young maid.
There wasn’t any distinction as low and high, even God has not created us separately. Some among the ancients to keep some as downtrodden designed the caste differences.
Dewdrops as diamond vanish within a second sunlight falling on it proving the human life’s impermanence.
The pain of the poor searching a morsel of rice from an empty pot is like a pregnant woman’s pain in giving birth to an infant. No words to describe.
I have tried to recreate what she says in understandable terms only because if I were to translate the poems word to word the essence of what she says will be lost in translation.
Nakeeran Mahal, aka Jasmine Kennedy is a graduate from the University of Denmark in Danish.
