In the below 40 tournament “Wolf Pack” were the winners and in the over 40 “Mighty 40” emerged champs. All the players were keen and showed off their skills and did not disappoint with structured team defences, strong attacking play and good running onto the ball and support play which was a work-on area within its curriculum. Throughout the whole day the players worked very well together with a clear understanding of the laws and respect for the opposition and referee.

Vidyartha beat Trinity in the semi-final 19-14. The Bowl championship was won by Kingswood College they beat D.S.Senanayake College 22-4 in the final. They gave a good display of rugby.

No proper training place
In Kandy today weightlifters and body builders have no proper place for their training. In the good old days Kandy YMCA, Mahanuwara YMBA gave a big hand, then also Municipal Community Centres.

Some schools have their own ones. The Ministry of Sports CP and Central Government should look into it and help the poor sportsmen and women.
