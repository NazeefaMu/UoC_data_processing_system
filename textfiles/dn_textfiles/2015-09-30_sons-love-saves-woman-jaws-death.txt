Son's love saves woman from jaws of death

For E.M. Shanthi of Anuradhapura, last Friday was another hectic day. After attending to her daily chores, the mother of three went to Kala Oya behind her home in the evening not knowing the danger lurking in the crystal clear waters.
Taking a dip, Shanthi, 52, suddenly felt something dragging her leg.
"I really did not know what happened and I felt danger. I screamed: 'Save me! Something is dragging me'," she told the Daily News from her hospital bed at the Colombo National Hospital yesterday.
Shanthi's son Romesh Maduwantha, 19, who heard his mother's cries, saw a crocodile dragging her.
"I saw a crocodile dragging my mother into the water. I jumped and swam towards my mother. My mother told me to tickle the crocodile's belly, which I did. The crocodile however, did not release her leg," he said.
"I tightened my grip on the crocodile with my legs and tried to open the crocodile's mouth with my hands. It struggled making it difficult to hold onto it. The crocodile's mouth was closed and I had to force open the crocodile's mouth for it to release my mother," Maduwantha said.
The heroic teenager who battled underwater with the crocodile for around five minutes, only realised how exhausted he was after carrying his mother on his shoulders and brought her ashore.
"Villagers helped me take her to the Anuradhapura Base Hospital," Maduwantha said.
Shanthi was later transferred to the Colombo National Hospital where she is still receiving treatment.
Shanthi whose leg was amputated said she will remember her son's words: "Amma, do not worry. I will save you," until she lives.
Recalling the nightmare, she said he held her hand and fought with the crocodile.
"That is all I remember. He later carried me on his shoulders and brought me to the garden. He also told me that he would somehow save me," Shanthi said brushing her tears aside.
Madhuwantha is Shanthi's youngest son. He works at a private company and lives with her.
She also has two daughters. Both are married and live separately.
Madhuwantha said he and his sisters have told their mother not to bathe alone as she could slip and fall."Crocodiles do not come to this place. This place has been separated for bathing. But this happened and we have to be careful in the future," Shanthi's daughter said.
"Our father died nine years ago. Since then my mother did everything for us. She cannot work now and our brother is looking after her as we are not living with them. We are lucky to have a heroic son and a brother," she added.
Well-wishers willing to assist Shanthi can contact her at Yaya 04, Dikwewa, Senapura.
