JVP Leader expresses concern about  university students

Instead of fostering higher education, the Minister of Higher Education today is discharging his duties in a similar manner to that of a Minister of Prisons, Janatha Vimukthui Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Dissanayake said yesterday.
H was speaking at a media briefing at the JVP head office in Pelawatta.
Expressing his reservations and concerns to the government about the recent arrests and class suspensions of university students, Dissanayake asked if the present government had taken after the previous Rajapaksa regime- it seemed that actions to suppress student demonstrations are all out.
He said, “up to this date, 28 students have been taken before Court and 26 students have been suspended from the Sabaragamuwa University- 19 arrested and 24 taken before Court from the Kelaniya University, three arrested and five taken before Court from the Ruhuna University.”
“The classes of 25 students attached to the Moratuwa University, 29 attached to the Peradeniya University and 35 attached to the HNDA, have been suspended by the higher education’s top brass,” he said,” Furthermore, the convener of the Inter University Students’ Federation has been put behind bars.”
The JVP Leader also cautioned the government of the possibility that current student protests can turn into public protests.
He said the government is making education a luxury of the rich and privileged. Its policy is to make education a crop to be yielded by the rich instead of making it a privilege of the entire student population which is to be yielded on an equal footing.
“The issues over the Malabe private medical school, SAITM stands as a good example.The students have opposed it and they are fighting against it. The SAITM Mudalali (entrepreneur) is in no position to sell education which is the sum total of experience of mankind throughout the ages as if it was his property,” he said.
“Where the government needed to change its policy regarding education, it appears that it has passed the ball to the Court, This has led to a situation of students being stranded, they have been left hopeless on the future of their education and rights, ready to spend sleepless nights opposite the Fort Railway Station,” he said.
“The government is responsible for their plight” he added.
