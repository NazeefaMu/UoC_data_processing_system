Start your day well

It is another day. Another twenty-four hours, starting from morning, afternoon, evening and night. This is the way the day has been divided.
THE GLITTERING GREETINGS THROUGH THE DAY
We always greet people during the day. Starting from morning which continuous to afternoon, evening and night. The glittering two words we use to greet a person throughout the day has been symbolized from past to present and will continue in the future too.
“GOOD MORNING” “GOOD AFTERNOON” “GOOD EVENING” “GOOD NIGHT”
A smiling “Good Morning” at a sight wherever you are makes you live and cheerful. It is a mental comfort as well.
The noon is hot, sometimes cool, but it is always a “Good Afternoon”.
“Good Evening” comes next. The bright sunshine glitter it’s colorful orange.
The dark blue sky is the “Good Night” which end’s the day. A “Good Night” sleep and sweet dreams keep you away from everything until the next day.
A GOOD START
Start the day with your prayers. Whatever religion you are it will be a blessing and the mental comfort to enlighten your day. Rise up early. It will take you off with the “hurry-up” and the prevailing rush.
RISING UP EARLY
Rising up early is the first thing to start your day. It makes things easy for you, rather than being hurry and messing-up everything during the day. If you get up early there is plenty of time for you to get ready and attend to the entire things that you should do in the morning. Late rising will be a big rush. Your mood and the entire mentality will be tarnished. I will be late to class to office. Bus breakdown, traffic all will be pestering you. You can get rid of all these issues by getting up early. Another important fact that I should point out is avoid going to bed late in the night.
MORNINGS CAN SET THE TONE FOR YOUR DAY
Why is it? You are fresh and comfortable in the mornings. Dressed and groomed to leave home to school or office. Everyone attend to their chores in the morning. Your power of strength is more in the morning.
DAYS OF THE WEEK
Seven days. It’s the lucky seven indeed. Every day is a new day. It has to be dealt with care and consideration. For children schooling is from Monday to Friday. They work according to a time-table in class. It is well-organized. What about the professionals? They too have to cope up with their regular routines for the day.
A WISH AND A POSITIVE THOUGHT
The wish within you to be successful during the day on all transactions will be a positive thought. Make a wish as soon as you finish your daily prayers it will be fulfilled. Think about the good things that will happen throughout the day. Even if something doesn’t look good, look at the positive side of it. For instance, you might have a difficult task at work. But instead of thinking about how difficult it is, think about what an exciting challenge it is. By reframing your mind like this, you will have a positive attitude about your day.
BE NORMAL AND CALM
The attitude you have when you start your day can have a big impact. If you grumble that you will have a miserable day ahead, it will be difficult for you to have a good day. On the other hand, if you think that whatever comes your way within day to take it up or face it with your power of strength it will happen! Fascinate the day. Keep a free mind. You can make the day or all the seven days your best.
PLAN YOUR DAY AHEAD
You should have a plan before going into your day. How should you do it? Arrange your schedule in a way that maximizes your effectiveness. What you should schedule in the morning and what comes first because your mind is fresh in the morning. The rest can be carried out during the day. By arranging your activities this way you can be more effective and gain fruitful results.
A HEALTHY NUTRIOUS MEAL – BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND DINNER
While you start the day think of your three main meals. Do not slip. Make it! Sometimes it will be difficult. A nourishing meal will keep you fit always. Especially breakfast. You should not use the words “No time to have breakfast even”. Make the time for your meals. I know that there are different opinions about this, but for many people having a breakfast can give them the energy they need to start the day. This is one of the reasons why you should get-up early enough. You will have time for a good breakfast. Lunch is also important followed by dinner.
FACING UNEXPECTED SITUATIONS DURING THE DAY
Sudden changes in your daily routine may occur. All seven days will not be the same. It differs. Be flexible to go ahead with difficult situations as well. Rainy days, Power cuts, Traffic, Road blocks, closure of roads… these are frequent incidents.
BE A WINNER AT THE END OF THE DAY
Take time off from your busy schedules to think and analyze whether you were able to take the maximum use of the day which will never come back. .
