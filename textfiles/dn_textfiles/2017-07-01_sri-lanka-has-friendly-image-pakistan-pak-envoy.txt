Sri Lanka has friendly image in Pakistan: Pak Envoy

Sri Lankan products and services would find receptive customers in Pakistan as Sri Lanka has a friendly image in the eyes of Pakistani people, Pakistani acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Sipra said.
The acting High Commissioner was addressing a seminar jointly organised by the Export Development Board (EDB) of Sri Lanka and the Pakistan High Commission on “Business Opportunities with Pakistan”, recently.
Dr. Sipra said Sri Lanka would be the “Focus Country for 2017".
Sri Lanka is the only country that has been granted this status.
The EDB would place a Sri Lankan pavilion during the Expo Pakistan 2017 to be held in November at Expo Centre, Karachi, he said. The Acting High Commissioner assured Pakistan’s full support to strengthen bilateral trade relations between the two nations. EDB Chairperson Indra Malwatte said EDB has taken steps to increase exports by raising awareness about export opportunities for the Sri Lankan businessmen in Pakistan.
