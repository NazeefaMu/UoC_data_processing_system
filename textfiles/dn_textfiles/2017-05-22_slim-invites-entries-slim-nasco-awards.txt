SLIM invites entries for SLIM-NASCO awards

The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) which has been in the forefront of fostering marketing knowledge of business sectors in the country is inviting local companies to nominate their sales personnel and top sales performers for the annual SLIM-NASCO 2017 awards, scheduled to be held in October this year.
Participants could send their entries until June 06.
Speaking at a media briefing, SLIM President Karthik Elangovan highlighted that the objective of conducting this 17th SLIM-NASCO awards is to recognise, motivate and encourage outstanding sales personnel in the country who made an immense contribution to the success of their companies. He said these awards also serve to facilitate cross industry sales learning, impart greater exposure to the country’s sales professionals, build confidence among the wide spectrum of participants and comprehensively develop the leadership skills of participants.
National Sales Congress (NASCO) is a premier organisation that looks into the performance of sales personnel in the country and serves as a platform for companies to identify and motivate their top sales performers to achieve their targets.
According to regulations, NASCO awards are presented to 15 business sectors under the categories of territorial managers, sales executives, sales supervisors and frontliners.
In addition, Gold, Silver and Bronze awards will be presented to best female salesperson under each category.
Accordingly, organisations can nominate two persons under territorial managers sector, four under executive/ sales supervisors and seven under frontliners. The period of performance review for entries is from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 or March 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.
Elangovan also said that winning a NASCO award can enhance careers of those nominated as it reflects the value that the company places on them.
He said the forthcoming NASCO 2017 will be an exciting platform for the sales fraternity to network among themselves and celebrate their noteworthy sales achievements.
SLIM Vice President Suranjith Swaris said last year they received over 500 entries and this year they expect over 550 entries.
He also said SLIM-NASCO is the only national event that recognizes and rewards sales personnel covering a spectrum of business sectors.
