Building powerful brands for 19 years

Leo Burnett Sri Lanka, the local office of the global advertising network Leo Burnett Worldwide recently celebrated its 19th anniversary of operations in Colombo.
As part of the anniversary celebrations, 110 Burnetters came together to commemorate the agency's 19 years of success. The proceedings kicked off with the lighting of 110 oil lamps by each member of staff to symbolize each employee's creative spirit. A Lemon sapling was also planted at the head office, with the soil brought from each Burnetter’s home, as a symbol of unity, new beginnings and celebration of teamwork.
In an effort to give back whilst celebrating their success so far, the agency team also partnered with the Sri Lanka Blood Bank, to host a blood donation drive at the head office. A total of 24 donors including many Burnetters came forward and donated 20 pints of blood which will go to help those in need.
To top off celebrations this year and staying true to its ongoing commitment of delivering creative excellence, the agency also scored a rare 8 ball at the GPC (Global Product Committee) for innovation, for its Petal Paint campaign for JAT Holdings. The GPC is held four times a year, to internally evaluate the agency’s work on a scale of 1 to 10. The Petal Paint campaign scored the fifth 8 ball in the local agency’s history, and the second within the last year.
