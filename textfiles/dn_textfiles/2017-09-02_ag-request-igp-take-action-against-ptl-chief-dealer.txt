Treasury Bond issue:
The Attorney General’s Department will on Monday request the Inspector General of Police to conduct a criminal investigation against Perpetual Treasuries Limited Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado for tampering with evidence submitted to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury Bond issue.
It was revealed before the PCoI yesterday (31) that PTL Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado has instructed the PTL IT Executive Sachit Devatantri to delete certain telephone conversations which were recorded in PTL’s call logger system.
Subsequently, Devathantri has deleted the recordings and replaced them with some other call recordings.
The PTL recently handed over all its telephone call recordings from February 01, 2015 to March 31, 2016 to the PCoI.
Testifying before the PCoI, PTL IT executive told that on the day following this deletion, the main voice logger computer of the telephone call recording system crashed and was replaced by another.
He said the call logger system was reinstalled as a result of the crash.
According to Devatatri he copied the tampered call recordings into the replaced computers while disregarding to copy the call information of these recordings, such as call time, duration and caller IDs.
The Attorney General’s Department has provisions to seek legal action against Salgado for tampering with and fabricating evidence, according to Section 24 of the Commission of Inquiry Act.
