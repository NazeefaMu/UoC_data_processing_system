Over the years, the show has steadfastly developed in to one of the best international gem and jewelry exhibitions in the world. A very significant factor in the history of the event is that it is the only exhibition in Sri Lanka, which has been held uninterrupted for a period of 27 years.
As a result, the local Gem and Jewelry trade has benefitted immensely, reaching appreciable heights in the international arena. Over the past 27 years, the brand profile of the show has developed to a great extent, gaining international recognition as a world class exhibition and has now grown to nearly 200 stalls.
Facets Sri Lanka plays a pivotal role in making Colombo a regional Gem &Jewelrycapital and Sri Lanka the “Sapphire Capital of the World”.
FACETS strengthens and promotes industry development with special focus on the industry’s prime resource, the Ceylon Sapphires, as well as to increase the sale of other gemstones and jewelry products to overseas markets, attract more international buyers to Sri Lanka and facilitate a level playing field among the different segments of the industry.
