"Never give up on your dreams" - ICC umpire Ruchira Palliyaguru

“Be determined and never give up on your dream” said ICC panel umpire Ruchira Palliyaguru addressing the players of the twelve teams competing in this year’s Matara Super League T20 cricket tournament which gets underway today.
Ruchira made this comment when the the Matara District Cricket Association (MDCA) and the organizing committee of the MSL T20 cricket tournament presented him with a felicitation plaque at the opening ceremony of the MSL T20 last Wednesday.
State Minister of Enterprise Development and President of the MDCA Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena presented the plaque.
Ruchira represented St Servatius College and the Matara Sports Club before representing Bloomfield Cricket Club. “It was my dream to play international cricket which never materialized but I did not give up on my dream and worked hard to reach the ICC Panel of Umpires which enabled me to officiate at an international game.
Although I was not born in Matara I have inherited the grit and determination which is an inherent quality of the people of Matara.”
“There are times we unwittingly make mistakes in the first or second balls of an international game but it was this grit has helped me hold my head and perform well in the rest of the game.
So I expect all of you
to pursue your dream with grit and determination which is inherent to the people of Matara” he added.
