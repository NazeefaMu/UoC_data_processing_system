Launched with the aim of fulfilling the national need to provide much needed quality higher education to Sri Lankan youth, SLTC conducts undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes on par with international standards in collaboration with globally reputed and highly ranked universities. Currently SLTC offers degree programmes partnering with University of Lancaster,UK and University of Deakin, Australia.
‘'SLTC was created with the clear vision to fill the vacuum for quality higher education in the spheres of engineering and technology. As the country progresses towards development, the demand for qualified professionals in these disciplines become increasingly relevant and rapidly increasing. Just like the existing degree programmes, our new degree programmes are designed to provide sound theoretical, practical and analytical knowledge with the fundamentals of engineering and technology' said Ranjith Rubasinghe, Founder President and CEO of SLTC. 
SLTC's ENTECH Youth Excellence scholarship programme is the only one of its kind in Sri Lanka, where deserving students who excelled in their GCE A/L's are presented the opportunity of world class education at affordable fees.
The eligibility criteria for ENTECH scholarships presents a wide array of grants ranging from full scholarships to part scholarships, based on the students’ AL results. Thus, the students with 3 A passes at GCE A/L are eligible for full (100%) scholarships and students will receive a 30% grant for each A pass, 20% for each B pass and 10%  for each C pass under this pioneering scheme.
SLT Campus is the first academic institute in Sri Lanka to practice student-centered and outcome-based teaching methods with a heavy emphasis on research. As a result SLTC graduates are equipped with the knowledge and expertise to immediately start working in their specialised fields. 
The campus is located at the iconic SLT Satellite Earth Station in Padukka, which is easily accessible from Colombo via common transport modes and can accommodate students in a comfortable environment located on a sprawling 35-acre property.
