UPFA denounces Speaker’s conduct

The UPFA yesterday vehemently denounced the inappropriate conduct of the Speaker and urged for a General Election observing that Parliament cannot function under a biased Speaker. The UPFA also held the Speaker responsible for the “unfortunate” situation that occurred yesterday with MPs from both parties behaving aggressively in House. They also said that they cannot accept the No Confidence Motion against Mahinda Rajapaksa based on the manner in which the voting was carried out by the Speaker.
They said the Speaker has violated the constitution, standing orders, rules and the tradition of the House. “This is in turn has led to a very unfortunate situation. This is not good for the country and its people. We hold Speaker was responsible for all the chaos,” Chief Government Whip S.B. Dissanayake pointed out.
Dissanayake said Lakshman Kiriella’s attempt to have a vote on Mahinda Rajapaksa’s speech in the House was a “joke”.
Dissanayake was speaking at a press brief held at the Parliament premises yesterday afternoon together with Susil Premajayantha, Bandula Gunawardena, Tilanga Sumathipala, Udaya Gammanpila, Dallus Alahapperuma, Dayasiri Jayasekara and several other UPFA members.
Susil Premajayantha said there is no provision to suspend standing orders in such a way. Therefore, the Speaker violated SO of Parliament and with his biased intention allowed the Opposition to raise their requirement. JVP MP Vijitha Herath ran to the Speaker’s chair handed over a document to Secretary General and without even going through the contents of the document, Speaker asked for a vote. He decided to take a vote by listening to the sound. It is very unethical not regarding the Standing Orders and not knowing the document given to the Secretary General.”
Premajayantha who criticized the attempt to vote against Rajapaksa’s speech in the House said someone can attempt to pave way for a Federal government in the middle of this chaos using the majority.” He alleged that the UNP led opposition is planning to separate the country.
Dayasiri Jayasekara alleged that the Speaker was trying to assist Ranil Wickremesinghe to declare a government while remaining in the left side of the Chamber. Jayasekara said the seating arrangements of Wickremesinghe and Gayantha Karunathilake were suspicious and implied a malicious plan. According to Jayasekara, the UNP was trying to declare a government after the vote against Rajapaksa’s speech while remaining in the left side of the Chamber. In tradition, the governing party occupies the right-side of the Chamber while the Opposition remains in the left-side of the Chamber.
Bandula Gunawardena said that not even a community based society acts in the way in which the Speaker handled Parliamentary affairs in the last two days.
Udaya Gammanpila said diplomats who were present in the House expressed their happiness when the UNP led group declared a majority in Parliament. He said that such an expression shows that the UNP has pledged their support to western countries and are ready “to sell the country to the West.”
