A TEA STORY!

The Tea Story of Ceylon began in the year 1824, when the first tea plant was brought in to the country by the British from China and planted in the Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya. This soon led to tea being a preferred beverage amongst all residents across the island. But it was in 1867 that James Taylor - a Scotsman who began tea plantation as a commercial tea crop on just 19 acres of land in Loolecondera Estate in Kandy. 150 years later, Ceylon Tea is synonymous with quality and is now a global favourite!
This milestone will see to a number of celebratory events including Tea Parties hosted across the world on July 6, 2017 at 5pm. Together with the Sri Lanka Tea Board Jetwing Hotels too will be hosting Tea Parties at Jetwing Colombo Seven, Jetwing Jaffna, Jetwing Vil Uyana, Jetwing St. Andrew’s, Jetwing Kaduruketha and Jetwing Yala in line with the global celebrations.
Guests will be treated to a display of sweet and savoury delights served with the finest cups of tea while enjoying the best views across the Jetwing properties. From traditional sweat meats to a specialty high tea menu, celebrate 150 years of Ceylon tea with us at Jetwing amidst unique settings. At Jetwing Colombo Seven and Jetwing Jaffna, high tea will be served at the rooftop bars promising panoramic views of the cities.
