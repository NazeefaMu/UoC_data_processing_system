Discover glorious Japan

The BMICH, Colombo will be transformed into a Japanese wonderland from April 21 to 23 when the Second Edition of Japan Expo takes place. The first edition held last year was highly successful.
Featuring everything from Japanese movies to tea ceremonies, Japan Expo 2018 is a golden opportunity for Sri Lankans and foreigners young and old to discover Japan.
One of the main highlights of the Expo will be the Japanese tea ceremony called sado. Also called the Way of Tea, it is a Japanese cultural activity involving the ceremonial preparation and presentation of “matcha” powdered green tea. Kado or Japanese flower arrangements will be another attraction at the Expo. Also called “ikebana”, it is the Japanese art of creating and appreciating of floral arrangements by using seasonal flowers along with various materials. In kado, not only flowers but also the shape of branch, stems, leaves and moss, and all the other materials used are subjects for appreciation. Started as a tribute to the dead, this spread to all parts of Japan from the 15th century onwards.
Sumo wrestlers
You will be able to see Sumo wrestlers (called Rikishi in Japanese) in action at Japan Expo 2018. Sumo is a Japanese style of wrestling and Japan's national sport. It originated in ancient times as a performance to entertain the Shinto deities. Many rituals with religious background, such as the symbolic purification of the ring with salt, are still followed today. In line with tradition, only men practice the sport professionally in Japan. Matches take place on an elevated ring (dohyo), which is made of clay and covered in a layer of sand.
You can also see the famous Japanese instrument Shamisen in action at Japan Expo 2018. The shamisen is a three stringed lute from Japan, with growing international interest. The most unique quality of the shamisen is its ability to be percussive and melodic at the same time. It can be played quiet as a whisper or, if played forcefully, can be clearly heard outside on a crowded street.
Japanese movies
You can also catch several Japanese movies at Japan Expo. These will either be dubbed or subtitled in Sinhalese. The movies are as follows:
In this Corner of the World (2016) - In 1944, Suzu Urano moves to the small town of Kure in Hiroshima where she marries Shuusaku Houjou—a young clerk who works at the local naval base. Living with his family, Suzu becomes essential to the running of the household and creatively prepares meals during the tough wartime conditions while also carrying out daily housework. In 1945, intense bombings by the U.S. military finally reach Kure with devastating effect to the townsfolk and their way of life. Suzu’s life is changed irrevocably, but through perseverance and courage, she manages to continue to live life to the fullest.
Her Love Boils bath Water (2016) - A strict, but caring mother has an awakening when she is told she has cancer and it is terminal. She has a few months. She needs to complete her tasks in that short time frame. She needs to retrieve her husband who has vanished and get the family business restarted. She needs to help her daughter be able to pick after herself. Will the family bonds grow stronger or wither?
100 Yen Love (2014) - Ichiko lives at her parents' home. She rarely hangs out with other people. Things change when her younger sister divorces and moves back with her child. Ichiko and her sister's relationship goes bad, causing Ichiko to move out and live alone. What brings happiness to Ichiko is to watch a middle-aged boxer (Hirofumi Arai) practice at a boxing gym. The boxing gym is located between the 100 yen shop where she works and her home. One day, Ichiko and the middle-aged boxer meet and they begin to live together. This film is more suitable for adults.
Samurai Hustle Returns (2016) - Masaatsu Naito successfully completes Sankin-kotai (required ritual to visit the shogun). On his way home, he hears that an insurrection by peasants has taken place in his hometown of Yunagaya. Masaatsu Naito knows that it is a counterattack by Matsudaira. He returns to Yunagaya, but finds that his castle is gone.
You can also see a Kamen/Joshi performance at the Expo. Meaning "Masked Girls" in Japanese, it is a Japanese girl group consisting of three smaller teams with several members for each. They are called "Masked Girls" because each member of the group wears a mask which covers up their face when performing.
Neputha ceremony
The Expo will also feature a traditional Japanese Neputha ceremony for the first time. This procession will begin from the BMICH and parade the streets. There will also be a Nyangosta drumming show. The performer is dressed like an animal dressed in red. They will be joined by the Sri Lankan Police cultural troupe.
The Expo will also include a workshop session on modern Japanese architecture and interior design by well-known Japanese architect Tsuyoshi Tane. This will be a valuable opportunity for local architects and interior designers. A Digital Video Symposium will be held for the benefit of all practitioners of digital video in Sri Lanka. There will also be several other lectures on various topics. Japanese wall artist Chichiro Koshi will engage in an “open production” in all three days. Artist Akihiro Nishino will present his picture book exhibition “Poupelle of Chimney Town” at Hall C.
If you like traditional Japanese food there will be stalls in the outdoor area behind c and e hall and you can taste it in hall number three. Exhibition patrons will also be able to buy other Japanese goods in Hall A and E. There will be a career fair where they will explain about higher educational and subsequent employment opportunities in Japan. Participants will have to fill the forms available at the Kizuna International Company’s stall to be eligible. Twenty educational scholarships will also be on offer through Kizuna International, one of the organisers of Japan Expo 2018.
