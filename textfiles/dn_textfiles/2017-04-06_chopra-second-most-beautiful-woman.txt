Chopra is the second most beautiful woman

Priyanka Chopra has been voted the second most beautiful woman in the world, defeating Emma Watson, Hillary Clinton and Angelina Jolie. In a poll conducted by LA-based social media network BuzzNet, Priyanka was just behind Beyonce, who topped the list of 30 beautiful women from different walks of life.
Priyanka, who will soon be making her Hollywood debut with Baywatch, took to Twitter to share the news. She thanked people who voted for her and added, “Beyonce is my number 1 too.”
From being seen on most of the famous talk shows and award functions, including the Academy Awards and Golden Globes, to bagging the People’s Choice Awards twice, Priyanka has been setting the bar high. Deccan Chronicle
