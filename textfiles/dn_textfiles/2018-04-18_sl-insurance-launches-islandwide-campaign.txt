SL Insurance launches islandwide campaign

An island-land awareness campaign on the importance of Life and General Insurance and how these could offer protection to the public was carried out by officers of Sri Lanka Insurance on April 1 and 7. The awareness campaign was conducted islandwide on a door-to-door basis as part of the efforts of the National Insurer to propagate the importance of being protected with insurance in case of unforeseen situations which may arise. Here some of the highlights of the campaign in progress.
