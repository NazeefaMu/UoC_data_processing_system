Shanthi Maargam for hapless

The Shanthi Maargam and Courage, Compassion, Commitment Line organised a 73-day Padayatra to make people aware that they have someone to share their issues.
The awareness walk started on April 1 from Mount Lavinia and proceeded along the South Coast via Galle, Kataragama. Moneragala, Potuvil and reached the Batticaloa Gandhi Park after one month. On their way, they visited churches, schools, Samurdhi Banks, Peradeshiya Sabhas and police stations among others.
After Batticaloa, they visited Chenkalady, Kalkudha, Mankerny, Vakarai, Topoor, Foul Point, Trincomalee and Jaffna.
Councillor and Psychologist Nivendra Uduman initiated the programme in 2016 from Nuwara Eliya to Point Pedro and it took 44 days to reach its final destination. CCC Line Manager Counseling Assistant Ranil Thilakaratna and Psychology final year student Sara Nagoor assisted him.
“We carry out this project for free and walk a long distance to minimise the cost. Every day about 10 people commit suicide in Sri Lanka. According to hospital sources, 100-160 people attempt suicide every day,” a member said.
He said those who try to commit suicide will change their mind if someone can spoke to them positively. Our organisation is open round the clock and anyone can reach us via 0717639898 or via 1333 to get redress for their burning issues, he said
