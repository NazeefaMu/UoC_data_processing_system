“It is always a pleasure for all of us at HNB to announce the start of the HNB Singithi Savings Month. Already the Singithi Savings month is one of our most popular annual promotions and this is a direct result of the unprecedented value that we strive to provide our most valued depositors, over and above the extensive range of gifts and prizes they are eligible for throughout the year.
“By offering such tremendous value for our Singithi depositors, we aim to continuously incentivise the savings habit, providing children with tangible rewards that help them to form a clear understanding of how a proactive savings habit can place them on a path for a stable, secure financial future,” HNB Chief Employee Experience Officer/Assistant General Manager – Deposits and Remittances, Kalum Wijesooriya said.
This time the popular annual promotion returns with an even greater pool of gifts from an even wider range of deposits, rewarding young account holders with special gifts throughout the duration of the campaign for every deposit between Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 5,000,000.
As part of the promotion, children who make a deposit from Rs. 5,000 to Rs 50,000 will receive attractive gifts such as Yoyos and Jumbo Caps, interchangers , doll sets, racing cars, Trolley Bags or Fast Track Sets.
Meanwhile, deposits in the range of Rs. 100,000 to Rs.5,000,000 will receive gift vouchers starting from Rs.7, 500 to Rs.200, 000 which can either be credited to the child’s Singithi Account or can be redeemed at any of the merchant partner outlets - Arpico Super Centre, Singer, Abans, Damro, City Lumala and Nithyakalyani Jewellers.
