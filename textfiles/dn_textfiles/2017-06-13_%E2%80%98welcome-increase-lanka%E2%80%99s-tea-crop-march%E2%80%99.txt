‘Welcome increase in Lanka’s tea crop for March’

Following the decline in tea production, tea export earnings during the calendar year 2016 amounted to US$ 1.269 billion representing 12.3% of total export earnings compared with US$ 1.340 billion amounting to 12.7% of export earnings in 2015, according to the Ceylon Tea Brokers Annual Report 2016/17.
This substantial drop was partly due to adverse weather conditions and, importantly, the restriction placed on the availability of weedicide and consequent curtailment of necessary agricultural practices and inputs. These contributory factors led to extremely poor performance. All three elevations recorded lower figures.
Sri Lanka tea production for the year under review witnessed a substantial decline, recording the lowest production in last seven years.
Tea production for the year ending March 31, 2017, amounted to 288.7 million kilos recording a significant decline of 31.1 million kilos (-9.7%) compared to the previous year.
High Grown and Mid Grown production has dropped by 10.7 million kilos (-14.5%) and 5.5 million kilos ( 11.1%) respectively whilst the Low Grown production declined by 15.0 Million kilos (-7.6%).
Total quantity of tea exported for the financial year ending March 31, 2017, including re-exports with imported tea amounting to 282.73 million kilos showing a considerable decline of 25.48 million kilos (-8.27%) compared to the same period last year.

Drop in production accounted for the lower export volume for the period 2016/17.
However, with the increase in the FOB price per kilo from Rs. 592.89 to Rs. 680.42, total export value for the period showed a marginal gain of Rs. 9.64 billion (+5.27%) as against the same period last year.
Export earnings from tea, the second largest export commodity in Sri Lanka, which accounts for about 12 % of total export earnings, marginally declined to US$ 1.30 billion as against US$ 1.32 billion in 2015/2016 recording the lowest value for the last seven years.
Despite this, the single most redeeming feature on the performance of Sri Lanka’s tea industry last year has been the increase in the auction averages compared to 2015 both when expressed in Sri Lanka Rupee and the US dollar equivalent.
Following the limited availability of tea, together with improved demand from some of our main markets, prices have moved up further during the first four months of 2017.
At the time of compiling of this Report, to date auction averages for the current year are at all-time highs both in terms of Rupees as well as the USD equivalents.
"Although there was a welcome increase in Sri Lanka’s national crop for March it is too early to predict whether this pattern will be maintained for the rest of the year and we can only hope that the total tea crop for 2017 will at least record a figure over the psychological barrier of 300 million kilos," says Ceylon Tea Brokers PLC, making a comment to their Annual Report 2016/17.
This encouraging sign however should be tempered with a word of caution in that if the availability of tea out of Sri Lanka continues to be limited, at some point, we may lose our market share in the more important importing countries due to a lack of regular and adequate supply.
In spite of the higher average FOB price per kilo reflective of the higher auction prices, the total volume of exports have declined following the drop in production. Increase in value has compensated for the drop in volume in respect of Rupee earnings from tea, which amounted to Rs. 184.78 billion in 2016, marginally more than the Rs.182.05 billion in 2015.
The disappointing factor however is that the total value of exports in terms of US dollars has declined to US$1.27 billion, which is the lowest since US$ 1.15 billion in 2009.
