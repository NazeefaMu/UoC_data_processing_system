PARLIAMENT

Pledges given to people will be kept in next two years: Rajitha
The undertakings that led to the people’s mandate on January 8, 2015 will be kept without failure in the next two years, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne stressed in Parliament yesterday.
Speaking at the adjournment debate on the current political situation in the country, the minister said nobody would be allowed to reverse the trajectory they set on January 8. “We even risked our own lives to bring about this change. We will correct our own mistakes and march forward. We have two more years to show progress and deliver our promises. It was a foolish logic to claim that the National Government should resign when it lost a village level election. Where in the world that happens? Only Sri Lankan Parliament has such idiots who bring up such foolish arguments,” he commented.
“People in this LG polls taught us a good lesson, but they have not defeated our force,” the minister said analysing that the forces against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa received 55.35 percent of the total votes whereas the SLPP received only 44.65 percent at the recently concluded LG elections. The Minister further said that when the SLPP won 3,369 electoral wards, the UNP and the SLFP had won 3,417 electoral wards. He added the percentage of votes obtained by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had gradually dropped from 57.88 percent in 2010 to 47.58 percent in 2015 and to 44.65 percent in 2018.
“Now is the time your court cases will gather speed. Be prepared to be in jail in the days to come,” Minister Senaratne told the JO urging the Government to speed up the cases against large scale corruption and criminal charges without letting anybody off the hook in the name of personal contacts.
In the course of Senaratne’s speech, he also tangled with NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa over the educational qualifications and corruption allegations of the latter. “You even failed the Ordinary Level Exam. Show your O/L certificate if you can,” he told Weerawansa. Weerawansa retorted that he would immediately resign from his Parliamentary seat if the minister could prove his claim. Senaratne also accused Weerawansa of spending public funds for the wedding ceremony of the latter’s niece. He said the JO members’ attempt to topple the Government was to escape from legal actions against the offences they committed. Weerawansa again challenged the Minister to prove the allegation stating that he would resign if those were proved.
UPFA will be in Government till President gets SC opinion: Thilanga
The UPFA will continue to be in the National Government till the President receives Supreme Court’s opinion, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala told Parliament yesterday.
He made this statement taking part in the special adjournment debate on the political situation in the country. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had requested Sumathipala to explain to the House over the newspaper reports quoting him (Sumathipala) which stated UPFA decided to quit the National Government.
Sumathipala, who was the only member present in the House representing the UPFA members in the Government, said they decided to remain with President Maithripala Sirisena as one group to maintain political stability in the country. The decision has been arrived at the UPFA group meeting chaired by the President at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday noon.
“UPFA members in the Government requested the permission of the President to leave the Unity Government taking into account the political viewpoint of the party. The President was of the view that such a change might affect stability of the country and the Government. Therefore, he sought legal advice of the Attorney General. The AG, however, had told the President that it was more appropriate to consult Supreme Court’s opinion at this stage to interpret the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. That was the situation prevailed at Sunday night and I take the responsibility of my statement to the media after that meeting. But when we met the President today, he requested us to remain in the Government till the Supreme Court delivers its opinion to maintain stability of the country,” Sumathipala explained. Sumathipala concluded his statement acknowledging the Speaker’s efforts over the past week to maintain stability in the country and in the Parliamentary affairs.
RTI Act revolutionised transparency in Government: Sumanthiran
Good legislative measures are taken mostly when there is weakness and uncertainty of government. The progressive legislative measures are possible when the government is weak, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said in Parliament yesterday.
Sumanthiran was taking part in the debate on the Code of Conduct for MPs and revised set of Standing Orders of Parliament yesterday.
Commending the eighth parliament for succeeding in presenting the set of standing orders and the code of conduct for the Members of Parliament, he cited the 17th amendment as one such example. He said the supreme example is the 19th amendment to the Constitution. “As we consider the new Standing Orders and the Code of Conduct for the members of parliament, it seems ironic that we are discussing these two documents which are important for the conduct of business in Parliament, on a day when there seems to be so much uncertainty in the country with regard to the Prime Minister, Cabinet and the Government,” he said.
For the orderly conduct of business of the House when MP Dinesh Gunawardena rose on a point of order last morning, consequent to a letter given to the Speaker, the Parliament Business Committee in a very orderly manner, made the decision to debate that issue for three hours from 4 pm to 7 pm yesterday. “That is testimony that even in such a situation where there is so much uncertainty, that business of Parliament is conducted in an orderly manner according to the prevailing standing orders. Hence this is an opportune moment to debate this document that has been prepared with lot of care, as said by Ajith P. Perera when he introduced this document,” he said.
Sumanthiran noted that when it was a minority government, numbers of that government was so low, yet it was possible to enact the 19th amendment with just one member voting against it. “When a government is weak, it seems that consensus is possible. That is why I say it maybe an opportune day to adopt these new standing orders that have been presented to the house. On a day when this country and even this Parliament seems unsure as to what governance will look like tomorrow in this country, these Standing Orders have been prepared by this committee across party divides and brought in a number of progressive measures,” he said. He added that it was necessary to have a new set of Standing Orders because the previous one is now so old and most of the provisions had become obsolete and dysfunctional.
The Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament, he said, was a promise given by the unity government, an electoral pledge by the new dispensation that was brought in from January 2015 to August 2015 and it may be important today to look back on that 3-year period. “Even pat ourselves on the back for the number of progressive legislative measures that this parliament was able to enact. After the 19th amendment, the RTI Act was brought into operation and it has revolutionised transparency in governance. Today it may seem that what was achieved during the past three years may come to an end or is a failure. But much of legislative measures that were adopted was progressive. The democratic reforms must be acknowledged and an important reform was the strengthening of Parliament and it is to that end that the new sectoral oversight committees have been brought in. This whole concept of a sectoral oversight committee seems even today alien to us is an important measure in strengthening Parliament,” Sumanthiran said.
Although many members and ministers seem dissatisfied, the committee system that prevailed before this which were consultative committees is what they want. He urged the house to look at this differently as it is a very different issue to the setting up of sectoral oversight committees.
SLPP proved themselves by winning LG polls: Dinesh
Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena said the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna had accepted the challenge thrown at them and proved themselves by winning the Local Government elections.
He said the alliance in the unity government is broken and they cannot function and provide solutions to the issues facing the country and urged the unity government to resign honourably.
He was taking part in the special adjournment debate on the current political situation in the country in Parliament yesterday.
He said the debate on the current unstable situation due to the political crisis the country has been thrust into is most opportune. “After two and half years, the LG elections was held and the Joint Opposition and the Podu Jana Peramuna polled the best results at the election. The Podu Jana Peramuna won 3,369 seats, the UNP won 2,385, the UPFA won 674, the JVP 431 and the ITAK won 407 seats. The Podu Jana Peramuna is clearly the winner. This is the decision given by the people of the country,”he said.
He said there is a political crisis and the country is in an unstable situation due to the actions of the government. “The people have rejected this government but the government is clinging onto power disregarding the mandate given by the people. The stock market, business community and international community have lost faith in the government.
The people no longer believe the lies and myths spread by this government. But now the people have spoken and expressed their disappointment of the government and if they have any respect they should resign in a dignified manner as they have no power to govern this country,” he said.
PM can continue as he has 2/3 majority in Parliament: Navin
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is in a position to continue the government as he can command the 2/3 majority in Parliament, Plantations Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
Speaking in Parliament yesterday joining the special adjournment debate on the current political situation in the country, the minister added that the ‘flower bud’ (Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna) should prove it if they have the majority to form a government.
Dissanayake noted that in terms of Article 46 (2) of the 19th Amendment, the PM can only be removed if he resigns or if he ceases to be an MP.
Although there was a rumour being circulated claiming that a gazette was to be issued to dissolve Parliament on Sunday night, such a measure cannot be taken, he added.
He further asked the SLPP not to boast about having the majority, reminding them that they only have 44 percent.
People’s mandate for the national government continues: Hakeem
A sense of instability has come about due to disagreement between the parties governing the country. However, the people’s mandate is for the national government to continue.
If they cannot continue, we should not have a unstable government, or run by remote control by another person or group. All parties who are going to form an administration must be prepared to take executive office.
If one party is not willing, by proxy or minority government, we are violating the very mandate we received, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
He was taking part in the adjournment debate on the current political situation in the country in Parliament yesterday.
Hakeem said he was not in favour of the way in which certain bills were presented to the House in a manner that denies a citizen of his constitutional right to petition the Supreme Court against such a bill. What has happened is very surreptitiously amendments have been introduced which are totally different to the content of the bill that has been presented. He said Parliament should be more responsible in presentation of bills and should not merely rely on the certificate of the Attorney General to say the bill is consistent with the Constitution.
In drafting amendments to the Standing Orders, many ground-breaking changes have been incorporated and the concept of sectoral oversight committees which goes to empower the backbenchers of the House to have an oversight rule of the executive functions of the government. It is a very salutary feature. We must understand that certain functions of the high post committee as well as the other financial oversight committees such as the committee on public enterprises and committee on public accounts may also get overlapped by the provisions that have been included in the sectoral oversight committees. Even the accounts and financial matters concerning the enterprises coming under the different ministries could also be examined all over again by the sectoral oversight committees in addition to the committee on public enterprises and committee on public accounts.
So while these overlapping issues could be quite confusing, I feel the continuous oversight of the executive by the legislative arm is a very welcome feature and these are important changes that have been made.
I did not receive official intimation on UPFA quitting government: Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday told Parliament that he had not received any official intimation on UPFA quitting the National Government.
He made this response when the Joint Opposition MPs raised questions on newspaper reports of UPFA deciding to quit the National Government. The Speaker however said he would seek some clarification from the relevant parties on the media reports.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena rising to a point of order said the number of Cabinet Ministers should be limited to 30 in the absence of a National Government as per the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. He pointed out the Cabinet of Ministers numbering to 50 is no longer valid.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella argued that the SLFP could not repudiate the MoU to form a National Government unilaterally.
JO MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said UPFA members in the Government ranks needs to confirm the House that they are still in the National Government. Nanayakkara also rejected the idea that one party in the MoU could not repudiate it without the agreement of the other party.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardena said it was a joke to continue the debate with a non-existing Government. NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa said President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan have no moral right to continue in their positions following the outcome of Local Government Elections. “Sampanthan should hand over the Opposition Leader post to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa,” he added.
JO MP Dullas Allahapperuma said the total number of Cabinet Ministers, Deputy and State Ministers should come down to 70 from current number of 100 as the MoU between the SLFPand the UNP has expired after December 31, 2017. “For seven days now, the country is embroiled in a political crisis. The final results of the LG bodies have been delayed. The rupee is depreciating and the stock market is falling down. We need to resolve these issues soon,” he added.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara said the national level Government needs not to be changed following the results of LG elections. “The national government is an affair between the UNP and the SLFP and if the two parties are willing to continue it, the JO has got nothing to do. The JO, which boasted on displaying the majority support of 113 MPs in Parliament, has been unable to collect at least 13 MPs in Parliament today,” he commented.
The Speaker then proceeded to continue the debate on Code of Conduct for MPs and Standing Orders stating that the matters related to the current political situation could be discussed during the adjournment debate.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was present in the House at the time of the argument.
Speaker shows concern over situation in Maldives
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, in his capacity as the Chair of the Association of the SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians, wrote to Maldivian Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed yesterday regarding the evolving situation in the Maldives.
He pointed out democratic norms and parliamentary practices appear to be in peril in the Maldives at present.
“Recent developments in the Maldives including the declaration of emergency and arrests, and disrespect of the Supreme Court’s rulings, threaten constitutional principles, and undermine the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. The developments also impact negatively on credible and inclusive pre-election processes with the full participation of all political parties in the country. The Association considers the Maldives as an important member in its fold, and is therefore deeply concerned about the current and evolving situation in the country which impacts negatively on the region,” the Speaker said in his letter. He urged the Maldivian Speaker “to prevail upon the relevant authorities in the Maldives including all parties concerned to find peaceful solutions through dialogue that would ensure a functioning Parliament”. He also urged him to “reassure the people of the Maldives that elections will be free and fair and that fundamental, freedoms, democracy, security, stability and prosperity will be guaranteed”.
