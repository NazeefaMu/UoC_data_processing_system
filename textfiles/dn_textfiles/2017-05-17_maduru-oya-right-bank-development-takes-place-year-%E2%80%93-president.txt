Maduru Oya right bank development takes place this year – President

President Maithripala Sirisena said the development work of the right bank of Maduru Oya will be implemented this year.
The President was speaking at the ceremony to offer 10, 000 deeds to the settlers of the Mahaweli C and B zones held on May 15 at the Vilayaya Maha Vidyalaya, Aralaganwila.
The Mahaweli settlers were granted 100,000 deeds under the Livelihood Development Programme by the President.
The President said the government has implemented a large number of mega projects to develop irrigation and agriculture in the country.
President Maithripala said 600 tanks in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, and Trincomalee will be renovated assisted by the Asian Development Bank.
He said the government is now resolving the water issue of the Rajarata people through the Moragahakanda Project - a long term demand of the regional people. “They will not have a water issue after filing the reservoir with water in the Maha Season.” the President said. “The former government spoke about a mega development. But the debt burden of that development has now become a critical problem when taking the country forward,” the President said.
He said the government has implemented a comprehensive development programme to take the country forward by freeing it from the debt burden.
“We will bring in economic development by taking the programme forward rapidly facing any challenge,” he said.
The President said some are dreaming to topple the government. He said some people talk about forming a new government after the May Day rally in Galle Face.
"They observe the rally and by seeing the supporters transported by buses to the Galle Face grounds, think that they can topple the government and it is a joke," the President said.
President Sirisena said he was informed that some people who asked people to hoist black flags when the Indian Premier arrived in Si Lanka, visited him at midnight.
Necessary equipment for the Livelihood Opportunities Development Programme was provided during the event.
Schools and temples were provided with water purification systems and water containers.
The Maha Sangha, religious leaders, Uva Provincial Governor M.P Jayasinghe, Minister Daya Gamage, NCP Chief Minister Peshala Jayarathne, Deputy Minister, Sudarshani Fernandopulle, former minister, P. Dayarathne, Provincial Councillor, Sampath Sri Nishshanka, Ministers and MPs, Mahaweli Authority Director General, and Polonnaruwa District Secretary participated.
