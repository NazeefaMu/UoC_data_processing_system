Disgraced US football star O.J. Simpson to be released from prison

Los Angeles: Disgraced American football star O.J. Simpson, whose racially charged 1995 murder trial riveted the nation, is expected to be released from prison as early as Monday after nine years behind bars for armed robbery.
Simpson, 70, plans to relocate to Florida following his release from the Lovelock Correctional Center, the medium-security prison in Nevada where he has been serving his sentence, said his lawyer, Malcolm LaVergne.
“He is getting very, very excited,” LaVergne told KTNV-TV in Las Vegas. “He’s feeling very upbeat.”
Simpson was granted parole at a hearing in July and his earliest release date was set for October 1. Since that falls on a Sunday, Simpson is expected to be freed no earlier than Monday, according to his lawyer and media reports. Simpson was found not guilty in 1995 of the grisly murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and a male companion, Ron Goldman, in a case that transfixed the country and became known as the “Trial of the Century.”
But the former National Football League running back and actor was sent to prison in 2008 for his role in an armed robbery the previous year of two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas resort. Simpson claimed at his trial that he was just seeking to recover personal items from the dealers and he repeated that explanation at his parole board hearing in July, where the four-member panel voted unanimously for his release.
At that hearing Simpson initially did not express any remorse for his actions but eventually offered that he was “sorry that things turned out the way they did.”
“I had no intent to commit a crime,” he said.
“If I would have made a better judgment back then, none of this would have never happened.”
LaVergne, Simpson’s attorney, told KTNV-TV that the former NFL star planned to relocate to Florida, play golf and be around his friends and family.
LaVergne said he did not anticipate that Simpson would pose any problems. AFP
