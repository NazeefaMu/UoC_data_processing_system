Mrunal on working  with Demi Moore

While Mrunal Thakur is a known face on television – she is known for having played the vibrant Bulbul in ‘Kumkum Bhagya’ (Pinky in ‘Adarei Man Adarei’) - critics have praised her for her film debut in ‘Love Sonia’, where she is seen in a de-glam role. Having been appreciated internationally for its gritty subject on human trafficking, the film now releases on the wide screen across the world.
Mrunal, who plays the title role of a young woman trapped in the notorious sex trade, said she chose this film as a debut for a particular reason. While most young women would prefer to ideally make their big screen debut with a comedy or rom-com, Mrunal defied norms and decided to make it with ‘Love Sonia’ instead. She says that while she always wanted to work in films, she chose this one because it was out of her comfort zone, and she wanted to push her boundaries as an actress.
she was thankful to director Tabrez Noorani for giving her an opportunity to work in the title role with a group of super talented and dedicated people. She said that all her male friends were hugely jealous with the fact that she got a chance to share screen space with Hollywood star Demi Moore.
Mrunal said that to prepare for her role, she had to lose weight, attend workshops, meet women in the flesh trade and adapt their mannerisms. TNN
