London Marathon medalist conducts program on running

Colombo City Running (CCR), a community-based recreational running group which aims to promote and improve running in Colombo, conducted a program for its members with none other than London Marathon Medalist and professional runner Lewis Chalk at the CR & FC grounds recently.
Stafford Garments, one of Sri Lanka’s leading apparel manufacturers were also involved in the program as they came forward to partner with CCR as the CCR clothing partner by providing the T shirts under their brand RBN.
CCR was formed on May 3, 2015 by a single athlete, Omar Alif who sought a community with which to share his passion of running. Stemming from this simple desire, he built up a vision that has since been shared by numerous like-minded athletes based in Colombo.
The group has now evolved into a team that goes beyond recreational running with most members preparing to participate in competitive marathons and other fitness competitions both in Sri Lanka as well as abroad. The program commenced with Lewis Chalk making a presentation on “Preparation for the upcoming Colombo Marathon 2016”.
“We are delighted to be involved with CCR in their endeavors to promote fitness and healthy living, both of which are synonymous with our brand,” said MD Stafford Garments, Shakir Hafeez.
Presently, the majority of the CCR community is preparing for the LSR Colombo Marathon in October 2016 and other international events such as the Penang Marathon in November 2016. “At present our membership comprises 340+ individuals, of which the vast majority are male and female locals and expatriates living in Colombo. Members all share a passion for running, fitness, healthy-living and the outdoors, are professionals working in a range of fields, and span a range of ages. Due to the growing profile of CCR particularly through social media, CCR has also hosted a number of tourists who have a passion for running and exploring new cities”.
