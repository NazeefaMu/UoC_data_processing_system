Illegal sand mining racket busted

Four persons mining sand illegally at night in a prohibited area in the Mahaweli Ganga reserved for the Weragantota Bridge by taking tractors to the riverbed were arrested by Mahiyangana police on July 27.
Police seized two tractors used by the illegal sand miners.
Four others fled the scene, Police said.
Among the arrested is a teacher attached to a leading school in Mahiyangana and a coordinating officer attached to the Mahiyangna UNP Organiser Upali Senaratne.
Investigations revealed that a son of a high official of the Mahiyangana Traders' Association was involved in the racket.
Sand mined in this manner had been hidden in a highly barricaded house in the area with a high wall and iron gates.
Police said several earlier attempts made to arrest the racketeers failed since they had escaped being alerted by their informants along the way.
The schoolteacher and the coordinating officer were released on police bail on July 28 pending legal action.
A police team led by HQI Chandana Wijesekara and Inspector Ruwan Weerakoon conducted the raid directed by Mahiyangana SP Ujith Liyanage.
