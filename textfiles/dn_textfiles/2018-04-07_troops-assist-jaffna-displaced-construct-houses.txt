Troops assist Jaffna displaced to construct houses

The government has made a special arrangement to provide Rs. 400,000 to buy a land and Rs 800,000 to construct a house for each extended family living in Jaffna welfare centers during so many years.
The troops serving in the Jaffna peninsula provided assistance to those who received grants from the government to construct their houses in the Thelippalei area. The assistance by troops gave a great relief to the families to save their money and spend on purchasing building materials.
MP Mavai Senathirajha handed over the houses to the families on April 5. Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake handed over 25 houses constructed by the Army at the Keeramalei area to resettle the displaced persons on March 30.
