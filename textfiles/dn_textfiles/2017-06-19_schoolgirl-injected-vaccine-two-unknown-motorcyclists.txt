Schoolgirl injected vaccine by two unknown motorcyclists

A 10-year-old schoolgirl returning home after attending a nearby tuition class in Peramaduwa on June 17 had a nasty experience when two men on a motorcycle stopped by her side and fled the scene after administering a vaccine to her right arm with a syringe. The girl who informed her parents about it after reaching her house was admitted to the Kantale hospital for a medical examination. She was later transferred to the Trincomalee General Hospital. Agbopura police are investigating.
