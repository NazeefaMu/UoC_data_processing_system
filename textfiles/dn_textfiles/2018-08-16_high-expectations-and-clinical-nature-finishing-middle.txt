High expectations and the clinical nature of finishing in the middle

Greetings rugby islanders and lovable fanatics who religiously follow our union code to all over this sun drenched land we call home.
So it naturally stepped up on expectations scale a few yards shy of 150% ...that the U20 7s team captained by Naveen Heenakan would carry our Lion flag all the way.
On the opposite group defending champions Hong Kong ...making Sri Lanka favourites for the final v HK.
No deckchair expert in their social media mind would dare to contradict or offer believable alternatives.
The class and running quality of the young Sri islanders absolutely clinical and second to none.
In addition to the hugely successful schools coach Nilufer Ibrahim, plus expertise from the vast experience of Fazil Marija. However in all the thinking...little consideration was given to ball retention.
I am guessing that vital component was factored in under running yards and finishing.
The fight and rip good turnover ball ticked off on the list.
Running in big tries against China, Taipei and Singapore...all as anticipated.
The wins not testing our power and physicality and breakdowns.
Alas our natural game skills suffered against the bigger Koreans who out muscled us to win extra time with a sudden death try...that floored our boys in utter disbelief.
A shock result which wiped our half time lead ...with lazy defence and possibly some questions about stamina to finish.
The flight home across the vast ocean .with a bitter taste that’s impossible to wash or spit out.
Playing Singapore for no 3...almost too harsh and slightly beneath us.
Hong Kong champions again seeing off an Sri Lanka inspired Korea...5-0 ...hard graft and a monumental upset, had Korea managed a converted try.
Imagine a heap of murmuring by the brains trust at Sri Lanka rugby HQ, especially the nature of our performance indicators.
Opportunity of this type must be absorbed well.
The thought of becoming Asian rugby 7s champions again...taken by warm ocean...lapping our island shores.
August is certainly a month of meticulous prep for 3 leg Asian 7s series.
Both men and women stepping up September in Hong Kong, then to South Korea early October and concluding in Sri Lanka for medals and final rankings.
Men are 4th from 2017...Looking at top 2 for sure.
The .women are 6 and starring down the barrel at 4 or 3.
Must quietly mention in passing as a quick free kick....tap taken...that the team scaled up from 12 to no. 5 and Plate champions 2 years running with the white shark...plus heaps of burgees and lots of barking.
The tactics worked and we shocked ARFU 7s series 2 years running.
Many thanks to Asanga Seneviratne, president Sri Lanka rugby, Colonel Dhammika Gunasek..chairman women’s rugby...plus the Sri Lanka Army...Navy...and Air Force...for all the players.
A remarkable and hugely laudable fact that supports this Olympic sport in its entirety.
Were it not for the sterling effort by the Service Commanders ..women’s rugby would be on the endangered list.
From August to December Asian rugby steps up its annual 7s calendar...and I am almost sounding like an old pedigree...dog, barking across the vast ocean.....this is Sri Lanka best opportunity, at all national grades to stamp our class and secure rankings.
I am hoping my bark and pride still potent enough to hits its mark.
Blessings for more.
Bula, bula 7s and Sri Api.
