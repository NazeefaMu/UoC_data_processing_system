Embrace your green thumb!

Did you know that getting your hands dirty can help your bill of health stay clean? This National Gardening Week, we’re exploring the health benefits of gardening for seniors and how this hobby can enhance your life. Here are five physical and emotional ways that embracing your green thumb is good for you:
1. Encourages physical movement
Perhaps without even knowing it, you perform a host of healthy exercises in a single gardening session, including squatting, lifting, and pushing. In fact, a study conducted by the American Society for Horticultural Science found that just 30 minutes of gardening fulfills all physical activity recommendations for seniors. Thanks to the wide variety of movements, gardening is a healthy form of both aerobic and strength-building exercise. While gardening, be careful not to go beyond any exercise limits you have discussed with your doctor. If bending over or kneeling on the ground isn’t for you, consider a raised garden instead.
2. Provides a natural source of vitamin D
Vitamin D, the “sunshine vitamin,” has several health benefits for the body, particularly for metabolic functions and skeletal health. Spending time in the sun when gardening allows your body to synthesize this healthy nutrient naturally. However, use caution when exposing yourself to the sun. Protect yourself from burns and dehydration with plenty of high-quality sunscreen on any exposed skin, a wide-brimmed hat, and fluids to stay hydrated.
3. Reduces stress and boosts your mood
The positive emotional health benefits of gardening are well-documented. An analysis of twenty-two different studies uncover a link between gardening and reduced anxiety and depression. It also decreases levels of cortisol, the “stress hormone.” And while sunlight and exercise are certainly a factor in this, there’s another fascinating reason involved. Soil itself appears to contain bacteria that acts as an antidepressant! Exposure to that bacteria through contact with the soil and consuming your home-grown produce can elevate your mood and make you feel good.
4. Offers new social opportunities
Nurturing social relationships is shown to have significant effects on mental and physical health. Research shows that adults who socialize enjoy better health and live longer than their isolated peers. Where better to build relationships than in the garden? Community gardens provide a common purpose, a space for meeting and interacting with old and new friends, and the satisfaction of beautifying your neighborhood and growing nutritious food together.
5. Keeps your mind sharp
Experts found that daily gardening can lower the risk of dementia by up to 36%. From problem-solving to sensory awareness, spending time with your hands in the earth involves many cognitive functions that can keep your brain sharp.
