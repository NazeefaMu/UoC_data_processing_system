Gampola gripped with tension following twin abductions

Two abductions reported in Gampola within a week have caused tension among residents in the area. A two-and a half-year-old boy and his uncle had been abducted by unidentified persons as they were walking towards a shop at circular road beside the Gampola Bus stand on May 3 afternoon, according to a complaint made to the Gampola Police.
The boy is named Mohamed Salman and his uncle Abdul Raheem Nizam. The complaint was made by the boy’s father Mohamed Rishaf following a telephone call received by him around 3.30 pm informing him about it.
Rishaf had stated in the complaint that Nizam was his nephew resident in Badulla and he had come to his house to attend a medical clinic at the Kandy hospital on May 4. When Nizam volunteered to take noon meals to their shop the boy too had wanted to accompany him. Another abduction of two persons was reported in Gampola one week ago and these abductions have caused tension among the people in Gampola.
