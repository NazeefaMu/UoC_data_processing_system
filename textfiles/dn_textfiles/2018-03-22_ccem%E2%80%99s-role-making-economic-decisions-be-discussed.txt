CCEM’s role in making economic decisions to be discussed

The President has agreed to discuss the role of the Prime Minister’s Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) in making economic decisions in the country, said Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, yesterday.
The President had earlier asked that the CCEM be abolished and that all economic policies be decided through the President’s National Economic Council (NEC), which the Prime Minister is also a part of.
“The problem here was that every paper, before being sent to the Cabinet, went through the CCEM and even I did not like the fact that many of my papers were stuck there because of the workload,” explained Minister Senaratne, addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department.
“Even if you need to build a hospital, it would go there,” added the Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister.
The Minister stated that they had proposed that the CCEM only deal with mega development projects and have Cabinet projects, which need further studying, directed to them rather than them approving everything.
He indicated that the Prime Minister had agreed to this proposal.
The President, he revealed, has submitted a Cabinet paper on the CCEM on Tuesday (20) and agreed to come to terms with the Prime Minister on the CCEM in the near future.
