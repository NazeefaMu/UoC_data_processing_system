When LIYANAGE  the boxing  ‘black panther’  floored an Euro champ

He was one of Sri Lanka's top class pugilists entering the ring and showing breath taking power, superb footwork, style and throwing punches that could floor opponents. It was as if they were pole axed. That was SUMITH LIYANAGEi in action.
Boxing in the 1960s ‘70s and ‘80s was at its pinnacle and it was the era when the sport brought into the spotlight some devastating boxers from the schools, clubs and the services - Police, Air Force, Navy and Army and many clubs. Many were the tournaments held and the interest in boxing was at fever pitch. In the club scene the tournaments that attracted great interest were the Clifford Cup and the Layton Cup and in the schools roped square was the eagerly looked forward to Stubbs Shield.
Star class boxers
That era also produced boxers who were star class and boxed for the country in many international meets and stood up to their more experienced opponents and slugged it toe to toe giving or asking no quarter.Names of those legends that come to mind are the Obeysekeras, Alberts, Handunges, the Bulners, VanCuylenbergs, De Kauwes, Pereiras, Jaroofs, Marzooks, Karunaratnes and Lewkes and the Ekanayakes. Also boxers who sprung up were SUMITH LIYANAGE and Dharmasiri Weerakoon from the Police. This column in going down memory lane of boxing will want start with SUMITH LIYANAGE. Tall, quick coiled like a viper he was a treat to watch when gloved up and fighting any opponent. He schooled at Nalanda and was a versatile sportsman – cricketer, Olympic boxer and pistol shooter.
Sub Inspector
After his schooling he joined the Police as a Sub Inspector and had all the opportunities to further his boxing career which sport was his first love. He kept himself fit as a fiddle and fighting in many local meets and winning earned his slot in the Sri Lanka team to the Rome Olympics in 1960. After excelling in local boxing meets he was an automatic choice to glove for the country and his most cherished and memorable moment was when he was picked to box for the country at the Rome Olympics in 1960.
That Sri Lankan Olympic team comprised – Linus Dias (Captain, athletics – long distance), Maurice Coomaravel, (cycling), Tony Williams (swimming) SUMITH LIYANAGE (Boxing), W.A.Dharmasiri (boxing) and the team manager was Darley Ingleton.
Roped square
It is the dream of every sportsman or woman to sport the Sri Lanka colours at the Olympic Games.
This dream became a reality for LIYANAGE who earned his slot with some excellent success in the roped square.
LIYANAGE took wing confident and believing in himself and his highly talented boxing prowess. Aptly tagged the ‘Black Panther’ and boxing in the style of that World Boxing Champion Floyd Patterson, LIYANAGE was down to meet the reigning European Featherweight Champion Jerzi Adamsky of Poland. Adamsky being an European champion did not bother LIYANAGE. On the contrary it made him more tough and determined and was confident that he could floor his much hyped opponent.
Lethal punches
After the introductory ceremony ended and when the bell rang, LIYANAGE moved panther-like and circled his opponent not caring about his opponent’s abilities and fame, began to throw punches that were lethal and stunned his opponent.
LIYANAGE was an expert of landing one-two punches with lightning speed and he did so and with a stunning upper cut that had Adamsky on the canvass. That was a moment of glory for the Lankan.
Buoyed by having the champion down, complacency apparently set in and that moment of ecstasy brought about his downfall because he was not connecting with his usual devastating punches in the rounds that followed and Adamsky who recovered from that early knock down began connecting with his punches that brought him the vital points to finally earn the verdict in his favour.
Boxed beautifully
LIYANAGE who boxed beautifully burst into tears when the verdict was announced because he was so near and yet so far from bringing honour to his country. Every time I run into the ‘Black Panther’ he recalls that moment when he allowed complacency get the better of him that led to his defeat. He has no regrets but cherishes the moment when he floored the European champion.
LIYANAGE represented Nalanda College boxing in the Stubbs Shield from 1955 to 1957 and won many of his bouts. His coach in school was the clever D.C.A. Wickremasinghe who taught him all the tricks of the boxing trade. The win he achieved against Percy Khatau of India in the tri-nation contest between India, Pakistan and Ceylon as one of his most memorable moments. He also boxed for the country in the South East Asian Boxing championships.
Surprising defeat
One fight in the local arena that LIANAGE remembers well was when he surprisingly lost to police constable Mahagedera. However in a rematch that followed LIYANAGE gained sweet revenge avenging that defeat.
However the most memorable moment LIYANAGE remembers was when he was fortunate to fight in the same ring of the 1960 Olympics which saw the late great Muhammed Ali then known as Cassius Clay fight on which helped him win the gold medal and launch him rocket like to stardom and finally end up as the greatest boxer the world had seen.
LIYANAGE watched Ali boxing and seeing the Kentucky kid in action predicted that one day the handsome Ali would rule and take the boxing world by storm the manner, the style, the dexterity and the superb and stylish and devastating punches he landed on all his opponents to win gold.
Autobiography
Ali reveals in his autobiography that when he was refused entry into a white only restaurant in anger and frustration he threw the gold medal into the Ohio River.
In the police in addition to his prowess LIYANAGE with the gloves he shone in cricket and pistol shooting and went on to win a silver medal in pistol shooting at the World Police Games Adelaide, Australia.
LIYANAGE joined the Police as a Sub Inspector and retired as Deputy Inspector General in 1996. He was easy going, popular and a honest and respected police officer.
After hanging up his gloves he took to administering boxing and served as vice president of the Amateur Boxing Association. He also served as manager of many boxing teams.President Mithripala Sirisena who gives honour where honour is due recently invited all Olympians and presented them with gold coins. The 'BLACK PANTHER' was also a recipient. LIYANAGE was one of best boxer’s produced by the country and will no doubt remain a ‘SPORTS LEGEND.’
