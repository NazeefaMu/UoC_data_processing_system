MR calls for removal of "hostile provisions" in UNHRC draft resolution

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a statement said that the draft resolution on Sri Lanka tabled before the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has "hostile provisions" and called for the removal of them.
"If the government is going to accept this resolution and allow it to pass by consensus, then they should ensure that the hostile provisions are removed and the resolution is brought into line with the people's expectations', he added.
Highlighting operational paragraphs 1, 4, 6 and 8, Rajapaksa said they run contrary to the expectations that the government has generated among the people by claiming that the draft resolution has been 'watered down' in Sri Lanka's favour.
Rajapaksa said that when the resolution was under discussion, the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Geneva had formally requested the sponsors not to place primary emphasis on alleged war crimes issues and to change their approach in consideration for the new government of Sri Lanka."However, the sponsors of the resolution have not heeded that request" he added.
