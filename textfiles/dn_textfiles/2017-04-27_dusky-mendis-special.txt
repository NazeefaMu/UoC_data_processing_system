Dusky Mendis Special

 Looking every inch like a West Indian mauler, dusky DULEEP MENDIS was hot property in the 1970s and ‘80s. His power packed dazzling magic electrified the field. With the willow he blundgeond bowlers local and international whether they be spin or pace with "Eveready Power and Swiss watch timing" that had spectators flocking to venues where he was in action to savour his magic. And rarely did he disappoint his schools St.Sebastian’s College Moratuwa or S.Thomas College, Mount Lavinia his team, club SSC, workplace Maharaja Organization or country. Runs flowed from his willow like the Mahaweli in spate. He was stockily built with a powerful muscular body and when he hit the ball it stayed hit. Any fielders daring to stop it did so at his own peril --- the risks included having damaged fingers or hands. The ball would race to the boundary boards or over it like a guided missile. I have played with and against him and could vouch for his power play.
MENDIS had all the shots in the book. Although short in stature, he could play the hook shot if the ball is reachable. After serving his term playing in the Sri Lanka team, the captaincy was not long in coming and when it did come he made it memorable one by leading the country to its first Test victory over India at the P. Sara Stadium.
First to score twin centuries
MENDIS was the first Sri Lankan batsman to score twin centuries and that was against India in Chepauk, Madras in 1982. He made the identical score of 105 in both innings. Mendis had the opportunity of scoring twin centuries at the Holy Land of cricket Lord’s in England. After making 111 in the first and when on 94 in the second innings, he had a sudden rush of blood and attempting to hoist Ian Botham for six dollied a catch. It was sad to see him go, but that is what the game is all about and that is why it is called at times game full of glorious uncertainties . MENDIS was lucky to survive a nasty incident in the 1975 World Cup in England when a vicious delivery from Australia‘s pace merchant Jeff Thomson hit him on the head. It was a delivery pitched short of length which sprung cobra like to strike him. It was life threatening, but thank god he survived. That was the era when Thomson and Lillee were making batsmen shake in the knees with vicious fast bowling. Once MENDIS put aside his bat he took to coaching and was in charge of the national team at one time. It was when he was manager of the team that Sri Lanka won the 1995/’96 World Cup in Lahore, Pakistan which sent the country into raptures. He was also Chief Executive of Sri Lanka Cricket under the chairmanship of Jayantha Dharmadasa for a short while and did a wonderful job using his tremendous experience in the game. His brother Gerald was also an excellent batsman and would have made it big time, but his job at Air Lanka did not allow him time to further concentrate on the game. Gerald was my team mate at Saracens Cricket Club.
Lot of leatner chasing
Mendis was a batsman opponents wanted out earlier. To let him ride was to do a lot of leather chasing while he reigned. An incident is still vivid in my memory. In the good old days the local cricket DERBY was the game between SSC and NCC. In an earlier article I had mentioned what a wonderful captain Michael Tissera was. And here’s another instance to confirm that. In that game against SSC Tissera was captaining NCC. Now MENDIS had a weakness against the ball pitched short of a length and on leg stump level. When MENDIS walked out to bat he was given a rousing welcome by the SSC supporters who were awaiting a fireworks display from MENDIS. Tissera crowded MENDIS with an attacking field knowing that the youngster would be all nerves and positioning himself at silly mid on. Tissera got his pace bowler Vernon Caldera to pitch short of a length on leg stump. After a couple of deliveries Caldera pitched right , MENDIS poked his bat from the crease without moving his feet and the ball ballooned off MENDIS’ bat and Tisssera gobbled the catch to the joy of his team and disappointment of the SSC fans. MENDIS failed to score that was due to Tissera’s astute and strategic captaincy. MENDIS had the ability to draw crowds where ever he played. At the wicket he was always excitement personified. I first saw him as a schoolboy cricketer at St.Sebastian’s when he made a scintillating half century against my old school St.Benedict’s at Kotahena. After watching that knock I predicted a very bright future for him in the game and did he not oblige.
Successful batsman and captain
MENDIS after a successful run as batsman and captain at school he joined the school by the sea STCML and like the breeze by the sea, he continued his breezy batting also captaining the team and having the rare honour of captaining two schools. In the 1971 and ’72 Royal-Thomian big games he scored centuries. In ’71 he made an unbeaten 103 and in the next year put the Royal bowlers to the sword pulverizing and slamming a big 184. Another anecdote and it goes like this. Duleep’s father was Julian and mother Doreen. Julian played for St.Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa and a team mate was the famous Acupuncturist Professor Anton Jayasuriya. Jayasuriya was a dear friend of mine. According to Jayasuriya who was the opening bowler while surveying the field before reaching his run up, he had noticed Duleep’s father chatting to a lady on the fine leg boundary. Jayasuriya ran up and bowled a bouncer which the batsman mis-hooked and Duleep’s father spilt the catch. Jayasuriya was furious. When the team reached the pavilion, Jayasuriya had slapped Duleep’s father and chided him saying – ‘you lost concentration and grassed the catch because you were chatting to a spectator’. The offence brought a two match suspension on Jayasuriya. According to another dear friend of mine doctor J.C. Duraisingham who was a Director of Sport and a batch mate, Jayasuriya was known as ‘kara’ at Medical College because he was always unafraid and unbowed and into trouble always with his hot temper.
But MENDIS --always delivered his type of Special. A 'Special' that cricketing connoisseurs would like to imbibe in for the thrill of all the blood rushing , adrenaline pumping excitement that he brought to the wicket.
