‘Solar energy to take over future electricity generation’

Solar energy is to become the “go to” energy source in Sri Lanka in future for electricity generation, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said yesterday.
He said Power and Energy authorities will visit Pooneryn next week to work over the area for the construction of what would be the largest solar power project in the country.
The project in Pooneryn is to generate 800 Megawatts of power. The minister said moves are afoot by the ministry to accelerate and sustain public- private partnerships in solar energy.
the Cabinet has approved a proposal to build a hybrid energy park of 1,040 Megawatts in Pooneryn where the 800 Megawatt solar power plant would be built side by side with a 240 Megawatt wind power plant, said Minister Siyambalapitiya.
This is in line with the government policy to add a considerable amount of electricity to the national grid through renewable energy sources, said the Ministry’s Development Director Sulakshana Jayawardena.
“All in all, steps will be taken by the ministry to promote the use of solar power throughout the country. The Private sector is expected to play a prominent role in promoting solar panels for future domestic use,” the minister said.
Meanwhile, moves are afoot by the ministry to call for offers from local and international solar power producers. Siyambalapitiya said open tenders would be called in August for the construction of the solar power plant in Pooneryn, he explained. “There is a good chance that we could be able to reduce the price of a unit of electricity through the use of solar energy. A unit of solar energy could be purchased between Rs. 12.10 and Rs 23. 10 he added. "The most important thing is that we get the infrastructure and facilities built for the purpose, he said.”
Asked if the ministry has acquired lands for the construction work, Siyambalapitiya said that they have identified the lands.
“They are state lands. Therefore I do not expect that we have a hard task in acquiring them,” he pointed out. “We have got to find independent power producers to build the transmission system and necessary infrastructure,” he said. “A project like this could do a lot of good for the people who live in the North. It stands to produce job opportunities. The people will get new roads and communication facilities. It will boost their economies too,” he said.
