Casio genuine watches available in Sri Lanka

Casio wrist watches are world renowned as iconic timepieces which offer reliability and style for users worldwide. However, a problem faced by Casio watch lovers in many countries is buying a genuine watch in a market flooded by fakes.
Understanding this need of the customer, Blink International (Pvt) Ltd., Official Distributer for Casio watches and related accessories in Sri Lanka, has now presented the widest range of Casio watches available in the market to the Sri Lankan customer.
The Casio range of watches are now available at 15 locations including Cool Planet, ABBA, Nastars and Haamaa in Negombo and will hopefully expand to another 50 locations island wide by July 2017.
The extensive range of Casio watches distributed by the company includes the internationally popular G-Shock, Edifice, Sheen, Protrek, Enticer and Youth brands. To complement the reliable performance of Casio watches with a matching after-sales support, Blink International has taken steps to open a Casio Authorized Wrist Watch Service Center at Galle Face by mid February 2017.
Mohamed Mansoor Director at Blink International emphasized that customers should exercise caution when purchasing Casio watches in the market to avoid being duped by fakes. They should insist on the green warranty card duly signed and sealed by the dealer.
Blink International (Pvt) Ltd., the official distributer and importer of genuine Casio watches, is a fully owned subsidiary company of Rainco (Pvt) Ltd, the leading manufacturer of quality Umbrellas, Mosquito Nets and Rainwear in Sri Lanka.
The company was formed by a group of passionate watch enthusiasts to cater to the fast growing segment of price conscious watch wearers who want a stylish and reliable watch at a price affordable to them.
