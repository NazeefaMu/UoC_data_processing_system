Nearly 50 dengue deaths in 2018

A total of 47,013 dengue cases and around 50 deaths have been reported from all parts of the country this year up to December 14, the Epidemiology Unit said.
According to the sources, the highest number of dengue cases, 9,259 had been reported from the Colombo district, while the second highest number, 5, 212 had been reported from the Gampaha district. The third highest number of dengue cases, 4,671had been reported from the Batticaloa district. The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported 2,307 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded 6,952 dengue cases.
The total number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province is 17,301, Epidemiologists said. Meanwhile, medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without trying home remedies.
All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school. All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All the other medications, especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen cause dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) which can be fatal, they said. People should keep their premises free of dengue mosquito breeding sites(water harbouring places) during the rainy season in order to prevent spread of dengue. Even water retained in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed, they added.
