‘Singer Got Talent – Season 3’ concludes

Singer Sri Lanka recently displayed that the company has a large number of employees with outstanding performing skills when ‘Singer Got Talent’ Season 3 was held at Bishops College Auditorium to an enthusiastic in-house audience cheering their team-mates.
It was a clear demonstration of how Singer encourages its personnel to enjoy a healthy work-life balance and follow their dreams. Employees representing Singer Group participated in the dazzling event.
This was the third time that the employees at all Singer business units were able to showcase their talents that ranged from singing and dancing to playing various instruments. Some of the participants joined hands with other employees to perform duets or group items while some performed solo.
The event not only recognized the gifted employees, it provided an opportunity to boost employee engagement and reiterate that indeed, Singer Sri Lanka is ‘a great place to work.’ The Company has been recognized by the Great Place to Work Institute as a top 20 workplace for three consecutive years.
Singer Group CEO Asoka Pieris commented “We take great pride in encouraging our employees to reach their full potential by creating an environment that motivates them to develop and demonstrate their individual talents and capabilities.”
Months of preparation culminated in the Grand Finale of Season 3 when the winners were announced. Umanga Jayaweera in the Administration Department won the Solo Singing Category.
The Solo Dancing Category was clinched by Sathya Garusinghe in HR who joined the company recently and explained why it meant a lot for her to win.
The Singing Duet winners were Upul Fernando and Dilanka Nishadi from the Singer Factory.
Chanaka Prabath who played the accordion won the Instrument Category. He had started playing the accordion only six months ago and this indeed was a tremendous achievement.
The ‘C-Sharp’ band from Regnis Factory added lively colour to the event. The group of ten members was formed in 2015 in time for Singer Got Talent Season 1 when they first performed in front of a large audience and have been performing at all the subsequent Seasons.
