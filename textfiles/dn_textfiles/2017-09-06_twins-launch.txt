The Twins launch

Foremost Books launched its publication ‘The Twins’ a story by Ananda Liyanage at the National Library and Documentation Services Board Auditorium recently under the patronage of Anoja Weerasinghe.
Ananda Liyanage has as up to now authored four novels: The Legacy, The Deception, The Vengeance, The Prophecy in addition to a collection of detective short stories Adventures of Rudra an Investigator, a textbook Mechanics of International Trade and a brief biographical essay Reminiscences & Reflections. All books have been translated into Sinhala. He is currently working on his sixth story.
‘The Twins’ commences with the return to Spain of a republican fighter, after the death of Franco, who took refuge in France at the end of the civil war. Upon his return to his home in Tarragona he identifies a Gestapo official who was probably responsible for his brother’s death while in Gestapo captivity in occupied France. Afterwards he identifies the Gestapo official obtaining the help of a fellow republican fighter to do so.
At their wits end what to do next they seek help from an institution in Paris specialising in capturing fleering Nazis. The institution investigators find the strange event that the suspect took charge of a woman from a monastery who subsequently gave birth to twins a boy and a girl.
This leads to the involvement of the Israelis after the Paris based institution suspects a much larger and sinister motive behind the activities of the Nazis. Meanwhile the suspect goes to Argentina and joins forces with the elder twin. He first goes to Buenos Aires and then to Ushuaia at the southern tip of the South American continent closely followed by the pursuers.
He is traced to a facility in Antarctica where the Nazis have been developing a vengeance weapon of unparalleled proportion.
Having found the facility abandoned the pursuers follow the quarry from Antarctica to the Mediterranean across the Atlantic not fully aware of the extent of the plan but only of a vague suspicion of its intent.
Meanwhile the other twin while on holiday in Nepal meets an Englishman who is the BBC representative in Katmandu.
They fall in love while on a trek to the Everest base camp.
Known only to a few people he is also the MI6 representative in Nepal. She displays her dancing skills one night at the hotel restaurant with him as a partner when she receives a request to dance the flamenco from a guest.
Later the guest provides startling revelation of the activities of her brother. She hurriedly plans her departure home but a last minute confession from her lover leads to his accompanying her.
At home she finds her brother and step father in the company of another man at their home.
Meanwhile the investigations at MI6 headquarters leads her lover to undertake a trip to Cornwall in search of an answer to a 30 year old riddle.
A final confrontation between brother and sister takes place in the sand of Tarragona’s famed Roman Amphitheater. The reappearance of the dinner guest from Katmandu lays to rest the unanswered questions.
The concluding chapter is a recap of the whole riddle from the moment a Gestapo official receives instructions, in the Berlin bunker in the dying days of Hitler’s 1000 year Reich, to carry out a plan to seek vengeance on the victors of the war to its final outcome three decades later.
