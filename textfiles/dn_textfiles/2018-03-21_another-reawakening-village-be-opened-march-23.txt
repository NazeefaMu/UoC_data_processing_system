Another Reawakening Village to be opened on March 23

The 50th of the 595 ‘Reawakening Villages’ under construction will be vested with the public on March 23, Housing and Development Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
“There are thousands of families who have housing issues,” the Minister said.
Minister Premadasa was speaking at a ceremony to hand over two houses constructed with the help of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka to the families of late G.Munsinghe, who served as the Awissawella Magistrate and to Gamini Balasuriya who served as a judge for over 20 years.
The houses valued at Rs.3,500,000 each have been constructed under the ‘Sayurapura’ housing programme at Moratuwa.
“By year 2025, we plan to provide shelter to every family in the country under the ‘Samata Sewana’ project,” the Minister further said.
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, Bar Association of Sri Lanka president U.R.De Silva, Colombo Bar Association Chairman Jagath Wikramanayake and several other senior members of the Bar Association were present.
