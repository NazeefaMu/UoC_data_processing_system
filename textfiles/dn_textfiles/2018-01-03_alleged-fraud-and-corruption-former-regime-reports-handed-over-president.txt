Alleged fraud and corruption by former regime: Reports handed over to President

Reports concerning 17 cases of serious fraud and corruption that had taken place during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s regime compiled by the Presidential Commission to Inquire and Investigate into Serious Acts of Fraud and Corruption (PRECIFAC), will be forwarded to the Attorney General and the Bribery or Corruption Commission, a reliable source said.
The reports would be forwarded to these two institutes after these reports are examined by the President.
Further action on a report compiled by the PRECIFAC, with recommendations on financial corruption and fraud prevention too would be taken as well, the source said. PRECIFAC handed over the reports of 17 cases of serious fraud and corruption that took place during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s regime to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
