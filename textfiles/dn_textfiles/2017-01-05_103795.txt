People’s Bank unveils CDM,ATM Kiosk at head office

People's Bank launched its Self Banking Center with CDM/ATM/Kiosks in seven locations in Colombo district, to provide seamless transactions to customers.
The facility will empower customers to conduct most banking functions at the Self Banking Centre without having to enter the branch itself. The launch of the Self Banking Centre closely follows the recent unveiling of the new People’s Bank logo which reflects the forward momentum of the bank towards green banking.

The CEO operating the new CDM
People's Bank CEO and General Manager, N. Vasantha Kumar, said People’s Bank is in the midst of mobilising revolutionary banking technology to empower the people of the nation and the launch of CDM/ATM/Kiosks in the new Self Banking Centre embodies the dedication to uplift citizens to next generation banking technology.
"Our new logo reflects our customer centric focus and we believe the launch of the new electronic banking technology further meets people’s aspirations to be in line with global trends, thereby reveling in convenience, value addition, reliability and confidence to improve the quality of their daily lives.
As a bank of the people, we are pioneers in the sector and are confident of sustaining our leadership in the digital era too. Similar state-of-the-art Self Help Banking Centres have been rolled out to 7 locations., with the bold vision to reach the 100 Self Help Banking Centre mark over the 2017 year. People’s Bank has a 16 million account base and an almost 14 million customer base, which portrays how many people’s lives will be enhanced and influenced positively with this latest technology.”
The touch screen CDM/ATM/Kiosks will be accessible 24 hours in the day, for 365 days in the year, further enhancing convenience for customers and putting them in control of where, when and how they would like to conduct their banking needs. The CDM even enables utility bill payments by cash apart from facilitating cash deposits and balance enquiry.
The ATM, apart from offering standard features, also offers cardless cash withdrawals and cash advances on credit cards, modified to better suit customer needs. Bill Payment is facilitated directly over the account by the CDM and the Kiosk, with real time update facility for customers over the new CDM.
