Debate on new Constitution postponed

The debate on the new Constitution has been postponed till mid February, a member of the Steering Committee said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the main reason for the postponement was that the SLFP demanded more time to study the draft interim report on the new Constitution.
He said the Steering Committee was of the view that it was useless to have the debate before the interim report is tabled in the Constitutional Assembly.
“The Steering Committee met on Thursday mainly to inquire into the official positions of the SLFP and JVP on the draft interim report.
“The JVP did not turn up whereas the SLFP wanted more time to study it.Accordingly, it was decided to have back to back meetings of the Steering Committee during the Parliament sittings week starting from January 23. The three day debate which initially scheduled from January 9 will be taken up in mid February,” he said.
Meanwhile, National Dialogue Minister Mano Ganesan, who is a member of the Steering Committee, said a set of minority party proposals to the new Constitution would be submitted collectively by the TPA, SLMC, ACMC and EPDP.
In a Twitter message on Thursday, he said their proposals would be on power devolution, national anthem, language, religion, territorial integrity, electoral reforms and the Presidency. He said the TNA and minority parties were not happy that the debate on Constitutional reforms being postponed.
“The SLFP/UPFA and any other party serious about the new Constitution and addressing the national issue once and for all should come with their proposals on or before February 10,” the minister said.
The Joint Opposition has also forwarded a 14 point proposal to the Steering Committee. The 14 points include that the foremost place be accorded to Buddhism and the unitary state and sovereignty of the country should be re-affirmed in the new Constitution.
