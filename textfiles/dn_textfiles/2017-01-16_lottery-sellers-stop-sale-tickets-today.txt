Lottery sellers to stop sale of tickets from today

Lottery ticket dealers will stop selling lottery tickets for five days from because the promises made to them by President Maithripala Sirisena had not been met.
The All Island Lottery Dealers Association (AILDA) President Krishan Marambe said the government had failed to address their demands as promised.
The lottery dealers protested about the price increase of a lottery ticket from Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 from the day the Budget proposal was announced. They complained that they were unable to sell lottery tickets at the new price, while their sales too have already decreased by 40 percent. They lamented that they were unable to trust the government further and would halt the sale of lottery tickets from today for five days, he added.
