With poise and elegance

The Kingsbury high tea monthly fashion show featuring a vibrant collection by ‘Anouki’ was held on June 2 at The Gourmet Station. The collection featured some elegant designs by the young designer. The event received a good turn out as the high tea buffet at The Kingsbury delivered great flavours and variety. Pictures by Prishan Pandithage Studios
