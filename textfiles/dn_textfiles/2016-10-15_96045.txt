Jason Dissanayake out of Asia Rugby Sevens

Sri Lanka’s cracking forward Jason Dissanayake will miss the Asia Rugby Seven’s series tournament starting today after injuring a hamstring at practice yesterday.
Havelocks SC and Sri Lanka Sevens player and centre Hirantha Perera, who was overlooked from the 12-man squad will replace Dissanayake.
“It’s really unfortunate to lose Jason in this crucial tournament, but I am glad that Hirantha who is an equally good player is available for us to replace Jason,” said selection committee chairman Michael Jayasekara.
