Coastal erosion spikes in Tangalle

Coastal erosion has increased at an alarming rate in Tangalle, with several houses, hotels and other cafeterias on the verge of being consumed by the sea. Coconut estates had also been destroyed by the phenomenon.
Residents said that coastal erosion had increased due to unauthorised constructions. Requests had been made to the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department to set up breakwaters to resolve the issue, but no action had been taken so far, restaurant owners in the area said.
