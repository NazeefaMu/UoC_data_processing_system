Birth of hate politics

UNP manifesto at 1953 Parliamentary elections, referring to the highly subsidized rice ration of two measures [aprx 2 kilos] per week, per person at 25 cents a measure stated, ‘as long as Sun and Moon exists it will remain intact’ –They won comfortably. 1952/53 financial year saw depleted foreign reserves; a severe economic crisis followed; catalysing the crisis was the end of Korean War boom; government was forced to impose unkind cutback in subsidies.
The alien term ‘HARTAL’ meaning strike action, was first engaged during the Indian freedom movement in which Leaders of LSSP participated in early 1940s. Four young Marxist, who spoke against ‘Imperialist’s world war II’ were imprisoned by colonial rulers. Dr. NM Perera, Dr. Colvin R de Silva, Philip Gunawardene and Edmond Samarakkody who broke jail and escaped to India, borrowed the concept from the Indians and on return they introduced it to Sri Lanka. A mass protest campaign which stipulates closing of shops and factories, work stoppage, transport strikes, or virtual abstinence from all engagements. The movement involved demonstrations against an illegal, irregular, or unacceptable decisions by a government that affects a large section of oppressed masses. On August 12, 1953 leftist parties declared a Hartal.
History of rice-subsidy
“Economic and social programme should not be hampered because the nation pass through a depression. If properly thought-out budgetary proposals on a long-term basis are contemplated, this situation will not arise…” J R Jayewardene, the brilliant fiscal and economic planner, presenting the first budget in 1947
- Hansard; Dec. 1, 1947: Col 421.
The Cabinet’s decision to deceive the masses eventually boomeranged on JR, the Minister of Finance, damaging his reputation as an expert fiscal manager. In 1953 it became a huge drain on nation’s economy; the shortfall rose to unmanageable magnitude. Concluding his budget speech on July 23, 1953, the minister said, “…solution lay in elimination of overall deficit…, but it was not possible to take this step without removing as well the subsidy on food”.
- Hansard-23/07/53: Col. 807
All citizens, irrespective of their economic standings were given two measures at prices far below that of prices paid to Thai, Burmese, and Korean suppliers. Government withdrew it with simultaneous trimming down of several welfare measures. The rapid falling of prices of traditional exports in international markets made bridging the budget deficit a formidable task. Within a month, the anticipated deficit rose many fold; the rice ration accounted for 70% of the budget deficit, pruning the subsidy became inevitable.
The socially insensitive government blundered by attempting to do it in one stroke—making a substantial rise from 25 to 70 cents a measure. The masses responded positively to leftists call for Hartal.
Cabinet on board Warship declares Martial Law
On August 12, in Waskaduwa, close to Kalutara, rails and fish plates were detached in railway line; sleepers were ragged up; telephone posts were toppled in many areas. Wooden sleepers set on fire bringing trains in the Southern line to a halt for a few days. Train compartments were uncoupled from the engines preventing operations on Main lines. Passenger transport services were disrupted by stoning in several places making the owners withdraw their services. [there were no CTB buses then]. Main roads had been blocked by placing logs from cut down trees across them. Rioters even used explosives to damage small bridges. As the protest turned out to be an aggressive mass uprising that spread to places where there were LSSP-CP strongholds, a panic-stricken Cabinet sought refuge in British Warship HMS Newfoundland docked in Colombo Port.
On the same day, and within hours top defense officials were summoned on board the British warship for an emergency session, where it was decided to bring all affected districts under Martial law. Under emergency regulations a twenty four- hour curfew was imposed. The government authorized the armed forces to use fire-power to suppress the rioting, though a painful decision for the 41 year-old Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake, who reluctantly placed his signature on the document.
UNP leadership’s, [JRJ’s] insensitivity to social anxiety was quite obvious as the proposals, in addition to withdrawal of rice ration included, increased sugar tax, train fares and postal rates hike; removal of free midday-meal to school children. JR’s antagonists in the UNP launched an anti-JR movement days before the passing of the proposals, a slogan was created, ‘A move by JRJ to make Dudley unpopular. ’
‘TRINE’, the political tabloid carried a Headline on April 19, 1953— “Conspiracy to oust Prime Minister”.
The Hartal was called by the Marxist/Trotskyites of the traditional left, LSSP, CP [Communist] and Philip Gunawardane’s group the VLSSP. It was led by Dr. N M Perera, Dr. S A Wickramasinghe, Dr. Colvin R de Silva, Pieter Keunamen, Philip and Robert Gunawardane brothers, and Edmond Samrakkody, most of them were former students of Prof Harold Lasky, the father of Marxist ideology in London University.
They had under their belt over 90 percent of the Trade Unions, and a well-organised sub-urban network in Western, Sabaragamuwa, and Southern Provinces and a significant presence in the plantations and in the North. They organised both the white and blue-collar working classes; Indian plantation workers in some tea estates participated in violent protests. The new-born SLFP supported the campaign in principal, with no active participation.
Hartal ‘53 was an exercise worked out on lines of Marxist ideology. Edmond Samarakkody MP and staunch Trotskyite writing to official organ of LSSP stated, “What the working class and the masses that were in the struggle looked forward to were not a mere one-day protest action and a return to work…they were in readiness for a struggle to overthrow the hated UNP government. In fact, this direct action of masses continued on the next day also….there was clear possibilities of this Hartal action being continued for several days…but the leadership, despite the unmistakable moods of the workers and other sections of the masses, decided against…”. –‘Samasamajist’; [1953]
The people’s capability for mass struggle against unfairness and injustices made the political leadership apprehensive and to look for options. Since August 1953, anti-Marxist politicians initiated plans and strategies of facing similar tragedies by distracting the interest of masses from material benefits to wishes on racial, religious and language issues, a ‘clever’ approach in political survival. A tragedy that caused the nation continues to suffer the harmful effects of it. Hartal ‘53 was a spontaneous reaction of an enraged people who displayed their strength in challenging a government’s authoritarian stance. People’s sense of collective power experienced on this day brought them success, when the price of rice was reduced from 70 to 55cents.
