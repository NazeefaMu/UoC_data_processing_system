Navy denies allegations

Sri Lanka Navy yesterday rejected allegations that its personnel shot dead a 21-year-old Indian fisherman on Monday evening while he was fishing a short distance off Katchatheevu islet.
Indian media reports stated that a 21-year-old fisherman from Tamil Nadu was shot dead while another suffered injuries when their boat came under attack late Monday night, allegedly from the Sri Lankan Navy.
Navy media spokesperson Commander Chaminda Walakuluge when contacted denied the charge but added that however, a probe has been launched into the allegations leveled in the Indian media.
According to Indian media, angry relatives of the dead youth have refused to receive his body from the hospital, demanding that a minister should visit them, and also seeking assurance for a permanent solution.
