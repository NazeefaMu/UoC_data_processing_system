Corruption case against Fowzie re-fixed for trial

A corruption case filed against State Minister A. H. M. Fowzie for allegedly causing an unlawful loss of Rs. 1.07 million to the government by misusing a vehicle belonging to the Disaster Management Centre, was yesterday re-fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
The case was re-fixed for trial by Colombo Additional Magistrate Buddhika Sri Ragala since the permanent Magistrate was on leave.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Director General had filed this corruption case against the State Minister under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on four charges.
The Bribery Commission alleged that State Minister Fowzie had unlawfully utilised a Land Cruiser Jeep belonging to the Disaster Management Centre between 2010 and 2015, while he was serving as a Senior Minister during the previous regime. The value of the vehicle was estimated at Rs. 19.5 million. President's Counsel Shavindra Fernando appeared for the accused.
