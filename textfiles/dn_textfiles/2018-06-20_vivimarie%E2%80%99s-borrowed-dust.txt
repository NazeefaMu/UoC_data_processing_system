Vivimarie’s  borrowed dust

I have known both Lal and Vivamarie since my The Island days. Some decades ago they were budding journalists, now academics.
Vivimarie VanderPoorten’s newest book of 88 pages is her poems collected together as borrowed dust published by Sarasavi Publishers at Rs 375 a copy. She is a prize winner and an acknowledged poet.
This slim volume has very short epigrammatical and a fairly little longer poems. Between pages 19 and 21 there is a poem like prose writing included.
Next, what I like are:
l I have words like obsession and infatuation, my defence.
I throw them at you- their polysyllabic edges hitting the lens of your eye where tears linger. Waiting to fall
l We go together like a Knife and a Fork. A carving knife, a Pitchfork
l And when robes ere being hand out, the bird who would be called crow said
Give me the black one, so I can forever remind the world of the grief stricken and the dead
n We will truly know that it’s folly to say there are no winners in war.
n You said we would stick together through Thick and Thin. Alas! It turned out to be a thick wall, a thin line
n Drifting dangerously like a snowflake, wavering aimlessly like hope, moving around the eye balls of human statues standing still in falling snow
n You called me yours. ‘my precious’ you said. Ever sensitive to speech broken down into their parts. I said: I like your use of the possessive determiner. You said: My knowledge of grammar and now, after all this time with you no longer possessive nondetermined. I think: your knowledge of grammar was fine. It was the usage that was flawed.
l I never know and you’ll always be the rainbow I found in the grass
l When trapped between the jagged edges of unanswerable questions you can find a way out through the familiar space of signifiers: For example, when asked ‘So where do you want to go from here?”, you could always say “I am searching for directions” or better still ‘I would like to stand still, in this place for a while”.’
l I have loved like a chain smoker lighting new flames with the dying embers of burnt down loves even while my heart lay crushed out like a cigarette butt still smoking in the tray-cage of my ribs.
Should I not then feel the withdrawals of an addict with not even the nicotine patch of a mild flirtation in sight, why do I now not follow my usual habit, look for the sweet tobacco of desire in someone’s eyes the flash of the flint wheel the butane satisfaction of being inhaled into a heart.
Or have I finally quit?
n Swaying rat snakes mate. Two dancers creating life on the dying grass.
· (I too witnessed the jammed traffic stillness in Kolkata streets)
n And hoe long will you wait for me my love? Will you wait until the river of my fear a shrunk I the drought of loneliness? Will you wait until I begin to rescue my canoe-heart from sinking in the cold sea of common sense. Will you wait until despair’s last tear has been wept?
n You became indispensable like Google. And YouTube, but unlike the search engines or even Wiki, you cannot stay long. So, I guess I better glued to dictionary and Encyclopaedia Britannica. The Yellow Pages to mi just have to do.
n And I who pride myself on the waves of words that hit the shoreline of the imagination am left empty as the beach when the tide is out.
I enjoyed her poems and was not looking for her content but was fascinated by the fresh coinages that fascinated me.
