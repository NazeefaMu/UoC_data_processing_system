Aluminium extrusions producer, Alumex, yesterday unveiled the Country’s first fully automated, front-loading aluminium extrusion plant and South Asia’s first vertical powder coating facility with patented SAT Travisan CUBE Technology in Ekala, Ja-Ela.
The R. 2 billion mega project will officially make Alumex PLC the largest aluminium extruder in Sri Lanka in terms of scale and output. A subsidiary of Hayleys PLC, will hire more than 185 people to ensure that the plant outputs an incredible 1,000 MT in Aluminium Extrusions and Powder Coating per month.
“This will be the most advanced extruder and powder coating plant in this part of the world,” said Managing Director at Alumex PLC, Pramuk Dediwala. “With these two facilities, Alumex will be the most advanced aluminium supplier in the Country and make its footprint in the South Asian region to help us stand out as world-class, empowering local fabricators and contractors under the Alumex ecosystem to compete in overseas markets.”
The plant will house the largest aluminium extruder in Sri Lanka. Alumex will also benefit from its automated downstream equipment and long run-out tables with Infrared and Bluetooth technology controls.
This powder coating plant will be equipped with advanced autonomous machinery for conomical operation and high efficiency. A complete powder recycling facility with 100% recovery will also mean no powder wastage in the powder spraying process, reducing the cost of production to a great extent. The firm will also leverage smart operating platforms with online error correction facilities.
The highlight of the plant is in its reduction of waste water and purification system to make certain that water discharge has zero impact on the local environment.
Alumex is a fully integrated manufacturer of Aluminium profiles in Sri Lanka since 1988.
