FNO urges govt to heed Maha Sangha’s advice

Members of the Federation of the National Organization (FNO) urged the government to listen to the voice of the Maha Sanga without insulting them, aiming to suppress their voice.
Ven. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera of the FNO said the Maha Sanga raise their voice not against the government but against its people and acts against the country.
Ven. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera made these remarks while addressing the media in Colombo. “The government should listen to the Maha Sanga especially to the Most Venerable Chief Prelates of the three Chapters. But the government has been insulting the Maha Sanga using its henchmen,” the Thera said.
Ven. Abhayatissa Thera requested President Maithripala Sirisena to take action against these ‘yes-men’ who insult the Maha Sanga. The Thera added that the government should not implement a new Constitution, which may harm ethnic harmony and territorial integrity.
“The country does not need a new Constitution which divides it,” the Thera noted.Addressing the media, Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekara said the government is trying to implement the 13th Amendment of the Constitution under the guise of introducing a new Constitution.
“Bringing a new Constitution means empowering the 13th Amendment,” he said.
Ven. Malewana Dharmavijaya Thera said the government is duty-bound to uphold territorial integrity.
When asked whether the FNO is leveling baseless allegations against an ‘imagined’ new Constitution which has not even been prepared or finalized yet, assuming that it will introduce a federal system, Ven.
Abhayatissa Thera replied that they are well aware of the new Constitution that will be implemented by the government. “It will harm territorial integrity as the new Constitution will outline a federal system.”
