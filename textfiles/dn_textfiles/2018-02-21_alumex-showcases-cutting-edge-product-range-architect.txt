Alumex, Sri Lanka’s premier integrated manufacturer of Aluminium extrusions showcased its vast catalogue of products including the very latest Alumex proprietary doors, windows and facades at the Architect 2018 Member's Work and Trade Exhibition held at the BMICH from February 22-25.

“For over three decades, Alumex has consistently driven quality and innovation in Sri Lankan market and given the unprecedented development which our nation has experienced over the recent past, demand for reliable, long-lasting materials is only going to rise. Our goal with this year’s exhibition is therefore to showcase the breadth of our catalogue including our most recent innovations such as insulated double glazed curtain walls, lift and slide windows and doors and many products for various household and industrial applications such as solar, furniture and many light engineering products.
“These types of products have helped to push the envelope in terms of design, by offering durable materials in a vibrant selection of colors and finishes, offering the perfect balance between form and function so we are confident of an enthusiastic reception at Architect 2018,”
