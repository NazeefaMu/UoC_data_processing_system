A rat snake at the Panadura Additional Magistrate’s Court

 
A rat snake paid a surprise visit to the Panadura Additional Magistrate’s Court yesterday (23), while  the Additional Magistrate Sadun Vithana was on the bench hearing a case.
The snake  ran over the bench and a pandemonium occurred as the attorney at law, M. D. Wijepala and Munasingha who were appearing for the case attempted to get on to the chairs of the Court.
However the Magistrate proceeded with the case as  the policemen at the Court chased away the rat snake..
Police believe that the rat snake came chasing after a mouse and accidently entered the Additional Magistrate’s Court.
