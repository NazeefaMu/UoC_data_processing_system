Liberal Democrats sweep Japan polls

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secured a two-thirds majority at the Parliamentary elections held last weekend. It won 283 seats out of 465 in the Lower House of Parliament. Its junior partner in the coalition, Komeito party won 29 seats. Opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) won 54 seats.
On September 28 Prime Minister Abe called a snap election to take advantage of the Opposition’s disunity and the Korean missile crisis. The Opposition was fragmented. The main Opposition Party, the Democratic Party split into four. New parties formed on election eve had no time to consolidate, so that Abe surged ahead despite his popularity being low. It was the weakness of the Opposition rather than the popularity of the LDP that ensured the latter’s victory. It is also said that the electoral system favours the ruling party.
Election victory would consolidate Abe’s position as leader of the LDP. Analysts predict that he would become Japan’s longest-serving Prime Minister.
Despite the election victory Abe faces tough times ahead. Japan’s economy is riddled with a huge debt burden. Its national debt exceeds twice the Gross Domestic Product. Abe proposes to introduce a special consumption tax hike in 2019 for welfare funding which has generated considerable opposition from the public.
The election victory gives Abe a chance to push forward his pet policy of reforming the Japanese Constitution which is pacifist and bars Japan from becoming a military power. However, it would mean a challenge to the post-Second World War world order.
This could cause much division among the population whose anti-war sentiments remain strong with the memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki still deep in their minds.
Al-Qaeda and ISIS move to Africa
With consequent defeats in Iraq and Syria al-Qaeda and the Islamic State ISIS have moved their centre of operations to the African continent.
A massive blast in Somalia's capital of Mogadishu on October 14 and it killed more than 350 and injured hundreds more. It was followed by more recent terror attacks in Somalia, Niger and Egypt highlight their presence in Africa. A large number of militants who joined the ISIS and al-Qaeda are from Tunisia and they are retreating to their homeland after the defeats in the Middle East.
This has led to increased involvement of United States, German and French militaries in the anti-terrorist operations in the continent. Governments in the poor nations are unable to handle the terrorist threat alone.
Political analysts point out that it is the social problems that have led youth to join militant groups. Among them are worsening economic conditions, especially poverty, underdevelopment and unemployment. Corruption and bad governance make the situation worse.
Hence, these countries need development assistance but the fight against terrorism undermines the development initiatives.
Venezuela: Government wins regional elections
The ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (UPSV) won the regional elections held on August 15 securing 17 of 23 Governorships. The Opposition Democratic Unity Round Table (MUD) won in 5 regions.
The USPV obtained 54 percent of the vote as against 43.3 percent it received in 2015. Out of the 18 million voters 61.14 percent took part in voting. MUD received only 45 percent of the votes cast. The United States which has called openly for the overthrow of the regime in Venezuela and imposed sanctions on it financed the Opposition campaign, in addition. It was hoping for an Opposition victory.
After the elections the Opposition and Western powers including the United States and Canada allege that it was fraudulent. In the meantime four of the five elected Opposition Governors have already taken oaths contrary to the decision of MUD to refrain from swearing in the post.
The Opposition now stands divided. Leader of the Justice Party Henrique Capriles Rodonski who unsuccessfully contested for Presidency in 2012 and 2013 has left the MUD over differences with the Democratic Action Party President.
Meanwhile, the National Electoral Council (CNE) accredited team of international observers hailing from different countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, Europe and Russia certified the “the total reliability and transparency of the Venezuelan electoral system” and noted that “the voting process took place in total normalcy and in keeping with applicable legal, technical and organisational aspects. In addition, it saw the broad and organised participation of the Venezuelan people in a clear expression of their Popular Sovereignty”.
Election results showed that the people of Venezuela have endorsed the new path of development introduced by President Chavez in the country. On the results of this regional election one could safely predict a victory for Chavismo at the forthcoming Municipal elections in December and in the Presidential election in a year’s time.
