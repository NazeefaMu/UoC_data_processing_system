Fashionistas at La Belle Époque opening

A trendy and functional banquet space lent its potential to the gathering who graced the simple launch ceremony recently.
The owners being the Deraniyagala family lit the oil lamp amidst relatives, friends and potential clients. In the heart of Mount Lavinia, nestled in a sprawling garden fringed with coconut palms, and more importantly - a large parking area, is this elegant venue. Topped with a welcoming ambience, everyone seemed to find their own space to relax, have conversation, a dip into a chocolate fountain, a cheese platter, a variety of thirst quenches, pass around canapés, poolside chatter and lively music; all of which contributed to a pleasant and memorable evening.
