Inspiration is the  key

Head Boy of British School in Colombo Darren Hall’s vigour and vision are inspirational. Perfect Prefects features Darren Hall who feels the urgent need for powerful change in society and sees himself as part of this change.
The well- known scientist Stephen Hawking’s intellect was astounding. Hall is very much inspired by this great mind. Hall’s ability to be inspired by great minds is certainly one of his great strengths. This inspiration is a key factor in his leadership.
“Take Stephen Hawking, he had a disease leaving him unable to walk or talk. They thought he was going to die in his 20s and he still lived into the 70s. He never gave up and achieved many of his dreams. He did not let the disease stop him from doing what he wanted to do. If there is something bothering, remember you can always get through it.
Inspiring technology
Science-based things really interest me, such as what Elon Musk is doing. He wants to make Mars habitable, so we can reduce earth’s population. He really inspires me doing incredible things with technology. It makes me feel like everyone on this planet can really do something and impact the world through their efforts through science and technology,” said Hall.
In addition to having vigour, compassion is another trait Hall possesses. He feels for those who suffer and feels that helping them is his calling in life.
“When I see things like what is happening in Syria and even in the States, I would like to be there for those children who are really suffering. I want to make sure that they are ok, even if it is something as small as a donation, or visiting somewhere nearby so I can help them out. I want to make sure I can do that.
One thing I want to do is to make sure that we help the people who are most in need. I believe we are in a privileged position to do that. We need to make sure that we help those who are not as fortunate as we are. Even if I have a company which makes a lot of money, what is important is how that money is re-distributed around us and if it goes into the hands of those who really need it. Once I have enough capital, confidence and experience I would like to have my own company. However, that is just a plan. I am still very young and cannot say what will happen in the future, but I can only hope for the best,” explains Hall.
High School shootings have become somewhat of a routine in America. Just seven weeks into 2018, there had been eight shootings at US schools. Cowardly though they are, they are carried out by mentally unstable teenagers.
“I think America needs to abandon the old gun laws, where it states everyone in America has the right to own a gun. They need to say only certain people have the right to have guns, perhaps policemen and army officers. Normal citizens should not have access to guns. In the States, you are allowed to have a gun before you are even allowed to have a drink. It is too easy for these children to have guns, and they come to schools and start shooting innocent people.
Innocent community
We need to help children who do have these mental health issues and make sure that they have someone to talk to, so they will avoid trying to kill innocent people. Even if he or she can’t use a gun, he or she can still use a knife. So if you really want to solve the issue you need to go to the root of the problem which is the person’s mental problems. There needs to be some sort of institute or guidance counsellor to help those people. There must be some way to distinguish between those who need help and who do not,” elucidated Hall.
British School in Colombo is a great place because everyone there is very friendly. It is a very close community. The teachers make sure that everyone is very safe and comfortable. They are also very good teachers. You never get bullied or anything of that sort. The new ones who come in can get comfortable easily when it comes to the social and academic aspects of the school.
“I am very privileged to get this position in the first place. I don’t think it was a particular individual characteristic that helped me to become Head Boy. But I think it was simply helping everyone around me and making sure that teamwork was the number one priority. And that was what lead me to become Head Boy.
I think what it takes to become a leader is knowing when to rely on others and when to rely on yourself and follow your gut instinct. You need to know when to avoid doing what everyone else thinks is right and do what you think is right. You need to be close to everyone around you but not too close when emotional factors get in the way of what you have to do,” added Hall.
Hall’s advice to anyone who wants to be a leader is not to try and be someone they are not. At the end of the day being your original self will suit you and the entire world for the better. You need to make sure that you don’t try and control everything and become a dictator.
“I want to head to university, after finishing my A/Ls, in Dublin or in the UK. I think I will be doing engineering as a degree and hopefully I will become an engineer. I would like to join a firm, perhaps the Middle East would be the best. So once I settle down I would like to form my own company,” said Hall.
Leader admired
Obama is a leader in history that Hall admires and World Wars I and II are events he says we can learn something from.
“I like Barack Obama because he was very laid back and relaxed and did not go over the top, he didn’t try to create problems and start a war, but he did what he had to do, such as trying to change the gun policy but it did not work out. He was compassionate and showed the people that he was human as well like everyone else.
The events in history that grab my attention are World Wars I and II. It is amazing how many people suffered and what they had to go through. A World War III would be far worse because now there are nuclear weapons. It would be very frightful and terrible. World War III might very well be the extinction of the human race,” stated Hall.
Hall was born in Abu Dhabi and lived there for 15 years. He went to school there for 12 years and came to British School in Colombo in 2014 where he has been there for three and a half years. His mother is Sri Lankan and his father is Irish and has been visiting Sri Lanka every year.
“I have been doing Football and Athletics since year 10, and I am also part of a group called Educo which helps people in need. So we have visited an Orphanage once a week and teach them different things like mathematics and how to draw. I was also part of Badminton for a little while.
When playing Football, the key is teamwork, so we need this not only in football but in life as well. You need to work well as a team and to support one another. So if you do not do this on the pitch and in life as well you will not succeed in both situations. You need to be relaxed and be confident. I play golf as well in my spare time, I would go to the golf club maybe two or three times a week and take part in tournaments. I have played a few junior tournaments as well. I also love to play table tennis at home at the apartment complex where I live. So I play table tennis quite often with my neighbours. So unlike Football, these are individual games, so you just need to be confident which will help you do your very best,” summed up Hall.
