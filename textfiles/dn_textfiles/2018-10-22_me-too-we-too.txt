ME TOO AS WE TOO

The #MeToo movement has been active for over a decade, thanks to the inspired and dedicated work of Tarana Burke, an activist and advocate for young women of colour. A Chicago abuse survivor, Tarana Burke, first introduced the “Me Too” initiative in 2006, after listening to the heart-wrenching testimony of a fourteen-year-old rape victim.
Actress Alyssa Milano added the hashtag to “Me Too” in October 2017, after a New York Times story detailed Weinstein’s conduct. The list of professionally successful men who have tumbled in the #MeToo wake has been without precedent, toppling a growing list.
While the #MeToo movement has revealed widespread abuse from Hollywood to government to businesses, mounting allegations of sexual misconduct within houses of worship and religious communities point to something perhaps even more appalling – a breach of a special trust.
During the past year, many women, and even some men, across the country have used the online hashtag #ChurchToo to tell their stories of past abuse. They have recounted how men in power used their uniquely intimate roles as pastors to spiritually manipulate and sexually coerce them when they were at their most vulnerable. Many were underage teens.
As the Roman Catholic Church struggles with a new wave of clergy abuse cases, several prominent evangelical institutions have been rocked in by their own sexual misconduct allegations against pastors and church leaders who exploited the trust they had gained from faithful churchgoers.
Sexual ethics: Soul-searching in the face of #MeToo
Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein surrendered to authorities in New York City following a firestorm of accusations—and ultimately legal charges—of sexual misconduct and assault. Released on a one-million-dollar cash bond, disgraced but also defiant, Weinstein was fitted with a tracking device and restricted to New York and Connecticut until trial. His story birthed the hashtag #MeToo movement last year, in which millions of women have stepped forward acknowledging that they, too, have been sexually abused.
The public conversation about #MeToo has lifted the blinds with a flood of stories has brought the reality of sexual abuse at work, at home, in school, and in government, forcing the devastating truth into the light and out of the shadows. Time ran the headline “‘Me Too’ Just Gave Society a Conscience.”
Why #MeToo can be for men, too
For some male victims of sexual assault and abuse, #MeToo can feel more like #WhatAboutMe?
They admire the women speaking out about traumatic experiences as assault and harassment victims, while wondering whether men with similar scars will ever receive a comparable level of public empathy and understanding.
Schmutzer is among a group of survivors and therapists forming the leadership of Male Survivor, which since its incorporation in 1995 has sought to provide support and resources to men who suffered sexual abuse as children or adults. It says its website has been visited by hundreds of thousands of men worldwide.
The psychologists and therapists who work with Male Survivor endorse the findings of multiple studies concluding that about one in six men in the US experienced childhood sexual abuse, compared with one in four women. Many adult men also suffer sexual abuse: Rape in prison is frequent, and the latest Pentagon survey found that 6,300 men in the military said they were victims of sexual assault or other unwanted sexual contact in 2016.
Despite such data, experts say many men, because of social stigma and feelings of shame, are reluctant to speak up about the abuse they experienced or to seek professional help.
Joan Cook, a psychiatry professor at Yale School of Medicine, has been treating sexually abused men for more than 20 years.
“Many of them still espouse this John Wayne mentality,” she said. “If something bad happens to you, just wall it off and don’t acknowledge it to yourself or others.”
Some of her patients fear they’ll be perceived as weak if they go public about their abuse, she said, while others worry people will view them as more likely to be abusers themselves because of what they suffered as children.
According to Male Survivor, a significant portion of abuse perpetrators report having been victimized by abuse, but most victims do not go on to commit sexual abuse against others.
New York-based psychoanalyst Richard Gartner, a co-founder of Male Survivor, says there’s increased public awareness of the childhood sexual abuse of males as a result of the extensive publicity given to scandals within the Roman Catholic Church and at Penn State University, where Jerry Sandusky was an assistant football coach before being convicted in 2012 of sexual abuse of 10 boys.
However, Gartner, like other advocates for abused men, said that in both those cases, public attention was far more focused on the perpetrators than on their victims.
Given the reluctance of many male survivors to speak publicly about the abuse, Gartner says it’s helpful when prominent men, including actors, music stars and pro athletes, do make that decision.
“They are models for others to come forward, to tell their families, to find help,” Gartner said. “It becomes a less shameful thing when somebody famous says it happened to them.”
Why hasn’t the gay community had a #MeToo moment?
According a survey by gay men’s health charity GMFA, some 62% of British gay men have been touched or groped in a bar without consent. In the US 40% of gay and 47% of bisexual men have experienced sexual violence other than rape, compared with 21% of heterosexual men.
The British government published a survey of some 110,000 LGBT people in which two in five said they had experienced verbal or physical violence in the 12 months. According to British LGBT rights group Stonewall, 53 percent of trans people aged between 18 and 24 suffered some form of abuse over the same period. Elsewhere in Europe, statistics are difficult to find as many countries, such as Ireland, do not have specific hate crime legislation.
There’s a culture of silence, and it’s not difficult to understand why. Recognising the sexual violence you have experienced isn’t always easy, especially when these are some of your earliest sexual encounters, or when memories are clouded by alcohol and drugs.
