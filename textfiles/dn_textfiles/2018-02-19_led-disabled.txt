Led by the disabled

At first, they had no idea how a simple wooden stick could be used for theatrical gestures when the circle was formed. But creativity does not come at once. One by one, those in the circle took some time to kindle their imagination. The very first one of the circle used the wooden stick for the theatrical gesture of fishing. That was followed by the next one who saw it as an arrow. For another, it looked like a weight-lifting bar. Another used the stick to play the flute. Such gestures were slowly, but steadily, leading them along miscellaneous avenues. The circle had many gestures of miracles with the wooden sticks in their hands. They played a guitar, threw a javelin, drummed, swept by a broom, wrote by a pen, played pool and even combed hair.
The circle was formed by a gathering of delegates from the 30th batch of the Ship for World Youth Programme and the students with disabilities of the Thidora Theatre. Seated in the middle of the circle, Rohanadeva Perera challenged the norms of creativity. How could mental or physical oppression be used for creative advantage, he questioned from the gathering circled around him. Disability used to be a sign of discrimination in the Sri Lankan arena. However, thanks to organisations such as Thidora Theatre, founded by Rohanadeva Perera, the phenomenon is now changing.
Nippon Maru, carrying over 240 youth from 11 different countries of the world set its journey to Singapore, India and Sri Lanka from the port of Yokohama, Japan on January 29. A group of the delegates from countries such as Peru, New Zealand, Australia, Oman and Japan chose Thidora Theatre workshop to gain insights on how the traditional attitudes of disability could be changed in a creative spectrum.
Delivering the keynote speech at the workshop, Professor Sunanda Mahendra enlightened the audience of Youth Leaders on the brief history of traditional Sri Lankan rituals and how they evolved into modern dance forms of the country.
The gathering was naturally interested in the genesis of Thidora. In Sinhalese, it can mean three doors (mind, body and word). In English, it is the acronym of Theatre Institute for Disability Oriented Research and Advocacy. The Thidora, founded by Rohanadeva Perera and Ramani Damayanthi, employs dance as a tool to enhance the communication skills of disabled persons.
Following a brief introduction on Sri Lanka’s traditions by Professor Sunanda Mahendra and Rohanadeva Perera, the Youth Leaders took part in various ritual-like performances. The young crowd mingled with the disabled students of the Thidora Theatre and explored the art of utilitarian creativity. They performed various exercises.
“I appreciate that I learned very important things here. Though the workshop is simple, I learnt a lot about music and dance. When I used the stick, I began to feel my own body and emotions,” said Ryoko from Osaka adding that she will introduce this exercise for children in Japan as well.
Thidora Theatre came to the fore as a concept in 1987, though it actually materialised in 2008. With the financial aid of theatre enthusiast Wolfgang Stange, who is also the founder of AMICI Dance Theatre Company in London, the Thidora Theatre was established to promote theatre activities of the people with disabilities.
“It was such an absolutely lovely job. It was such a beautiful hour and the smiles I saw were magical in a land far away from my country. I felt at home. I am thankful to the Institute for sharing the gift of music and dance with us,” Noemi del Castilo from Mexico said.
Shu from Japan expressed appreciation of the amazing family at Thidora Theatre. “Here is an acceptable place for everyone and us including normal or disable people or whoever can share the same music and happiness for dancing. I hope their work goes well.”
The workshop was a touching experience for Nikki Vivienne from Australia, a sister of an autistic brother.
“I saw a wonderful family at Thidora theatre. It was a privilege to be here with them. I sincerely hope they will receive more recognition and support for their amazing work. I thank them for crossing a safe and creative space that welcomes disabled and disadvantaged people. They offered a voice to the disabled community. It truly touched my heart and gave me hope in humanity,” Nikki added.
