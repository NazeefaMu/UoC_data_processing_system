City cleaning tops K’gala MC agenda

The Kurunegala Municipal Council’s new SLPP administration, headed by the newly appointed Mayor, Thushara Sanjeewa Witharana is to pay attention to keep the Kurunegala city clean.
The first inaugural monthly meeting was held at the Municipal Council Conference Hall, recently, presided by Mayor Witharana.
The Mayor said hawkers have completely encroached the pavements in certain sections of the town, causing harassment to pavement users, especially patients, women, the aged and schoolchildren.
He said vehicle parking on the payment without any regard to pedestrians will be stopped.
