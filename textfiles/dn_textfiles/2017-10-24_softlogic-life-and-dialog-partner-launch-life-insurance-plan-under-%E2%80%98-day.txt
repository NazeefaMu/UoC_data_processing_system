Softlogic Life and Dialog partner to launch Life Insurance plan under ‘Per Day Insurance’

Softlogic Life in partnership with Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka's premier telecommunication services provider, announced the launch of a Life Insurance plan under the Per Day Insurance service available to Dialog's 11.8 Million Prepaid and Postpaid subscribers across Sri Lanka.
Enhancing the existing Per Day Insurance service portfolio of hospitalization and accident covers, this Life Insurance will enable all Dialog mobile customers to enjoy the benefits of a comprehensive life insurance package from Softlogic Life, for as low as Rs1/- per day.
Life insurance cover extends from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 1,000,000 and the daily premiums graduate from Rs. 1 to Rs. 10 per day. The service also extends life protection up to the age of 70 years through a transparent and hassle-free subscription process which does not need any documentation.
Expressing his views, Softlogic Life Managing Director, Iftikar Ahamed said, “We are proud to partner with Dialog Axiata to introduce this timely Per Day Life Insurance Plan for Dialog's widespread customer base in Sri Lanka. The simple life protection product was designed based on two important ethos: one, offer an adequate life insurance cover for every Dialog customer and two, give Dialog customers the ability to purchase it with ease.”
“Our latest offering will empower Dialog customers to make a worthy choice, their family liabilities and protect their loved ones’ future financial prospects at an affordable price,” Ahamed alluded further.
Softlogic Life has also collaborated with MILVIK Lanka (pvt) Ltd as the customer service support partner to drive further convenience to the consumer.
Softlogic Life ensures reliability and efficiency for Dialog customers in terms of claim settlements, considering its globally award-winning reputation with claim settlements over the years. In 2016 alone, Softlogic Life has given away health claims worth more than Rs.100 million and settled 80% of their claims within 24 hours.
Supun Weerasinghe, Group Chief Executive Officer, Dialog Axiata PLC said, “Mobile Technology enables products and services from across multiple verticals to reach a vast majority of the population, maximising affordability and convenience. We will provide the mobile platform in enabling Softlogic Life with delivering this unique product to our customers. The launch of this micro-insurance product further complements our ongoing innovation thrust, while allowing for Softlogic Life to leverage on our extensive network and reach.”
