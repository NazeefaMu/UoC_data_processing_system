AISEX 2018 begins on May 10 at BMICH

Bringing together suppliers and service organizations in the apparel industry in Sri Lanka, the Apparel Industry Suppliers Exhibition (AISEX) will be held from May 10- 12 at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Center (SBMEC).
Organized and managed by Lanka Exhibition & Conference Services in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Apparel Institute (SLAI), organizers hope it would be the platform in which the future development of the industry as a major sourcing and knowledge hub for the apparel sector by 2020 would come to fruition.
Held biannually since the year 1998, the 9th edition of AISEX 2018 will bring together a wide range of players, big and small, focused on the development of the industry together.
Reinvigorated by the provision of GSP plus, the apparel industry is on the brink of taking every foreseeable step in a bid to take full advantage of the benefits allowed under the scheme. “This is a benefit that is time stamped. As the country develops and reaches a higher Per Capita Income, we will lose this opportunity. The time is now to make full use of what is given to us,” Chairman of the Sri Lanka Apparel Institute Professor Lakdas Fernando said. Set in this backdrop, the Apparel Industry Suppliers Exhibition aims to bring all suppliers Big and Small and service organizations in the sector under one roof and will focus on a wide range of textile machinery, accessories and services from many parts of the world.
AISEX will provide manufacturers of all sizes a platform to expand existing manufacturing methods and possibilities of increasing production volumes and efficiency through state of the art innovative technology. AISEX will also focus on generating new opportunities closer to home for small scale local designers and manufactures. The Event will feature a sourcing Market / Pavilion where small to medium scale manufactures, suppliers and designers can meet and source each other’s skills and products.
The 9th edition of AISEX sets out to attract innovators and trend setters both domestic and overseas to access, meet, learn and experience.
There would be a number of knowledge sharing sessions held alongside the exhibition and well known personalities from the Industry will speak & share their perspectives, followed by open panel discussions and Forums.
