Eight teams vie for Mini Football World Cup

Organised by German Embassy in Sri Lanka :
Over 100 football players (girls and boys) will take part in the football tournament organized by German Embassy and the German Football Federation at Race Course, Colombo 7 today from 1 pm to 6 pm. Eight teams from Jaffna, Gampaha, Negombo, Colombo supported by the Embassies of Switzerland, Norway, Netherlands, Brazil, France and USA will compete in the tournament for the Mini Football World Cup.
Within the last months the German Embassy Colombo has repeatedly cooperated with Thaabit Ahmed Football Academy (TAFA), a privately run football academy based in Colombo. In 2016 the football youngsters in Jaffna participated in TAFA workshops followed by a “German Embassy Tournament”.
Earlier this year more than 4,000 children in the Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu Districts enjoyed football games and activities supported by the “German Buzzzz” and TAFA.
German Ambassador Jorn Rohde said at a press briefing “Football is rightly dubbed ‘the beautiful game.’ It is the world’s most popular team game and our event will surely contribute to increase its popularity in Sri Lanka. It will also bring children from different parts of the country together to experience team spirit and lots of fun this coming Saturday!”
