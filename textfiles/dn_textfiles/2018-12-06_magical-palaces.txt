Magical Palaces

BRAN CASTLE IN BRASOV, ROMANIA
Bran Castle, popularly known as Dracula’s Castle, is the perfect spot for those looking for something magical with also a lot of myth and mystery surrounding it. According to bran-castle.com, the fictional story goes that Dracula, a Transylvanian Count and the OG vampire (you know before Twilight hit the teen reading scene), has a castle located way up high in the mountains.
Although the myth is totally just something from the depths of our human imaginations, it’s fun to think about when taking a trip to this vision in the valley. During your visit, you might want to grab a bite at the tea house. Transylvania isn’t on everyone’s bucket list, but now you have a beautiful reason to go.
