Podu Jana Peramuna Badulla rally, a damp squib

Political analysts yesterday said that the much hyped Badulla rally organised by the Podu Jana Peramuna was a flop as many party leaders in the Joint Opposition refrained from participating in the rally.
They said that absence of Joint Opposition firebrand Dinesh Gunawardene, National Freedom Front Leader Wimal Weerawansa and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila reveals that a major rift is looming within the Joint Oppositon.
“The Podu Jana Peramuna had given wide publicity ahead of this rally but the absence of Joint Opposition party leaders may have been linked to infighting among party leaders,” Political analysts say.
