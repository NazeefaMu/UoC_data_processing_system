Sajith “ready for any responsibility”

UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa has said that he is prepared to take on any responsibility given to him.
He was answering a question posed by BBC Sandeshaya on the possibility of contesting as the UNP Prime Ministerial candidate and being the Party Leader at an upcoming election.
Premadasa explained that he had given his fullest support to every election campaign and had the blessing of the membership, Parliamentary group, Working Committee and the incumbent leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe in any responsibility held.
When pressed whether he would take on the leadership of the party, he said, “from the day I took up UNP membership, from the day I was born, I have been ready for anything, but there is a procedure and method for everything.
Be it in the country, organization or party, certain systems have to be followed”.
