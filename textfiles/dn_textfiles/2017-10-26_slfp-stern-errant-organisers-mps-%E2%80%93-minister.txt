SLFP stern on errant organisers, MPs – Minister

The SLFP has no other alternative than to expel members supporting the ‘Pohottu Party” while remaining in party ranks irrespective of their rank, Social Empowerment,Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S B Dissanayake said.
Although such members sacked for infidelity are making various pronouncements after their sacking, the public know that they were trying to promote the Pohottu Party (SLPP) while remaining within SLFP ranks earlier.
Dissanayake made this observation addressing a press conference held at his residence following a meeting of SLFP Kandy district electoral organisers recently.
Dissanayake said people have broken away from SLFP ranks on four previous occasions in its history.
When compared with previous groups which had parted from the SLFP earlier, the recent group seemed to be the weakest group. He said the departure of a senior party member had created the opportunity for an efficient junior group of SLFPers to come forward and display their mettle.
