HEAD PREFECT MURDER CASE:
THREE SUSPECTS UNDER PROBATION

Chilaw Magistrate Manjula Rathnayake yesterday ordered to detain the three student suspects involved in the attack and murder of the Savarana Muslim School Head Prefect under probation care until July 3, 2018.
Three 15 year-old students had allegedly beaten the Head Prefect who lived close to the Savarana Mosque.
The victim, Mohammad Rizvi Mohammad Faizul was on his way home with a friend after a religious ceremony held at the mosque when the three students had attacked him.
The three students are said to have switched off the street lights and attacked the victim with clubs.
The victim who was critical was taken to the Chilaw District Hospital and transferred to the Colombo National Hospital. He succumbed to his injuries after 13 days of the attack.
A brawl between two student groups is considered to be the cause of the attack.
The three suspects have threatened the victim at an argument between student groups.
Police took the three suspects into custody and released two on bail. All three were produced before the court yesterday.
