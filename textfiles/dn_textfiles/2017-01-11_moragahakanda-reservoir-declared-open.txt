Moragahakanda reservoir declared open

 
Maiden waters were released into the Moragahakanda reservoir, as President Maithripala Sirisena declared it open today.
The foundation stone was placed by President Maithripala during his tenure as Agriculture, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development Minister, in 2007, during the former president’s regime.
The Moragahakanda reservoir is said to be six times larger than the Parakrama samudraya and is the final step of the Mahaweli project.
 The reservoir serves multiple necessities, such as for irrigational work for Matale, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura districts, the provision of clean water for consumption in order to avoid deceases related to kidney infections prevailing in the area and also to sustain electric energy.
