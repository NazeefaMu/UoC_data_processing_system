Preventing Shin Splints

This week Consultant Rheumatologist and Specialist in Sports Medicine attached to Nawaloka Hospitals PLC Dr. Harindu Wijesinghe (MBBS, MD, MRCP), speaks about Shin Splints, one of the health issues that affect many in our society, especially sportsmen.
Q - What is Shin Splints?
A - The term "shin splints" refers to pain along the shin bone (tibia)- the large bone in the front of your lower leg. Medically known as medial tibial stress syndrome, shin splints often occur in people or athletes who have recently increased their exercise routines. The increased activity overworks the muscles, tendons which are attached to the shin bone irritating the bone tissue. This leads to pain.Fortunately, this is self-healing and with rest it will get better.Usually the pain settles in a few weeks.
Q - Who develops it? how and when?
A – This can occur in anyone who suddenly does a lot of impact training such as running jumping etc. It especially occurs when people change the intensity (ex-running/walking speed,) frequency (number of days per week) or duration (length of exercise) of their exercise too soon.
The pain associated with shin splints results from excessive amounts of force on the shin bone and the tissues attaching the shin bone to the muscles surrounding it. The excessive force causes the muscles to swell and increases the pressure against the bone, leading to pain and inflammation.
Q - What is the connection between a stress fracture and shin splints ?

Dr. Harindu Wijesinghe
A – If pain from shin splints is ignored and training is continued it can lead to stress fracture.
This occurs as the constant pounding of excessive impact exercise and training causes minute cracks in the bones of the leg.
The body can repair the cracks if it gets time to rest.
However, if the body doesn’t get time to rest, the tiny cracks can result in a complete fracture or a stress fracture.
Q – What treatment options are available?
A - When shin splints occur you should stop running completely and decrease your training depending on the extent and duration of pain.
Then, as a first step, ice your shin to reduce inflammation.
Pain killers can help to lessen the pain and inflammation.
Gentle stretches for the calf and Achilles will help. Following this, strengthening is started. Patients can resume non-weight bearing activities such as cycling, swimming.
Once pain is reduced they can start walking followed by jogging which is increased gradually.
When you return to running, increase your mileage slowly, no more than 10 percent weekly.
Q - How can we prevent Shin Splints?
A - When you increase your training increase the intensity of exercise or training no more than 10 percent weekly.
Remember there are three training variables intensity (ex-running/walking speed), frequency (number of days per week) or duration (length of exercise).
As a rule, you must gradually increase only one component at a time.
Make sure you wear the correct running shoes for your foot. Have two pairs of shoes and alternate wearing them to vary the stresses on your legs if you are running a lot.
Avoid hills and excessively hard surfaces when possible and specially if you have shin pain.
Stretch your calves and Achilles regularly as a preventive measure.
Engage in strength training, specially to strengthen leg muscles.
If you are overweight start with non-weight bearing exercises like cycling, cross trainers and swimming.
