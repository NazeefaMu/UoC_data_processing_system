The newest generation  and high tech options to shape Sri Rugby’s future

The time has come...to shelve all local rugby and look regional, at the fast growing Asian circuit.
Sri Lanka will feature heavily with all our 7s ..men's, women, U20 boys and probably the U17 boys and girls.
Major sadness when you consider our pinnacle alpha 7s U20 squad only playing one tournament before they hit the circuit.
In addition, we are also up for some more pressure against the best at the September Asian Games ...Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Kazakhstan etc. contemplating that magical step up to the elite world series.
Sri Lanka will certainly be tested to the core....and much pressure in the middle.
However, important to mention that our best chance to beef up our reputation and bragging rights this season...is here. If Muthu, Ratwatte, Weeraratne, Sooriyabandara and company can really step up ...the Asian Games is the ideal platform.
Naveen Heenak...might well stretch across both teams ...his skill and pace vital to our performance clout.
Joining him for a seriously alpha 7s... will be the stupendous talent and running skills of Gem Chetiya, Gani Dilshan, Muthalib etc ..great finishers for coach Nilufer to have realistic ambitions of winning the Asian series.
Welcome wellness and utter inspiration for our new selection panel headed by the master architect ...Rohan Abeykoon ...who will draw on his years in a Sri 7s shirt ..confronting the likes of Serevi and company in the middle.
The rules have changed somewhat, to enable smoother transition from set play and defensive positions.
But the magic is still the same...fit, power, skill, craft and pace...still lethal qualities and impossible to counter the injection of pace ...ala Carlyn Ayles, Dan Norton, Cesil Africa..etc.
Dreaming of the U20 Asian 7s championship is absolutely a realistic possibility... and entirely dependent on the quality and specialists picked as our combination in the middle.
We will have good depth and phenomenal bench strength...so recycling will be intimidating all game.
Let's look forward to some good news indeed.
September's Asian Games will also test our men’s depth and experience...it will quickly add impact and recovery to our diets ...especially the contact to clean and secure good ruck ball from tackle situations...that efficiency, very much a decisive and critical factor to separate the stronger 7s outfits.
Here is the most ideal gift for the mighty thinking at Sri Lanka Rugby to profile up our Asian focus and start to create some serious waves of impact.
What a fabulous gifted opportunity.
I am supremely confident and inspired by this line for 7s in 2018.
The mighty Asian series starts in September and time enough on the big clock for our men and women to rewrite some compelling history.
The men are currently 4th after Japan, Hong Kong, and Korea ...with plenty to look forward to.....finishing is no issue at all with good ball...but forward power and strength to win the physical contest, might be our Achilles heel under pressure.
Let's imagine practical options by Muthu and his utility forwards, to present clean ball for our pace merchants..Danu Ranjan, Sooriya B, Kavindu, Ritchie Dharma, Naveen Heenak..etc to pepper the opponents goal line.
Let's step up to the plate and Sri islanders a top 2 finish this season.
For our women, who didn't qualify for the Asian Games ...plenty prep time to push up from 6th ...Japan, Hong Kong, China, Kazakhstan, Thailand...standing above.
Sudath Sampath will need to dig deeper than previous years..to craft our Sri islanders ...no 3 on the rankings.
Fair thoughts methinks...from my work experience....helping their climb from 12th to 5th and Asian Plate champions 2 years running...my job was to make them fit and believe.
Now it's time to boost that to 3rd in Asia.
Music to our rugby hearts and all Sri islanders if ....the U20 grab the championship, our men the silver and 2nd....our women bronze and 3rd.
What a wonderful world it would be...
The future looks promising and strong...but we the previous lot, need it stronger,...we want to sit back, cheer in admiration and maximum pride pouring from our gills, remembering our time in that Sri Lanka pride jersey!
Bula bula our history that endures, and blessings to the new Sri warriors to carry our flag.
Cheers!
