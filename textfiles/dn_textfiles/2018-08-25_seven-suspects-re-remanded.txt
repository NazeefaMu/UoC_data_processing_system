All seven suspects, in connection with the shooting of Kirivehera Viharadhipathi Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera, were re-remanded by Tissamaharama Magistrate Lakshman Priyankara Atapattu until August 29.

The suspects are charged with the attempted murder of the Thera, returning to the temple after performing religious activities at Kirivehera along with several bhikkus on June 12 at about 10.40 pm.
Ven. Vidapola Sobitha Thera, a teacher at Janadipathi Vidyalaya, Kataragama was critically injured in the shooting.
Attorney-at-law Deepika Samanmali, appearing on behalf of two suspects told courts that their bail applications have been forwarded to the High Court, but it was not possible to obtain bail due to the delay in further investigations by Kataragama Police.
Kataragama Police said the delay in obtaining telephone call reports had caused the delay of investigations.
Attorney-at-law D. Wickramasinghe also appeared for the suspects.
