Europe unlikely to be favourable market for Sri Lanka: Patali

Europe is not going to be a favourable market for Sri Lanka in future with political changes taking place in many countries in the European Union, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
He said although the country received the GSP plus facility, there would be little use of it. The country would be urged to find alternative foreign markets for the country's exports, he said.
"2017 is a significant year for politics in Europe. It would affect Sri Lankan Exports as well," the minister said.
"The two main political parties in France have not been able to bring their candidates to the presidential election. This failure will have its effects on global politics and economy," he said.
The minister said a General Election has been called for in the UK this year. It is expected that the Conservative party will gain the victory. The election to elect the German President will be held in September, he said.
