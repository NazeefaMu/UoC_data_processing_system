Floods, landslides wreak havoc

South West Monsoon starts:
Flash floods and landslides triggered by incessant rains killed more than 50 people in the Kalutara, Galle and Matara districts leaving hundreds of families homeless.
Many districts experienced heavy down pour ending a long spell of dry weather last week. Many parts of the country experienced torrential rains with the onset of the South West Monsoon ending the drought of more than five months.
Hundreds of families in the banks of Ginganga, Nilwala, Kalu and Ve and Kuru rivers were forced to leave their houses as water levels were on the rise creating floods in the area. Hundreds of houses in the Elapatha Divisional Secretariat area in the Ratnapura district came under water with the overflowing of Hangamuwa canal.
The government deployed the Tri Forces for the rescue of thousands of people trapped in floods and landslides in the Kalutara and Galle districts. The Air force deployed helicopters to the affected areas to assist the rescue operation, while the Navy boats were in operation in flood hit areas to bring the people affected by floods to safer places.
District Secretaries with the help of Disaster Management officials at district level are providing facilities to the flood affected. Relief camps have been kept ready to provide accommodation to the people who are displaced by the floods and landslide in every district.
Hundreds of people in Hangamuwa, Aluketiya, Mudduwa, Muwagama, Kahangama, Devalagawa were displaced by the flash floods. Many villagers at Hamgamuwa in Ratnapura said they did not experience any sign of flood when they went to sleep on Thursday night.
Chaminda Prasad Wickremasinghe of Hangamuwa said he was fast asleep when he heard residents yelling out Ganwathura Enawo (Flood coming)
“The water level of my hardware shop rose to above six feet within 30 minutes," he said.
He said his hardware store came under water within an hour destroying cement, paints and other items stored for sale.
