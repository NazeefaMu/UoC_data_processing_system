Deakin honours PM with a doctorate

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is on a four day official visit to Australia was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Deakin University of Australia yesterday in recognition of his long service as a Parliamentarian, Minister and Prime Minister and the role he played in steering the country to a high status in the economic, education and human rights fields.At the convocation at Deakin University’s main hall, the Chancellor of the University Prof. John Stanhope conferred the honorary doctorate on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Prof. Jane Den Hollander reading out the citation said several factors including Prime Minister Wickremesinghe’s contribution towards steering the country to a high international status, tactfulness in getting LTTE terrorists into the negotiating table, creating the groundwork for obtaining financial assistance from the international community and dedication towards setting up good governance were taken into account for awarding this degree.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe addressing the gathering at the convocation ceremony said a person’s ambition in life should be to overcome setbacks with perseverance and move forward rather than to avoid such setbacks.
Wickremesinghe who said that we are living in an ever changing world added that we should also change our future course to suit such changes. Understanding the demands and opportunities available in this changing world would lay the foundation for a successful life, he said.
Premier Wickremesinghe also quoted the Buddhist Stanza “Mano Pubbangama Dhamma” to emphasise the importance of controlling ones mind and thoughts in this ever changing world.
The Prime Minister said: “I wish to thank you all for this honour bestowed on me by conferring this honorary degree. I am all the more happy because Deakin University is a leading education institution having special ties and several co-operation agreements with counterparts in Sri Lanka. This university has been named after former Australian Prime Minister Alfred Deakin. Prime Minister Deakin visited Sri Lanka in 1893 to study Sri Lanka’s 1000 year old ancient irrigation technology. Sri Lankan professionals are undergoing training at the Law Faculty of the Deakin University. Many Sri Lankan students are studying at this university and some are today receiving their degrees at this convocation.”
The Prime Minister said he too is a product of a university. A university degree opened up limitless vistas in a competitive world, he said.
Addressing the graduands who obtained their degrees, the Prime Minister said they were now entering the university of life where they should and try to follow leadership, be humble in disposition and learn from others. If they were to be victorious in life they should also learn to face defeat as well. They should try be undettered both during success and failure.
Nearly 300 graduands were conferred degrees at this convocation.
Executive Director of the Deakin University’s Law Centre Athula Pathinayake said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe joined the long line of world Prime Ministers including Malcolm Fraser, Kenneth Kaunda and Julia Guillard who received the honorary doctorate from Deakin University.
Immediately after the convocation ceremony Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe directed Prime Minister’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake to ensure that the “Dr” tag is not attached to his name in official or personal matters.
Prof Maithri Wickremesinghe, Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa, N.P. Liyanage de Soysa, Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, Prime Minister’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Sri Lanka High Commissioner in Australia Somasundaram Skandakumar Australian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka Bret Hucheson and Prime Minister’s Additional Secretary Saman Athaudahetty were also present on the occasion.
