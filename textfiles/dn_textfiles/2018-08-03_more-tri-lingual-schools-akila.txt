More tri-lingual schools - Akila

The Education Ministry had made preparations to increase the number of tri-lingual schools in the country, Education Minister Akila Wiraj Kariyawasam said.
During the first phase of the programme, the ministry would set up tri-lingual schools at Kottawa, Wellawatta, Wattala, Kalutara and several other areas, once the Cabinet paper in this regard received Cabinet approval, he said.
The minister was addressing a prize-giving ceremony held at Vivekananda National College, Colombo, on Wednesday.
Minister Kariyawasam said the present government treated all schools equally, unlike the previous regime.
He said there were only a few tri-lingual schools such as Vivekananda National College in the country, adding that the government aimed at providing all students with equal facilities, regardless the medium.
Following examinations, 3,000 teachers were recruited to fill vacancies of principals that had prevailed for years, he said; moreover, vacancies in the Teacher Education Service and the Education Administrative Service, had also been filled, and the candidates were provided with the proper training, both local and foreign.
“The country could be developed by developing human resources, and human resources could be developed through education. Hence, education has a pivotal role to play. That is way the government has taken measures to uplift the education sector,” the minister added.
