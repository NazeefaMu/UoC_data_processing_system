SC ruling, a victory for the people - JVP

A wrongful decision of the Executive was reversed by the judiciary for the first time in the country’s history, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said.
Speaking at a press conference at the JVP Headquarters in Battaramulla yesterday, the JVP MP pointed out that the Supreme Court ruling on Thursday was a victory for the progressive people, supremacy of law and the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
He said a massive rally has been organised at 3 pm at Kirula Grounds in Kirulapone today to mark Thursday’s victory and galvanise the people to make it a real victory of theirs.
“The JVP right from the beginning said that we would do everything in our capacity to defeat the conspiracy. We waged our battle in Parliament, in the Courts of law and on the streets. The Supreme Court verdict sealed the victory for our struggle,” MP Herath said.
He invited all citizens who fought to defeat the coup to attend the rally. He further said that the JVP would start a two-week hand-out distribution campaign from Monday to make the public aware that the fight must continue to achieve a real people’s victory. Herath also pointed out that the new Cabinet of Ministers should not exceed 30 as the UPFA has officially withdrawn from the Unity Government.
He pointed out that the JVP has no objection in giving the Opposition Leader and Chief Opposition Whip posts to the UPFA, when the UPFA members sit in the Opposition in the absence of a National Government.
He further said the JVP would spur the 20th Amendment to the Constitution taking note of the recent developments in the country. “The people have now realized how harmful it can be when too much power is concentrated on one individual. We will push the 20th Amendment in Parliament and then seek the people’s approval for it at a referendum,” he said. He said Thursday’s Supreme Court ruling was possible because of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. “There were many false criticisms on the 19th Amendment, but now it is clear that the 19th Amendment only contained correct, progressive and democratic reforms,” MP Herath added
