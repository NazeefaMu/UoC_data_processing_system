More afternoon showers predicted

The Meteorology Department yesterday predicted that the enhancement of afternoon showers over the island is expected to continue today and tomorrow due to turbulence in the lower atmosphere.
Duty Meteorologist Janak Kumara told the Daily News that the turbulent motions impact on the formation and existence of fog and boundary-layer clouds could result in more showers.
He further said that showers or thundershowers will occur in the Northern Province and several places along the coastal areas of the North-Western Province. Showers or thundershowers will occur at most places elsewhere particularly after 2.00 p.m. Heavy rain fall of about 100 mm can be expected at some places, particularly in Central, Uva, Sabaragamuwa and North-Central Provinces and in the Galle, Matara Districts. There may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers. The public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning activity.
