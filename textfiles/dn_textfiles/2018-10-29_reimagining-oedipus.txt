Reimagining oedipus

“When I open the fridge my laptop is in there; the phone, the television remote. You shout for me in the middle of the night and when I come running you ask what I’m doing there. You are not Gretel, you say. My daughter Gretel was wild and beautiful. You are not her.”
Writes the heroine of Daisy Johnson’s debut novel, ‘Everything Under’ - Shortlisted for the Man Booker, 2018. (In spite of being the bestselling book on the shortlist and the odds in Johnson’s favor the prize went to Anna Burns’s Milkman).
It is natural if you feel skeptical when you read the blurb on the cover, written by author Celeste Ng because you would probably have read elsewhere that the story is a retelling of Oedipus Rex and you already know Oedipus is tragic but not too scary. As you turn the pages and step deeper and deeper into the story, however, some of your doubts will vanish “like broken wine glasses in the dark and then are gone.” True to Ng’s words, this is a book “ Weird and Wild and Wonderfully Unsettling.”
Weird? Undeniably. Wild? Definitely. Unsettling? Yes, a million times over. But, Wonderful? I am not so sure. Especially if you go to bed with ‘Everything Under’ on a stormy night such as the ones we are going through right now, with thunder and lightning and heavy winds thrashing on your window panes. If you hear strange noises outside, close your eyes and cover your head with a pillow. For all you know it might be ‘Bonak’ trying to get in.
Bonak the monster. No, he is not in Sophocles’s Oedipus. Nor is there such a word in the Oxford English Dictionary or in any other English Dictionary for that matter. Nor would you have ever heard any of the following words either: harpidoodle, sheesh, duvduv, effie... You wouldn’t know them because these are words Daisy Johnson invents for her characters - an attribute praised by Booker Prize Chair of judges, Kwame Appiah as “a miracle of stylistic invention.”
The protagonist of ‘Everything Under’ is Gretel whose childhood is spent with her mother Sarah in an engine-less houseboat moored in a quiet part of the River Thames, sharing a private world defined by a vocabulary known only to the two of them. Not surprisingly Gretel grows up to become a lexicographer, and ends up spending her days alone, examining the various meanings for real words like “break” and “dread”. When the story begins, Gretel is coaxing Sarah into telling her life story – an endeavor made tougher by Sarah’s dementia – vividly described in the opening pages as seen above.
If you feel Gretel’s relationship with her mother is unsettling wait till you read more, wait till Gretel comes across an old acquaintance, Marcus, who (as told in another thread, from his point of view) spent part of his youth on the boat with Gretel and Sarah, after committing murder while in the grip of a nightmare. If this is not enough to spin you around, you will soon learn Marcus “was, to begin with, Margot.” In other words there are no fixed categories of “man” or “woman” in this book. As the New Yorker pointed out, in Johnson’s hands, “masculine and feminine signifier slide around like raindrops on a pane of glass.”
In such a setting its natural that Oedipus is not really Oedipus. Johnson transforms Oedipus into the girl Gretel who lives in modern Britain. In this new version of the Greek tragedy Johnson explores questions of fate and free will, gender fluidity, and fractured family relationships. She also focuses on womanhood as a trap.
“There is no escaping... the way we will end up is coded into us from the moment we are born,” Sarah tells Gretel. “Any decisions we make are only mirages,ghosts to convince us of free will.”
Johnson who became the youngest author ever to make the Man Booker prize shortlist, talking about the importance of classical mythology in a modern-day setting and the current trend for classical Greek literature to be re-written from a woman’s point of view says, “This year has been a good one for retellings; they’re everywhere.
I think retellings have the power to talk about the world we live in from a different angle, to trick the reader into seeing through a lens. The classics often speak about universal things that affect us all. There is something, also, about the orality of them which I think speaks to writers.”
When the New Statement asked her (before the Man Booker 2018 winner was announced), “Are we all doomed?” she had this to say. “Of course.
Even if we don’t die from global warming or a nuclear event we are fast moving away from any sort of happiness that will enable us to exist without feeling we are living doomed lives.”
This may not be the perfect way to begin your Monday. But let’s look at the bright side. Somewhere out there Sophocles must be smiling.
