Amana Bank Q1 profit tops Rs 66 mn

Amana Bank recorded a successful first quarter in which the bank achieved a profit before tax of Rs. 92.5 million, reflecting a remarkable YoY growth of 83 percent from the corresponding period in 2016.
The bank’s profit after tax for the same period grew by 74 percent to reach Rs 66.6 million.
CEO Mohamed Azmeer said, “I am happy to note that in line with its five-year strategic plan, the bank has been successful in maintaining its upward momentum. This reflects the growing acceptance of our people friendly banking model. I am confident the numbers we have achieved will add impetus to our forthcoming rights issue, which in turn, will support the future expansion of business.”
The bank recently announced a rights issue to support its growth and comply with the regulatory capital requirements.
