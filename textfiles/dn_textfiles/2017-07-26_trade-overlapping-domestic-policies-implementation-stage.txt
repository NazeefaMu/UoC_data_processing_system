'Trade overlapping domestic policies at implementation stage'

Trade policies overlaps domestic policies when it comes to a implementing stage and Sri Lanka has to take proactive steps towards larger targets while embarking on new trade liberalization processes, export promotion targets, Brooking India Executive Director Harsha Vardhana Singh said.
He was speaking at the Economic Summit Held in Colombo yesterday. Citing Sri Lanka as the best performer in terms of technological readiness, health and primary education, higher educational training and within South Asia, he added that ,“Sri Lanka has a lot of strength, however, these efforts must be given far more loudly; it is the right kind of approach. I
don’t think it is being done.”
He further added that in a dynamic world, efforts were also needed to be made particularly to link with new products and technology. Moreover, he noted that time is getting compressed due to impacts of emerging technological changes and emphasized that it is high time for the
government and relevant authorities to take proactive measures to develop domestic industries and regulatory processes to address challenges arising from technological advances .
