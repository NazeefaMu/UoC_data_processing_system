SANNA the Master Blaster  like no other in the World

They were batting volcanoes and were rearing to erupt. When they erupted ,as they did in the historic World Cup in 1995/’96, they spewed hot lava on the opposing bowlers and teams. It had them scurrying for cover as the opponents stood in a trance in wonderment watching the explosive batting display that they put on show.
I am referring to those two ‘pals of mine’ as sang Lord Fle of those two little ‘pals of mine’ Ramadin and Valentine after they spun West Indies to victory over England – SANATH TERAN JAYASURIYA and ROMESH SHANTHA KALUWITHARNE.
The duo formed a devastating pair of explosive opening batsmen. They turned the game on its head giving a new concept to what opening batsmen should do. Since the inception of the World Cup in England in 1975, the cricketing world had not seen this new concept that JAYASURIYA and KALUWITHARNE put on display by going over the top in the first 15 overs when there was field restrictions and accumulating big runs.
Both were powerfully built opening batsmen. They feasted on the opposing bowlers like hyenas and when ball hit bat, it rocketed over the fielders. Runs and boundaries flowed as they put on totals of over 80 to 90 runs in the first 15 overs and paved the way for batsmen who followed to take the team to imposing totals that dispirited, frustrated and lured the opponents to destruction.
The opposing teams were in a daze not knowing what was hitting them. It was the traditional thing to go slow in the first 15 overs, losing few wickets and keeping in reserve batsmen who could put bowlers to the sword in the final 15 overs although there were no fielding restrictions.
Fell by the way side
Many opening batsmen tried to copy the style of JAYASURIYA and KALUWITHARNE, but sadly fell by the way side, not knowing the know how. In the limited over tournaments that followed opposing teams tried this ploy, but with little success as they did not have destroyers like JAYASURIYA and KALUWITHRANE. To them goes the credit of introducing a new concept to the game.
JAYASURIYA was tagged the ‘MATARA MAULER’, the ‘MASTER BLASTER’ and the writer who closely followed the unwinding of his phenomenal career from the time he scored two unbeaten double hundred on a tour of Pakistan with the Sri Lanka A’ team tagged him the ‘BLACK SUPERMAN’. KALUWITHARNE was tagged ‘LITTLE KALU’ by that South African born England captain and Commentator Tony Greig who was excited and elated by this small made big hitting wonder.
First to JAYASURIYA. From the time he was knee high to a bat, his one ambition was to hit the covers off the ball. Coming from a little known school down South, St.Servatius’ College, he did not have the elite or the best of coaches to show and tell him how and correct any flaw or technique in his play. But he had the DNA in him-- as tight as any vein or nerve would. And as his career bloomed and blossomed his natural technique and ability began to unwind thanks to the principal G.l.Galapathy and coach Lionel Wagasinghe.
He served notice of his immense potential making two unbeaten double hundreds with the Sri Lanka ‘A’ team in Pakistan and that was the stepping stone and the rock on which he built his fantastic career. A left hander gifted with a quick eye and excellent footwork, there was no thing called getting one’s eye in before launching. If the first ball was meant to be hit, he would take the plunge and hit with the result being a scorching four or a huge six. That was JAYASURIYA for you.
He played first division cricket for Bloomfield and Colombo Cricket Club and made telling scores and it was not long when he caught the eyes of the selectors who were quick to reward him with the national cap – the dream of any sportsman. And he adorned that cap with great respect and aplomb to the very end of a phenomenal and glittering career and his rocket like propelled hitting is still being spoken of in awe.
Shots were rocket propelled
JAYASURIYA’S eye catching shots were the cut and the pull. When he hit it was rocket propelled and the fielders and the bowlers were helpless and could only watch the flight of the ball as it sailed over between point and cover like a missile for maximum – six. He was one of the main players in the 1995/96 World Cup triumph and was rightly adjudged the ‘Most Valuable Player’ of the Tournament’ and won for him a sleek AUDI limousine.
He became the Sri Lankan batsman to make a massive triple hundred against India and when it looked as though he would break Brian Lara’s record of 374, he lunged forward and failed to keep the ball down and the ensuing ‘lolly’ was grabbed by Sourav Ganguly at silly mid off off Chauhan. The packed R.Premadasa Stadium saw a deathly silence when he was dismissed.
JAYASURIY held the record for the fastest 50 in 17 balls against Pakistan, fastest 100 against Pakistan in 48 balls and fastest 150 against England in 95 balls. He made a scintillating 213 against England at the Oval which helped Sri Lanka win that memorable Test match. In Sharjah he made a belligerent 189 against India and going for a hit what would have earned him a six and past Pakistan’s Saeed Anwer’s top score of 194 he was stumped off a wide ball from Ganguly. To him 4s and 6s hitting was chicken feed.
JAYASURIYA was an all rounder in the manner born. In addition to his belligerent left hand batting, he was a feared left arm spinner and as a fielder he was a Colin Bland and a Jonty Rhodes in any position. He was also an example of a sportsman. Once he took a bump catch and before the umpire could raise his dreaded second finger, he signaled to the umpire that he caught it on the bump. He also captained the Country with distinction and when everyone was losing theirs and blaming it on him he doffed his captaincy.
To mention his achievements and records will need reams and reams. Historians and statisticians have done that for posterity but suffice to say, he played – TESTS 110 –RUNS 6973 – HIGHEST 340 – HUNDREDS 14 – FIFTIES 31- FOURS 910 – SIXES 59 --- ODIS 445 – RUNS 13,430 –HIGHEST 189 – HUNDREDS 28 – FIFTIES 68 – FOURS -1500 – SIXES 270 ---- T20s 31 – RUNS 629 – HIGHEST 88 –FOURS 76 – SIXES 23. BOWLING TESTS 119 – 98 wkts --- ODIS 445 matches 323 wkts --- T20s 31 matches 19 wickets.
