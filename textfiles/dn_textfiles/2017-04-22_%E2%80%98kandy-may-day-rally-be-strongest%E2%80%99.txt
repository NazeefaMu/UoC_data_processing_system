‘Kandy May Day rally to be the strongest’

The May Day rally to be held in Kandy, will be the strongest May Day rally in the history of the country, Gampaha District SLFP Organiser Ajith Basnayake said.
According to Basnayake, the rally to be held under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena will be the biggest rally in the country’s history since thousands of people will join it representing all part of the country. Basnayake said so while addressing the SLFP Kantha Balamandala committee meeting in Yakkala, Gampaha recently.
He said no one can form political parties by holding May Day rallies. The Joint Opposition will prove that they don’t have the power of the people.
