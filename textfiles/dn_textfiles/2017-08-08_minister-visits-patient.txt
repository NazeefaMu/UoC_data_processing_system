Minister visits patient

The 34-year-old female patient who underwent a heart transplant surgery at the Kandy General Hospital on July 7 is doing well.
The Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne visited her recently, Health Ministry sources said.
Minister Senaratne thanked the doctors, nurses and the health staff who carried out the surgery and looked after the patient when the minister visited the hospital for the second time after the surgery was performed.
The Minister had stated that the heart transplant surgery, the first heart transplant in Sri Lanka, was a miracle as it was performed with minimum facilities.
Minister Senaratne admired the courage and unity of the doctors who carried out the surgery, the sources said. The donor was a 24-year-old brain dead male patient. His kidneys were transplanted to two kidney patients, the sources said.
