Politicians should take policy decisions: Navin

Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said that politicians should take decisions based on policy and not on personal reasons as the people are now very much politically intelligent.
“The people know the reasons why politicians make various statements on various occasions,” the Minister said.
“We should engage in honest politics by always taking decisions based on policy and not on personal reasons,” Minister Dissanayake said.
“Sri Lanka has a long history of strong and democratic political culture. People are intelligent and they do not hesitate to change the governments when power is abused. Politicians should not think that they can remain in power for ever.Hardwork and clean politics make successful leaders who make correct decisions on time,” he added. Minister Dissanayake was speaking at a ceremony in Colombo yesterday to distribute 80 motorcycles to field officers attached to the Smallholder Tea and Rubber Revitalization (STARR) project implemented under the purview of Project Rubber Development Department.
