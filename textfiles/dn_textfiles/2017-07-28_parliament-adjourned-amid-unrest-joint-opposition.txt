Parliament adjourned amid unrest by Joint Opposition

 
Parliament was adjourned till August 4, a short while ago, amid unrest by the Joint Opposition (JO) on the Gazette listing petroleum as an essential service.
However, despite the unrest, a Parliament majority passed the Gazette declaring petroleum distribution an essential service.
The unrest displayed by members of the JO has delayed the debate on the Hambantota port agreement.
The Hambantota Port agreement was up for debate in Parliament today and scheduled to be inked on Saturday (29).
