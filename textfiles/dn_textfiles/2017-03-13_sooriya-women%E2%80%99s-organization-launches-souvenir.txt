Sooriya Women’s Organization launches souvenir

Sooriya Women’s Organization, Batticaloa celebrated its Silver Jubilee this year. To mark the occasion, the souvenir “ Kootru” was launched ceremonially at the Town Hall, Batticaloa on Saturday.
The ceremony was presided by Sooriya Women’s Organization President Prof. Cithralega Mownaguru. Batticaloa Magistrate M. Gamesaraja and Batticaloa Government Agent P.S.M. Charles were chief guests.
Sooriya women’s organization has been of immense benefit to the poverty-stricken, abused, conflict-affected, deserted, and widowed women of the North and East. In addition to providing them psychological advice, legal advice, legal representation, and livelihood opportunities, they have initiated a number of projects to provide employment to unemployed women. They have been campaigning for higher representation of women in Parliament, provincial councils, in local government bodies, and in politics.
