The Beruwala China Fort Mosque Association has made a great contribution towards strengthening national reconciliation by donating relief goods valued at Rs 7.5 million to distribute among disaster affected people in the Ratnapura district, said Ven. Walathara Subhuthi Nayake Thera, Secretary, Amarapura Sambuddha Shasanodaya Maha Sangha Sabha and Viharadhipati, Walathara Meththaramaya Beruwala.
