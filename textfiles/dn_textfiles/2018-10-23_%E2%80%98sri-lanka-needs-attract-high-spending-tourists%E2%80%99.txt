‘Sri Lanka needs to attract  high spending tourists’

One of the key problems repeatedly highlighted by the Travel industry is the lack of accurate data and this is an issue that has to be addressed soon.
This issue was highlighted at the Tourism Leaders Conference titled ‘Integration of Global Value Chains for Sustainable Tourism Development: Way Forward for Sri Lanka Tourism’. The event was organized jointly by Sri Lanka Tourism and the University of Colombo at BMICH.
It was pointed out that for years, the Government has been releasing numbers that do not differentiate between the formal and informal sectors adequately to understand how many foreigners are tourists, where they stay, how much they spend, and their level of expectations. “Without in-depth data, policymakers cannot understand the direction the industry should take, which affects the entire value chain,” speakers at Forum said.
It was pointed out by speakers that when compared to its neighbours, Sri Lanka boasts a most enviable variety in sights and attraction. Wildlife safaris, exotic marine life, beautiful sandy beaches, cozy cold climate escapes, deep sea diving, ancient ruins. “Yet Sri Lanka’s promotion abroad is very limited when compared to the work that countries with far less to offer put in.” Furthermore, the protection of its natural resources has been woefully inadequate.
Meanwhile Chairman Ranjit Fernando, SriLankan Airlines said that Sri Lanka tourism and the national carrier should jointly promote the destination.
