Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka
Simplicity and patience were his greatest treasures
Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka was a fearless man, who never feared anybody or anything, always stood by the correct thing and above all, had a manly heart. He was so courageous that he was ready to fight and to fight, even when hope was out of site.
As a politician, he never wanted to retire, he said, and wanted to live his life, forgetting his age and never to retire from living. Above all, he enjoyed living like a humble villager and enjoyed being himself. Simplicity and patience, was observed to a very great extent in his life. Those qualities were his greatest treasures.
His achievements were born of great sacrifice. He had good faith, and positive thinking, confidence in himself, and devotion to hard work. These excellent qualities, enabled him to do a remarkably great service to the nation and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as its General Secretary over the years, without caring for trouble making personalities.
One of his biggest contributions to the country was during the last few years of the separatist war – mainly from 2006 to 2009, when he was the Premier. He never knew about fear and he was so brave and fearless, while threatening Velupillai Prabhakaran with death and the LTTE terrorist leaders, again and again, saying that Prabhakaran’s days are numbered; ‘in three months hence, Prabhakaran would be three metres under the earth and so on.’
This type of brave speeches helped boost morale of our armed forces on one hand, and helped the campaign to attract urgently needed new recruits to our armed forces on the other. That way his contribution was immensely valuable for the country at that time.
He was never a racist. A Sinhala Buddhist at heart he always respected all religions and ethnic groups without any difference. We have never seen any occasion, where he has shown, any difference under whatever the circumstances, all were Sri Lankans to him. He was by all means, for a unitary Sri Lanka and valued always the sovereignty of our country. After passing out as a young lawyer, at the party reforms, I was selected as the SLFP organiser for Balapitiya in 1979. Since then, I became fairly close to this gentleman, who was the General Secretary of the party. We continued our friendship for the last nearly 40 years.
In the early 80's, may be at least once a week, we used to meet and discuss political matters at Rathna Deshapriya Senanayake’s residence at Castle Street, Borella, with Dharmasiri Senanayake, Lakshman Jayakody, Senerath Somarathna, Harischandra Mendis, Nimal Siripala de Silva and Vijaya Kumarathunga etc.
All sorts of arguments regarding various subjects were discussed with their deep knowledge on men and matters, where we were lucky to enrich our political knowledge with Wickramanayaka’s great contributions especially to me as I was the youngest in that circle. Around 1995 when I was the District Judge of Hambantota, one morning he rang me, to say that he was coming there. He said he will not visit me and even for a cup of tea. To that extent, he was conscious and concerned about the members of the judiciary.
During the 2010 Presidential Election campaign, I accompanied him to many a meeting, in different parts of the country by helicopter. I traveled with him throughout Kalutara district, during the general election by car. Once, after a grand meeting to felicitate him, for completing 50 years in politics in 2010, in Horana, we were to go to a well-wisher's house for lunch. After the event, though we were seated together, he went to the car and left. I continued to be seated at the same place at the venue, though I knew, we were to go for lunch together with him.
A little later, he had remembered me and the car immediately returned. While proceeding, he inquired as to why I did not join him. I said: ‘You didn’t invite me.’ He apologised for the lapse on his part. He was such a humble and genuine gentleman with noble qualities.
He cared very little for money and during election times, he sold a few acres of his ancestral land for the campaign. He never uttered a word about his loss. He had boundless enthusiasm, and worked with resolution, to overcome even so called impossibilities. He had been a man, who had honour, and one would not lie. He believed in persistence and determination as the most important factors to make this place we live in a better one.
Although he appeared rough and ruthless, and a vociferous speaker inspiring the supporters, he was merciful, gentle, gracious, kind and humane, compassionate and tender hearted.
All his good qualities and trustworthiness, helped him to be the Prime Minister under former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and also equally, under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He was also the Senior Advisor to President Maithripala Sirisena.

Christopher Gregory Weeramantry
He made his name, and that of Sri Lanka echo worldwide
Each and every nation treasures a selected band of very special sons and daughters; the eminently gifted ones in any given domain of human endeavour. Christopher Gregory Weeramantry will go into history as such a son to Sri Lanka. He will also keep a special place in the hearts of many of his fellow-countrymen.
The surname Weeramantry is spoken of with respect throughout the country: Christopher’s father Gregory and his elder brother Lucian earned their spurs in national history. But Christopher was to reach well beyond the national compound. He made his name, ánd that of his beloved Sri Lanka echo worldwide.
None perhaps of the eminent legal and social minds Sri Lanka gave birth to ever exerted such an impact on global thought as did “The Judge”, as he was lovingly called. For there was a personal element to it as well. By virtue of his gentle, mild personality, his irresistible charm - topped by that enchanting smile – Christopher Weeramantry, with enviable ease, laced together strings of friends and admirers worldwide.
Christopher Weeramantry was gifted with a rare legal and philosophical genius, a photographic memory, an astoundable energy and a formidable drive and will-power. For all of this, he will be remembered first and foremost for his courageous stand on principle when it counted most, when he was faced with one of the greatest challenges met in the history of the Bench which he served with such pride and honour: the International Court of Justice in The Hague (1991-2000). His valiant defence, in the trenches of the law, of the unconditional ban on Nuclear Weapons will be remembered as the zenith of his moral endeavours.
Some people manage to rise to the occasion: with Christopher Weeramantry one felt he was hand-picked and groomed all his life to serve the world. Rarely, even in the impressive, century-old records of the highest judicial authority the modern world boasts as the outcome of a chequered process and at the end of a long and winding road, will one find a Judge whose in-depth humanity, truly universal outlook and inter-cultural learning shone so eminently and persuasively.
His stand in The Hague did not come by incident, though. At various critical moments in his long career Weeramantry spoke up on principle on acute political and ethical issues, be this in an academic capacity or in his position as a Judge of the Supreme Court in Colombo.
His stand against Apartheid in the final stages of the regime exemplifies the numerous ethical issues of compelling urgency that found lucid, and fundamental, treatment in Weeramantry’s publications.
We were honoured to edit a Congratulatory Volume to celebrate the 90th birthday of Judge Weeramantry, on November 17, 2016. The volume is titled One World, One Home, One Law For All, A Tribute to Christopher Gregory Weeramantry, and will appear shortly. In the publication some 60 colleagues, pupils and friends from a range of disciplines amply review the width and wealth of Weeramantry’s multi-faceted career. They address his seminal tenets on such varying issues as Humanitarian Law; Sustainable Development and the Right of Future Generations; Trusteeship; Equality & Freedom; Science & Ethics; Xenotransplantation; Law & Equity; Judicial Integrity and Law & Religion.
The rich harvest of his numerous Opinions and publications marks Christopher Weeramantry as one of the most intriguing legal thinkers of the 20th Century. Paramount in this philosophy are his unfailing belief in the global perspective and in the fundamental equality of all human beings, next to his reliance on the capacity of Man to overcome the unsettling challenges the world faces today. And something else is noteworthy. In perceiving the role of the Law and the Judiciary Weeramantry insists on the quintessential unity of the Law; on the imperative of its interaction with Society; on normative moral values and such concepts as Justice and Equity; last, but not least, on the pertinence of the world’s rich cultural and religious traditions - the reflection of humanity’s accumulated experience and wisdom - as sources of inspiration to draw up the Universal Law of the Future.
And this brings us back to Sri Lanka. No Judge in the history of the World Court was so adamant on revitalising the interaction of Law and Religion. It was a tantalising quest Judge Weeramantry embarked on, not just in view of the prevailing Western legal tradition of four centuries, but no less on account of current clashes and skirmishes.
Still, there is no coincidence here. Not just his Opinions in The Hague, but numerous books and publications, even his poetry, reveal Weeramantry’s penetrating thought on the views conceived in Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam with respect to the Judiciary. To that extent he proudly presented himself as the product of that multi-cultural and pluriform religious tradition of his home country.
But it likewise revealed the heartache he felt witnessing the troubled times his country had been through. There is a wealth - not just of learning and knowledge but, what counts most in the final analysis, of Wisdom and Humanity in the tracts and treatises the Judge leaves his fellow-countrymen of all denominations. And this is the rich legacy he presents on a silver platter to his country in recognition of the debt he always felt he owed his Island of Serendipity.

Princie Perera
I will never forget her
Mihindukulasuriya Mary Annie Perera was born in Chilaw on January 25, 1921. She was well known as “Princie”. She was the only daughter of Peter Perera who was an Interpreter Mudliyar at the Chilaw Courts and Agnus Perera who was a housewife.
She had three elder brothers named Flemmin, Dudley and Lawrence. She lived at “Princie Villa“, No 53, Alluthwatte Road,Chilaw.
She had her school education at St Mary’s Convent, Chilaw and was a very smart and intelligent student. She was good in almost all the subjects and always wanted to become a nurse. Though she was very keen on higher education she had to stop her studies as her mother was sick. She married her life partner D.P. Perera (D P master) from Chilaw and had three children Dunston, Siyani (my mother) and Sharmaline.
I was very lucky as my childhood was strongly influenced by my grandmother. As my mother was reluctant to enter hospital for confinement when I was to be born, my grandmother had to arrange a room in her house with all facilities including a midwife and a doctor. I was born at “Princie Villa” on a sunny morning in March and the first to see me in this world was my grandmother.
As I was born as the first grandchild to the “Perera” family, she was very thrilled with my arrival. She once told me it was the happiest day in her life. She had performed the Sinhala tradition ritual “Ran Kiri Kata Gema” amidst all the relatives on my christening day.
She used her wedding ring with my mother’s breast milk. My mother told me that my grandmother used to lullaby me singing Indrani Perera’s Dilhani Duwani.
The second chapter began when my sister was born and my grandmother decided to look after me as my mother was struggling with two little children. I moved to Chilaw again as a two-year-old. She looked after me very well. We slept on the same bed and she always made sure that my nose touched her lower part of the neck. Once I asked her why she always wanted me to sleep in that posture (as I felt uncomfortable) and she said she needed to feel my breath and make sure that I was living. I was with my grandmother, grandfather and aunt for five years till I moved to Colombo to join my parents as I had to start schooling at Holy Family Convent, Bampalapitiya.
She was a very clever and famous in Chilaw. She used to help people whenever they needed. I can remember people borrowing her jewellery for functions and weddings. She was very good in cooking and sewing. She used to stitch all her grandchildren’s clothes including uniforms, petticoats and undergarments.
For our birthdays, Christmas, functions and weddings she used to stitch clothes. I can remember for my concert at the nursery, she did all the outfits including the headdress to be worn as an animal. She made me a Teddy Bear out of old socks for the performance with a teddy bear.
All these were done with her inbuilt cleverness and artistic ideas. There was no access to internet to get ideas in the early 70’s. No ready made costumes or outfits were available as now. She annually organised a pilgrimage to Madu church. She saved money from September to July every year and spent on the annual pilgrimage in August. She used to come from Chilaw to the Maradana railway station with my grandfather and domestic aid and our family joined them there.
We used to travel in the night mail train which started in the late evening from Maradana railway station. Dinner was roast beef, butter and bread every year. A cup of ginger tea was given after dinner. We slept till the train reached the Madu Road station. A hopper treat was given at the Madu Road station for breakfast by my grandmother. These hoppers were made by old women who ran small boutiques in cadjan huts near the station. We used to stay there for seven days and she was the one who organised menus for all the meals for all seven days. She used to arrange five dresses from five different coloured materials stitched by her for my sister and me to dress for evening novenas.
She always preferred to dress siblings in same manner which she had done for my mother and her sister when they were young,and for me and my sister when we were young. I have the same habit now when I choose frocks for my two daughters. I can remember how she dealt with the labourers to get the tent or the house in order. Till 1982 we enjoyed the annual pilgrimage to Madu church organised by her, which stopped due to the war. She was fluent in all three languages Sinhala, English and Tamil. She could deal with Indian labourers and vendors well, as she knew their language.
Her maternal great grandfather was an ayurvedic doctor and she inherited all his medical books. She used to prepare one of his medicines used for tetanus. I can remember people tapping at the gate calling “Princie Nona”. Those were her customers to buy “Gammiris Kude Behetha” (Pepper powder medicine). Fishermen especially took it as a “first aid” when they went out to the rough sea to have it as precautionary measure for them for tetanus caused by cuts and injuries from nails etc in the boats.
She was very good in treating the sick. I hardly remember going to the doctors during the five years I lived with her. She used to treat me with her own medicine and first aid.
She had a habit of taking me to the studio on my birthday to get a photograph with the birthday cake. One year she could not organise a cake and she took a cardboard box, glued an embroidery lace around it and made the cardboard box look like an icing cake. The black and white photograph looked perfect. Till I was 16 years, she forced me and dragged me to the studio for the so called “Birthday photograph”, but ended on my 16th birthday as the cameraman asked whether we came for the ID or Passport photo. On that day she felt after the 16th birthday, photographs were not necessary. I have all 16 birthday photographs with me.
She used to come with my mother to see me when I was at the University. I can remember how she used to joke with my batch mates, especially the boys. She was very proud of me as I was the first to enter university out of her children and grandchildren. The last chapter of her life was spent with my parents, her grandchildren and great grandchildren. She was sick at the age of 80 and passed away on March 12, 2001.Eternal rest to you “Mamma”.

Sirisena Koralearachchi
A father like no other
My father Sirisena Koralearachchi was a senior graduate teacher of Royal College, Colombo. He was born on January 21, 1942 in Yatigala, Veerakatiya Gamsaba, North of Giruwapaththuwa in the Hambantota district.
This village consisted of natural resources and wild-life. The surrounding forests, were nourished by inter-monsoonal rains. Most villagers led a simple and charming life, and my father’s father was a farmer.
In my father’s village there were no government or private schools, established at that time. My paternal grand-father, Wilbert Koralearachchi manged to build a primary school with support from the village temple head and several villagers. The name of the school was Tharaperiya Primary School, which still exists today. My father was incidentally the first student. My father, by his sheer dedication and commitment became the first proud graduate from the Beliatta electorate.
After graduating from Kelaniya Vidyalankara University, his first appointment was Sariputhra Maha Vidayalaya Matara in 1970.
He always loved to create and write Sinhala literature poems, and produce stage dramas. His talent was visible through the production of a spate of national stage dramas, which had the distinction of winning junior competition and senior competitions in 1973 and 1980.
During his tenure at Matara Denagam MahaVidyalaya, he produced and directed the stage drama “Kalahoda Passen” for the island-wide national competition, securing second place in 1973, in the junior category.
When teaching at Kelaniya Nagasena Vidyalaya, he produced and directed the stage drama “Ran Polawata Ran Dahadiya”, which competed nationally in the senior category. He won first place, bringing recognition to his school, which as a result gained recognition.
He took over the responsibilities to teach Sinhala and Social Studies to Ordinary Level students as a graduate teacher at Royal College in 1984, and went on to serve for two decades, until his retirement.
He was also instrumental in establishing a senior Sinhala Literature Club to initiate cultural activities to Royal College, and promote arts to a high level. Through his guidance for the first time in Royal College performed a Sinhala stage drama, titled, “Nomal Puthutu Aluth Lowak”. This drama was performed at the opening ceremony of Rajasisu Gama house scheme project at Ratnapura in 1986. This stage drama produced and directed by my father, was appreciated by the chief guest, then President Ranasinghe Premdasa.
I would like to give due respect to my father as the initiator who established the Art stream for Advanced Level students at Royal College. He did all these not for his own benefit but for the future of my alma mater, and the country.
He did not want titles or laurels. This was evident when he nominated two teachers from his own staff to hand over the responsibilities of the Sinhala Arts section. He however took pride in overlooking the programmes and made sure of its success. My father married Nanda Koralerarachchi in 1972. She was also a graduate teacher and shared a passion for teaching. My father met my mother when they were teaching at Denagama Maha Vidayalaya in Matara. During his retired life he did not waste time for unnecessarily. He used his time reading till midnight and wrote poems during the day. He also had a penchant for astrology and served more than a decade as an astrologer. He always lived true to his philosophy. He was always patient regarding any problem. I learnt a lot from his retired life, and how looked at problems in a very wise way. He was extremely patriotic and concerned about national problems. We discussed many times how we could make a positive contribution to solve these at a civic level.After fighting health issues he died on October 10, 2016. According to his last wish, his remains were gifted to the Colombo Medical Faculty on October 12, 2016.
May he attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana.
