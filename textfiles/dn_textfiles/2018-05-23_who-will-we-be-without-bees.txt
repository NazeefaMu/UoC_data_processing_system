Who will we be without bees?

The United Nations has declared June 18 as World Bees Day on the basis that bees and other pollinators such as butterflies, bats and hummingbirds are increasingly under threat from selfish human activities. An editorial in a daily newspaper has stated: Many people especially those not too concerned about the environmental issues and the vital need to maintain bio-diversity may be surprised that United Nations has declared this day on their calendar.
Some religions, especially Hinduism and Buddhism offer flowers at temples and Kovils with the expectation to gain merit to enter heaven or Nibbana. So do other religions to a lesser degree and at weddings. These are customs or rites brought down from generations to generations and have been done without any rational thinking.
I would wish to narrate my personal experience as a Buddhist. One early morning, as usual, I went to pluck flowers to be offered at the shrine room where a statue of the Buddha is placed. Nearing the flower plant which was in full bloom, I saw a beautiful butterfly sucking the nectar to satisfy its hunger, and also two bees hovering above for their food for the same purpose. As I got near, they flew away which made me sad for depriving these innocent creatures of satisfying their hunger.
Then I went to pluck a flower which was so beautiful in full bloom. Pausing for a moment, I thought, if I pluck this flower it will lose its fragrance in a few moments and deprive insects of their food. The flowers wither away preventing it to go through the process of producing a seed and a new plant of the same species. Am I committing a sin, a thought flashed through my mind? Then looking at the serene, peaceful, benign statue of the Buddha, I remembered as to what he did to pay homage, gratitude and reverence to the tree which gave him shelter and shade at the time he attained Enlightenment.
According to Buddhist scriptures, the Blessed One gazed at the tree for a week. If that is the gratitude paid by the One to whom Buddhists offer flowers as gratitude for preaching the Dhamma why cannot the Buddhists follow the same, without this carnage?
On further research, so to say, this practice had crept into Buddhism from Hinduism, as an Indian Buddhist monk Buddhagosa had come to Sri Lanka to read the Tripitaka, an epic, and translate it to Pali. In doing so, he may have included this rite of offering flowers in Buddhism as well. The other possible reason is that our ancient kings married Indian Princesses, built Kovils to please their queens and thus Hindu customs and religious rites entered Buddhism.
My purpose in writing is to check whether there is any possibility of convincing those who destroy nature, to stop this practice. It is rather a difficult task as religion is involved and we do not wish to break away from an age-old practice, but it must stop one day as we may lose some plants for not allowing to produce seeds to propagate and bees honey, a vital ingredient for medical treatment.
