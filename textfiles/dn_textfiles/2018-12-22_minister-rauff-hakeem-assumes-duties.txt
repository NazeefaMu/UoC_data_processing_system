Rauff Hakeem today assumed his duties as Minister of Town Planning Water Supply and Higher Education.He said that, he is ready to build a cordial rapport with the young generation aiming to address the issues in the higher education sector and the outcome of the recent political turmoil can be considered as a victory of democracy.He said that everyone should keep in mind that political posts are temporary. He added that there may be a series of elections next year. “But it is doubtable about which election comes first. There are a few persons who can decide which election to be held first. These persons should not exercise political agendas when calling an election as they should think of the future of the country when taking a decision for calling for an election” he said.He added that he personally believes that all these political issues can be solved if the President calls for a Presidential Election after January 8. There may be a general election by next September. It is regrettable that there may be struggles for power after the next general election also, he said.However he added that he is ready to intervene aiming to solve those probable political struggles after the next election.Speaking on his planned activities while in office, the Minister said that we Sri Lankan are proud to have a brainy, educated younger generation.“By going through posts on social media it is clear that the young generation is well educated and brainy. The higher Education sector should be reformed to go with the expectations. We have to design our university system in order to make a livelihood degree oriented” he noted.He further said that within a short period he cannot do much but he presumed that he takes every possible measure to establish a hassle free environment for higher education. We don’t have large expectation but he will try our level best.
