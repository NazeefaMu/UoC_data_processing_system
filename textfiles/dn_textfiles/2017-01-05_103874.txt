UPFA representative signs Delimitation Committee final report

UPFA representative Saliya Mathew yesterday signed the final report of the Delimitation Committee, Delimitation Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris said.
The much awaited report was not accepted by Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha on Monday when Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris handed over the report with the signatures of three members in the committee. Minister Mustapha pointed out that he cannot accept the report without all five members of the committee signing it. Minister Mustapha reiterated that he has to look into the legal provisions whether he can accept the report without the signatures of two out of the five member Committee appointed by him. When the minister refused to accept the report with a majority of the committee members signing it, Peiris revealed that United National Party’s A.S.M. Misbar and the United People’s Freedom Alliance’s K. Saliya Mathew refused to sign the report.
However, Mathew had signed the report yesterday and the UNP representative has not signed it as yet. “I don’t know why Mathew delayed in signing the report and I have no idea what UNP representative M. Misbar is going to do,” Peiris said.
