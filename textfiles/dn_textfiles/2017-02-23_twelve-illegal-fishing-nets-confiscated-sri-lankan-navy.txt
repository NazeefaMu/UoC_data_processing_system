Twelve illegal fishing nets confiscated by Sri Lankan Navy

 
Twelve illegal fishing nets were confiscated yesterday (22) by Sri Lankan Navy officers of the Sri Lanka Navy Ship (SLNS) Kashyapa, from Kaththankudi.
The nets stretching 200m long were submitted to the Batticaloa Assistant Directorate of Fisheries for further investigations.
A few months ago the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry banned a number of fishing methods including the bottom trawling and the use of purse seine (Hebili Del), dynamite for fishing.
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera appointed an expert committee to study illegal fishing methods being adopted by fishermen in different parts of the country to make adequate laws to preserve marine sources.
