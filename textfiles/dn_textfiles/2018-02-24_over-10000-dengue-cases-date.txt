Meanwhile, medical experts and Consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without using home remedies. All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school.
All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All the other medications, especially Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which can become fatal, they said.
