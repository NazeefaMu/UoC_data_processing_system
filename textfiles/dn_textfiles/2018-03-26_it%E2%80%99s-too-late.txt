Before it’s too late

Fu Xuewei, a 25-year-old entrepreneur from Chengdu, China recently shared a beautiful set of wedding photos that are going viral. However, there’s an emotional twist to the photographs where no groom seems to be found. In fact, one is not even present as the only people featured in the photoshoot are Fu and her 87-year-old grandfather.
Despite having no plans of getting married anytime soon, Fu Xuewei decided to don the bridal gown for her grandfather. The man fell seriously ill last September, with doctors warning that he could pass away at any time. Fearing he might never get to fulfill the dream of walking his granddaughter down the aisle, Ms. Fu arranged a 3,000 yuan ($475) surprise photoshoot. Keeping her plans a secret, she took her grandfather for a regular hospital check-up, only to reveal that they were going to take pictures later and he agreed.
Fu was raised by her grandparents from the age of ten after her parents divorced and she formed a special bond with her caretakers. She insists on taking care of them in return as they mean a lot to her. The young woman even has a tattoo of her grandfather. “I had my grandfather’s portrait tattooed on my arm in January because I want my new friends and my children to be able to know what he looks like in the future,” she said.
