Understand the sensitivity of prevailing situation

The University Grants Commission (UGC) is increasingly concerned about the situation that has developed in state medical faculties due to continuing boycott of academic activities by students and the impact it has on the creation of ‘good doctors’. The complex matter and the sequence of events that led to this situation, is now under consideration by the highest court in Sri Lanka, states University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva in a release.
The release adds: “The University Grants Commission understands the deep concerns and feelings of parents regarding the direction of  their children’s education and the risk of young minds being manipulated by forces beyond the control of parents and university authorities.
“The present legal nature of the events and the timelines usually associated with such matters has made further limitations and concerns to all parties. "
