Cheers!

Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera has this tendency to swim against the tide. When he was a minister under the Chandrika government he spearheaded the Sudu Nelum Movement that was meant to extend the hand of friendship to the Tamil community, as against the LTTE, which was not well received by the nationalist and Sinhala hardliners who viewed all Tamils as Tiger sympathisers. These elements wanted the war to continue in earnest and the Sudu Nelum campaign was viewed as demoralising the security forces.
Presently Minister Samaraweera has spoken in favour of reducing the price of soft liquor such as wine and beer so that more and more imbibers, bent on hard liquor, would switch their preference to the less injurious brands. Speaking in parliament on Thursday, while moving a Notification on under the Excise Ordinance, for debate, the minister proposed to relax laws pertaining to the sale of wine and beer in the country adding that relaxing the issue of licenses for wine and beer sales would deter consumption of illegal liquor (kassippu) which commands a market as high as 61 percent. “It has been found that consumption of ‘kassippu’ goes up when we increase the duty on liquor. We cannot forcibly reduce liquor consumption. Instead, what we can do is to give more relief to types that have less impact on health”, he told parliament. What the minister meant was to offer relief to distillers who manufacture their product under a strict standardization, unlike in the case of rotgut. In other words, the villain of the piece here is the much cheaper ‘kassippu’, which is the preferred brew of labourers and the toiling masses. Some weeks ago Labour Relations Minister John Seneviratne too spoke in favour of reducing the price of certain brands of arrack such as the popular ‘Gal'. He was of the view that this particular brand was now out of reach of the common man following the serial increase in the price of hard liquor recently with the slapping of VAT. One recalls Prof. G. L. Peiris, onetime Cabinet colleague of Minister Samaraweera, expressing similar sentiments in favour of reducing the price of soft liquor in order to wean away those addicted to hard liquor, arguing that this would in no way affect the excise revenue to the government given the increased numbers who will switch their preferences .It is moot though if those bent on hard liquor (as opposed to kassippu) could be persuaded to go for beer or wine, especially those engaged in the hare grind, who would naturally prefer a ‘kick’ from their liquor.
Be that as it may, any proposal to reduce the price or liquor (hard or soft) is bound make our imbibers drink a toast to the health of the Minister Samaraweera who is known right along for his daring and the unconventional moves though this particular suggestion may not endear him to the wives and, more importantly, clergy of all faiths, particularly the Mahanayaka's whom the Minister met only days after making his recommendation. Nor will they view his proposal to have liquor shops opened on Poya days with the logic that the minister holds onto ie. in any event liquor is consumed on Poya days, even more so than the other days, after having stockpiled ahead. The Minister's claim that liquor shop owners, restaurant keepers et al. sell liquor on the sly for double the price on Poya days, and other days the liquor outlets are forced to close under the law, is only all too well known. As the Minister contended, the fact that Thailand, which is predominantly a Buddhist country, closes it's liquor shops only on election day is enlightening indeed. What is more, as the Minister said, closing liquor outlets on Christmas day which is associated with jollity and merrymaking will be viewed by many Christians as a paradox indeed.
Hence, the Minister has called for a reappraisal of outdated laws and practices governing these restrictions. Most of these restraints and taboos surrounding the subject of liquor are no doubt rooted in ignorance and hypocrisy. The fate that befell mathata titha of the ardent Buddhist Mahinda Rajapaksa is all too well known. The number of liquor permits issued and the mushrooming of wine stores in every corner of the country after the mathata titha campaign was launched had the public coin the hilarious term tithata matha (loosely read, liquor flowing).
The hard fact is, it is difficult to wean away the hard drinker from the habit, try as the authorities might with their various temperance campaigns and religious preachings. What is therefore prudent is finding ways to rid the hard drinker from the highly injurious moonshine and making him go for a standard drink produced under professional supervision.
As the minister said, bringing down the license fees and other levies imposed on liquor manufacturers would invariably bring down the prices of standard liquor that would not pose grave health hazards to the habitual drinker.
