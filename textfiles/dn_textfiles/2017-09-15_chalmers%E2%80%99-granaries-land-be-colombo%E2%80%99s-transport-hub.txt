Chalmers’ Granaries land  to be Colombo’s transport hub

The Multimodal Transport Hub concept in Fort proposed by the Megalopolis and Western Development Ministry received Cabinet approval to call for project investors.
The Hub was initially approved by Cabinet on October 19, 2016, and will involve Chalmers’ Granaries, opposite Fort Railway Station being converted into the ‘Gate’ into the City of Colombo.
The land which was previously used by a private party as vehicle car park has been taken over by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and the latter is now operating it for the same purpose.
The cabinet paper describing the project said the land has been earmarked for mixed development enhancing wider corridors for public to move and to connect to the proposed Multimodal Transport Hub in the Olcott Mawatha area and the financial district in the Northern Part of the Fort and strengthening the public access through the development for wholesale and retail market businesses in the Pettah area in the East”.
As per the UDA development plan, the plot coverage is 50 percent and it is suggested a minimum of 40 percent land area be maintained for public space with and green coverage left adjacent to Olcott Mawatha. The UDA Planning and Urban Design guidelines prepared to develop the Colombo Fort and Pettah area will have to be followed by the selected investor.
The Hub will eventually connect to the proposed expressway connection to the Colombo city from the Katunayake Expressway. A large parking facility at the basement level and space for office and commercial establishment are proposed within the building complex in the hub.
