Williams reshot her ‘All the money in the World’ scenes for free

After a string of sexual misconduct allegations against actor Kevin Spacey, director Ridley Scott reshot his newest movie 'All the money in the World' with Christopher Plummer, replacing Spacey in the lead role of the movie. Reportedly, but now, the film's actress Michelle Williams has revealed that she and other actors re-filmed their scenes in the movie for free.
In a recent interview, Williams said, "I just thought that this experience that we had all treasured was going to be essentially flushed down the toilet." While speaking of director Ridley Scott, the actress noted that she was really thrilled to know about the change of plans for the flick.
"I hated that this man's time and expertise and gentlemanly-ness was going to be kind of for naught, so when I got the phone call about the change of plans I was thrilled. They could have my salary, they could have my holiday, whatever they wanted. Because I appreciated so much that they were making this massive effort," explained Williams.
Michelle plays devoted mother Gail whose 16-year-old John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer) is kidnapped. She must begin a desperate attempt to convince his billionaire grandfather (Plummer) to pay the ransom. ANI
