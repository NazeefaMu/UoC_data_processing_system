CHFMA hosts awards ceremony

Certified Hospitality Finance & Management Accountants (CHFMA) professional qualification hosted its certificate awarding ceremony and new class inauguration ceremony recently.
As management accountants, their skills have been harnessed to develop businesses in a variety of industries across the world. Preparation for the specific needs of operating with any given field, however, tends to be a matter of on-the-job learning, and wisdom passed down from predecessors.
Jointly offered by the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA) and Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM), the CHFMA qualification supports Sri Lankan professionals by pre-empting that process, giving them the skills, they need to excel in finance and management accounting in the hospitality sector, even before they have spent years in the workplace.
Chief Guest at the ceremony, Rohan Karr, Executive Vice President, John Keells Holdings, Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts, stated that the hospitality industry demands a fascination with the sector, and deep and comprehensive knowledge, in order to establish a successful career.
He reminded those present of the value of a professional qualification in Hospitality Finance and Management Accounting to hoteliers.
Speaking on the lack of professional qualifications providing skills to support operations in the hospitality industry, he underscored the importance of obtaining a professional qualification in the specific area of finance and management accounting for the hospitality industry. He noted that it would allow one to promote and endorse oneself, positioning oneself well for employment in an industry which is attractive and in demand.
