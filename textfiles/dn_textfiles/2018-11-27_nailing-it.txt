'Nail'ing It

This festive season, let your nails do the talking with its sparkly ombré patterns, to add glitter to your parties and night outs.
There is something about that glitz on your fingertips that puts a smile on your face and we all know how every girl loves glitter on her nails. Glitter nail designs can give that extra zing and brighten up and send sparkles in your dull moments.
They are always a good choice for the festivals and fun times around the holidays, like the New Year, Christmas and more..!
While some choose to only bedazzle one accent nail, others go all out and add sparkle to every finger to look their best.
This nail art looks tough to execute, but these glitter ombré designs are anything but difficult. The only extra tool you need is a disposable makeup sponge to get this gorgeous look along with the micro glitters or dazzling embellishments.
Here is how to flawlessly nail the look in just a few easy steps:
Prep and paint all your nails with your choice of base coat. For the glitter, choose a glitter of your choice and apply it using a fine tipped brush to your nail three fourths of the way down to the tip of your nail.
This creates the beginning of your ombré look. You may also use a sponge, using the same polish to swipe the glitter from the halfway point of your nail to the tip, building the gradation, concentrating on the edge and tip to finish the ombré effect.
Finish the effect with a top coat. Choose from range of colours from black or white with a gold or silver dazzle being the all time favourites to hues of pink, mint, aqua, mettalic or neon. Deccan Chronicle
