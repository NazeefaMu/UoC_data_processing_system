The Management of Owl and the Pussycat extends their best wishes once again to all participants.Owl and the Pussycat – named after Edward Lear’s 1871 poem – is tucked away from the busy main road in a location that sits close enough to the ocean with breathtaking sights! The only sounds that can be heard are the birdsong, the tranquil crashing off the waves and watching the stilt fishermen patiently waiting for their catch.
