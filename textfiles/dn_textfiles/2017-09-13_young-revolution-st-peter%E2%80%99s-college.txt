Young revolution: St Peter’s College

Head Prefect Joshua Young of St. Peter’s is a man of many sides. He is a leader who does not recognize the word ‘Impossible’. Nothing deters him from achieving what he wants. He is open to the opinions of his Peterites, a hallmark of a successful leader. Perfect Prefects features Joshua Young an extremely progressive and liberal leader.
Young feels that a Head Prefect should be someone who is really forward and forward thinking as well. He correctly points out that one problem we have with our current society is that there are lots of people with opinions, but don’t like to give them out. It is not only about leadership qualities says Young, but you have to be a person who boldly speaks his mind and applies what he does to the Prefect-ship.
Best action
“In our Prefect Body, we get the opinions of everyone. When there is a difficulty the first thing I would do is ask the opinion of everyone inside the body – my senior, juniors and my stewards. I would get their opinion first. Then I and my deputies would get together and discuss and carry out the best action that we think. That is the game plan,” explains Young
When Obama contested for the presidency many people thought it could not be done. But now America has had its first Black President. Nothing deterred Obama from carrying on with his policies when he was convinced that it was the correct plan of action. It is this tenacity that Young admires about Barack Obama. “Even though there was a lot of controversies, he took it into his consideration but he had his own game plan. In the end, I think he brought America to a much better place. So for me, he is actually a good role model,” said Young.
Young feels that most people have misunderstood the meaning of leader. They think he is a person who does whatever he wants to do. Indeed this is the characteristics of a despot. And we have seen many examples of leaders in our world who have been ruined because of their inability to handle their positions of power. Young aspires to a more democratic way of life as a leader. His ideas are very reminiscent of Athenian ideals of democracy.
Happy working
“I have a system for getting others opinions, I am involved with people more junior to me. They are happy working with me rather than hating me and not liking my methods. Even though I say it is my methods, it is their opinions that apply to it. I have been in their place before. That is how I think and do things. That is why I think it works and it is easier for a person to follow a leader like that,” pointed out Young.
Young stated that emotions can affect the way you think, and being humans we are emotional, but you need to face the facts in life. You need to make decisions based on those facts. As a Head Prefect, there are a lot of activities in school that you have to attend while doing your studies. You need to give a good example of yourself and there are a lot of pressures like that. So you can’t start panicking and freaking out saying you can’t do this.
“We work to come to a place like this, we actually wanted something like this. Given that opportunity, you have to deal with it. So when there is pressure, instead of freaking out, I calm myself down and think what the problems are and face one problem at a time. The challenges are all one at a time. Finish off what is more important firstly and then deal with the rest,” said Young.
Young has many ambitions. One is to do well as a Software Engineer and go to a very high place. Currently, he is doing Math for his A/Ls and aims at getting his degree.
“Regardless of the circumstances, I somehow found a way to balance my studies and became Head Prefect somehow and that is not easy in an institution like this. To be honest, I really have not planned out my future that much, but becoming a Software Engineer is the basic idea,” said Young.
Defeatist mentality
When asked as to what the biggest tragedy he felt the world had faced, Young pointed out that in his opinion it would be World War II. However, he pointed out that this tragedy could have been nipped in the bud. You need to deal with these tensions at the school and family level. World War II could have been prevented.
There is a certain defeatist mentality in society. People think that effecting change is beyond them. Change cannot be prevented but society is going in a direction that is distressing. There are so many problems like Gender based problems, poverty and crime.
“We all have this dream in our head where we want to do something but we also think that as a single person we can’t do enough. But there is enough evidence in society today where we find there are people who are making a change – child prodigies and young billionaires and a Black President. Problem is people think they cannot be someone like that. It is important to improve yourself and be a better version of yourself and then just let things happen,” pointed out Young.
Being in most of the clubs, Young holds the editing positions. Being a member of the Interact Club, what he has gained from the club is the ability to socialize with people who come from different schools and different backgrounds.
“I gather valuable knowledge from what my fellow club members have gone through. So I know what I am going to face in society. As a boys’ school we don’t have that much exposure to international schools, by being in clubs like this we gain a lot of exposure,” said Young.
Never give up
A bookworm when he was in Grade 6, 7 and 8 reading about five or six books a week, Young has an attitude and message that he wants to share with others. And that message is never to give up. People can tell you all kinds of things but you need to be determined. You can’t throw in the towel.
“I want to tell them not to be affected by other people’s opinions too much. People will discourage you. One word I don’t like is ‘impossible’. I am a person who has proved people wrong. So I would like to tell you that nothing is impossible. When you want to achieve something, disregard the negativity of others. Take into consideration what those who are closest to you think. People who matter to you. When they encourage you to pursue your dreams then go for it. Another problem in our world is challenges faced by disabled people. My message to them is to never give up. When trying to make changes in society you can start small. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg started small while being college dropouts. They wanted to start a company and now they have come to a big place. So start small. And someday you can do something big,” summed up Young.
