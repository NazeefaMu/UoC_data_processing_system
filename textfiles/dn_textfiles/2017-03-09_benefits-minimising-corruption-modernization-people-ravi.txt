Benefits by minimising corruption, modernization to the people: Ravi

Some public institutions which were misused and provided luxury to members of a single family were relieved from that family grip and been made productive centers to serve the public, says Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The minister pointed out that the anticipation of the good governance administration is to pass on the benefits collected by minimizing corruption and modernization directly to the people.
Karunanayake expressed these views during a ceremony organised to mark International Women’s Day at the Finance Ministry yesterday. Letters of Appointment were handed over to several female lottery agents to mark the appointment of 1,000 female lottery agents to the National Lotteries Board during this ceremony.
It is significant that the new appointments have been made covering the entire island and specially giving priority to some differently abled female persons and some others from low income families.
Addressing the gathering, Minister Karunanayake said: “President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe anticipate to economically empower the less fortunate people of this country. Appointing new lottery agents throughout the country is one such programme under the two leaders’ objectives. Government institutions such as the National Lotteries Board were controlled and used by one family to lead super luxury lives several years ago.”
He said revenue earned by public institutions such as the Lottery Board was lavishly spent on their personal affairs. “But hundreds of families are happy today because of programmes of this nature. At the time we assumed office, we pledged the people that we would eliminate corruption and fraud. It is gradually happening today. People are enjoying the benefits of such attempts by this government,” the minister said.
