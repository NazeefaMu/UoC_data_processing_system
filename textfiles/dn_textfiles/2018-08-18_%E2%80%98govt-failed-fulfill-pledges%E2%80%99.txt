‘Govt. failed to fulfill pledges’

Hambantota District Parliamentarian D. V. Chanaka yesterday said the government has failed to fulfill promises given to the people at the last Presidential and Parliamentary Elections.
He said the government is celebrating its third anniversary by recording a statement from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Chanaka was addressing the media following a meeting in Weeraketiya on Thursday.
He said three years have passed since the government came into power, but the promises have receded one by one.
