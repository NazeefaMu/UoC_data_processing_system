Foreign Ministry probe into Maldivian national's issue

 
The Foreign Affairs Ministry will conduct an investigation to find out what had happened from the side of the Foreign Affairs Ministry in connection with the deportation of the Maldivian national arrested in connection with the assassination attempt of the Maldivian President, Acting Director General, Spokesperson's Office and Public Communication Division of the Foreign Affairs Ministry Satya Rodrigo told the 'Daily News' yesterday.
He said that the investigation is aimed at finding out the details in connection with what had been done on the part of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, in connection with the deporting of this individual. The issue was handled by some other agencies, including the Immigration and Emigration Department and the Police.
"At present, we are waiting for information from the other agencies, such as, the Immigration and Emigration Department, Police etc which handled the issue," he added.
Last Monday, Sri Lanka deported a Maldivian teenager who was arrested and wanted in connection with the investigation into an explosion on a boat carrying Maldives President Abdulla Yameen. Sri Lanka's immigration officials deported the 18-year old Maldivian national on the request received from the Maldivian High Commission. He was deported after cancelling his visa.
