Scenic railway

A Railway station is not a place for admiration. But thousands visit this countryside railway station to admire its beautiful garden and landscaping and a make a day out trip. Spring Bluff Railway has a prize winning garden throughout the year.
I was surprised when it was suggested that we drive almost 130 kilo meters to spend the time at a railway station garden located in the regional council of Toowoomba. Further I was told that my friend’s family was making an annual trip there to spend the day with the children. “September is the best time for the trip as it is the season of best flowering” my friend added.
Within of about an hour drive we sighted the sign board to "Spring Bluff railway station”. It was a Monday morning and we anticipated less people. To my surprise we found a young female volunteer in a yellow jacket and duty tag signalling us to stop at a quite distance. Peeping in to the vehicle greeting us warmly with a smile, she self-introduced herself and said she is there to help with the parking. There are three carparks in this hilly location and she checked up on the walkie talky whether we have space closer to the station for parking. Some vehicle was pulling out and we were asked to drive direct to car park one near the station.

Location reminded me of a place like Nawalapitiya railway station as I was a frequent traveller by train to my work place, Tea Research Institute Talawakelle. We could see the beautiful garden at a distance and the people above the carpark. Happy faces of people indicated the impact of the garden.
The car park was surrounded by trees and bushes full of many different coloured flowers.
These trees must have been planted many years ago. There was a train stopped on the track and it was a beautiful view to see a train surrounded by flowers.
History
This station had been established in 1860 and today this station and the garden are heritage listed. It is the station master Ralph Krisoo and his wife Lillian that had taken the interest in making the place beautiful. He had received the help of the station staff and the neighbours to do the beautiful land scaping. This was far back in 1930. They set picnic tables to encourage people to visit the station and enjoy the evenings.
Prize winning garden
Regional Council of Toowoomba then began the annual flower show. It was then the station master took the initiative to enlist the place as a competitor for the event of carnival gardens. Spring Bluff railway station became a prizewinning garden many times and people began to visit it.
Weddings and parties
It became so popular it has now become a place for wedding events as the garden remains beautiful throughout the year and the small café does the catering for such garden events.
No fee is charged for using the garden or the car park and people come with the families to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries. People can bring their own food and refreshments.
The café building is supposed to be the living quarters of the then Station Master.
In a clever and a simple way the place is maintained with ever smiling flowers make us forget that it is a railway station and make the visitors long to go there again the next September during the Carnival Garden show time in Toowoomba.
