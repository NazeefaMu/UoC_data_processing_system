Sri Lanka has witnessed an exponential growth in the e-commerce arena over the past few years with amass acceptance garnered for the concept of buying online.
Daraz started operations in Sri Lanka in 2016, and has since then become a frontrunner in the e-commerce industry in the country. Daraz’s specialty is its largest variety of products offered through successful partnerships with major local brands.
Daraz will now be expanding their reach within the country and building further convenience for their clientele by opening ten new hubs spread across the main regions of the nation.
With three hubs already in operation in Kandy, Panadura and Gampaha, Daraz will open two new hubs in May in the towns of Chilaw and Kurunegala, followed by Galle, Matara, Nuwara Eliya, Jaffna and Ratnapura during the months of June and July.
These strategically placed hubs will play a pivotal part in Daraz’s plans to ensure an enhanced, complete shopping experience for all Daraz customers.

This will make it possible for consumers from every corner of the Island to access genuine products available in Pettah at the best prices. By scaling up and investing in infrastructure, Daraz will now be well positioned to increase their speed of delivery and provide a superior experience to customers.
