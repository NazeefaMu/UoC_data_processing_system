Anjana’s injury time try: stuns  St. Anthony’s 29-28

A spectacular injury time try scored by Isipathana fly half Anjana Kulathilake, who found his way over the St. Anthony’s try line from a close range scrum to edge out St. Anthony’s College Kandy
by 29 points (5 tries, 2 conversions) to 28 ( 4 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty, 1 Drop goal) in the inter schools ‘Milo’ President’s Trophy knock out quarter finals played at Sugathadasa Stadium In Colombo yesterday. Isipathana will meet St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya on coming Sunday (June 18) in semis. Isipathana made a sensational come back from 25 points to 12 down to beat Antonians at the end.
The ‘Green Shirts’ showed better control of the ball in perfect conditions and turned the match in their favour with a rousing second half rally.
Isipathana, put up an unthinkable effort to topple Antonians who led 15-12 at half time.
The winners dared to run the ball and gained in meters whenever a gap in the opponents’ defense was detected. Havelock Park lads were always sure of what to do, in contrast to their counterparts who only knew to run straight, often ramming into their opposite numbers. St. Anthony’s opened scoring when second rower Daulagala touched down for a try, 5-nill. Fly half Samuel Maduwantha failed with the conversion.
Soon after Isipathana equaled scoring 5 all when flanker Umesh Jayamanna went over for a try with centre Manelka Ruberu missing the conversion. Within couple of minutes Isipathana went in to a 12-5 lead off winger Nadeesha Chaminda’s try, converted by Ruberu.
Antonians cut down the lead 12-10 through a try scored by winger Pramoditha Wickramaarachchi, but Maduwantha missed the conversion. Just before lemons Anthony’s jumped into the lead 15-12 with a try scored by Dinesh Rodrigo. Maduwantha missed the conversion again. At half time St. Anthony’s led 15 points to 12.
Soon after the breather St. Anthony’s surged ahead 22-12 with a try by centre Jason Seelagama with Maduwantha slotted in the conversion. St. Anthony’s went further ahead with a 35 metre penalty fired across by Maduwantha to read the score 25-12. Green shirts made a striking return to the game, in the second half just 12 minutes remaining, when Sudeera Gaynath broke away from a maul and went over for a try.
But Pathana hopes of winning seemed thrust under a ‘dark cloud’ when the team’s place kicker, Ruberu failed with the vital conversion but close the gap 25 points to 17.
St. Anthony’s further increased their lead to 28 points to 17 with a nearly 50 metre drop goal fired across by Maduwantha. Antonians, who dominated the first half, lost the grip late into the second half as they seemed hampered by the Isipathana three quarter attacks.
However, luck beckoned at Isipathana in the second half when replacement centre Randy Silva gave the side the hope of winning by scoring a try, breaching the St. Anthony’s defense off a three quarter move. Ruberu made amends for all the missed kicks by converting the try this time to cut down the lead to 28-24 in St. Anthony’s favour.
The winners, who enjoyed the major share of possession from the set pieces, sealed the game in the penultimate minutes from the end when fly half Anjana found his way over the Anthony’s try line from a close range scrum. Centre Ruberu missed the difficult conversion to take Isipathana College to a remarkable 29 points 28 victory in the end.
Surprisingly Referee Rohan Fernando had a miserable game with the whistle disallowing two tries scored by Isipathana.
