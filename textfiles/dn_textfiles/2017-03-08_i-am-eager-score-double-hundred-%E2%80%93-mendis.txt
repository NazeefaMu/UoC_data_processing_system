I am eager to score a double hundred – Mendis

GALLE: Sri Lanka’s number three batsman Kusal Mendis said that he was keen to make it big and score a double hundred after finishing the first day of the first Test against Bangladesh unbeaten on 166.
“I missed getting one at Pallekele (against Australia) so I am determined to make one here,” said Mendis yesterday.
“I am a set batsman and the team expects me to score big. I will try my best to score 200 if not more. It is a good batting wicket and I don’t see it taking any changes in the next few days, by evening it might take spin. It is a hard wicket and I believe there are runs on it,” he said. Recalling the first ball reprieve Mendis said, “I may have played a false stroke the first ball I faced but that’s the way I play naturally. When I got a second opportunity I took that advantage to provide my team with what they required from me. “Dimuth (Karunaratne) spoke to me a lot after I played that first shot he told me to leave the balls you cannot play alone. Asela (Gunaratne) also told me the same. Everyone who came to the wicket spoke to me. Initially it was difficult to go for the runs. Off the first 45 balls I faced, I scored only 10 to 15, but later on because we had wickets in hand we went for the runs. “When I was in partnership with Asela we ran a lot of singles and when I was tired he scored runs from the other end. That was very helpful to me. He also played well but unfortunately for him he got out. It was easy batting with him.” (ST)
