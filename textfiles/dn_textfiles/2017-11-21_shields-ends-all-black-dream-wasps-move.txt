Shields ends All Black dream with Wasps move

Wellington: Wellington skipper Brad Shields on Monday confirmed a move to Wasps in 2018, ending his All Black aspirations but opening the door to a potential switch to England for the 2019 World Cup.
The highly rated 26-year-old captained Wellington Hurricanes to a Super Rugby title in 2016 and led the side against the British and Irish Lions this year.
Hard-working and physical, the loose forward is regarded as unlucky to have never been capped by New Zealand, despite being named in two All Black training squads.
He is eligible for England via his British parents and Sky Spots reported that Eddie Jones will closely monitor his progress in the English Premiership as he looks for World Cup options.
Shields will join Wasps after completing the 2018 Super Rugby season with the Hurricanes.
"It's good to have my playing future confirmed nice and early so I can focus 100 percent on the Hurricanes," he said.
The All Blacks have a strict policy of not selecting foreign-based players, making Shields ineligible after he leaves the Hurricanes.AFP
