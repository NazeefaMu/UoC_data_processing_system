CIABOC is not a political tool - DG

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) cannot be a tool in the hands of the political system. We need systems in place to make it work regardless of party or politics, said CIABOC Director General (DG) Sarath Jayamanne.
Addressing a gathering of media and civil society on the formulation of a National Action Plan to Eliminate Bribery and Corruption at the Movenpick Hotel on Monday, Jayamanne explained that complaints of bribery and corruption usually were only made soon after a regime change took place.
“It is then that people remember all the large-scale corruption. Then the public starts to view the Commission as a tool in the political system of the country. People have been asking me if the Commission is only used for politicians on either side to bring down their political opponents.”
The DG pointed out that apart from complaints, no politician has come forward to speak of establishing systems or legislation which would prevent and deter corruption.
He said the Bribery Act had not been amended in the last 30 years, the Asset Declaration Act was outdated, and laws on ‘conflict of interest’ and ‘gift rules’ were yet to be legislated. Current asset declaration laws also only require the person to declare their assets on March 31 of every year and do not show the transactions of that year. Further, there is no institution to collect the declarations or review them to ascertain their credibility.
“We can’t undertake investigations in accordance with the political machinery of the country. Investigations cannot only be done when regimes change. We need a system that is beyond this. Chasing after wrongdoers after a crime is committed is just one method. Another method is to introduce legislature that will deter crime,” said the DG.
The Commission is to hire 50 new officers, some of them graduates, for the first time in the Commission’s history, to set up a Prevention Unit and the National Action Plan which is to be finalised in the next three months will look at ways to deter corruption at every level of society. More importantly, they will target children in teaching them the importance of living a life of integrity, Jayamanne said.
He said Hong Kong has agreed to train CIABOC officers in preventive legislation. “If we can deter corruption, people will not keep asking when we are going to arrest the corrupt. We will be able to nip it in the bud.”
