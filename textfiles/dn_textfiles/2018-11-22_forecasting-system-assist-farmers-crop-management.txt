Forecasting system to assist farmers in crop management

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed the Agriculture Department authorities to prepare a Crop Forecast Information System to prevent some of the main issues faced by farmers, especially small-scale farmers.
Minister Amaraweera said most farmers cannot sell their produce at a good price due to the absence of a proper Crop Forecast Information System and mediators take the advantage of this situation.
The Minister said the Crop Forecast System would helpful for proper crop management. The cultivation of crops without any management creates various issues including harvesting losses and the reduction of prices.
“If we have a Crop Forecast Information System, we would also be able to predict an excess of harvest of vegetables, grains and fruits and we will be able to provide necessary measures to export or produce value added food products. Then farmers would be able to get a better price for their produce,” he said.
