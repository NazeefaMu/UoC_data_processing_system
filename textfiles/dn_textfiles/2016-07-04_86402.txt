Sri Lanka ‘A’ gain major honours

After rain sheeted down the full last two days without allowing a ball to be bowled, Sri Lanka A teams opening match of their tour with Durham ended in a tepid draw. Sri Lanka A played tremendous cricket with both bat and ball to win more honors in this first warm-up.
Roshen Silva’s patient innings of 109 and Sachith Pathirana’s rapid 51 from just 66 deliveries put Sri Lanka A team towards a dominant game with a first innings score of 352 before their bowlers led by Vishwa Fernando with five wickets conceding just 37 runs in 11.1 overs reduced Durham to an unimpressive 205 all out Gordon Muchall making the top score of 70.
Sri Lanka batting second with a healthy first innings lead of 148 extended their lead to 291 with 8 second wickets in hand and it was the end of the proceedings as no play was possible thereafter due to rain in the last two days of the match. In Lankans second innings too Roshen Silva followed up his century in the first innings with an unbeaten 43 carrying Lankan’s second innings total to 143 for two in a well-accomplished partnership of 84 for the unfinished third wickets with Mahela Udawatta who made 45 not out.
Sri Lanka A : 353 in 114.2 overs (ARS Silva 109, SS Pathirana 51, PLS Gamage 43*, MS Warnapura 34, NGRP Jayasuriya 31, GS Sandhu 4/70, P Coughlin 3/65) and 143/2 in 52 overs (ML Udawatta 45*, ARS Silva 43*)
Durham : 205 in 54.1 overs (GJ Muchall 70, P Mustard 38, MVT Fernando 5/37, PLS gamage 3/49)
