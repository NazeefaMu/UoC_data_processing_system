‘Govt. cannot be toppled’

The government will not collapse under any circumstance, Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said yesterday.
He was addressing the media at the ministry premises yesterday.
He said there is a strong bond and mutual trust between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“Although various people say various things about the government, it will not be toppled,” the deputy minister said.
The people have given them the mandate to govern and develop the country. The Prime Minister and the President will achieve this target, he added.
