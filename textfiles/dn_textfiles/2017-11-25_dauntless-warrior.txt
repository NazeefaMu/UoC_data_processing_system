Dauntless warrior

“…we cannot dedicate, we cannot desecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated far above our poor power to add or detract…”
- Extract from Gettysburg address by Abraham Lincoln
On January 10, 1818, Governor Brownrigg castigated Keppetipola and several other leaders of the Uva uprising as outlaws, rebels, and enemies. President Maithripala Sirisena a few months ago de-gazetted the British proclamation and posthumously awarded medals for several national heroes for their personal acts of valour above and beyond the call of duty, and for their heroic acts and meritorious services against invaders in the past. The number one in the list was none other than Rajapaksa Wickramasekera Mudiyanselage Bandaranayake Monarawila Keppetipola [Monarawila Keppetipola Dissawe] the leader of the 1818 Uva rebellion.
Keppetipola was born in Monarawila of the Matale area to Golahela Disawe, the Diyawadana Nilame and Disawe of Tamankaduwa during the reign of King Sri Wikrama Rajasinghe. Young Keppetipola acquired father’s position after his death.
In 1813, the colonial office recommended Robert Brownrigg appointed as Governor of Ceylon. In 1815, he acquired Central region of this island through a treaty known as the “Kandyan Convention” assisted by the deserting ministers of the King, and annexed it to the British Empire, which they believed ‘on which the sun never sets’, since its spread about the globe meant that the sun was for all time visible in at least one of its settlements. The Badulla massacre undertaken by Robert Brownrigg implicated the slaughter of children, including baby suckling at the mothers’ breasts. They smashed their paddy cultivation, the irrigation systems and other road and rail network as well.
The 1817/18 riots described as the Uva rebellion is the culmination of the peoples resentment and dissatisfaction over the Colonial rule which promised to uphold and foster the Buddhism and observe the traditions and rituals that prevailed in the Kandyan Kingdom up to March 2, 1815. Wiliam Tolfry, the Chief Translator; appraised the Commissioner Sutherland of the volatile circumstances that prevailed in December 1816 and January 1817, and warned him of an imminent rebellion against the British rule. Reports indicated that one Duraisamy, a kinsman of the dethroned king is claiming his rights to the throne, and is gaining the support of the people in Uva, and that some Sinhalese leaders too joined him. A rebellion began in Uva-Wellassa on October 12, 1817.
Keppetipola was sent with 500 men by Governor Brownrigg to suppress the rebellion. However, at the request of the rebels, Keppetipola joined them to lead the struggle. Brownrigg declared Martial Law in Kandy and the surrounding provinces and three army divisions were dispatched to Uva immediately after the news reached the Governor that Keppetipola who returned the British arms and ammunition to the Governor, too has joined the rebels. Wilbawe who had claimed to be the inheritor to the throne, was officially crowned. Keppetipola was appointed as the Maha Adhikaram under this new king, and the insurgents were urged to free the country from the British rule.
Keppetipola led a guerrilla war against the British army, knowing that the rebels were outnumbered and lesser in firepower. There were not many large face-to-face battles done against the British army during the entire rebellion, and most of the attacks were carried out in the form of Guerilla attacks. The rebellion gained new strength and grew rapidly under the leadership of Keppetipola; it spread to a large part of the country including Dumbara, Hewaheta, Harisspattuwa and Nuwara-Kala-Viya, it was a great success until it was broken with the disbanding of the rebels.
Rebellion spreads
In October 1817 the riots broke out. Major Wilson sent out a battalion under Hadji Muhandiram, controlled by Hadjis’ brother himself to suppress the rebellion. The people of Uva were so aggravated with this incident that they trapped Hadji and produced him before Duraisamy who sentenced him to be beheaded.
The arrogance and pride of British rulers saw no limit when again on October 12, 1817 Major Wilson himself travelled to Uva with a Malay troop. Major Wilson was killed on this march near the Bibile town. Lt. Col. Hardy collected intelligence that the insurgents were on the move to Dolosbage in Gampola, where they found that the area was calm and quiet.
The British government credited this attitude of the natives to the authority that Molligoda exerted in the region and the personal bitterness he had with Keppetipola. However, in Galaboda Korale area which was the native place of Keppetipola, the Britishers featured problems with the rioters. As a matter of gratitude of the British to those who refrained from participation in the rebellion, the British Governor reduced the grain tax.
Keppetipola was appointed as the Maha Adhikaram and the new King urged the fighters to free the country from the invading British. A guerrilla war was waged by Keppetipola, though aware that the rebels were lesser in firepower.
As the rebels were gaining power the British forces stationed in the country could not do enough against them, strengthening needed were brought in from India. The rebels were incapable of facing the British forces, and were appeared to be in difficulty with supplies cultivations and livestock where the uprising took place had been ruined. As a result of hardships the civilian population had to face due to the fighting, the rebellion was called off and the men were dispersed. Keppetipola and other leaders fled to Anuradhapura.
Great Rebellion of 1818
Keppetipola along with Pilimathalawe were captured by Captain O’Neil On October 28, 1818. As the troops surrounded the house, Keppitipola boldly came out and greeted Capt. O’Neil; he was taken to Kandy, and tried for high treason and sentenced to death in a gruesome crime of history.
This national hero is well known for the exceptional bravery that he showed at the instant of his execution, and has been honoured as a national hero of Sri Lanka since then. Honouring their memory, of course is an exercise in generosity.
On November 25, 1818, they were taken to the Temple of the Tooth at the request of Keppetipola, for performance religious rituals. Keppetipola wished to be born in the Himalayas on his rebirth and attain Nibbana. He offered a cloth he wore to the temple, and his friend Marshall Sawers received his copy of Dhammapada.
Being taken to Bogambara grounds, Keppetipola tied up his hair to avoid it falling onto his neck requested the slaughterer to behead him with one stroke. He uttered a Pali verse from the Dhammapada and placed his head on the stump. Rajapaksa Wickramasekera Mudiyanselage Bandaranayake Monarawila Keppetipola was killed on the second stroke.
The genocidal policy of the colonials during the Great Rebellion of 1818 recognized Brownrigg for his ‘achievements’ who conquered the 1818 Rebellion and prepared the beheading of Keppetipola; he was raised to the rank of General before leaving in 1819. There had been lots of national, political and cultural massacres, slaughter and butchery committed by the British and other colonial powers who ruled for 443 years from 1505 to 1948.
Remembering people who had their own individual ambitions, personal concerns, to live peaceful lives, but confronted with events that affected not only them, but the nation, yet, they could have preferred to remain focused on their individual battles, ignoring what was going on just about them. They set aside their private agendas, their worries, they did not dither. They knew that if they did not employ their strength to oppose it, then the abuse and hostility would continue. These are the citizens we consider heroes.
After all they say - conquerors are people like you and me who were positioned in unexpected situations, and yet, still favoured to do what is right. Keppetipola’s skull was taken to England and preserved in the Phrenological Society of Edinburgh.
When we gained independence in 1948 Keppetipola was declared a national hero, who fought against foreign rule. In 1954 at the request of the Government of Sri Lanka his skull was returned, and entombed in the Memorial erected in his honour in Kandy.
‘The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example.’
- Benjamin Disraeli
