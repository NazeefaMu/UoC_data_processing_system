Reflections on Buddhist vinaya

In the Maha-parinibbana Sutta, the Buddha taught: "Now, Ananda, if it occurs to any of you -- 'the teaching has lost its authority; we are without a Teacher' -- do not view it in that way. Whatever Dhamma and Vinaya I have pointed out and formulated for you, that will be your Teacher when I am gone."
The Buddha calls his teaching the Dhamma and the Vinaya, and these two cannot separate from each other. The Vinaya is the "life" of the Buddha Sasana. The Sasana is alive only when the Vinaya prevails, and prevalence of the Vinaya depends on those who observe and practice it strictly.
The Vinaya Pitaka, the first division of the Tripitaka, is the textual framework upon which the monastic community (Sangha) is built, and includes the code of rules that defines the way of life of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. It also details the many rules, procedures, and forms of etiquette that are necessary to support harmonious relations, both among the monastics themselves, and between the monastics and their lay supporters, upon whom they depend.
For nearly twenty years after the Enlightenment of the Buddha, no definite rules were laid down for control and discipline of the Sangha (Order). As the Sangha gradually grew in number and evolved into a more complex society, occasions inevitably arose when a member would act in an unskilful way. Whenever those cases were brought to the Buddha's attention, he would lay down vinaya rules establishing suitable punishments for the offences, as deterrents to future misconduct.
Reasons for the promulgated of rules, their various implications and specific ceremonies of the Sangha are fully described in the Vinaya Pitaka.
Practical lessons
The monastic tradition and the rules upon which it is built are sometimes naïvely criticized as irrelevant to the "modern" practice of Buddhism. Some see the Vinaya as a throwback to an archaic patriarchy, based on a hodgepodge of ancient rules and customs that only obscure the essence of "true" Buddhist practice. This view misses one crucial fact: it is to the credit of the unbroken lineage of Sangha that have consistently upheld and protected the rules of the Vinaya for almost 2,600 years that we find ourselves today with the luxury of receiving the priceless teachings of Dhamma. Were it not for the Vinaya, and for those who continue to keep it alive to this day, there would be no Buddhism.
Lay practitioners will find the Vinaya Pitaka filled with valuable practical lessons concerning human nature, guidance on how to establish and maintain a harmonious community or organization, as well as profound teachings of the Dhamma itself. But its greatest value, perhaps, lies in its power to inspire the layperson to consider the extraordinary possibilities offered by a life of true renunciation, lived in harmony with the Dhamma.
A bhikkhu is bound to observe t227 rules (apart from several other minor ones) which include four kinds of Higher Morality, namely: Patimokkha Sila -- the Fundamental Moral Code (major offenses related to immoral, cruel, harmful and selfish activities.), Indriyasamvara Sila -- Morality pertaining to sense-restraint, Ajivaparisuddhi Sila -- Morality pertaining to purity of livelihood and Paccayasannissita Sila -- Morality pertaining to the use of requisites pertaining to life. These four kinds of morality are collectively called Sila-Visuddhi (Purity of Virtue).
These precepts and rules remain as pertinent today as they were 2,600 years ago for they restore the focus back to the human being, to how actions and words affect individuals and the world
For the Bhikkhu, the Vinaya helps to highlight actions and speech, and show up their significance. It brings an awareness of how he is intervening in the world, how he is affecting other people. Of course, such awareness is necessary for every human being, not just Bhikkus. This is why Buddha bequeathed to laymen the Five, the Eight and the Ten Precepts.
Training
In the Mangala Sutta the Buddha teaches that one should be well-trained in Vinaya. The term “well-trained in discipline” is explained in the commentary on the Sutta as follows: “There are two kinds of Vinaya, one for laity and the other for monks. The lay Vinaya means avoidance of the ten unwholesome kammas. A lay person shuns these ten evil kammas with a pure heart and humble attitude. With the aim of not spoiling his morality he respectfully observes the training in full. Here the words “well-trained in discipline” encompass two factors: purification of defilements, and devoted practice of moral discipline. These two essential factors should be learned and practised by the laity.”
Regarding the monks’ Vinaya, the commentary explains that a monk must observe the seven classes of rules with complete confidence. If he has no defects he gets the honour of practising well. Moreover, he becomes truly learned by this means. Besides the seven classes of offences, the rules for monks include the morality of four-fold purification. By observing these four trainings a monk can reach the highest stage of sanctity, the perfect purity called Arahantship. If one diligently practises the rules to reach this noble aim, one is called “well-trained.”
Practice
Therefore, the commentary clearly shows that a lay person must learn his Vinaya. For monks, there is the code of conduct described in the Vinaya Pitaka. The advice in the Mangala Sutta does not convey the sense that laity should learn the monks’ Vinaya. The term “well-trained” does not mean mere academic study. Academic knowledge is useless in this sphere. What “well-trained” means here is that a monk diligently follows the Vinaya rules in practice. So “to be well-trained” also means “to be learned.” The main point is that without following the Vinaya rules devotedly one does not deserve to be called “learned.” Mere academic knowledge becomes useless if it is not put into practice.
As with Dhamma, Vinaya is essentially a matter of practice and realization. To ensure that our approach will be practical, we must ask questions of its results. We can then observe what fruits our approach bears and make the appropriate adjustments. This is especially important in times of transition when experimentation is necessary. We can’t just figure these things out intellectually, they must be tested in real life. Dhamma-Vinaya is always a dialogue between the texts that we cherish and our daily practice of what they teach, as well as between tradition and present reality.
Ven. Narada Maha Thera in his book "The Buddha and His Teachings" says, “The Vinaya Pitaka is regarded as the sheet anchor of the Holy Order of Bhikkus. The history of the gradual development of Sasana from its very inception, a brief account of the life and ministry of the Buddha additional, and details of the three Councils are some other relevant contents of the Vinaya Pitaka. Indirectly it reveals useful information about ancient history, Indian customs, ancient arts and sciences”.
“One who reads the Vinaya Pitaka cannot but be impressed by the democratic constitution of the Sangha, their holding of possessions in common, the exceptionally high moral standard of the Bhikkhus, and the unsurpassed administrative abilities of the Buddha, who anticipated even the present Parliamentary system.”
And it may come as a surprise to many westerners to learn that in the Assemblies of the Buddhists in India two thousand years and more ago are to be found the rudiments of our own Parliamentary practice of the present day.
