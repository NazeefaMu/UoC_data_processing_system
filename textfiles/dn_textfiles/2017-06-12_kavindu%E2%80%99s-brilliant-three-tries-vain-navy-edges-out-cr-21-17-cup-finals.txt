Kavindu’s brilliant three tries in vain  as Navy edges out CR 21-17 in Cup finals

 Sensational CR & FC winger cum Sri Lanka national player Kavindu Perera scored three breath taking tries to lead 17 points to 14 but all in vain as Navy ‘A’ edged out unlucky CR & FC in the last move of the match scoring through Buddhima Piyaratne under the post, finally capping off a thrilling 21 points (3 tries, 3 conversions) to 17 (3 tries, 1 conversions) win in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter club rugby sevens cup final encounter played at Race Course international stadium in Colombo yesterday. Navy were holding on to a slender 14-12 lead at lemons.
For Navy, centre Mohamad Abzal, scrum half Samith Danajaya and winger Buddhima Piyaratne scored one try apiece while Thilina Weerasinghe converted all three tries.
Winger Kavindu Perera scored all three tries for the losing CR & FC while captain and srum half Kavindu De Costha slotted in a solitary conversion.
Incidentally CR & FC had not won an inter-club rugby sevens Cup final for the past 26 years, hence they had a tremendous chance yesterday under captain Kavindu De Costa and head coach M.J.M. Mushtaq to end their title drought, but were not lucky enough to do so.
The last time they got into a final was in 1996, where they became the unbeaten sevens Cup champions under former Isipathana hooker Viraj Prashantha’s captaincy.
