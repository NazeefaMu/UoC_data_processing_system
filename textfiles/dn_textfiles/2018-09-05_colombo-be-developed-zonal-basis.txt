Colombo to be developed on zonal basis

The Colombo city and suburbs will be developed on zonal basis. One of the main aspects of this will be the administrative city. Work on this which began in 1985 is due to be completed by 2025, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The minister was addressing the gathering at the Colombo Dialogue, recently.
Minister Ranawaka said nearly 113 government offices were situated in Colombo. Leaving out financial institutions, all other offices could be shifted to the proposed administrative city as the construction of the buildings was now underway.
“The Sethsiripaya third stage was no more a dream as a 28-storey building is now under construction,” he said.
The construction work on Sethsiripaya stage 4 will be launched this year. Some of the buildings under construction would be completed by 2020.
The other projects envisaged were Colombo city, Colombo Harbour, Port City, Beira Lake project, restoration of historic buildings and the Transport Centre in Colombo Fort and Maritime city encompassing Galle city.
Minister Ranawaka said already slum dwellers around the Beira Lake had been shifted to modern flats through persuasion and a part of the area around the lake would be developed as a line park accessible to people of all walks of life.
The balance section around the lake would be developed within the next one and a half years.
He said the 150-year-old water supply network was also being modernised by laying new pipe lines.
