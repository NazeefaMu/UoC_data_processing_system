Development impact bonds : Pay for success

Impact bonds: a new approach to development finance. Governments are looking for innovative models to finance their public agendas without substantially higher costs for society. Impact bonds seem an appropriate, innovative financial mechanism to use private funding to support public goals. Impact Bonds, shorthand for social impact bonds, social benefit bonds or development impact bonds, are a new social investment mechanism that is growing in popularity. Impact bonds effectively allow the risk of implementing social development activities to be shared with private sector investors. Social or development impact bonds replace the upfront financing of charitable activities with a pay-for-success contract. Four actors together agree upon the outcomes and their indicators: outcome sponsor, investor, project implementers, and verifier.
Basic structure of an impact bond
Compared with result-based financing, impact bonds include a third party, the investor, who pre-finances the necessary activities to achieve desired development outcomes. The investor is paid based on results achieved. Impact bonds generally involve four actors: investor, service provider, outcome sponsor, and verifier. The investor pre-finances the activities of a service provider, serving a particular societal outcome. An independent verifier assesses whether the outcomes are met according to the contractual arrangements. The outcome sponsor agrees to pay the investor once the agreed outcomes have been achieved. Impact bonds have variable returns, similar to equity investments, including interest on return.
The process to organise the design of an impact bond, including agreeing on the outcomes and the specific contractual arrangements, can be complicated and time-consuming; therefore, an intermediary sometimes facilitates the process to create the structure for the development impact bond (DIB), including the legal and financial specifics.
An impact bond adheres to four criteria. Firstly, measurable outcomes are to be defined that can be measured by the independent verifier. The simpler and clearer the outcomes are, the easier it is to measure success in an unambiguous manner (Gustafsson-Wright et al., 2015). Secondly, a reasonable time horizon to achieve the outcomes needs to be defined. Thirdly, there should be evidence that the outcomes can be achieved successfully. This will motivate the investor to provide the pre-financing and take the risk. Fourthly, the appropriate legal and political conditions need to be in place to support the impact bond. If governments are involved as outcome sponsors, the legal structure should generally allow them to pay for outcomes achieved beyond the fiscal year (Gustafsson-Wright et al., 2015).
Target indicators and Development Impact Bond value to sponsor
We can note the following possible options: Replacement value
The value of the result can be evaluated as the cost that the outcome sponsor would need to incur if it wanted to produce the results itself. Results like operationalization of a production facility, construction of a warehouse, or installation of water pumps give a fairly precise approach to estimating their value.
Outcome players are likely to have all the necessary assumptions at hand, and it is immediately clear if financing via a DIB brings any benefits. At the same time, for a wide range of results, such as facilitating vertical diversification of smallholder producers, this approach is not directly applicable owing to the uncertainties of future developments in the value chain as the result of the project.
Activity-based approach
If the schedule of activities to be implemented towards the achievement of the result is known, it is technically not difficult to calculate the cost of implementing these activities. The total budget for activities, plus a certain level of profitability, provides a fair benchmark for projects focusing on issues such as education, vaccination campaigns, or quality certification for market access, among others. The negotiations between outcome sponsor and investor on the value of the DIB would be fairly simple in such cases.
However, this approach faces a natural limitation because the investor would essentially need to take the risk of not reaching the intended results despite full and diligent implementation of activities (‘effectiveness risk’).
This risk would vary by sector, and the negotiation of profitability markup by the investor may be expected to fail if the expected effectiveness of proposed activities is insufficient in mitigating the effectiveness risk. At this stage, it is not entirely clear where such a limit of activity-based approach would lie in practice because the limit will mainly be seen in the failure of negotiations of DIBs. It seems that identifying and examining such cases presents a separate research challenge to provide more insight into the practical applicability of an activity-based approach.
Financializing economic impact
This approach assumes that the outcome player can agree on some measure of the economic impact of a project. The net economic value of a project could be calculated using assumptions as is commonly done in commercial projects. The outcome sponsor may wish to get involved in such projects because the use of normal forms of financing is not possible owing to lack of viable monetization. The determination of the value of such a DIB would best be based on objective economic indicators such as revenue, the price premium for quality, or volume of transactions in a microfinance scheme, among others.
The estimates of a net economic value are notoriously imprecise and, in the absence of some objective indicators, the negotiations of a DIB are also likely to fail.
However, the list of specific activities to be financed under a DIB contract does not need to be negotiated and specified in such a contract, which opens considerable scope for the investor to monitor and mitigate the risk of delivering the intended result by adjusting the activities in the implementation process.
