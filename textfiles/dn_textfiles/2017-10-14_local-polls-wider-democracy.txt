Local Polls to a wider Democracy

With the latest amendments to the Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabha Bills passed in Parliament without a division, the path is finally clear for the Local Government polls to be held most likely in January next year. This brings a long delayed opportunity for democratic action by the people, the first since the major political changes in 2015, and also what could be a very keen contest between the two parties in the coalition of national unity – the UNP and SLFP, as well as the ground breaking electoral exercise to the Sri Lanka Podujana Pakshaya (SLPP), led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, although yet not formally.
While the parliamentary unity of the ruling coalition will remain unchanged, the contests between the UNP and SLFP at local government level will certainly bring in a new level of political rivalry in the country, with major issues of national and political leadership canvassed among the people – between the SLFP’s Maithripala Sirisena and the UNP’s Ranil Wickremesinghe. In addition to this rivalry will be the SLPP campaigning seeking to establish its position as the main opposition party in the majority Sinhala-Buddhist areas of the country.
The role of the SLPP in these polls will firstly be a challenge to the President Sirisena’s leadership of the SLFP, and also a major attempt to show that Mahinda Rajapaksa still has the support of a majority of the Sinhala Buddhist voters. In this context, the coming Local Government polls will be a test of the lay of politics in the country, and should give important signals about the future trend of politics, to be seen whenever the Provincial Council polls are held, and the next General Election due in 2020.
With his leadership of the SLFP now accepted both legally and formally, President Sirisena has taken many initiatives to control the SLFP members within the government, mainly in the Cabinet and key government positions, to move away from their strategies of seeking a new unity between him and Mahinda Rajapaksa. The government’s present actions against the forces of corruption has helped in curbing these pro-Rajapaksa groups, as well as, Sirisena’s moves to remove the pro-Rajapaksa party organisers at the electoral level and replace them with his own supporters; building his strength within the party, and in many electoral areas.
The Basil line
While the UNP and SLFP will have their own clashes in the coming polls, the complexity of the leadership issue in SLPP was seen with the recent visit of Basil Rajapaksa, the key organiser of the party, to Jaffna, to obtain northern support. Although a brother of MR, Basil remains a not very popular member within the SLFP, due to what many see as his contribution to the defeat of MR in the Presidential Poll in January 2015. He is seen as the major image of corruption within the Rajapaksa Regime that led to the defeat of MR. His failure to contest the August 2015 General Election, and the many charges of corruption brought against him in recent months, makes him a questionable figure for popular leadership of the SLPP, although he certainly is a background manipulator, with little concern for public image, as seen in the days of the Rajapaksa Regime.
His efforts to attract Tamil voters in the North were certainly a twist of the political talk and strategies of the JO and the SLPP. The statement to the Jaffna Press Club that the troops under his brother who was Commander-in-Chief had committed crimes after the separatist war, although stressing they were individual crimes and not war crimes, was certainly moving away from the wide defence of War Heroes by MR and the JO.
Another major shift was his claim the SLPP supported the return of all occupied private lands to Jaffna to their owners. These were clearly strategic shifts to gain some popularity in the North, but it is the stuff that could well bounce back in the South, where the SLPP has to build strong forces on the basis of Sinhala-Buddhist majoritarian policies, the stuff of MR and the JO.
The SLFP under the Sirisena leadership has to vastly strengthen the grassroots movement that was a key factor in the party’s success in any elections. It is certainly no easy task today, but is facilitated by the SLFP sharing power. Yet, it also has to face a major challenge from the UNP that remains undivided, although there are issues over corruption that can affect the support of the right wing voters. The SLPP faces a bigger challenge in attempting to show strength as an opposition party of credibility, having to need the services of the likes of Basil Rajapaksa for its strategies, and give confusing messages on its policies towards Tamils and the North.
Constitutional debate
As the campaign for the local polls moves on, the debate on the new constitution also gathers more interest, with Parliament due to discuss the Steering Committee Report of the Constituent Assembly later this month. Although there are many areas of importance in the Steering Committee recommendations, which are not final, the debate is largely focused on two issues, that of the structure of the State and the position of Buddhism.
There are so many twists and turns being given to the recommendations made on both these issues, giving the impression that the critics of what has been stated wish to give the impression that this is the final draft of the new constitution. The debate keeps whirling around the content of the “Unitary State”, with the most critics showing satisfaction with the present situation, and not even considering any possible improvement. They are concerned about the possible room being made for a “Federal State” while wholly neglecting to consider the values of the recommended situations on wider power sharing, under a unitary state.
On religion too, there is much criticism for the proposals that would give more meaning and content to the rights given to religions other than Buddhism, as provided in the present Constitution, while preserving Buddhism’s foremost place and it is the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana. There are wholly unfounded twists to the recommendations made which, far from reality, seek to show that other faiths will have new and more rights than now, and would thus be a threat to Buddhism.
There is also a regretful confusion, especially in government ranks, about the future of the Executive Presidency, with the SLFP wanting to retain what that party has clearly wanted replaced from the time it was introduced in 1978. It shows the politics of convenience and not that of principle.
One regretful aspect in this debate is that it is largely wangled by the critics, with little heard from the government, which has made broad statements and given assurances to the Maha Sangha about Buddhism. A better debate with more participation by government voices, and not only Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, a key member of the Steering Committee, would certainly help in showing the public the much wider aspects of the proposed constitutional measures, and giving meaning to a possible referendum to adopt a new constitution, which will do away with the Executive Presidency.
Treasury Bonds and EPF
The Treasury Bond probe is gaining increased public interest with more information being revealed about the role of the Employees Provident Fund, as a Primary Dealer in the bond market, and the evidence of the massive losses that EPF had allegedly suffered in questionable bond dealings.
While the main issue of the bond probe by the Presidential Commission has to do with the large losses to the national budget from the alleged scams, the public interest is certainly heightened with the EPF, the main retirement benefit scheme of employees in the private sector being drawn in. Spread throughout the country, and numbering many millions, fears are now expressed by trade unions and mercantile employees that their retirement benefits could have been adversely affected by the losses suffered by the EPF in secondary transactions, which could even lead to trade union action with a large impact.
The politics of the T-Bond scams was seen with the presence before the Commission of Ministers Kabir Hashim and Malik Samarawickrama who mentioned the need to raise Rs. 15 billion for State needs. They denied that the questionable primary dealer, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. or its members had made any contributions to the UNP. While the Chairman and General Secretary of the UNP did clear the Party on such approaches, the forgetfulness of the former Finance Minister of the donations given to him for Penthouse occupation, while being a deputy leader of the UNP, shockingly remains.
The public interest will continue as to why the EPF did not bid at key T-Bond auctions as a Primary Dealer, but bid for the same tenure bonds from the secondary market, at a loss to the EPF.
