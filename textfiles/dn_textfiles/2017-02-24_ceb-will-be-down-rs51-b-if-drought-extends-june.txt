CEB will be down by Rs.51 b if drought extends to June

The Ceylon Electricity Board will have to bear an additional cost of Rs 51 billion for power generation if the prevailing drought continued till June 30, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya told Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation while moving the Engineering Council Bill for the second reading.
The minister said this was informed to the Government, adding that the Treasury during the Disaster Management Committee meeting presided by President Maithripala Sirisena agreed to disburse the money in several stages as per the need.
He requested the consumers to use electricity sparingly and extend their full support for power saving efforts. He also asked the industrialists who possess generators to use during this difficult period.
“It is reported this would be the worst situation in 40 years if the drought continues for another month. The additional cost we have to bear is due to this disaster situation” he said.
The minister, commenting on the Bill to provide for the establishment of the Engineering Council of Sri Lanka, said all the Clauses which the Supreme Court ruled inconsistent with the Constitution would be duly amended at the Committee Stage.
The minister pointed out the ground work for the establishment of the Engineering Council started 35 years ago, adding that the realization of it was a historical achievement towards the maintenance of professional standards and conduct of engineering practitioners.
He thanked Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka for the special interest taken in drafting this legislation.
The Council will consist of four ex-officio members namely three Deans of the Faculties of Engineering or their representatives not below the rank of a professor, and Director General of Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission.
The Council will consist of 17 members altogether. As per the Bill, all engineers are required to register in the council.
