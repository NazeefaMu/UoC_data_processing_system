Corrupt officials will be punished - Devapriya

Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said yesterday that President Maithripala Sirisena is the only leader in Sri Lanka who had taken action against corruption and fraud in his own government.
He said that certain politicians in both government and the opposition who have been exposed by the Bond Commission are now viciously attacking President Maithripala Sirisena.
However, the former regime did not appoint any Commissions to reveal these scams.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Devapriya alleged many media institutions and websites which attack the President are directly connected to Ministers of this government.
“A certain website connected to a former Minister of this government had attacked me and Minister Patali Ranawaka saying that we had earned money from garbage disposal,”.
“This type of clean political culture initiated by President Sirisena has not been seen previously in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we will not stop taking further action against corrupt people.
We have created a new SLFP after introducing many reforms to the party. We are fielding candidates who have not been associated with corruption and this has strengthened the party,” Devapriya.
