Can-Sur-Vive, a CSR effort aimed at reinstating the lost zeal while providing the survivor with emotional, psychological and societal wellbeing is a project of the Can-Sur-Vive Trust of Sri Lanka.
Breast cancer is the top cancer in women worldwide and is increasing particularly in developing countries like Sri Lanka where the majority of cases are diagnosed in late stages. Further cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among the females in Sri Lanka. However, with early detection and treatment of all cancers can be cured and managed.
The workshop will be enriched with lectures by Consultants, including well-known Clinicians, Psychologist, Occupational therapists, Physiotherapists, Sociologists, while financial advisors, Clergymen will discuss the main issues and challenges faced by the survivors.
Although the “survivor” is often used to mean someone who has finished active treatment, ‘CAN – SUR – VIVE’ program intends to invite all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who are presently on treatment too.
Interested participants could register for the free workshop by calling the registration hotline 0713 161616.
