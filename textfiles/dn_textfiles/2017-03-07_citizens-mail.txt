 Invest in schools, not prisons
President Maithripala Sirisena has recently turned down an invitation to open a prison complex at Angunakolapalessa. The prison is a luxurious one, so we hear. The president is recorded to have said that he would not willingly take part in any such occasion. President Sirisena expressed these sentiments at the 150th anniversary of St Mary’s College, Kegalle. When he emphasized that he would open schools but not prisons, it naturally brings us to Victor Hugo’s celebrated maxim: He who opens a school door, closes a prison.
While applauding President Sirisena for his bravery in issuing such a statement, we cannot help recalling the horrendous incidents that has been plaguing this beautiful island. Monday’s killing of seven persons is latest in the scene.
It goes without saying that the prison is where criminals are quarantined for punishment. Imprisonment is a measure to avoid a criminal from committing the same mistake over and over again. But then why make it lavish? Is it to encourage being imprisoned? Or is it a new decision taken to cheer up the politicians arrested for their malpractices? If that is the case, of course a luxurious prison complex makes sense. But it is not the case when it comes to law and order in a society. Prisons are not meant to be encouraging. A luxurious prison complex indirectly encourages the criminals, need I say more? And that beckons danger to a civilized social order.
I doff my hat to your bold statement, President Sirisena. At the same time, I keep my fingers crossed that you would take a bold initiative against the increasing crime rate of this country.
