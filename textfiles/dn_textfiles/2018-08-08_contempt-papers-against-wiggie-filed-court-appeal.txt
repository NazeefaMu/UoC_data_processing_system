Contempt papers against wiggie filed in Court of Appeal

Filing an affidavit before the Court of Appeal, B.Denishwaran alleged that Northern Province Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran and several others have willfully acted in contempt of the Court of Appeal order since they prevented him from acting as a Minister of the Northern Province.
The Court of Appeal had issued an Interim Order, preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran to remove B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Minister of Fisheries and Transport in the province.
Denishwaran stated in his affidavit that the first Respondent, Justice Wigneswaran has, by his conduct and statements, acted in contumacious and willful disobedience of the order of Court of Appeal and thus committed an act of contempt against the authority and dignity of the Court of Appeal.
The petitioner further alleged that Chief Minister Wigneswaran willfully intended to act in defiance of the order of Court of Appeal notwithstanding the fact that no Order has been issued by the Supreme Court staying the operation of the said Order of Court of Appeal.
The petitioner cited Chief Minister Wigneswaran, K.Sarveswaran and K.Sivanesan as respondents.
The Court of Appeal on June 29 issued an Interim Order preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to expel B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the province.
The petitioner B.Denishwaran had challenged Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran in the Court of Appeal, complaining that the Chief Minister had no power to appoint or remove any Provincial Council minister. The petitioner cited Chief Minister Wigneswaran, K.Sarveswaran, Ananthi Sasitharan, G. Gunaseelan, K.Sivanesan and P. Sathyalingam as well as Governor Reginald Cooray as respondents.
The petitioner claims he was one of the members of the Northern Province Board of Ministers. He states that in October 2016, a dispute arose with respect to the conduct of ministers, following which the Chief Minister appointed an inquiry panel.
Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran had filed an appeal in Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal’s Interim Order to prevent Wigneswaran’s decision to remove B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Minister of Fisheries and Transport in the province.
