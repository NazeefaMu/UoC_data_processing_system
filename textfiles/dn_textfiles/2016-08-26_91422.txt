Getting ready for a Wild Finale

 
The new and improved Wild Elephant from Elephant House has signed on with the popular TNL Onstage Season 16 music competition as its “Official Beverage Partner”.
Re-launched recently with a more refined taste, in an iconic, stylish can, Wild Elephant is now available in two variants, the original Wild Elephant in a red can, and sugar-free Wild Elephant in a blue can. It is currently available island-wide at grocery stores, supermarkets, restaurants, clubs and even pubs and bars.
As an enthusiastic and committed partner in 2016’s TNL Onstage Season 16, Wild Elephant has already been involved in each and every step of this competition. Beginning with the Auditions onwards, Wild Elephant has been integrally involved in the Knockout Rounds, the Workshops and in other supplementary programmes, all of which will lead up to the Finals on September 3, 2016.
Having kicked off in 1999, TNL Onstage is one of Sri Lanka’s most famous annual music talent competitions, organized by Sri Lanka’s TNL Radio Network. The competition takes place over a two-month period during which participants undergo amazing experiences, learning about different types of music, competing amongst themselves in an effort to further hone their musical skills, as well as taking part in enlightening one-on-one sessions with established musicians. In 2016, this contest offered categories for solos, bands, instrumentals and DJs (Commercial and Electronic).
In line with its brand promise, “Ready for Anything”, the new and improved drink is fully committed to being the energising partner for this popular competition, not only in supporting each and every contestants in diverse ways, but also empowering them with the guts and confidence vital to facing any challenge.
To this end, Wild Elephant has partnered with TNL Onstage Season 16 towards introducing brand new concepts to the competition as well. The Wild Elephant: Wild Card is such a concept, which gives eliminated bands a second chance through public voting, with the winner earning the opportunity to compete on the day of the Finals.
Additionally, they also continue to actively engage with its fans at every level during the TNL Onstage Season 16 programme, which is inclusive of The Busking Sessions, where finalists perform LIVE at several high profile venues all over Colombo, in the lead up to the Finals.
“With the re-launch of the brand which highlights a whole new product, look and feel and an improved taste, Wild Elephant will be focusing solely on Sri Lankan youth.
In line with this thinking, we have introduced the new Sugar Free Wild Elephant variant with 0% sugar, to address the changing life styles of youth towards healthy living. In line with the brand’s promise - Ready for Anything, Wild Elephant partnered with TNL Onstage this year, with the objective to support and bring out local musical talent, which is important to the brand. We will not only partner with TNL Onstage but we’ll also take it up on ourselves to ensure the contenders who show great passion towards what they do, are given the supporting hand to succeed in the industry”, Wild Elephant Assistant Brand Manager Sudeepa Weerasekera said in a release.
“Elephant House Beverages has partnered with TNL Onstage for many consecutive years and, this year, we have decided to partner the programme with Wild Elephant, which is one of the most vibrant and dynamic brands in our portfolio, which targets the developing of youth talent in Sri Lanka”, JKH Assistant Vice President/Elephant House Beverages Head of Marketing Sathish Rathnayake added.
“Considering Wild Elephant’s recent re-launch and the new concepts that TNL Onstage has introduced this year, I think the partnership between the two brands makes perfect sense”, JKH Vice President Elephant House Head of Beverages Daminda Gamlath stated.
