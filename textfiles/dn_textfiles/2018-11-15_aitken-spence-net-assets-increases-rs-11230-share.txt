After discounting the exceptional gain on disposal of Hotel Hilltop Kandy in September 2017, the Group has recorded a PBT growth of 19% year on year in the second quarter and registered a significant improvement over the performance of the first quarter of the current financial year.
The tourism sector reported a decrease inprofits-before-tax YoY. This was mainly owing to the significant gain from divesting in Hotel Hill Top that amounted toRs. 307.6 million Last year. The devaluation of the rupee had a negative impact on the translation adjustment of foreign currency loans taken by the tourism sector, which also witnessed a drop in the contribution from Meedhuparu resort in Maldives due to its investment made in the new resort Aarah. However, the revenue of the tourism sector was up 8.4% YoY to Rs. 12.06 billion from Rs. 11.12 billion.
There were significant improvements in the maritime & logistics and services sectors. The turnaround of cargo sector and improved performance of the ship agency operation resulted in an increase in profit-before-tax for themaritime & logistics sector.
The sector revenue increased by 10.2% to Rs. 5.62 billion from Rs. 5.10 billion. The quarterly profit-after-tax of the sector increased by 24.9 percent to Rs. 711 million from Rs. 569 million, over the previous year.
