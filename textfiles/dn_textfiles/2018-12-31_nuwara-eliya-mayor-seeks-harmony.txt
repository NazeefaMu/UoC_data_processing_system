Nuwara Eliya Mayor seeks harmony

Nuwara Eliya Mayor Chandana Lal Karunaratne said a businessman in Nuwara Eliya had filed a case against him claiming Rs. 500 million as damages since he had granted permission to erect a kovil at a location close to Nuwara Eliya that had been used by Hindu devotees to perform religious observances for a long time.He said the businessman lived near the location.
The Mayor was addressing the monthly meeting of the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council (MC) held on December 28. He said a multi-ethnic community lives in Nuwara Eliya and communal and religious harmony in the area should be ensured.
The Mayor said he had directed the MC Commissioner to check the litigant’s credentials to this land.
Karunaratne said he is not a wealthy person.
He said that if he lost the case, he would sell a property he owns to pay the compensation that the court orders him to pay because he valued respect of the Hindu Community in Nuwara Eliya more than his land and other properties.
