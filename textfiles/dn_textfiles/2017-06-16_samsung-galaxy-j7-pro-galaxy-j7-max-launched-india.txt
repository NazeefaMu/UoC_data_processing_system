Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro, Galaxy J7 Max launched in India

Samsung has unveiled two new ‘J’  series smartphones, the Galaxy J7 Max and Galaxy J7 Pro, at an event in New Delhi.
 The South Korean giant has teamed up with Reliance Jio to offer up to 120GB of additional data to buyers of the Galaxy J7 Pro and Galaxy J7 Max. The former comes with Samsung Pay service seen on the likes of Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, while the latter includes a new service that Samsung is calling Samsung Pay Mini.
The Galaxy J7 Pro and Galaxy J7 Max sport a slim metal unibody design with no bezel on the left and right edges of the smartphone. There is a Home Button in the front with the fingerprint scanner underneath. The volume keys are on the left edge while the power button sits on the right edge of the smartphones. Both the smartphones come in Gold and Black colour options.
Samsung Pay Mini, which makes its debut with the Galaxy J7 Max, is a toned-down version of the Samsung Pay mobile payments standard. It is meant for phones that do not have in-built NFC. It doesn’t work with regular swiping machines for ’tap and pay’ offline payments, but supports mobile wallets and UPI for online payments.
As for optics, the Samsung Galaxy J7 Max packs a 13-megapixel rear and front sensors with f/1.7 aperture and f/1.9 aperture respectively, and flash support on both ends
The smartphone packs a 3600mAh battery and is IP54 certified for being splash proof. It supports dual-SIM slots, USB Type-C port, and 4G LTE. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro is 7.9mm thick. (Gadgets)
