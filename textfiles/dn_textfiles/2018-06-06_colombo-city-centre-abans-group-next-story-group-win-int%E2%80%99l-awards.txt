Colombo City Centre, Abans Group, Next Story Group win Int’l Awards

Colombo City Centre recently added two new accolades to its portfolio at the multidiscipline, multinational Golden Globe Tigers Awards held in Kuala Lumpur in April 2018.
Emerging triumphant over some of Asia’s most recognised brands, Colombo City Centre won awards for the ‘Upcoming Mall of the Year’, and the ‘Best Innovative and Sustainable Design of the Year’.
“We are honored to receive such recognition on an international platform,” said, Anand Sundaram, CEO of Colombo City Centre. “Our continuous drive for success is testament to Colombo’s upcoming potential, and we are proud to play a key role in its development as a world-class metropolis.”
The two new awards are the latest in Colombo City Centre’s milestones for 2018 – the first being an early topping out which was achieved 30 days ahead of schedule.
These accomplishments add to the project’s previous accolades from 2017 when it was honored for ‘Brand Excellence’ by the Golden Globe Tigers, adjudged ‘Asia’s Greatest Brand’ by AsiaOne Magazine, and declared the ‘Most Promising Mixed Use Development’ by CMO Asia – one of the continent’s foremost associations of high-level exchange between next-generation marketing leaders.
A highly anticipated addition to the capital’s fast-developing skyline, Colombo City Centre is Sri Lanka’s first BOI - approved mixed development project, slated for completion in early 2019.
The USD 170 Million joint venture between local retail giant, Abans, and Singapore-based Next Story Group is one of Sri Lanka’s largest foreign direct investments in recent times, and rises 47-storeys above the heart of the city.
Honored by several international associations since its inception, Colombo City Centre is a multi award-winning skyscraper dedicated towards transforming Sri Lanka’s capital into a global metropolis with the first integrated lifestyle complex of its kind.
This includes Sri Lanka’s first international mall with high-end brands, a 700-seat food court and 6-screen multiplex cinema, the upscale NEXT Hotel® with 164 keys, and 192 luxurious residential units designed to offer unmatched views of the city, Beira Lake, and Indian Ocean.
