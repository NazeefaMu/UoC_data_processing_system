Weliweriya Booms 6 clinches Red Bull Tuk It 2018 title

Freshers ‘Weliweriya Boom 6’ put up a gallant effort to outclass many seasoned campaigners and emerged champions of the Red Bull Tuk It second edition concluded at the Moonemale Estate at Kaluaggala recently.
Altogether 155 teams comprising of 465 participants lined up to test their strength and endurance where all teams were equally tested in a battled of fatigue, emotions and challenges on a tough Lankan terrain which has proven idel for the contest.
Stage one of this year’s Red Bull Tuk It put the participants through an initial obstacle course that was designed to mimic the conditions of the terrain that would follow through in the second stage. Lasting for more than 36 hours and crossing more than 15 cities over a distance of 200 kilometers from Kaluaggala to Negombo through a challenging route that involved hill climbs, river crossings, mud pits and extreme weather.
Many of the returning teams from 2017 knew what was to be expected of Red Bull Tuk It, and were very well prepared to get through more than 35 hours through Sri Lanka’s most extreme tuk-tuk challenge. Even though being a new team, ‘Weliweriya Boom 6’ got a hold of survival tips quickly by conversing with the returning teams, coupled with great round one points lead and patient navigational instructions created the winning formula to claim the top spot in the podium this year.
Team Nipun Baja from Negombo and Weliweriya Boom 3 also were able to end up with podium finishes at 2nd and 3rd places respectively. It is also a point to note that all three podium finishes this year were new teams.
The most creative tuk-tuk award was won by Team No. 067 from Nuwaraeliya for the most original design using the Red Bull can.
“We were really excited to be a part of such a great event like Red Bull Tuk It. We had some ideas of what it would be like, from talking to last year’s teams. But in reality the route was tougher than we expected, but in the same time it also showed us how beautiful our country really is with all the views we got from the mountaintops until we hit the beach park in Negombo. We are definitely looking forward for next year’s Red Bull Tuk It in order to try and defend our champion’s title” said Weliweriya Boom 6, the winning team of Red Bull Tuk It 2018.
Red Bull Tuk It is a rally style challenge that utilizes Sri Lanka’s most used form of transportation – the tuk-tuk, while allowing teams to experience the iconic beauty of Sri Lanka.
The course is not necessarily physical, but by accomplishing tasks, which are a combination of active adventure, getting to grips with tasks of local traditions and then the ultimate satisfaction of reaching the end brings the essence of what the project is about.
