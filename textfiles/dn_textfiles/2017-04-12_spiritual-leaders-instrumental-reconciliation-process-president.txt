Spiritual leaders instrumental in reconciliation process: President

President Maithripala Sirisena says spiritual leaders are the real messengers who connect the hearts of the people and strengthen reconciliation as wished by every religious philosophy.
He was speaking at the cultural programme, “Erabadu Vasantham,” dedicated to enhance ethnic and religious reconciliation, held at Singakkuliya, Dankotuwa on Sunday. A programme was also organised to remember the service of the late Rev. Fr. Marcelline Jayakody in line with the cultural event.
He said the guidance for reconciliation is witnessed in Thripitaka, Bible, Quran and Bhagavad-Gita.
The President highlighted that Buddhist monks and all other priests belonging to Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity are expected to make use of the norms of the great teachings.
Speaking further, the President said the country was built upon on peace and reconciliation among different communities from the ancient times.
Sri Lankan nation should come together as a strong human wall while consolidating peace and harmony among different ethnic communities at the present context, the President said.
He explained that though some elements would try to insult the term “reconciliation,” Sri Lanka’s future will only be fruitful if the term would be given the true meaning and implement it in the society realistically.
The President recalled the services of legendary artiste Rev. Fr. Marcelline Jayakody, who earned the hearts of people from all walks of the life in Sri Lanka.
He presented a token of appreciation in the memory of Rev. Fr. Marcelline Jayakody to a senior member of his family Winifrida Jayakody.
The Maha Sanga led by Chief Prelate Most Ven. Iththapane Dhammalankara Thera, Christian and Catholic priest including former Archbishop Rt. Rev. Oswald Gomis, Hindu priests, Ministers Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, North-Western Province Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dasanayake, Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando, and Sarasavi Arts Association President Ananda Karunarathna were present.
