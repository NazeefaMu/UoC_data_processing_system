Lesser known, better value

An evergreen tree with glossy bright leaves, lavulu, is an attractive asset to the garden with its fruit turning a bright yellowish color after ripening. It is valued as an ornamental tree with great medicinal value. It is a fine garden companion to have. Garden Talk speaks to Director Institute of Indigenous Medicine, Swarna Hapuarachchi on the Lavulu fruit that is grown for food, medicine and aesthetic value.
“It is a very delicious sweet fruit. After ripening it takes a bright yellowish orange color. The interior pulp also is yellowish orange. At the beginning before ripening, the fruit is greenish. It has a high carotene content and has a strong smell. Like, Durian some people like the smell and some people don't. After ripening it is very soft and puffy and we can easily break it apart without using a knife,” said Hapuarachchi.
Lavulu can also be made into a curry similar to dhal curry. You can even make a tempered curry as well. The Lavulu is cooked while it is the stage between un-ripened (immature) and ripened (maturity). After it softens it is very difficult to cook. After it takes on a yellow color, it becomes very soft.
“When you prepare the curry the fruit should be hard and after cooking it becomes soft. Before ripening you cannot eat, because it is hard. After it ripens and softens it can be eaten as a fruit. When immature it has high latex making it difficult to eat. The bark and when plucking the immature fruit, we can find it has high white gummy latex which is why it is so hard to eat un-ripened fruit. And when it is cooked, it loses its sweetness,” stated Hapuarachchi.
Varieties

Lavulu tree is middle sized. In Sri Lanka it can be grown everywhere. There is no definite zone. It is grown in the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Cuba. There are so many varieties - nearly 60 varieties, the sizes vary.
“However this is an under-utilized crop, because it is not available. Not many people know about it. It can be found in villages. Throughout the year it can be grown anywhere in Sri Lanka. Usually it is available, preferably in the wet and intermediate zones,” added Hapuarachchi.
It is good for the younger children since it has high carotene content. It has high nutritional value, and has a high calorie content. Lavulu also has a very high energy value and rich with Vitamin C. It has high Carbohydrate content. It has proteins as well.
“It can be used as a jam or jelly, as well as a milkshake. When it is ripened it can be blended with milk and other ingredients and made into a milkshake. It is extremely tasty with natural vitamins. A number of processed food items, such as dessert (ice cream), marmalade and pancakes can be made. Lavulu also can be used to make sandwiches as the ripened fruit can be used as a paste. It has a very nice color with the layers. It can be used with chicken or fish sandwiches.
We can make the dried fruit into a powder. It can be used as a nutritional powder. We cannot preserve the Lavulu fruit as it is not long lasting. The ripened mature fruit cannot be kept for long. If we can dry it and powder it, we can use it. It can then be used with the milk or in pudding mixes. Fruits can be processed into pickles,” explained Hapuarachchi.
Medicinal value

As a medicinal plant it has immense value addressing a variety of medical problems.
“In Mexico the bark of the Lavulu tree is used to make decoction. It is used for fevers. In Cuba it is used for skin diseases. The seed is used as a remedy for ulcers. But still in Sri Lanka we are not using this for medicinal purposes. We are only using this as a fruit and curry, but this is not practised widely. If trees are available in our home garden then we can do it. The problem is that it is not popular. In Cuba a decoction prepared from the bark of lavalu is used to cure skin eruptions. The paste of seeds is applied for ulcers,” pointed out Hapuarachchi.
Flowering under tropical climate extends from January to June, though some trees flower throughout the year. The fruits generally mature from September to February. Some trees produce more or less continuously throughout the year.
