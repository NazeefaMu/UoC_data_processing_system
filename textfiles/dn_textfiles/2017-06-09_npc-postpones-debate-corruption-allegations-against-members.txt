NPC postpones debate on corruption allegations against members

The Northern Provincial Council (NPC) has postponed the debate on allegations of corruption and malpractices against some of its members to June 14.
The decision was taken after a committee report was submitted to the NPC when it convened on Wednesday, NPC sources said.
According to the NPC sources, heated arguments had broke out among some members when the issue was taken up.
A three-member committee appointed by Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran to look into the accusations against four NPC Ministers handed over a report containing their findings to the CM last week. Wigneswaran had told the NPC council meeting on Wednesday that an independent investigation has been done and the matter will be discussed on the 14th. However, some members had urged Wigneswaran to reveal the content of the report and have the debate on Wednesday itself.
Several other members had opposed the suggestion resulting in a heated argument between the two groups, the NPC sources said.
