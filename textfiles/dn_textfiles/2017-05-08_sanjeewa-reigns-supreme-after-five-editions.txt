Sanjeewa reigns supreme after five editions

B.A. Sanjeewa Kumara Jayalath comprehensively won the May edition of the Pin Fernando Grand Prix 2017 by a comfortable 9 strokes from M U Chanaka Perera, who took second place from Vinoth Kumar by one stroke.
The event was powered by Cat Solar and sponsored by United Tractor & Equipment Ltd (UTE).
It was refreshing to note that young Chanaka Perera and Vinoth Kumar of Nuwara Eliya, currently based in Qatar, and Chalitha Pushpika and Pradeep Bandara finish in the top 6. Lamindu Rainika the only junior to qualify occupied 7th place and also won the special junior prize in the PFGP May edition.
The final round was very challenging with some difficult pin positions and the picturesque Nuwara Eliya golf course was more challenging than it seemed. The winner B A Sanjeewa was 10 over par for the 4 rounds and scoring at the NEGC course was difficult.
Nonetheless, the Sri Lanka Open 2017 for Professionals and Amateurs is scheduled for July, whilst the 130th Sri Lanka Amateur Golf Championship has been rescheduled from October 16 to 22, to be conducted in Little England at the Nuwara Eliya Golf Club.
The Cat Solar Pin Fernando Grand Prix June edition sponsored by UTE will be played from June 13 to 16.
B A Sanjeewa leads the Cat Solar PFGP rankings comfortably at the completion of five editions as at May31.
