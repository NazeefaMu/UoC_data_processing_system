Parliament dissolved to avert conspiracy - Amaraweera

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said Parliament was dissolved to avert a conspiracy brewing in certain quarters.
He said that if the President did not take this step, people would undergo great difficulties. Asking for a fresh mandate is better, he said.
He said they must get a new mandate from the people to prosper the country. The Minister said several ministers of the previous regime have misused public properties and they will be brought to book.
