However till 5.00 in the evening no meaningful steps had been taken by the Director General of Sports to resolve this issue and even the water supply had broken down the Minister had to instruct the Minister’s staff and Ministry Officials to intervene.
A generator was then installed by the Electricity Board but they informed that it will take a day to restore services.
No Official of the Sports Development Department nor the Director General had bothered to even inspect the site up to now.
Meanwhile the Cabinet Minister of Sports, Provincial Councils and Local Government had instructed the Ministry officials and staff to accommodate the Athletes in a 4 star hotel and provide the necessary food and other facilities.
