India always ready to assist Sri Lanka: HC

India is ready to assist Sri Lanka in whatever possible way, High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu said.
He made these comments at a ceremony to mark the 68th Republic Day of India at the India House in Colombo yesterday.
High Commissioner Sandhu who hoisted the Indian flag, also read out excerpts from the address to the nation on the eve of the Republic Day by Indian President Pranab Mukherjee. The High Commissioner said “in the new international economic and political order that is emerging India is playing a very prominent role. In this quest we welcome our brotherly country Sri Lanka to partner with us”. The High Commissioner said the Indian President had highlighted that the Indian economy has been performing well despite the challenging global economic conditions.
In the first half of 2016-17 it grew at a rate of 7.2 percent. – same as the last year-showing sustained recovery. The Indian economy today was the fastest growing among the major economies of the world.
Quoting the Indian President, the High Commissioner added that India was firmly on the path of fiscal consolidation and the inflation level was within comfort zones. Sandhu also noted the President as saying that although India had a noisy democracy, yet the country needed more and not less democracy. According to the High Commissioner the Indian President on the eve of the republic day had said that in a fiercely competitive world, the country had to work harder than ever to redeem the promises made to the people. The Indian President had said the country had to work harder to eradicate poverty, to provide food security, to generate enhanced employment opportunities, to provide safety and security to women and children, to change the consumption pattern which has posed a threat to environment, to protect the pluralistic culture and tolerance, to keep terrorism at bay and to ensure the well-being of security forces.
A brief cultural programme organised by the Indian Cultural Centre followed.
