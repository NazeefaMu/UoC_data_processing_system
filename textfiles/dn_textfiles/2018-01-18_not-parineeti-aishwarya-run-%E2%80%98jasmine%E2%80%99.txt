Not  Parineeti,  Aishwarya  in the run for ‘Jasmine’

A film based on the subject of ‘womb-for-hire’ or ‘surrogacy’, ‘Jasmine’ has become the talk of the town due to the casting reports of the leading lady.
A few names were doing rounds, however, now, according to the latest reports, it seems Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is being considered for the role. Reportedly, Parineeti Chopra’s name was also in the race.
The producer of the film, Prernaa Arora allegedly clarified that Parineeti was never considered for the role in ‘Jasmine’ and that there is a different project for her in the future, while Aishwarya has been approached for playing the lead character in ‘Jasmine’.
The report further states that she even had a creative discussion with the ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ actress, who supposedly “liked” the idea.
Prernaa, who has worked with Ash in ‘Fanny Khan’ praised her and even called her a humble actress. TNN
