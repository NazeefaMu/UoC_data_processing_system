Zahira Walk 2017 postponed

The much awaited Zahira Walk 2017 has been postponed by a week to August 5 due to unavidable circumstances. It was originally scheduled to be held on July 29. This mega event is being organised by the Old Boys’ Association, with the collaboration of all affiliated groups under one umbrella to foster a sense of camaraderie among all participants to walk hand in hand and exhibit an unflinching loyalty to their alma mater. All affiliated groups numbering over 30 bodies, have extended their unstinted support and cooperation to make this epic event a truly memorable one.
“The OBA’s heartfelt thanks go to everyone for accepting the postponement in good faith. We will have the best of walks on August 5 and look forward to the valuable participation of everyone on the new date” said OBA President, M.U.M. Azmi.
The organizing committee has printed T-shirts, caps, souvenirs, and shawls for those taking part in the walk. The proposed parade will begin at 7.30 am from the college premises and will proceed through T.B. Jayah Mawatha, Lipton Circle, Horton Place, Borella Junction and finally proceed to Borella – Maradana Road, before returning to the college premises. Zahira Walk 2017 will cover a distance of nearly 6 km.
