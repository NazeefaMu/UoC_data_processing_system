He said there had been issues attributed to the transparency of tender procedures.The minister was speaking at Yattalatissa Dharmayathanaya in Yattogala, where he gifted a solar power panel for the use of the Dharmayatanaya.
“We are attempting to maintain a high level of integrity and transparency in our procurement activities,” he said.
“A report by the Auditor General to Parliament’s Sectoral Oversight Committee on Energy, had pointed out that there had been flaws on the part of the functions of the procuring company.
Firstly, they had not taken necessary legal action to rectify the wrongs of the previous board of directors,” he said.
“Secondly, there have been flaws that could be thought of as their doings,” the minister said.
“The Secretary of my ministry charged with identifying measures, recommended that the Board of Directors of the Lanka Coal Company be removed and its shareholders, the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Ports Authority, while the Treasury may take necessary action to ensure the company’s resourcefulness and transparency of functions in that a new board of directors will be appointed,” he added.
“I acted accordingly to meet these requirements for the benefit of the public, “he concluded.
