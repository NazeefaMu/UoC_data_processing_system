Tea production up by 36%

Tea production data for October 2017 released by SLTB, revealed a figure of 25.5 Mnkg sharply up 36% on last year’s drought effected quantity of 18.7 Mnkg.
Whist this looks favourable on the face of it, production is below the 2015 October figure of 26.8 Mnkg and 28.1 Mnkg harvested in 2014. Sri Lanka is yet to get back to pre El-Nino production levels and every month this year has recorded lower quantities compared with the corresponding period of 2015. Whilst there has certainly been more rain this year, overcast conditions and excessive rain have restricted growth from all three elevations.
Tea production for the period January to October has reached 258 Mnkg up 9% on last year’s low quantity of 237.6 Mnkg, but is well below 279 Mnkg of 2015 and 283 Mnkg in 2014.
