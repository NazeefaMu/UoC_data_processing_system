Trinity-Anthony’s in the scrum: who will succumb

Today’s schools rugby match between Trinity and St Anthony’s at the Pallekelle Stadium at 4.15 pm is part of a home series and it will be interesting to see who will succumb. These two schools are Kandy’s bitter rugby rivals and the players will throw everything into battle in an effort to win. Last year Trinity was able to beat their rivals by 49 points to 13.
Both schools are undoubtedly smarting after their defeats to Isipathana and Royal in their last outings and will try to make amends this evening.
The stage is set for another enthralling and bruising confrontation. Both schools are seeking to field their strongest possible lineup. Much will depend on how the game is officiated.
This time the two schools are playing in the Division 1 “Cup Competition”.
The Trinitians are likely to do well in the back division play. They have arguably the best back division line in the hills. They tend to be, faster, more elusive players. It’s useful when one knows each other’s capabilities and uses them accordingly.
The Antonian forwards tend to be knowledgeable and stronger, and they have helped the school get back to Division I after three long years. These forwards when in possession of the ball move it towards the opposition goal-line. Their forwards in the last game against Royal made short bustling runs with the ball against stronger forwards. The Antonian forwards should do well in line outs an area where Trinity is weak.
Today’s clash is certain to draw a huge crowd of rugby lovers, in expectation of a grim yet attractive battle for supremacy. Trinity will depend much on skipper Rahul Karunatilake, Thushila Perera, Anuka Boyagoda and Leshan Wijesuriya, Aqtheeb Ramzeen, Nathan Yee, Diluksha Dange, Geshan Pethiyagoda and Sanushka Abeyawickrema. The Antonians will be expecting a lot from skipper Pasindu Dulshan, Shenal Dias, Anjana Ariyawansa, Mohamed Shabeer, Dinesh Rodrigo, Duminda Hettiarachchi, Asanka Maduwantha and fly half and place kicker Dinuk Amerasinghe and Praboda Bandara.
Sports in Kandy at club level needs a fillip
Sports is a significant part in the city of Kandy where Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils, Burghers, Malays and so many communities have made it their home, including all sports lovers. Today rugby is the most popular sport in the central hills at club level. In the early days Football and Cricket were much more popular together with Hockey. Then the other popular sports were netball, badminton, athletics, basketball, tennis, cue sport, volleyball, table tennis, elle, golf, swimming and baseball. Whatever is said and done schools regularly organize sports at top level and they are doing well at all sports they play. Thanks to the Principals and the past pupils Kandy has produced national captains at cricket, rugby, athletes, iron sports, hockey, football, boxing, swimming, basketball etc.
The sporting fraternity of Kandy wants to appeal to the Sports Minister to look into Kandy sports’ shortcoming at club level. The Chief Minister of Central Province Sarath Ekanayake one time president of the Basketball Federation, a keen follower of all sports gives a big hand, and also Minister Lakshman Kirielle and Rauff Hakeem too have promised to help thanks to “Mr. Rugby” Minister Malik Samarawickrema who is ever ready to give support.
