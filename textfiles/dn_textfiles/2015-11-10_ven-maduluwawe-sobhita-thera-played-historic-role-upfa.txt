Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhita Thera played a historic role - UPFA

Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhita Thera was a great sangha teacher born in this country. Great teachers have been born at various times in this country to play historic roles and Ven Sobhita thera also belonged to that category, the UPFA states in a condolence message on his demise yesterday.
The message signed by UPFA General Secrertary Prof. Vishwa Warnapala said Ven. Sobhita who preached the dhamma in a simple style peculiar to him was a great thera who dedicated his life for creating a true democratic country in this country. By expressing his views fearlessly on National, social and political problems displayed a great sense of learning. During the past several years he rallied the entire civil society behind a great struggle to strengthen and protect democracy and take the country towards a new direction.
The effort taken by him to socialise his ideas including the eradication of communalism helped to bring about far reaching changes in the political culture in this country. He not only played a leading role in the field of the progressive struggle but also stood for the religious harmony in this country.
His untimely demise was a great loss to all communities and religions in this country. May the Ven Maduluwawe Sobhita Thera attain the eternal bliss of Nibbana!
