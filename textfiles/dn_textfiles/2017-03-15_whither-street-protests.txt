Whither street protests?

If you talk to any of the Colombo’s bus or train passengers about the current wave of street protests, their first reaction will be anger and frustration against protestors, saying this is a public nuisance and people are either getting late to get to work or getting late to return home.
Public inconvenience is only one side of the coin. The other side includes more serious issues. The economy, including the private sector, is adversely affected costing billions in lost business and opportunities. With the continued protest marches in the country’s capital, foreign businessmen would think twice before taking a final decision in making investment in Sri Lanka.
Disruption
I recently asked a protest leader who is in the limelight these days why he thinks street protests succeed. This is what he said: “Let me get this out of the way and be as frank as possible. You cannot claim any sort of moral high ground if you’re more concerned with disruptions not reaching your jobs, homes, highways, and neighbourhood as long as justice does not exist for an entire population of people in the country.”
“These disruptions don’t occur in a vacuum. Context informs them. To get that many people to disrupt life in the Capital means that the legal, less risky channels for addressing one’s grievances have been exhausted. Negotiations, appeals, passive marches and strikes all have failed.”
“As for the tactic of the disruptions themselves, let’s simply ask ourselves this: Does a negotiation with the Minister occupy physical space, garner wall-to-wall news coverage, or offer feelings of solidarity and pride amongst people who are victimised?”
“Don’t think the protests in main roads and public transit the sole activity we are utilizing? There’s a diversity of tactics at play ranging from public debate, sit-downs with the political bosses and higher officials, preparing for legal action, enlighten the citizens through media conferences, petitions to Human Rights and so on.”
“And these tactics work. Political bosses get scared easily. As an activist who’s been invited to sit and “discuss things” with power after engaging in street protests, I always used to laugh when they’d express the desire to change. I’d literally think to myself, “You can already do what you want - what are you so afraid of?”
He has a point. The right to protest is a perceived human right arising out of a number of recognized human rights. While no human rights instrument or national constitution grants the absolute right to protest, such a right to protest may be a manifestation of the right to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of association, and the right to freedom of speech.
There was one point on which he had, even grudgingly, agreed: That such freedom to protest without being arrested (in large numbers) or brute force used, was not possible before 2015.
So, it is a right stolen and regained and, therefore, it is our duty to cherish and protect this right and not let it abused. Anybody can protest, anybody can rally without being antagonistic. Anybody can express his point as long as there is no impingement on the rights of others. I think the protesters need to work to address these issues.
Street protests and rallies will not go away in the foreseen future. In fact, they will become more and more intensive. Hence, it may prove useful for us to take a look at these “protests” and to focus on how the three main stakeholders – participants, public and police could manage those inevitable frustrating times.
Participants
First, it’s crucial for a protester to know what rights he has and doesn’t have. He must do his homework and find out whether the organizing leaders have a history of non-violent protests, and search whether the leaders plan to move through unrestricted areas and gather in a public, safe space. Second, he should assess carefully whether the protest leaders are genuine to fight for the cause and do not have any ulterior political motives.
It’s a common story, seen in many instances, where an initially peaceful protest movement subsequently engages in violent clashes with authorities. Images of peaceful demonstrators are replaced by rioters with poles, rocks and bottles. What separates the campaigns that maintain non-violent discipline from those whose discipline begins to break down? From the experiences of some recent incidents it is obvious there were pre-meditated plans by the protest organisers to create disruption and havoc for their own hidden political agenda.
The participant must be smart enough to know when to stay, and know when to leave. The important thing to know whether he is going out to enjoy his right to assemble or participate in or just make his voice heard. He must act accordingly, and when the time comes to leave or obey the police direction he should do so without delay. He should never go toe to toe with the police and antagonize them. He must be aware that arguing about his rights with a dozen police officers is probably a losing battle.
Public
Few generalizations can be made about the general public’s support for street protest movements in general; level of support varies by issue. But, in the current context, the public’s overall attitude toward street demonstrations seems to range from scepticism to outright condemnation.
I once asked a young protest leader, “Why don't you work these issuers through negotiation, legal action and other means that don't inconvenience me?” The leader quoted Martin Luther King Jr as his answer. King wrote in a Birmingham jail cell “These white moderates were quite right in calling for negotiation. The purpose of our direct-action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.”
In the end, even acknowledging the necessity of disruption to achieve change might not relieve the citizen’s resentment at being inconvenienced. Whether it is the “SAITM case” or the “Pensions issue,” street protests have always had its consequences – the public had always paid the full price for it.
Police
Sri Lankan Police has a long history of handling street protests and has been tested time and again on how to best manage mass protest demonstrations. Often the police succeeded brilliantly in peacefully managing thousands of demonstrators. At other times, the actions of the police became the unintended focus of protesters and the centrepiece of media coverage of the event. Tough lessons were learned during this period.
The challenge of policing street protests highlights a number of issues for today’s police officials, including how to effectively manage police resources to deal with large numbers of people who may be expressing their fundamental constitutional right to protest; how to work with business/community members who are not involved in the demonstration but who have an expectation that the police will protect them and their property from unlawful or destructive behaviour; how to effectively gather information for a planned or spontaneous mass street demonstration; how to integrate local and national resources - and maintain accountability; how to identify the policy issues and what procedures and safeguards should be in place for mass arrests, if necessary; determining what level of force should be used when demonstrators become unruly and who gives the command to use it.
Planning
In addition, police actions have now become the subject of increased monitoring by third parties, including news agencies and civil rights organizations, all of whom are armed with video cameras. These developments exert sustained pressure on law enforcement to “get it right.”
Police officers must also balance a number of conflicting demands when managing street protests. While allowing legitimate groups to express their fundamental rights, police needs to protect innocent bystanders; safeguard municipal and private property; ensure unimpeded commerce and traffic; contain unruly protestors with the appropriate type and amount of force; prevent injuries to officers, and, all the while, projecting professionalism and proficiency.
What is most important in handling street protests is the early and comprehensive planning for the events. The planning does not stop with the “plan.” It is a live process designed to avoid a potential crisis, while allowing senior officers the flexibility to meet unforeseen circumstances.
There is no contradiction between activist democracy and representative democracy. On the contrary, direct participation and activism of citizens, including through protest movements on the street, is a prerequisite for a representative democracy that functions and addresses the concerns of citizens.
