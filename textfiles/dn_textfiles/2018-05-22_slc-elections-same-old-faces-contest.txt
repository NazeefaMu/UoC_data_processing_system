Incumbent president Sumathipala seeks another term
SLC elections: The same old faces to contest

Sri Lanka Cricket released the nominations received for the annual general meeting scheduled to be held on May 31.
Whether all the names received will be eligible to contest remains to be seen as there could be room for objections to be filed against candidates and if there are any an inquiry will be held to justify their participation.
The Elections Commission will receive any objection to proposed nominees/candidates by member clubs till 3 pm today (May 22).
What the nominations reveal is there are no new names surfacing to contest the main office-bearer posts but the same old faces who have been in and out of cricket administration over the years.
For the post of president for instance incumbent president Thilanga Sumathipala is seeking another two-year term in office. Contesting along with him are Jayantha Dharmadasa, Mohan de Silva and Nishantha Ranatunga.
Dharmadasa and De Silva have been past presidents of Sri Lanka Cricket while Ranatunga was a past secretary who contested the post of president the last time and lost to Sumathipala. This year’s elections could also see a similar confrontation between the two.
What is so strange about the nominations is that there are three candidates contesting for three posts which in all probability the five-member Election Committee might disallow.
Mohan de Silva apart from contesting for the post of president is also coming forward for the post of vice president as well as secretary.
Shammi Silva who is contesting the post of vice president is also coming forward for the posts of secretary and treasurer, and Bandula Dissanayake who is contesting the post of secretary is also coming forward to contest the posts of assistant secretary and treasurer. Contesting for the assistant secretary’s post is incumbent assistant secretary Ravin Wickremaratne against whom there are allegations of fixing the Premier Division I cricket match between Panadura SC and Kalutara PCC. All current office bearers are coming forward to contest and win another term.
