Gadot  joins ‘Wreck-It Ralph’ sequel

‘Wonder Woman’ star Gal Gadot has been animated for a role in new Disney sequel ‘Ralph Breaks The Internet’.
The Israeli actress has revealed she is voicing the character Shank in the movie, explaining her cartoon alter ego is a tough and talented driver with a heart of gold.
“Shank is amazing at driving cars and has this bad-girl vibe to her,” she tells Deadline. “But as the movie goes on you realize how fun, wise and warm she really is on the inside, which is what I like most about her.” Shank is the star of intense online game ‘Slaughter Race’ in the film, the follow-up to ‘Wreck-It Ralph’.
“She is the coolest character in this world of ‘Slaughter Race’,” director Rich Moore explains. “Shank’s lived a lot, she’s seen a lot, yet she’s got nothing but kindness in her heart.”
The movie, which also features the voice talents of John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman, opens in America on November 21.
