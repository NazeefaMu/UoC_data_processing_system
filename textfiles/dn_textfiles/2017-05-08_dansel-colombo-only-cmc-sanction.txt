Dansel in Colombo only on CMC sanction

All dansel to be held in Colombo need to obtain the approval of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), the Health Department sources said.
According to the sources, all dansel organizers in the Colombo city need to fill a form and obtain approval from the CMC prior to holding dansela. After filling the form, the department will conduct a field inspection and approval will be granted to all dansel which have met the required rules and regulations.
No dansel will be allowed without meeting the required rules and regulations which have been introduced in order to protect the hygiene of food and persons who serve them. Over 100 dansel organisers have already obtained approval. It is believed that around 250 dansel are held in Colombo during the Vesk festival, the sources said.
Two teams of Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) including the Food Inspector of the CMC will carry out inspections for a period of one week commencing from May 10. Dansel which ignore rules and regulations will be banned and legal action will be taken against the offenders, the sources added.
