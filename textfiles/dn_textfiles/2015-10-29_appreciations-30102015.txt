Saumyamoorthi Thondaman:
Trade Union giant of plantation workers
The 16th death anniversary of Saumyamoorthi Thondaman falls today. All remember him as one who fought for trade union and political rights of the Indian origin people of this country especially of plantation workers.
The imperialistic and inhuman approach of the British Planters during colonial period had been an instrumental factor for Saumyamoorthi Thondaman to champion the cause of the plantation workers.
His wandering among tea bushes during his early childhood observing the pathetic conditions under which the indentured labour had been subjected to work had made indelible impressions in his mind to fight for the workers rights. This made him to assume leadership of the Ceylon Workers’ Congress in 1940 and continue until his demise in 1999.
The Ceylon Workers’ Congress of which he was the founder President became a political party subsequently. It played a major role in shaping the destinies of the Indian population in the country. Major strikes, go slows, work to rule campaigns and Satyagrahas waged by CWC had their impacts in industrial relations and even the industrial laws of the country.
The vexed question of citizenship and voting rights of the Indian population were restored by a series of amendments to citizenship laws culminating in eradicating the term “Statelessness” by the legislation brought in 2003.
In the same way, the amendment Act brought in on April 26, 1989 by the government conferred the voting rights on those newly registered as citizens of Sri Lanka.
Thondaman was a person of different roles, a trade unionist, a Minister, legislator, king maker, a respected and revered leader popularly called by all as ‘Ayah.’ He was able to move with ease with the President of the country and the humble worker. His diplomacy to interact with foreign dignitaries and international leaders brought esteem and honour to the country.
He was the founder President of the South Asian Trade Union Council (SARTUC) which consolidated and focused on the trade union movement in South Asia.
He was a member of the ILO governing body until he became a Minister. His contribution to the workers movement through the ILO, ITUC and international workers groups was immense.
He will be remembered for ever not only for deep involvement in trade union and political arena, but for promoting, supporting and spearheading measures for the educational, economic and social well being of the Indian community in Sri Lanka.
