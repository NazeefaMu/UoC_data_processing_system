Strong winds, heavy rains wreak havoc

Ceaseless rains and strong winds battered several parts of the country and floods inundated many low-lying areas forcing authorities to issue landslides and earthslips warnings to many districts. Major roads flooded and trees uprooted obstructing transport services and over 10 districts were issued warnings. The Southern, Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa, and Uva Provinces experienced heavy rains.
Strong winds and rains disrupted electricity supply, mainly in the Colombo, Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Hambantota and Badulla districts. Fallen trees along the track disrupted the Kelani Valley train services from Avissawella to Kottawa and the upcountry line from Badulla to Nanu Oya. The inclement weather affected over 20,000 people so far.
