ODEL paints new vistas with Desert Safari

Nature’s vistas and forms have once again inspired a seasonal fashion collection at ODEL, this time the dramatic shapes and colours symbolic of the desert.
The fashion-focused retail giant’s latest offering is a ‘Desert Safari’ themed collection of clothing and accessories to celebrate the pre-fall fashion season.
With its aesthetically designed bold patterns featuring plant life, cactus,animal prints and desert sunsets, the new collection explores hues of the wild on a spectrum ranging from khaki green, orange, mustard, maroon, brown, plum purple, grey, dark blue, white and beige. Inspired by international designer brands such as Huishan Zhang, Valentino, Chloe, Blumarine, Roberto Cavalli, Ellery, Neil Barrett and Versace, the collection includes statement pieces worthy of snazzy catwalks in the world of vogue. It is designed to appeal to the daring and more adventure-inclined patrons of ODEL, with an affinity for the great outdoors.
With its bold prints, bolder cuts and spotlight on nature’s arrays, ODEL’s ‘Desert Safari’ range is an exclusive capsule collection that will bridge the gap in the retail market between the summer and fall collections.
