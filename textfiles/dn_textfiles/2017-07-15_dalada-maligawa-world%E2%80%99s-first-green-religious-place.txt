Dalada Maligawa, world’s first green religious place

The Temple of the Tooth Relic (Dalada Maligawa) was named as the world’s first Green religious place of worship yesterday.
The National programme to name the Temple of the tooth as the world’s first green religious place of worship was held at the Temple of the Tooth Relic under the patronage of the founder of this programme, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
Through this programme, the entire temple premises will be made polythene and plastic free zones. Henceforth, the temple will provide recyclable vases at the entrance for devotees to offer flowers instead of the plastic vases that devotees bring inside the temple premises.
Only environmental friendly waste bins will be used inside the temple premises under this programme. The Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government has allocated provisions to provide a special vehicle to dispose of flowers and food materials.
Minister Musthapha intends to cover all the religious places in Sri Lanka under this programme.
