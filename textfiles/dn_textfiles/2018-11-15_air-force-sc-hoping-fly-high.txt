Air Force SC hoping to fly high

Sri Lanka Air Force who now go as Air Force Sports Club are all-out to enjoy success this season. Their rugby has targeted some top players , and these players determined to keep the Airmen’s rugby at its best. They played Kandy Sports Club in the opening game on Saturday and their next game is against Navy SC.
It was in 1961 Air Force SC, Police SC, Army SC, Navy SC and University were permitted to play in the “B” division alongside ‘A’ division clubs, Ceylonese Rugby & Football Club (CR & FC), Colombo Hockey and Football Club (CH & FC), Havelock SC, Kandy SC, Dimbulla Athletic & Cricket Club, Dickoya Maskeliya Cricket Club, Uva and Kelani Valley Club in the Clifford Cup competition, which was changed whereby all 13 clubs had to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the season the best eight teams went on to play in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup.
In 1972 Airmen were promoted to Division ‘A’, and by 1975, led by Kandy school product Shanthi U. Mendis, Air Force SC, were victorious in 12 out of 16 games at the end of the league season. In the knockouts they entered the Clifford Cup final by beating Kandy SC led Iswan Omar in the semis, in extra time and lost to Army SC in a close final 3-4. Two years later led by scrum half Ronald Rodrigo; they once again made the final, this time they lost to Havelock SC. Then in 1986 Air Force SC, captained by Lakshman Caldera, won the Clifford Cup, defeating Police SC in the final 10-8. In 1990, the Air Force SC had to withdraw from the game due to the north-east war.
The club’s rugby revival took place in 1995, coming back under the coaching of A. Tennakoon, after an absence of four years they won the Plate championship for three consecutive years in 1998, 1999 and 2000. The club were runners up in the Rugby Sevens championship three times in 2006, 2008 and 2010.
It was A.V.M. Harry Goonatilake who was a top sporting Commander who took Air Force rugby to a high level. Later others too followed in his footsteps to promote rugby, Goonetilleke’s son Roshan Goonatilake who too was a Commander also gave a big hand for rugby.
Air Force are famous for their hard brand of rugby and if they can blend it with some rugby skills they could get the better off the more fancied teams.
This season they are hoping to give their best under the captaincy of H.M.L. Udayanga. M.M.G. Iddamalgoda is the vice captain and the rest of the players in the squad are D.N.S. Weeraratna, N.M.T.Y. Sarathchandra, Frankk Kaadd, R.M.N. Rajanayake, H.R. Wasantha, W.M.S. Banda, Y.U.G.C.P. Abeyaratne, W.A.M. Kasun, J.H.P. Madushanka, J.A.D. Nilantha, U.V.P.N.S. Weralla, G.K.G.S.M.

This year’s rugby committee is well supported by the Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy. Rugby Chairman is Group Captain DCI Weerasooriya a keen follower of the game who played for CH & FC, CR & FC, Havelocks SC and Sri Lanka. He said this time they have a formidable team. He is well backed by secretary Group Captain BWDNM Samarakoon, Team Manager Wing Commander ADR Liyanaarachchi, Coach Ferrati Verebula and Assistant Coach Nishal Meepage.
They are blessed with a top rugby ground at Ratmalana which was opened on 29 March 2012, by Commander Air Vice Marshal Harsha Abeyawickrema. The improvement of this ground was due to the efforts of former commander Air Vice Marshal Roshan Goonatilake and the man who helped to complete the good work was Base Commander at Ratmalana at that time Air Commodore Sumangala Dias and the staff of SLAF Base Ratmalana.
