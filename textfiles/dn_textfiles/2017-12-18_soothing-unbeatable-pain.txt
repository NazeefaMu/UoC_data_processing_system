Q - How much sleep is required for patients who need palliative care ?
A - The reason for sleeping several additional hours and feeling lazy to wake up is the decreasing body fitness. A quiet and calm environment should be created for them to sleep. Their hands should be held and rubbed. Speak bit louder enabling them to hear and understand what you tell. Sometime such patients hear you and understand you but are unable to reply because of their weakness. Therefore we have to be kind to them.
Q - How should we monitor their breathing ?
A - Sometimes the patient who needs palliative care breath deeper than ordinary persons and sometimes their breathing is not monotonous. Sometimes they do not breath at all for about 30 seconds. The reason for this is weakened blood circulation. Sometimes the patients who are about to die breath from their (opened) mouth.
The head of the patient should be positioned at a height. It is better to keep the patient under a fan or closer to a fan but not too close. All doors and windows should be kept open in order to provide a better ventilation for such patients.
Q - What can be done to ease the discomfort of the patients who need palliative care ?
A - Such patients can feel discomfort due to the chemical changes that takes place in their bodies and infection conditions of the brain. Therefore these patients do not know where they are and have no idea about what they see. The patients fold and unfold their fingers all the time due to less blood circulation. Let such patients know that you are with them all the time by holding hands. Let them listen to music. If required, give them drugs according to medical advice. Do not stop their activities and body movements but be careful about the patient's safety.
Sometimes the patient may make an unusual rough sound when breathing. It is due to the collection of fluid inside their air passage. It is not due to any pain or discomfort. Therefore turn them to a side and let the fluid come out from the mouth and wipe out or place a piece of cloth under the chin. If required give relevant drugs to dry out fluids.
Q - What should be done when the hands and legs become cold and blue ?
A - Due to poor blood supply the hands and legs can become cold and sometimes blue. When the body try to maintain a good blood supply to the main organs, the other parts of the body such as hands and legs do not get adequate blood supply. Use socks, gloves, blankets to warm-up the body. Do not use electric blankets.
Q - How to manage the caretakers' stress during the process ?
A - It is very important to maintain the health of the caretaker. The caretaker should be always healthy and fit. Allocate a certain time for the process.
Share the patient's feelings, happiness and sorrow, give the patient good food, drinks and especially exercises daily. Keep the patient free and happy with his/her family members. Help the patient to achieve spiritual development according to his/her religion.
If the patient is a Buddhist let the patient to listen to Pirith chanting.
Providing palliative care for a loved one / relation / friend is a priceless deed which offers countless merits and self satisfaction. Palliative care does not extend or shortened the life of the patient. It only upgrade the quality of life without bed sores, pains and discomforts.
