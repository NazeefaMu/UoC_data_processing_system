NKAR Travels to boost MICE tourism with India

A joint venture between Sri Lanka and India to boost MICE tourism that caters for Indian tourists to conduct exhibitions, conferences, meetings and events at popular tourist destinations in Sri Lanka was signed by NKAR Travels and Tours with a top Indian counterpart.
The tourism initiative will commence before the end of this year. The agreement was signed by NKAR Travels Chief Operating Officer Dr. Damian Fernando with his Indian counterpart Jacob Pullan.
MICE is an abbreviation representing Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Events.
This tourism initiative is an upcoming trend in the world where top corporates plan their meetings, conferences and events in various destinations around the world.
Sri Lanka has also proven to be a strong and popular tourist destination that could cater for MICE tourists.
Speaking to Daily News Business, Dr. Damian Fernando said that this initiative is a great milestone for the country in gaining much important recognition as one of the key MICE destinations in the world.
He said although Sri Lanka is also rated as a popular MICE destination, this is the first occasion top Indian tourism corporates and top global leading brands such as Colgate, Times Group, Uniliver and TATA Communications will come together to commence this new initiative. Recalling the service rendered by NKAR Travels and Tours for the development of local tourism Industry, Dr. Fernando said the company was established in 1980 and it has been in the tourist promotion industry for the past 37 years.
He said NKAR Travels and Tours currently caters to a large number of tourists to Sri Lanka from over 50 counties around the world, including from UK, the Middle-East, India, China, Russia, CIS countries, Norway, Australia, France, etc.
Asked why he mentioned that Sri Lanka is one of the key MICE destinations in the world, Dr. Fernando said it is mainly due to several reasons such as that our hotels have conference halls with all facilities and attractive venues at almost all parts of the country to conduct exhibitions, conferences and meetings.
“In addition, our country is equipped with an array of natural resources, eco-friendly places and traveler-friendly climatic conditions which tourists like immensely,” he said.
When asked about few other countries that help to promote the MICE tourism in Sri Lanka, he said currently some countries in the Asian and European regions support to promote MICE tourism in our country.
The initiative is partnered by Amari Hotels, Jet Airways and Cinnamon Lakeside
