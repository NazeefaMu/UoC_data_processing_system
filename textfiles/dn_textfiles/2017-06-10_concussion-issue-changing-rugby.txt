Concussion issue is changing rugby

Concussion has become a bit of a buzzword at the moment, and it is changing the face of rugby in a lot of ways. There is now awareness, and the concussion issue is regulated as a result of World Rugby changing the laws as a means of prevention, but it remains something that can affect players at all levels.
If you go through some of the names affected recently, just in New Zealand, there is: Dane Coles, Ben Smith, Sonny Bill Williams, Ryan Crotty, Matt Todd and Charlie Ngatai have had concussions, while Kieran Read and Brodie Retallick previously had it quite badly; and now this weekend we have Ardie Savea and Beauden Barrett sidelined. And that's not to forget Daniel Baldwin, a young player in Wellington who died recently after a head clash, and Jordan Kemp a couple of years ago.
The spotlight right now is on concussion, and it is a positive that we are all talking about the issue. It is real, and it is something that is changing rugby. It's changing a lot of mindsets and it will be interesting to see where we go from here.
In days gone by, the attitude was always to "harden up" and just get on with the game because rugby was a contact sport. However, we are now starting to see the aftermath of that sort of attitude with the severity of effects among former players. Former Hurricanes lock James Broadhurst retired recently having fought long-term concussion issues, while research sponsored by World Rugby, published in Sports Medicine last year, found links between concussion and cognitive problems for rugby players.
The issue is not going to go away any time soon, and the concerns about concussion are highlighted by the number of high-profile players who are opting out week after week.
Now we have had the ACC (Accident Compensation Commission) throwing $NZ7million to New Zealand Rugby to put in some work to study the issue, and to me it begs the question: What is the solution?
I'm passionate about sports injury prevention -- that's the business I am in -- and I can see the question is: What is the how?
That interest has extended to our business sponsoring courses by a prominent sports medicine and rehabilitation provider, and I have taken the chance to ask some of the experts at these courses what the best methods are by which we can help?
Are mouthguards something that can help? Is neck strengthening being encouraged?
One speaker at a session said he didn't believe mouthguards or neck strengthening helped.
Then, earlier this year, an Otago University study came out and noted that neck strengthening was important.
I would love to see the introduction of a minimum-standard, accredited mouthguard because there are a lot of poor mouthguards out there. We are teaching young players to put some of these things in their mouth, chew on them and hope they do the job. But they never fit properly, as I've written previously.
You have got to have a properly fitted mouthguard.
I have been at games where I have seen young players sent from the field because they don't have mouthguards, and they go off the field and grab their mate's mouthguard, put it in their mouth, and go back on the field. That's not good enough. We almost need to educate referees so that kids don't just present them with their mouthguard in their hands.
They should have to open their mouth and show that it doesn't fall off the top teeth; only then will the referee know it is correctly fitted.
That way you know the player is protected by a properly fitted mouthguard that will provide the best protection when the point of contact happens.
It is not going to prevent massive impacts from happening, but it is something there can provide a cushioning effect.
These are the steps that we have to start taking with the younger generation. Boxing has been leading the way for a long time now, because it has to. You don't see boxers going into the ring with an average mouthguard or a weak neck; they wouldn't survive in that sport if they did.
I'm also big on the importance of neck strengthening. I've known this for a long time, and have been banging on about having players at a young age do the neck resistance exercises.
The Otago University study showed how the neck stops reverberations and acts like a strong spring, but the trapezius muscle is also hugely important.
Hence I would put money on suggesting that most loosehead props are probably more resistant to concussion than any other player on the field due to what they have to do in the scrum: If you think about the downward pressure on the back of their head, and how they exert their trapezius and neck, some of those players are very strong in those areas.
With the cleaning out that has become part of rugby in the past 20-30 years, the loose forwards now are the players most susceptible to concussions.
Before the cleaning out became common, it was generally felt you had to get lower than your rivals if you wanted to move your opponent. But we are seeing now that the target is over the ball; and the loose forwards are getting to the breakdown as quickly as possible, where their heads have to go low, and it exposes them to knocks on the back of the head.
World Rugby in the past couple of years has been trying to encourage the approach of an "aeroplane taking-off" style at the breakdown to minimise injuries.
That's great, but the loose forwards who have already arrived before the contest commences put themselves in a position where they can get harmed.
This is no one person's problem: It's just what we've created in the way the game is played; and for every change in the game there is a knock-on effect of consequences. – Scrum
