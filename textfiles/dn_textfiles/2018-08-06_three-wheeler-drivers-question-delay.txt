Implementing law on meters
Three-wheeler drivers question delay

Three-Wheel Drivers’ Union President Lalith Dharmasekara yesterday, questioned the delay in implementing the rule making taxi meters compulsory for three wheelers.
He blamed the government for the delay and said the delay has an ulterior motive of giving an undue business opportunities for taxi companies.
“The delay in implementing the law will help thrive taxi companies and three wheel drivers who earn a meager amount to make their ends meet will not benefit from it,” he said
Dharamasekera said the law is put off citing that three wheeler associations are against this move.
“The Three Wheelers Associations do not oppose this move. Three wheeler drivers and the travellers get benefits by the move,” he said.
Dharmasekera said his association stressed the importance of installing a meter to every three wheeler and a Sri Lankan company is now providing high quality meters
Dharmasekera asked whether some companies eying at introducing taxi meters to three wheelers have hand behind the delay.
He said it was his union that first introduced taxi meters on January 5, 2005. “We supported the endeavour. Those who opposed to taxi meters previously, still maintain the same stance citing various reasons. But these types of regulations are necessary to protect honour and dignity of the profession,” he said.
Dharmasekera said the law should be implemented in the Western Province initially, “It can be made compulsory in other provinces later, he said .
The National Council for Road Safety (NCRF) Spokesman said meters that can issue printed bills were made compulsory from August 1. Accordingly, all three-wheelers transporting passengers should have meters that issue printed bills. The gazette notification making taxi meters mandatory for all three-wheelers were issued in September 8, 2017. Since the law has been gazetted, the Police can take action against three-wheelers with no meters. We have given a grace period for the trishaw drivers since 2017 to fix taxi meters. Therefore, the law has to be strictly implemented by now,” he said.
The Three-wheeler Associations have endorsed the government decision to make it mandatory for three wheelers.
All Island Professional Drivers’ Association General Secretary K.R.C.J Kumara said the law has to be implemented to regulate the three-wheeler industry.
“We expect to eliminate various irregularities and shortcomings in the industry by implementing the regulations. It will help ensure a secure destination for commuters and eventually produce disciplined three-wheel drivers who would assure the safety of the commuter and the driver,” he said.
“It is the duty of the authorities to prepare necessary rules and regulations to safeguard the three-wheel industry and protect passengers. As a union, we are 100 per cent in favour of making taxi meters compulsory for all three-wheelers since it would pave the way to regulate the industry.
These regulations should be strictly implemented as many companies have come forward to produce and install the meters. However, the fines for the offence is not mentioned in the gazette. It should be done simultaneously with the gazette notification. Then, the Police will have the authority to enforce the law.
The National Council for Road Safety (NCRF) Spokesman said meters were made compulsory from August 1. All three-wheelers transporting passengers should have meters that can print bills.
The gazette notification making taxi meters mandatory for all three-wheelers was issued on September 8, 2017. Since the law has been gazetted, the Police can take action against three-wheelers that have no meters,” he said.
