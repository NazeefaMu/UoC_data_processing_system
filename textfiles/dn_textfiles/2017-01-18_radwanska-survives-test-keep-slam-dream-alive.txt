Radwanska survives : test to keep Slam dream alive

MELBOURNE: Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska survived a dogfight to move into the Australian Open second round on Tuesday as she bids to end her long wait for a maiden Grand Slam title.
The third seed battled past fellow veteran, Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova, 6-1, 4-6, 6-1 and will next play Croat Mirjana Lucic-Baroni, who beat Chinese qualifier Wang Qiang in three sets.
Radwanska, who lost in the final of the lead-up Sydney International, has consistently done well at Melbourne Park, making at least the quarter-finals in five of the previous six tournaments.
But she is yet to break through to win a title at any of the majors in 42 attempts spanning more than a decade.
“I have played her (Pironkova) many times and knew she was good,” said the 27-year-old.
“I’m very happy that I was able to come back strongly in the third set and pleased to be into the next round.” An Australian semi-finalist last year, she is desperate to end her long wait and started methodically against Pironkova, who made the quarter-finals of the French Open last year, beating Radwanska along the way. - AFP
