Doctor accused of attacking journalist, released on bail

A doctor attached to the Badulla General Hospital who had allegedly abused and assaulted provincial journalist Jayalath Dissanayake when he went to cover an accident involving the doctor's car was arrested by Badulla Police and released on police bail.
The incident had occurred near the Deiyannewela bridge in Badulla on May 23.
Police later summoned both parties including the doctor and the journalist to the police station on May 24 morning and brought about an amicable settlement after getting the doctor to tender a public apology to the journalist.
Dissanayake had been informed by residents in the area about the slippery condition of the road over the bridge which had been paved with earth saying a car had skidded at the spot. The car happened to belong to the doctor concerned. When Dissanayake went to report the accident and the poor condition of the road, the doctor is alleged to have abused and assaulted him. Dissanayake had complained to Badulla Police over the incident and police acting on it arrested the doctor after which they released him on bail and brought about the settlement.
