 JO boycotting SC meeting: MP Dinesh Gunawardena strongly refutes media reports
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday in Parliament, strongly refuted reports that the Joint Opposition had boycotted the Steering Committee meetings.
He said the JO had been attending the Steering Committee meetings right through as much as possible.
While making this clarification, the MP also called on the Chair to investigate as to who had provided the wrong information to the media.
He pointed out that the JO was represented by two members in the 21 member Steering Committee chaired by the Prime Minister. “There had been so many meetings where the two JO MPs had not been present. I attended it . Yesterday, I had to attend a public meeting of former President Mahinda Rajapaska,” he explained.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella also supporting the assertion of MP Gunawardena, said participation of the Steering Committee was highly satisfactory. “The JO has been participating regularly. This is the first time in the post-independence history that all political parties are involved in the Constitutional making. This is the first time that the Tamil parties are taking part actively. This is a golden opportunity and we should make use of it. Wrong reports set fire to the constitutional making process. They are trying to destroy the country,” he said.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala noted that the Prime Minister as the head of the Steering Committee could issue a statement to the media explaining the real situation.
The 99 year land lease: We must not let our country be subject to foreign pressure: Justice Minister
Justice Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday in Parliament, raised his concerns over the proposed 99 year lease of the Hambantota Port lands.
Speaking at the debate yesterday, the minister said the 99 year lease was a serious issue that should not be taken lightly. “We should have a consistent land policy in the country. Ninety nine years means three generations.
What would happen to our lands at the end of this period? We cannot wash our hands and steer clear of this move, while justifying it just because we are in the Government. I am not ready to be naïve like that.
This Parliament should discuss this issue at length.
Pointing fingers at either former President Mahinda Rajapaksa or President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is not going to help. The rights of our people could not be betrayed just because we want dollars. We have to safe guard their rights. These are lands our ancestors protected for over 2,500 years risking their lives.
We should not let our country subject to foreign pressure. Foreign countries are interested only about the economic benefits they receive,” he insisted.
Govt pays rental of Rs. 140m for ministry buildings on monthly basis:Media Minister
The Government pays nearly Rs 140 million on a monthly basis as rental for buildings where ministries are located, a document tabled in Parliament yesterday revealed.
Chief Government Whip and Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatillake responding to a question raised by JVP Parliamentarian Nalinda Jayathissa during the round on questions for oral answers, said government pays monthly rentals to 33 buildings where ministries are located.
Accordingly, a sum of Rs 24 million is paid for the Agriculture Ministry premises, while Rs 14 million is being paid for the premises where the Childcare and Women's Affairs Ministry is located, Rs 11 million for the premises of Special Empowerment Ministry to Rs 11.3 million is being paid for the Road Development Ministry premises.
It was also revealed that some ministries including the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Public Administration, National Policies and Economic Affairs and Foreign Employment Ministry have rented more than two office buildings.
JVP MP Jayathissa said the Agriculture Ministry is paying Rs 24 million to the premises where it is located, but it has been closed for 11 months. He said the government was wasting the money of the people and asked as to what measures would the government take on this matter.
Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluwihare said the same question had been included in the Order Paper and is scheduled to be answered in May and he would answer it then.
Refusal of Wimal’s bail application: Hidden agenda to support JO campaign by agitating people: Dilan Perera
The refusal of the bail application of NFF leader MP Wimal Weerawansa cannot be justified, State Minister Dilan Perera yesterday said.
Joining in the debate in Parliament yesterday, he said the Colombo High Court had no reason to refuse bail. He said the non-bailing of the MP could be linked to a hidden agenda to support the JO campaign by agitating people.
“Now the MP is said to have commenced a hunger strike. Court decisions cannot be changed by hunger strikes. The correct method was to appeal to the next Highest Court,” he added.
Govt has no reason to politically harass Weerawansa: Justice Minister
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday observed that it was humorous that members of a former government that imprisoned late Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi for six weeks alleging that he misused a vehicle which was out of order and garaged, worrying over Wimal Weerawansa being in remand custody.
He made this observation yesterday, in response to a question raised by UNP parliamentarian Arshu Marasinghe in Parliament, who questioned as to how the Justice Minister defined the allegation that Weerawansa was being remanded on political vengeance.
Minister Rajapakshe further said that MP Weerawansa was not arrested by the President, Prime Minister or the Law and Order Minister. He had been arrested by the Police. "The Police had been made independent by the setting up of the Police Commission by this government," Minister Rajapakshe said. "We can't influence the Police now like the previous government did."
He said that Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi was a politician who worked hard to set up the UPFA government. "Due to various reasons, he sat with the Opposition," Minister Rajapakshe said.
"He used a 16 years old jeep and it was in the garage when he left the ministerial portfolio. But he was imprisoned for six weeks alleging that he misused it. It was justice for the members who worry about Weerawansa's plight today."
He also said the previous government imprisoned 28 politicians including Sydney Jayaratne, Lal Rajapaksa, S A Subramanium and Srimal Perera for more than five months as political vengeance. He added that these members accepted it as justice then.
"For those that the foul was fair during the previous regime, the fair is foul today" Minister Rajapaksa said.
He also questioned as to why purpose the government should take political vengeance on Weerawansa? "Is he at least the Opposition leader?' questioned Minister Rajapakshe. "He should prove his innocence before Court without staging fasts. He should engage in protests without drinking orange juice."
TNA members always speak of separatism: Justice Minister
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday, charged that the TNA members were speaking always of separatism.
He made this observation yesterday in Parliament in response to statement made by TNA parliamentarian S Sritharan who said that there was an attempt of ethnic cleansing against his people.
The Justice Minister said that the LTTE killed Sinhala and Muslim people in mass scale.
"They were hacked to death with manna knives," Minister Rajapakshe said. "School buses with children were blasted, trains were blasted by the LTTE. 100,000 Sinhala and Muslim people were chased away from Jaffna during that period."
He also said TNA killed innocent Tamil People including Opposition leader Amirthalingam, Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgarmar and many others.
He said the TNA is speaking only of them.
"They always wanted separatism. During a war various crimes takes place," Minister Rajapakshe said. "Now we are in a position to forget them and face the future."
S Sritharan said the government was in a position not to allow a foreign inquiry into these incidents. He said it was wrong.
He also said the government could investigate into the incidents of bomb blasts, train blasts and hacking people to death and punish the culprits, but there should be a a foreign investigation into the crimes committed during the last phase of the war.
Asking for assets and liabilities of President, PM: An insult to country and its people at large
Justice Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday in Parliament severely attacked Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) over the latter’s request of information on assets and liabilities of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe under the Right to Information Act.
Joining in the debate yesterday, the minister said this move was an insult and ridicule to the two leaders who made immense sacrifices to bring in good governance to the country.
“The Media Minister on the midnight of February 3, gazetted the enforcement of the RTI Act.
Around 9 am the very next day, the first two RTI applications came from the TISL requesting for the assets and liabilities of the President and Prime Minister, under the presumption that they were thieves. Was this the respect they show toward these leaders? Certain NGO activists resort to such acts depending on the size of the dollar sack they receive.
What is the transparency of that NGO? Reveal the country how much of dollars they receive,” he added. He also criticized the media for overly criticizing the Good Governance Government.
“In the past, there was heavy media suppression, but the situation had remarkably improved.
However, the media wish to see the end of good governance and bring in the old system again.
If that day comes, let me warn you that nobody will be there in Parliament to speak on behalf of you when your fellows are assaulted and killed,” he said targeting the media.
