‘WHO recommendations on dengue control will be implemented’

The Health Ministry is to implement the recommendations in the WHO report to control the dengue outbreak. The report says many homes have hidden areas that breed dengue mosquitoes, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Minister was addressing a dengue control programme at Beruwala on Saturday.
Minister Senaratne said the report recommends to reduce number of dengue patients by 50 percent within four weeks. The WHO is willing to offer financial assistance in this regard. He said the Health Ministry could not control dengue by itself and everyone should participate in the battle.
It is same in other countries where dengue is present, he said.
The Minister thanked media institutions for coming forward and contributing immensely to the dengue control programme without focusing on profit making.
