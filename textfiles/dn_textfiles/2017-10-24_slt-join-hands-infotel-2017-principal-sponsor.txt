SLT join hands with Infotel-2017 as principal sponsor

Sri Lanka Telecom, Sri Lanka’s premier telecommunication solutions provider has joined with as a principal sponsor with Infotel 2017, in supporting the vision of transforming Sri Lanka towards a trillion-dollar economy through digitization by 2042.
With the 25th anniversary of Infotel also marked by this year’s Infotel, SLT has made plans to open up a number of initiatives that will garner interest and will become centerpieces of this year’s Infotel. Organized by the Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS), INFOTEL is South Asia's oldest and most prestigious Information and Communication Technology (ICT) exposition.
This year's event is scheduled to be held from November 1 to 5, 2017 at the BMICH in Colombo, under the theme “Towards a Digital Economy”.
Ajantha Seneviratne, Group Chief Marketing Officer SLT said, “SLT has always supported the Sri Lankan ICT industry through various initiatives and with Infotel we have continued to work together to uplift the ICT industry of Sri Lanka for over 13 years. And with the theme of this year, the sector based approach and the vision towards using digitization to transform Sri Lanka’s economy, we felt that this was a vision that we also shared and felt we must support.”
“Infotel has been the premiere ICT event in Sri Lanka for over 2 decades and this year will mark its 25th anniversary. It has allowed many Sri Lankan ICT companies an opportunity to showcase their many offerings and talent as well as enabled the general public to gain an insight to how the ICT industry is rapidly transforming the way we live. Especially with the school children and other students being one of the largest groups of attendees each year, we feel Infotel is fulfilling a role that could not be overlooked,” he said.
“In many ways, digitization is becoming the primary way in which our economy will advance. Thus, we think this year’s theme is an opportune one. Each of the sectors that have been allocated has immense potential to disrupt the way through digitization how traditionally these industries operated in the past. We at SLT too have recognized this and have taken many initiatives to support this growing requirement as well as use the opportunities that were on offer,” he said.
“First off SLT has built what we call NBN, or National Backbone Network which is the primary infrastructure on which all telecommunication networks and many key institutions operate. We have also taken steps to expand our infrastructure through fiber optic networks domestically connecting all the cities and major institutions both government and private.
Also, in anticipation of a strong demand for internet use we have increased our connectivity option to suit the demands of the next 25 years as well as attained access to newest SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system adding to multiple global connectivity options of SEA-MEWE 3, 4, Bharath-Lanka and SLT-Dhiraagu cable systems. National Backbone network is the platform in which Sri Lankan digital economy can rely on as even today many financial institutions use the network to communicate with their branches as well as each other,” he said.
