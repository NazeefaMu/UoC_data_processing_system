Parliamentary sittings end as JO members swarm well
Parliament sittings came to an abrupt end at 11.45 am yesterday, as chaos reigned in Parliament when Joint Opposition members swarmed the well of the House following a heated argument with government members with the announcement to take the vote on the resolution under the Essential Public Services Act on making fuel distribution an essential service.
The arguments flared up as Speaker Kari Jayasuriya called for a vote as a member was heard requesting for a division, although it was not clear as to who made the request. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya adjourned sittings until August 04 as the Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando took the Mace in his hands to protect it as the Joint Opposition members were standing around the it. However, the government side members said 'Aye' for passing of the resolution before Parliament sittings adjourned.
The debate on the resolution which commenced on Thursday and put off for yesterday, was taken up for vote following the presentation of the papers and oral answers. On this occasion, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentary Group Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake who was on his feet said the debate was adjourned the previous day as there were two government side members to make statements on the resolution.
"We wish for a clear statement from the government as to what the government would do in connection with the attack on the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation ( CPC) workers on Wednesday?" "Here are the pictures of the attackers. What do you do to the Welikada OIC who assaulted a Provincial Council Member? The Prime Minister or the Law and Order Minister should make a statement."
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardane said the government should respond to the questions raised by the Opposition. Thereafter, Joint Opposition members were seen coming towards the well and walking towards the Speaker's bench. Among the members were MP Bandula Gunawardena, Gamini Lokuge, Pavithra Wannaiarachchi, Padma Udayashantha Gunasekara, Sriyani Wijewickrama, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Tharaka Balasooriya, Prasanna Ranatunga, Rohitha Abeygunawardena, Dinesh Gunawardena, Vidura Wickramanayake, etc.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya later questioned whether Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake make a statement. The minister said that he would make a statement after the investigations were over. The Speaker then requested the members to calm down. "Please cooperate to continue proceedings," requested the Speaker. "You should not waste time and public funds. The division is asked for so the vote should be taken now."
The quorum bell was rung and during the bell was being rung, the arguments continued.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who joined cross talks at this stage, insisted that no statement could be made when a vote was called for. This would set a bad precedence. "We can't allow it."
"A division was requested from the Opposition side. So a vote has to be taken," Speaker Jayasuriya said. "Later we could have a debate on it after discussions at the Party Leaders' meeting. Now take the vote by name. Isn't the vote system working? we can't allow Parliament to be run like this."
Thereafter, the names of members were called to take the vote by name. While the names were being called out, Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando took the the Mace in his hands as Joint Opposition members thronged in front of the Speaker's chair.
Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms Kushan Jayaratne was near the Mace for its protection. Then sittings adjourned until August 04 on the motion of the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella.

Does Govt plan to sell it to a foreign company?: JVP
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament, demanded to know whether the Government had made plans to sell the Maha Illuppallama Seed Farm to a foreign company.
Raising a question under Standing Order 23 (2) in Parliament yesterday, the MP alleged that the Government has prepared a draft agreement to hand over local agricultural seed production to a Bangladesh private company named ‘Lal Teer.’
The MP said that Cabinet approval had been granted for this move.
“This deal not only vests the rights of local seed production to a foreign company, but also grants it the authority to import seeds and obtain patents for local seeds. This may pave the way for bio-piracy and a collapse in local seed production. The Government has not discussed this move with any stakeholder with regard to the move,” the MP charged.
The MP inquired from the Government the conditions that had been laid down by the Government for the foreign company to produce local seed paddy. The MP also urged the Government to table the draft agreement in this regard.
