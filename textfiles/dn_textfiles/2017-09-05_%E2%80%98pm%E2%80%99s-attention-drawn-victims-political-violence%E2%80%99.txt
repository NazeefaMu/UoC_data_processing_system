‘PM’s attention drawn to victims of political violence’

Prime Minister's attention has been drawn towards the payment of compensation to UNP supporters who underwent suffering and property damage due to political violence. UNP supporters in Ratnapura endured untold suffering and property damage, particularly during the time of the Nalanda Ellawala assassination and justice should be meted out to them, said Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala.
She was addressing the gathering at a reception accorded to her near the Ratnapura clock tower on September 2. It was organised by Parliamentarian A.A. Wijetuna and Ratnapura Municipal Council former Opposition Leader Lakshman Munasinghe.
Athukorale said that she never considered the new Ministry entrusted to her as an ornament, but as an opportunity to serve the people better. Today, the people of this country who wanted a change in 2015 had been afforded the opportunity to live in peace and freedom under an independent judiciary.
The Government had done a great amount of service during the last two years in office, but unfortunately, no one highlighted it. Investigations had been completed against wrongdoers of the previous regime and relevant reports and files had been forwarded to the Attorney General who will file indictment in Court against them. When action was taken against corrupt individuals in the former regime, the Joint Opposition was trying to interpret as political victimisation.
She said the Government had given an unprecedented amount of relief to victims of natural disasters during the last two years. Parliamentarians A. A. Wijetunga and several others also spoke.
