Depleted Sri Lanka look to make big closing statement

BRIDGETOWN, Friday - The lead up to the third and final Test has not been ideal for Sri Lanka, with Dinesh Chandimal suspended after he was caught on camera attempting to alter the condition of the ball during the second day’s play of the second Test, which ended in a draw in Gros Islet earlier this week.
Sri Lanka had already lost the services of Angelo Mathews and Lahiru Gamage, and with their captain first suspended and then choosing to appeal the sanction, the focus might have been a bit off over the past few days. But down 1-0 in the series, the visitors will have to put everything else behind them and put their best foot forward come Saturday at Kensington Oval.
After losing the opening Test in Port of Spain, Sri Lanka fought back well in Gros Islet. They got into a position from where they could pull level, but a dogged effort from Kraigg Brathwaite and spells of rain ensured the Windies came out with a draw.
Squaring the series will not be easy against an opposition that seems to be firing as a unit.
For the Windies, the batting hasn’t always worked as well as Jason Holder would have wanted, but the pacers have done a fabulous job so far.
Shannon Gabriel, who returned extraordinary figures of 13/121 in the previous Test and leads the wicket-takers’ chart with 17 strikes in the two games, has looked lethal with both the new and the old ball. He has been well backed up by Kemar Roach, Holder and Miguel Cummins. Being a day-night game, the Windies pacers might be even tougher to handle.
The top order has had starts all through the series, but barring the century by Shane Dowrich in the first innings of the opening Test, no one has been able to breach the three-figure mark yet. They will hope to rectify this going into the final game of the series.
For Sri Lanka, the batsmen will need to find a way to tackle the threat of Gabriel, who has been a revelation this series. The best of the visiting batsmen have been Kusal Mendis and Chandimal, but with Chandimal out, someone else has to put his hand up.
Mahela Udawatte had an unimpressive debut with scores of 0 and 19, while Dhananjaya de Silva has also struggled since rejoining the team. Roshen Silva and Niroshan Dickwella did find some form in the second innings of the second Test but it is the big runs that the visitors will want from them.
The bowlers have done a reasonable job so far. Suranga Lakmal and Lahiru Kumara have been on the money right from the word go while Kasun Rajitha in his maiden Test did an excellent job picking up five wickets at a decent economy rate.
Sri Lanka and the Windies have played a day-night Test before, both against Pakistan. That means they both have an inkling of how the pink ball behaves under lights and will hope to use the expertise.
The Kensington Oval surface has historically supported the fast bowlers, and being a day-night Test much of the same is expected. The threat of rain, however, remains ever present.
