Realization…

Putting my arms around his shoulders, I leaned and placed a silent kiss on his pale lips. Stepping down, I looked into his eyes: the very eyes which melt my soul and ablaze me are now immersed with serenity. His gaze is set at a faraway horizon, an expedition in quest of the reality of life.
Fate keeps on weaving the cobweb of life that we are tangled in. Unless broken by the ones who are trapped in, the circle continues. Met as strangers, destiny took us to a shore, a shore with no name. Though, struggled to name it, we knew it’s unyielding. Moments of flames, moments of sensitivity and moments of truth were passed.
I hugged him tight. I could hear his beating heart, going on and on. On his ear I whispered “do you still feel me?” looking away, he said “yes”.
