JA-Ela UC grapples with lasting issue

Thanks to the Ja-Ela Urban Council (UC), the people of Kanuwana, Ja-Ela from the St Joseph’s Church to the Minuwangoda Road had to drench and wade through this water logged road stretch.
The road stretch is even less than a quarter of a kilometer and the problem has been perennial stretching for nearly 100 years. During this time, the Ja-Ela UC have been spending millions of rupees to solve the problem but merely failed. Now, no attempt has been made to solve the problem.
Around six years ago the Council launched a major project in laying huge concrete pipes underground along the other side of the road and the water from the households on the other side of the road were connected to the underground concrete pipe. Though millions have been spent by the JUC, the water logging on the road still continues during rainy days.
It is really a misery to see the faithful to the church as well as the children attending the St Joseph’s School, Kanuwana wading through this eternal water log.
A private construction company has launched a massive pipe laying project around three months ago using giant heavy machinery, like backhoes, cranes and pile boring covering the entire stretch of the road and during the three months, the road was completely closed.
They also pumped thick mud water from the huge trenches on to the road. The project was temporarily stopped halfway as the faithful complained that the pipe laying would tremendously inconvenience them. This project would resume now.
