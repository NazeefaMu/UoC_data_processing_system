I am not afraid of being arrested or going to jail: BBS General Secretary

Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera said yesterday there is a plan to arrest him to fulfill the needs of Muslim extremist politicians.
He said he would start a protest before the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters if the Government used different laws  to suppress Sinhala Buddhist activists and support Muslim extremists.
Speaking to journalists after paying a courtesy call on Most Ven. Tibbotuware Sri Siddahartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at Malwathu Maha Viharaya, Kandy, Ven Gunanasara Thera said he is not afraid of being arrested or going to jail. But, we oppose the Government’s plan to obstruct our activities for protecting the rights of Buddhists by upholding the Muslim extremist vision of Rishard Bathiudeen and Azad Salley.
The authorities should arrest corrupt politicians allegedly involved in the destruction of artifacts, antiquities and archaeological sites, wildlife conservation and spreading racism, before they arrest me.
