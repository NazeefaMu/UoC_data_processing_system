Special Parliament sitting tomorrow

A Special Sitting of Parliament has been convened at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow to discuss the Bond report following the request of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Acting Secretary-General of Parliament Neil Iddawala issuing a press release yesterday said all Parliamentarians have been informed to attend the Special Sitting. Speaking to the Daily News, Iddawala added a Party Leaders Meeting chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has been scheduled for 2 p.m. today to discuss tomorrow’s agenda. He said it is most likely that the Prime Minister would make a statement at the commencement of Sittings. When inquired by the Daily News, Parliamentary sources said a copy of the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the Bond issue had not been received by Parliament until yesterday and whether it would be tabled on Wednesday would be known only after the Party Leaders’ Meeting.
The Prime Minister addressing the UNP Convention rally at Campbell Park on Sunday stated that he had formerly requested Speaker Jayasuriya to convene Parliament ahead of schedule to discuss the Commission report.
The first sitting of Parliament for 2018 was earlier scheduled for January 23.
