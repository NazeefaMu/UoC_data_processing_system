Radcliffe to star in thriller ‘Beasts of Burden’

Daniel Radcliffe has come on board to star as a drug smuggler in the action-thriller ‘Beasts of Burden,’ which will go on sale next month at the American Film Market.
Producers are Paul Schiff, Michael Diamond of MGMT Entertainment, and Chad Moore and Jeff Elliott of Green-Light International, which will handle foreign sales. Shooting will start in late November in Savannah, Ga.
Swedish filmmaker Jesper Ganslandt is directing from a script by Adam Hoelzel. The story focuses on a pilot who runs drugs across the border and must evade the DEA and drug cartels.
Radcliffe was most recently seen in ‘Swiss Army Man’ and ‘Now You See Me 2.’ His upcoming films include ‘Imperium,’ which was handled by Green-Light, with Radcliffe portraying an undercover cop who infiltrates a white supremacist gang.
