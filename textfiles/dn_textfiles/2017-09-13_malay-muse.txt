Malay muse

The revised and enlarged edition of “Persaudaraan – Malay Life in Sri Lanka” by Tuan Zameer Careem (Godage Publishers) was launched at the auditorium of the Sri Lanka College of Surgeons recently. Professor Maithree Wickremesinghe, Tissa Devendra, Prof Karunasena Dias Parnavitana, Venerable Professor Ittademaliya Indasara Nayaka Thera, Netharlands Ambassador Joanne Doorneward, Zahiere Careem and Sabrina Jayah delivered speeches at the occasion.
Tuan M Zameer Careem’s revised edition is certainly a labour of love and a work of meticuluous details, which is both historical and ethnographical. Specifically focusing on the different life aspects of the diasporic Malays in Sri Lanka, the book will undoubtedly provide many “windows” to the study of Malays in a comparative context. As an anthropologist researching into Malays in Peninsular Malaysia in the context of their changing cultural values and socio-economic transformation, one can be excited about the possibilities of Zameer Careem’s book in providing ‘comparative’ answers to some of the critical questions arising from this particular Malaysian discourse.
For instance, how could we utilize the Malay Sri Lankan ethnographic and historical data base to engage in the counter-narrations against ‘colonial knowledge’ or the colonial/post- colonial discourse on orientalising the Malays , as has been elegantly argued in S. Hussein Alatas’s The Myth of the Lazy Native’ (1977).
Are there concrete markers of high achievement orientations amongst Malay subjects in Sri Lanka as a result of their diasporic environment? How relevant is the nature of the debate pertaining to Malay ‘development’ and ‘underdevelopment’ in the Sri Lankan context? These above questions pertaining to the many facets of ‘being Malay’ remain critical research issues among scholars of contemporary Malay society in Malaysia.
