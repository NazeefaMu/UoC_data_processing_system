Dalugoda main culvert in need of urgent repair

The main culvert at Dalugoda, on the Thihagoda-Welletota via Malimbada main road, is on the brink of collapse. It has badly affected motorists as well as pedestrians, residents complained.
Residents said that several road accidents have already occurred there, as that point of route is broken and narrow. It is hardly possible for two vehicles to pass each other at that point. People urge Road Development Authorities to construct a new bridge here with strong side walls in place of the dilapidated culvert for the safety motorists and pedestrians.
According to residents, they use this highway to reach Kadduwa, Malimbada, Kanburupitiya, Akuressa and many other far off destinations in the Southern region.
In addition, it is used as a short route to the Godagama interchange of the Southern Expressway.
