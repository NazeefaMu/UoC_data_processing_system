And they learned nothing from history

Sri Lanka’s the first private medical college, North Colombo Medical College (NCMC), was started during the reigns of President JR Jayewardene pioneered by Dr. Dankande Muhandiramge Heennilame. Dr. Heennilame toying with the idea of establishing a private medical college since seventies pointed out the dire need of revamping medical education in Sri Lanka. He strongly believed that the trajectory of medical education should change with times and demands and foresaw the difficulty in doing so with the existing system.
Dr. G.M. Heennilame, a visionary and one of the founders of the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka, first proposed the establishment of a private medical college to the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka in 1975. However after considering, the social, political and economic environment prevailed at the time, the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka showed their reluctance to Dr. Heennilame’s suggestion to establish private medical college in the country.

After the political change in 1977, Dr. Heennilame once again presented his proposal to the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka who willingly agreed to consider it. They formed three-member committee including medical practitioners Dennis Aloysius and Walter Gooneratne to study the proposal and make recommendations to the professional body. According to their feasible study, three-member committee recommended a fee-levying non-profit oriented, undergraduate medical college. Later they developed their report further and made it into a fully-fledged a project proposal identifying Ragama as the location for the private medical college.
First non-profit private medical college
A detailed report was subsequently presented to President J. R Jayewardene who in turn agreed with the proposal to set up the North Colombo Medical College. On July 4 1980, the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka launched on their ambitious project by appointing a five member Board of Governors to run the North Colombo Medical College, that included well known medical auctioneers such as. G.M. Heennilame, Dennis Aloysius, Walter Gooneratne, Sathis Jayasinghe, and Shelton Cabraal. These highly qualified medical practitioners agreed to work without a salary to establish Sri Lanka’s first non-profit private medical college. On September 25, 1981, they inaugurated the North Colombo Medical College.
Founding a non-profit oriented private medical college was a visionary and revolutionary approach by the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka. During the early eighties even the East Asian countries like South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand were not so familiar with the private university system.
Sri Lanka had a significant potential to be a qualitative private education hub in the South Asia, but alas as a nation we missed that opportunity due to acrimonious politics and short-sighted self-centred politicians. This eventually put us behind times where the other countries in the region were far ahead of us in providing private education to cater to the needs of the Asian countries. Countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan have established solid private sector education options for Asia as a result. Besides other higher education streams, Pakistan has fifty-five private medical colleges, Bangladesh has forty-eight private medical colleges and Nepal has ten private medical colleges. A significant number of Sri Lankan students have received their education in these countries yearly to obtain medical degrees.
The district quota system introduced by successive governments had shut the doors every year for scores of brilliant students denying their right to enter a medical faculty of state run university. These students who were denied of medical education largely due to government policy readily embraced this opportunity, which was created by the North Colombo Medical College. Initially the North Colombo Medical College enrolled hundred students per year, they received more than thousand applications each year during 1981 to 1989. The North Colombo Medical College authorities introduced internationally recognized admission policy, which was not only focused on academic achievements. The admission criteria to North Colombo Medical College were based on: 70% for performance at GCE A Level, 10% for GCE O Level and distinctions, 10% for extra-curricular activities and 10% for the viva voce.
Free education system
However vocal and militant opposition against the North Colombo Medical College by Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), JVP led university student’s organisations and few academics with a leaning towards left wing politics created a monster, out of the NCMC which was in place to destroy free education system. Prof. Carlo Fonseka, Prof. Nalin de Silva and Dr. Rajitha Senaratne were vocal critiques of the NCMC and they were the main speakers at public rallies that were organised against NCMC.
After more than two decades they have changed their view point on private universities and now they openly support the establishing of private universities including medical colleges. Prof. Carlo Fonseka recently stated that NCMC was a solid example to prove that private sector also can produce high quality medical practitioners (http://www.lankaenews.com/news/5304). Writing an opinion piece in The Island November 11, 2006, Prof. Carlo Fonseka put his weight behind the International Medical and Technological University to launch pre-clinical course at Piliyandala.
He pointed out that Sri Lanka needs more doctors: “the number of doctors per 100,000 of the population in Sri Lanka is one of the lowest in the countries of the world and even in the region. To make matters worse many doctors, most if not all of them members of the GMOA, who are sent abroad at huge state expense for postgraduate training do not return to serve their motherland. So we must somehow increase the number of doctors produced in our country. The State is doing all it can to increase the output of doctors. This year two new medical faculties were created, one at Eastern University and the other at Rajarata University. But the State cannot satisfy the demand for medical education in the country. For many years in the recent past, over 200 students of very rich parents have gone abroad each year to qualify as doctors. They return and after passing the Act 16 Examination and undergoing internship training, become entitled to practise medicine in Sri Lanka.
In the process of going abroad for medical studies they have drained a vast amount of foreign exchange from the country. If a part of the medical course can be taught in Sri Lanka, parents will save a lot of money and the country will save a lot of foreign exchange as a result. By reducing the cost of medical education, such a procedure will enable children of not-so-rich parents also to qualify as doctors. The net effect would be an increase in the number of doctors in the country. The pre-clinical campus of the IMTU at Piliyandala was in my judgement such a project. At present it is only a bunch of medical students misguided by some of their big brothers in the GMOA who seem to be determined to disrupt the enterprise by shouting silly slogans about the “pohosathunge moda lamai sandaha vaidya upadhi kadaya” — degree shop for foolish children of rich people”.
Prof. Fonseka not only supported the private medical school but also vehemently criticized the Sri Lanka Medical Council’s (SLMC) and GMOA’s destructive role against private medical colleges: “the SLMC has also violated a fundamental right of many other citizens of the country who are due to sit the Act 16 Examination. This is a manifestation of the arrogance of power the SLMC possesses from time to time. It derives its power from the GMOA’s capacity to engineer strikes by its members and thereby jeopardise the lives of the poorest people of this country when they are stricken by serious illness. In the face of this murderous power of the GMOA, governments considerate about the lives of the poorest citizens in the country pathetically succumb to the demands of the GMOA whether they are reasonable or unreasonable”.
Prof. Stanley Kalpage, a former Chairman of the University Grants Commission and Secretary of the Ministry of Higher Education, was the guest speaker at the last Convocation of the NCMC in 1994.
During his speech, Prof. Kalpage disclosed what the real reasons were for targeting NCMC. He stated that “the GMOA took up cudgels against the College thinking that state medical faculty graduates would be pushed out of employment in government hospitals. The daughter of a high office bearer of the GMOA had applied with qualifications suitable for her admission and had been admitted. When the same person’s son, whose qualifications were not adequate, was refused admission, he became an inveterate enemy of the NCMC. A number of general practitioners were disappointed when their children failed to gain admission. It was not possible to satisfy everyone”.
Furthermore Prof. Kalpage described JVP violent attack on NCMC: “The JVP which was raising its head and holding the country to ransom in the mid-eighties got into the act. Their aim was to disrupt the work in all universities, cause embarrassment to the government and bring the government down. Dr. Heennilame himself received a death threat over the telephone in Sinhala. “If the money taken from the students of the NCMC is not returned your life is in danger,” said the anonymous caller. Dr. Heennilame went abroad to England. Dr. Sathis Jayasinghe too received a telephone call which he reported to President Jayewardene. Dr. Jayasinghe left for Pakistan. In 1988, the JVP bombed the administration section of the NCMC”.
President R. Premadasa took popular political decision to take over the NCMC. He had sent Army battalion to surround NCMC buildings. Prof. Stanley Kalpage severely criticized Premadasa government’s decision to take over NCMC at the last convocation of the NCMC: “The UNP government of 1989 must take full responsibility for the manner in which they capitulated in the face of a challenge that had only to be faced and overcome. Those directly responsible for depriving the private sector of continuing to manage the North Colombo Medical College which they had established caused, in my view, a disservice to our country”.
We can hear same allegations that rose against the NCMC are once again being raised against South Asian Institute of Technology & Medicine (SAITM). GMOA, Inter University Students’ Federation and JVP led extreme political groups repeat the same slogans and allegations after more than two decades. It seems like they didn’t learn anything from history.
They destroyed Sri Lanka’s first non-profit oriented private medical college, which maintained significant academic quality. These extremist forcers thriving on social discord try to repeat the mistake time and again. Once, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said: “Those who fail to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.”
