What is NCMC?
This refers to the letter ‘The difference between NCMC and SAITM’ by Prof C Deepal Mathew on April 12. I respond as the only living Clinical Professor of the NCMC that existed from 1981 to 1995. I was a professor of OBGyn from 1985 - 1995 during which time we passed out over 800 graduates, most of whom I am proud to say are leading consultants, lecturers and professors in this country and many other countries abroad. This was mentioned by none other than Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament a few months ago. Even Prof Carlo Fonseka, whom I taught in the final year 1961, when I was at DSHW, who was deadly opposed to the NCMC in 1986, has changed his mind after seeing our products and I have openly talked about it.
Ragama Hospital was not very popular at that time till the college of general practitioners put up that beautiful three-storied prof units and we occupied it for the first time and it became a very popular hospital. It was run at that time as a Public Private Partnership as the NCMC gave the hospital to the Government, and the hospital was managed by a Government Director and all our nursing staff, medical staff were from the government. The Pre Clinical and Para Clinical Department that were put up by the NCMC and the beautiful library was all managed by Dr W D Ratnavale who was Director and his staff of the NCMC.
They were all paid by the NCMC. The Board of Governors, most of whom are dead charged only Rs 350,000 from the students for the whole course at that time. Even at that time the criteria for the admission was two Cs and one S at the A/L.
Prof Daphne Attiygalla, who was the Dean at the time was very helpful at the start and there were no objections from the Colombo Medical Faculty at that time till some of the Buffoons of the Board of Directors of the NCMC were demanding a Colombo Degree for the NCMC Graduates. This started the ball rolling and the lecturers and the students of the Colombo faculty got agitated and thus in 1986 JVP insurrection started with the attack on the NCMC which ended up in three year closure of the Universities at that time and finally ended up when President Premadasa decided to Nationalize and make it the faculty of Medicine Ragama. The first batch of the NCMC that entered in 1981 passed out only in 1990 - a world record.
Regarding the KDU, which is also more or less a Private Medical College, the SLMC approved it for fear of the then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in 2012, when even up to now the Clinical Professors give only lectures and have no wards as the hospital still not been opened.
I don't see how SLMC can approve of this set up, as students are not having proper clinical training of six months in each specialty. Obviously the SLMC has double standards.
