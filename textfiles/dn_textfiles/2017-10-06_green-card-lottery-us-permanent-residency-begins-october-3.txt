Green Card lottery for US permanent residency begins on October 3

The US Embassy in Colombo on Wednesday announced the start of the 2019 Diversity Visa Lottery Program, also known as the “Green Card” Lottery.
The program will be open for online registration from October 3, 2017 to November 7, 2017.
The Diversity Visa Lottery allows randomly selected applicants the opportunity to interview for an immigrant visa and become legal permanent residents of the United States.
The program is the “2019” lottery because applicants enter in 2017, interview in 2018, and—if selected and approved—receive Green Cards in 2019, the US embassy said in a statement.
A few items to keep in mind:
The lottery is open to those born in qualifying countries – both Sri Lanka and Maldives, applicants may only apply once and multiple entries will result in disqualification. Also applicants must meet all qualifications for the Diversity Visa Lottery, the US embassy added.
The US embassy cautioned applicants, as there is no cost to register for the Diversity Visa Lottery, beware of scams, of persons or companies making claims of affiliation with the U.S. Government, and of those who promise improved odds of selection.
No third party assistance is needed to complete and submit an application, the statement added.
U.S. Embassy Colombo’s website at https://lk.usembassy.gov/visas/immigrant-visas/diversity-visa/ carries more information about the program, including qualification requirements and detailed instructions on how to apply in Sinhala, Tamil, and English. The only way to apply is online at www.dvlottery.state.gov.
The US embassy noted that beginning in early May 2018, applicants may go online to the Entrant Status Check page on www.dvlottery.state.gov to see if they have been selected for the Diversity Visa program.
