Sophisticated  and sensuous

The Kingsbury hosted its celebrated High Tea fashion show in July. This month’s featured designer was Anouki Cooke, founder of the label Anouki. Her portfolio showcased a trendy lineup of evening wear which has been lovingly crafted from fabrics such as silk and lace. Each dress was handmade with intricate detailing to bring out a woman’s confidence, sophistication and sensuality.
