Pakistan to assist in addressing fertiliser shortage

Secretary to the President Austin Fernando said the Pakistan Government assured the immediate dispatch of 41,000 metric tons of urea fertilizer to Sri Lanka to address the shortage in the local market. He said he met the Pakistan High Commissioner to Sri Lanka on Thursday to discuss the arrangements in that regard and the Agricultural Ministry Secretary and Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary were updated on the discussions.
“Pakistan promised 75,000 metric tons of urea fertilizer upon the special request made by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Pakistan has relaxed its fertilizer export regulations to facilitate the move.
41,000 metric tons of fertilizer will be imported immediately and the balance 34,000 metric tons will arrive by the end of February,” he said.
