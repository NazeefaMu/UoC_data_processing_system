Argument erupts between MP and DS

A heated argument erupted between UNP Parliamentarian Bandulal Bandarigoda and Baddegama Divisional Secretary Himali Ratnaweera over an issue concerning the distribution of dry-rations among flood victims in the Nagoda Zone.
When MP Bandarigoda requested 200 dry-rations over the phone, the Divisional Secretary said she could provide only 65 dry-rations. Meanwhile, a tense situation erupted when UNP Parliamentarian Bandarigoda arrived at the Baddegama Divisional Secretariat in the evening and requested the Divisional Secretary 200 dry-rations. This brought about an exchange of words between the MP and the Divisional Secretary.
