PPP distributes over 3 mn biodegrable bags

Over three million compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets and bags have been distributed to super centres and local markets by Sri Lanka’s pioneer food wrapping sheets and bags manufacturer, the Plastic Pakaging Pte Ltd (PPP), during the last three weeks.
This was highlighted by PPP Chairman Dr Mervyn Dias at a meeting held at the company premises in Ratmalana, to create the awareness of media about the company’s participation at `Sri Lanka NEXT - A Blue Green Era’ conference and Exhibition held at BMICH under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Dr Dias said his company would reach the five million production target during the next few weeks.
He said during the President’s visit to his stall at the BMICH, the President had a close look at the compostable and biodegradable bags that get composted within 180 days.
It is said that polythene takes over 500 years to degrade, causing heavy damage to living beings and also to fauna and flora.
The 30-year-old 100 per cent Sri Lankan owned Plastic Pakaging Ltd. has been manufacturing bags and food wrapping papers for the UK market and the company commenced manufacturing compostable and biodegradable bags in 2006.
Dr Dias said the company supplied compostable and biodegradable bags even to the Sri Lankan market before the ban was announced.
“Now we have focused full attention towards the local market,” he said.
He said the company markets the products under the trade name `Natureplus’, certified by Vincotte, Belgium and they have also certificates such as OK Compost.
He said these compostable wrapping sheets and bags are manufactured according to this UK approved EN 13432 stand.
Dr Dias said that no exports could be done to any EU country without this certification.
The OK Ccompost certification guarantees composting in an industrial composting and the OK Compost HOME guarantees the green light to use the certified bags in a home compost bin to compost.
He also said the company manufactures 10 micron compostable bags and it can even be reduced to 8 microns. Although the thickness was reduced, the strength of these bags are maintained to the maximum.
Dr Dias further says the company is now able to supply compostable food sheets and bags to super markets, shops and also to customers.
