Over 13,000 dual citizenship applications received

The Department of Immigration and Emigration (DIE) has already received about 13,300 dual citizenship applications since it was reintroduced by the present government, DIE Citizenship Division Deputy Controller Chamika Gamage told the Daily News.
With the Amendment of Act No. 45 of 1987, the granting of Dual Citizenship provisions which had been suspended by the previous regime since September 2011 was reintroduced. The provision of dual citizenship was restored on March 28, 2015.
"Normally, we provide dual citizenship for the applicants of nine countries,namely, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, France, Sweden, Switzerland and Italy. But, rarely do we receive applications from citizens of other European countries and if only those countries certified that they will not cancel their citizenship and have no objection, we would be prepared to grant dual citizenship for them as well. But, not for the citizens of SAARC or Middle East countries," he said. He also said of the 13,300 applications for dual citizenship, only 5,000 applications have been taken in to the consideration and dual citizenship granted to around 700-800 applicants.
A person whose citizenship of Sri Lanka has ceased under Sections 19, 20 and 21 of Citizenship Act No. 18 of 1948 or a person whose citizenship in Sri Lanka is likely to cease, can apply for dual citizenship.
The status will be issued under two categories as resumption and retention. The Section 19 (2) of the Act makes provisions in respect of a person whose citizenship of Sri Lanka has ceased due to obtaining of citizenship in another country and who there after desires to resume the status of a citizen of Sri Lanla and Section 19 (3) of the Act makes provisions in respect of a person who is having a desire to obtain citizenship in another country, while intends to retain the citizenship of Sri Lanka.
