Kandy hockey to get back to its former glory

A herculean effort is being made to get back to the former glory days. They hope to commence with a seven a side tournament followed by the league and knockouts.
Cue sport pots off the table
Billiards and snooker have taken a nosedive with hardly any activity. It was a sport which was once dominated by Kandy clubs. Only Mahanuwara YMBA keeps the sport going, other clubs like Kandy Club, Kandy Garden Club, and Kandy YMMA have forgotten to switch the table lights and today the cue room has become a store room.
Lawn tennis needs a fillip
At one-time lawn tennis was a very popular sport in Kandy. It was Kandy Lawn Cub, Kandy Garden Club, University of Peradeniya and Kandy Police who took to the sport during DIG Bodi Liyanage's time. Schools like Trinity, Girls High School and Hillwood were involved in a big way. A big hand should go to former Municipal Commissioner and All Ceylon cricketer the late D.H. de Silva who was a live wire and produced some top players using the Garden Club courts. But sad to say today this sport has more or less lost its identity without any back up, nor any attempt to revive it.
Asgiriya 102 years
The Trinity College ground at Asgiriya, which was an International stadium, is 102 years old this year. This sheer cliff face was gradually transformed into one of the loveliest cricket grounds. When the wicket was first laid in 1915 there was only one clay strip which was thereafter gradually extended over the years. The first ever cricket game at this ground was between Trinity and S.Thomas’ and the old pavilion still stands. The first centurion at Asgiriya was Antonian Jack Anderson. After Test status was granted for Sri Lanka in 1982, late Gamini Dissanayake who was the president of BCCL upgraded the ground to International status. All Test playing countries have played at this grounds until the new Test venue came up at Pallekelle.
