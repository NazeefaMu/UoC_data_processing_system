Six fishermen in distress off Myanmar rescued

A group of six fishermen in a multi-day boat who fell into distress after being caught in a storm, causing their boat to drift towards Myanmar, were rescued by the Sri Lanka Navy on August 25.
They were brought back to the Trincomalee Harbour, along with their boat.
The boat, Jaya Isuru 03, which left the Nilwella fisheries harbour on July 19, was engaged in fishing in the deep sea, when it developed engine trouble on August 14. The boat which was dragged towards the Myanmar coast by a current during a storm, had been spotted by a group of Negombo fishermen and was towed by their boat Brian 03, for five days, and later handed over to the Sri Lankan Navy ship Samudra, which brought the fishermen and their boat to Trincomalee, after searching for them for five days.
The owner of the ill-fated boat, Yaddenige Shantha Eardley said on August 14 the skipper of the boat sent him a radio message about the problem they had encountered and that their boat was being towed by Brian 03, which came to their assistance.
Eardley said that he immediately contacted the Fisheries Ministry about it and State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi in turn informed the Navy Commander and the President about the matter. He said he was thankful to the State Minister, the Navy and the Fisheries Ministry and its operations room for rescuing the fishermen and their boat.
The six fishermen who were rescued are Madhawa Manthinda Wijeweera of Hungama, Ruwan Kumara of Dickwella, P.A. Premasiri of Ambalantota, Gamage Pradeep Harshana of Medawatta, A.B.R. Chanuka Wimalasuriya of Matara and Sanath Kumara Weerasooriya of Ranna.
