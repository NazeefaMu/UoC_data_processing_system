Kidney-kind remedies

Sri Lanka’s rural environment is no longer peaceful as college textbook fairytales used to suggest. A stranger has knocked at the impoverished farmer’s door with one more burden: Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology or CKDu. Dr Rathnasiri A Hewage (MBBS, MSc (Med Admin) MACPE (USA) MCMA (SL), MD (Med Admin) DIPPCA. PH210x (Harvard), Dip in IT Management (Alison), MAPCR (USA), Dip in EU Public Procurement (Belgium) who is a Consultant in Medical Administration and CEO / Director of the National Institute For Nephrology Dialysis & Transplantation, Colombo, gets in touch with Health Watch to explore possible rescue from the disease of unknown etiology.
Q: What is the genesis of CKDu?
A: The real timeline of the disease is unknown since most of the affected countries lack renal disease registries. The affected regions are mainly farmlands drowned in poverty. Nicaraguan health authorities, for instance, issue statements that they have been noting an increase of CKD cases in the Pacific Ocean coastal regions since the 1980s. But it was not until 2002 that a scientific paper from an El Salvadoran hospital first communicated and described the existence of an important group of CKDu patients with a particular epidemiological pattern.
Since the origin of the disease is still unidentified, or rather unknown, it is difficult to say the patients at the risk of developing CKDU and prevention methods.
Q: What are the identified symptoms of CKDu?
The early symptoms can be listed as follows:
1. Loss of appetite.
2. General ill feeling and fatigue.
3. Headache.
4. Itching (pruritus) and dry skin.
5. Nausea.
6. Natural loss of weight without any attempt.
We have also identified late symptoms such
as the following:
1. Abnormally dark or light skin.
2. Bone pain.
3. Drowsiness.
4. Concentration or thinking concerns.
5. Numbness or swelling in the hands and feet.
6. Muscle twitching or cramps.
7. Breath odour.
8. Easy bruising, or blood in the stool.
9. Excessive thirst.
10. Frequent hiccups.
11. Problems with sexual function.
12. Menstrual periods stop (amenorrhea).
13. Shortness of breath.
14. Sleep problems.
15. Vomiting
Q: What is the possible remedy when you observe a portion of these symptoms in a patient?
A: Such a patient should immediately see a doctor. The doctor will use a screening tool that is a package consisting of a combination of tests, testing for Serum Creatinine with calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), measuring urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) on an early morning urine sample and measuring blood pressure.
Q: What is your advice to stay out of danger?
A: Lifestyle change is the best policy. Adhere
to the following lifestyle changes:
1. Do not smoke.
2. Eat meals low in fat and cholesterol.
3. Get regular exercise. Talk to your doctor or nurse before starting to exercise.
4. Take drugs to lower your cholesterol, if needed.
5. Keep your blood sugar under control.
6. Avoid eating too much salt or potassium.
