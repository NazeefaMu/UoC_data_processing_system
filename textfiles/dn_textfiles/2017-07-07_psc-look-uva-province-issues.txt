PSC to look into Uva Province issues

A Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) is to be appointed to look into the entire gamut of issues faced by the people in the Uva Province as a result of the Uma Oya multi-purpose development project.
According to Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, the President and the Prime Minister have come to an agreement to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee to look into the project in depth.
“It has been revealed that the substandard equipment used for the Uma Oya project is the main cause for the severe environment impact,” Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, a team of experts, who visited the project site,revealed that most of the equipment, including the dredging machines are obsolete and this situation has caused a negative impact on the environment.
Minister Samarasinghe said a select committee can summon any person involved in this project by using the parliamentary prviledges and powers.
“It is regrettable that certain elements are trying to gain political mileage by creating a fear phychosis among the affected people,”he said
The Minister requested those elements not to gain political mileage by holding the innocent people to ransom.
