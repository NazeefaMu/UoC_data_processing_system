Scarlett Johnsson calls Ivanka Trump 'cowardly' following 'complicit' interview

 
Scarlett Johansson’s appearance on Saturday Night Live ruffled a few feathers when she donned a blonde wig to portray Ivanka Trump.
Asked her reaction to the skit, itself a faux advert for the perfume ‘Complicit,’ Trump insisted she’s activity involved with trying to guide the current Presidential administration. 
Speaking at Tina Brown's Women in the World Summit, Johansson continued the conversation, calling Trump “cowardly” while commenting on the First Daughter’s recent interview. 
“[Ivanka] said… she felt that the greatest change… actually would be behind closed doors, and nobody would actually know that she had made this change,” Johansson told the audience, according to The Cut. 
“And I thought, well that’s empowering! How old-fashioned, this idea that behind a great man is a great woman. What about being in front of that person or next to them? It is such an old-fashioned concept that to be this powerful woman you can’t appear to be concerned, that someone is going to think that you are bitchy, or a powerful woman. They get concerned with this idea that they are going to be seen in this unforgiving light and screw that. It is so old fashioned and it is so uninspired and actually really cowardly.”
