Solar power plant to be set up in Sampur

A 50 MW solar power plant will come up in Sampur as a joint venture, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
Changing the initial plan to construct a coal power plant, the government decided to set up an LNG plant in Sampur, but the plans have been changed again to make it a solar power plant.
Addressing a press conference at his ministry, Siyambalapitiya said the proposal to set up a solar power plant in Sampur was discussed at the last Cabinet meeting. “It is now confirmed that there will not be an LNG plant in Sampur, but a solar power plant,” he said.
