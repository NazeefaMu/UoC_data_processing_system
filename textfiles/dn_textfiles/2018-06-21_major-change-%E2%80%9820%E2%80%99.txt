Major  change  in ‘2.0’

RJinikanth’s 2.0 seems to be stuck in a huge post-production problem, and with every passing day, the future of the film is turning out to be a big question mark.
The film, which was initially planned to hit the screens in May 2018, was first postponed to August 2018. Now, according to a report, the release date of the film is likely to be shifted to 2019.
This is because of many changes in CGI of the film, says the report. With many pending post-production work, it is not clear when the film will see the light of the day. It is said that some of the CGI outputs were not satisfactory and the makers are re-working certain portions of the film.
The film was supposed to hit the screens before ‘Kaala’.
Directed by Shankar, 2.0 has Amy Jackson and Akshay Kumar in the lead roles. Academy Award winner AR Rahman has composed the songs for the film.
2.0 is a sequel to Rajinikanth-Shankar’s ‘Enthiran’, which is about an AI robot called Chitti.
