A non-profit, non-political organisation focused on expanding bilateral trade links between Sri Lanka and the UK, the CBB pursues mutually beneficial business relationships for Sri Lanka and the UK. Organising regular events, CBB helps the business communities from these two countries to come together. The project was designed and is being managed by the British Council with HSBC as the Principal Sponsor. HSBC has been working with the British Council on this project for close to 10 years and has partnered on many other different projects in the sphere of English and Higher Education.

The CBB-British Council Teacher Training programme started in 2006. The overall goal of the programme is to upgrade the English skills of pupils and this is achieved through improving the quality of the teaching practice in their schools. The project has trained a total of 56 mentors from the Ministry of Education’s RESCs ensuring the project’s wide geographical coverage across Sri Lanka.
The mentors deliver in-service teacher training to teachers in their areas using a distance learning course, which leads to the internationally recognised University of Cambridge Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT).
Keith Davies, Former Country Director for the British Council, said: “The British Council strives to reach millions of teachers and learners of English and to provide them with access to the best resources and latest approaches to English language teaching and learning from the UK. This project is one example of our work in English. We have trained over 2,100 English language teachers in Sri Lanka through the CBB Project English programme with the support of the Ministry of Education.”
Mark Prothero, CEO, HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives commented, “Adequate knowledge of English is a compelling necessity to access the many opportunities available in today’s society. The teachers trained under this programme use their newly acquired skills and knowledge to create a positive impact in the classroom by building confidence and a positive attitude in students. The overall impact of the programme on these children, therefore, is more holistic increasing their chances of educational and employment opportunities.”
Speaking at the event, the Minister of Education, Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said: “I am pleased that the Ministry of Education has been working with the CBB and the British Council on this project from its inception to present day. It is an example of a successful partnership collaborating to increase the educational potential of the country’s youth. The Ministry is keen to support such partnerships.”
The TKT examination comprises of three modules which focus on the core knowledge and skills needed by teachers of the English language.
