KIA’s redeveloped runway will take A-380s

The redeveloped runway of the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport will facilitate the world’s largest planes such as the A-380 as its width is increased from 60 to 75 metres, said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
He was on an inspection tour of the ongoing development work of the airport yesterday. He said the runway is being rehabilitated after a lapse of 30 years as the Good Governance Government had given priority towards the improvement work.
If neglected, the Airport would have even been blacklisted by International Aviation Authorities.
The Minister who recalled that they even had to face brickbats when development was begun on January 6 said the government closed the airport for only 8 hours during the day without resorting to a total closure.
He said 75 percent of the development work was now complete and the Airport was expected to be in full operation by April 6 this year.
He said thereafter work would be started on the second terminal building by July and Tenders had already been called to hand over construction work to a successful bidder.
