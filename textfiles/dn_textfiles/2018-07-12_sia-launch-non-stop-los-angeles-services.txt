SIA TO LAUNCH NON-STOP LOS ANGELES SERVICES

Singapore Airlines (SIA) will launch non-stop flights between Singapore and Los Angeles using the new Airbus A350-900ULR (ultra-long-range) aircraftin November.
In addition, SIA will stepup existing daily non-stop Singapore-San Francisco services to 10 times per week. Together with the earlier announced non-stop Singapore-New York services, SIA will link Singapore and the US with 27 weekly non-stop flights by the end of 2018.
The route will initially be served three times per week, departing Singapore on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.
With the introduction of non-stop services between Singapore and Los Angeles, SIA’s existing one-stop service to Los Angeles via Seoul will cease after 30 November 2018. Singapore-Seoul frequency will be maintained at four flights per day with the introduction of a new Singapore-Seoul return flight from 1 December 2018.
SIA will also be increasing frequency on the existing Singapore-San Francisco route with three more weeklyflights, with effect from 28 November 2018.
“Our US services have always been popular with our customers and we are pleased to be able to provide even more travel options with the launch of non-stop flights between Singapore and Los Angeles,and an increase in frequency on the existing non-stop Singapore-San Francisco route,” said Singapore Airlines CEO, Goh Choon Phong.
“Together with our non-stop flights between Singapore and New York that will launch in October, SIA will redefine the convenience of travelling between Singapore and the United States, delivering on our promise to constantly enhance the travel experience of our customers.”
