Veiled violence

Jagath Weerasinghe spoke out on his work ‘Temporalities of Violence’ and the location of Anuradhapura within the conceptual and curatorial framing of the exhibition ‘A Tale of Two Cities’. The conversation was held at Theertha Red Dot Gallery, Borella recently.
‘A Tale of Two Cities’ is a one-year long project that was conceptualised as a discursive, research-based art-making context that engaged eleven artists from India and Sri Lanka to respond to two sacred sites – Anuradhapura and Varanasi. The exhibition was both a reflection and record of a creative process that involved crossing borders and boundaries, questioning practice and approach and shape-shifting in order to absorb the journey through the living sacred.
