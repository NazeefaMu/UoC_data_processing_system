‘Seized illicit timber at Customs for three years without investigation’

The Sri Lanka Customs was yesterday ordered by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to carry out an investigation into a load of timber lying in the Customs custody for nearly three years without an investigation.
Minister Karunanayake said the Customs had not investigated the matter and failed to prosecute the offenders.
Under whose authority, they remained dormant? the minister asked.
The Customs reportedly had seized the illicit timber load in 2014.
Minister Karunanayaka charged the Customs of depriving the government of revenues from fines from the offenders in the case .
If any officer of the Customs is found acted in violation of law, steps will be taken against them, he said.
“I have directed Customs Director General Chulananda Perera to submit a report on this,” he said.
“I do not know whether some Customs officers are on a role to invent topics to please those who call themselves Joint Opposition,” he said.
