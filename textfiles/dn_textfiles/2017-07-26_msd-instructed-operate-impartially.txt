MSD instructed to operate impartially

The Health Ministry Secretary has instructed the Medial Supplies Division (MSD) to operate impartially when making payments for its suppliers and not to prioritize some suppliers over the others.
The instructions have been sent after it was revealed that a letter instructing to pay the due money for a certain company were reportedly issued by the Health Ministry administration.
The MSD has not paid Rs. 30,000 million due for several suppliers but has favoured a different company when making payments.
“The order was given by the Secretary on July 21. Rs. 10 billion should be paid by the Ministry to supplying companies and medical suppliers," sources said.
MSD Director Lal Panapitiya has said they would comply with the letter of instruction sent by the Secretary.
The investigation are continuing under the Committee of Public Enterprises (COPE).
