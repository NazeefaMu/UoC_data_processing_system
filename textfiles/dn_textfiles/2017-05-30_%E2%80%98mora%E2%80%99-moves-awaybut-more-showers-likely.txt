‘Mora’ moves away,but more showers likely

The depression in the East Central Bay of Bengal has intensified into a cyclonic storm ‘Mora’.
It is moving further away from Sri Lanka, the Meteorology Department said.
The Duty Officer said the effects of ‘Mora’ cyclonic storm will subdue only after June 2. Under the cyclonic storm influence cloudy skies, windy and showery conditions are expected over the country, the Meteorology Department weather forecasts said.
It is sad the cyclonic storm is moving towards Bangladesh and it will lash Myanmar, and perhaps Eastern India with flooding, rain and strong winds as well.
The Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, North-western and Central provinces will receive showers or thundershowers and heavy falls above 100 mm can be expected at some places particularly in the Western slope of the central hills. The cyclonic storm ‘Mora’ is now moving towards Bangladesh and it will lash Myanmar, and perhaps Eastern India with flooding, rain and strong winds as well.
