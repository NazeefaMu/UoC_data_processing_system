Give a home to an adult dog or cat

Every day the AWPA receives calls to admit adult animals to their shelters. Some people feel their pet will be happiest in a shelter and of courseit is also the easiest way out of their problem. They don't try to find it another home by advertising or some other social media. Dogs and cats brought up in a home will never be happy in a shelter. They will only be secure and receive food. They will just be one of the other dogs/cats at the shelter.
They won't be showered with love and attention they received before. We find it very sad when it is an old and aged animal that has lived in a home and received a lot of love and care. The reasons are many - some trivial (daughter-in-law doesn't like dogs) but some are genuine - moving to an apartment or due to old age and ill-health themselves, they are unable to care for their pet.
The AWPA is looking for foster homes for many adult dogs and cats. You may be unable to take a puppy and make a 15 year commitment but you may be someone who could take in an adult dog/cat with a shorter life span. Please call Iromi on 077 6565181 if you can provide a home and be blessed.
