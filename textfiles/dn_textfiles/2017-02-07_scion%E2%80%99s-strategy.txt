Scion’s Strategy

The young author was turned down by a dozen of publishers. The publishers used one particular term, which is controversial enough: religion. When you talk about religion, it may hurt the communities. The publishers had been bothered more about the social opinion than a potential market.
But that turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the young author. He was to establish himself as an author turned entrepreneur in the booming literary industry. He became a new addition to India’s vast literary industry: Amish Tripathi.
The publishers feared blasphemy, Amish expressed his sentiments during a recent visit to Galle. He embraced the rejection like a rebel. He took over the publisher’s job himself banking on his years of expertise in finance. Amish was soon to become a familiar sight in the bookshelves.
Amish Tripathi, born in 1974, is an Indian novelist, known for The Immortals of Meluha, The Secret of the Nagas, The Oath of the Vayuputras and Scion of Ikshvaku. The first three books are a combination of the Shiva Trilogy, while the fourth is the first of the Ram Chandra Series. The Shiva Trilogy as well as the Scion of Ikshvaku were ranked as the fast-selling book series. Tripathi’s books have sold over 3.5 million copies. He has also been handpicked as an Eisenhower Fellow, an exclusive programme for outstanding leaders from around the world.
“I was fascinated by the pantheon of gods and deities in India. There was this God Nataraj who was obsessed with his wife and many more,” notes a beaming Tripathi.
He chose the modern English to narrate the most ancient lore of his country. And then he initiated his own marketing campaign.
“It is all about thinking out of the box. If you say ‘we can’t do this,’ I take it as a ridiculous sentence. Being rejected is a blessing in disguise.”
If only the publishers accepted Amish, he would not have come this far.
Tripathi’s first marketing strategy was distributing the first chapter of his first book. It was a well-kept secret as no one had experimented on it before. Amish compares this strategy with a promotion of shampoo sachets. When you cannot afford the normal shampoo, the sachet is the convenient option. That also gives you an idea about the bigger shampoo bottle.
“I applied the same theory. It is all about investing at the right time. I placed the first chapter of my first book in the cash counter, because that is where you find the serious customers.”
When you approach the normal customers in the supermarket, they are not serious buyers. The serious customers actually use money. They would hardly mind investing on a book. Having distributed the first chapter, a few weeks before the launch, Amish Tripathi soon witnessed a great success in a newfound marketing campaign.
Amish Tripathi has been awarded the Society Young Achievers Award for Literature in 2013. His most recent awards have been Raymond Crossword Popular Fiction Award for his book Scion of Ikshvaku and the Dainik Bhaskar Readers choice Award in 2016.
Tripathi’s books are essentially based on religious themes, apparently as he is a devotee of Lord Shiva. An atheist in his youth, Amish claims to have returned to his faith following the first book. He had the opportunity to gather the cream of Hindu mythology and theology knowledge from his grandfather, a Sanskrit scholar.
Religiosity and liberalism go hand-in-hand in India, Amish claims, but hastens to add: You need to be innovative. Keep on innovating marketing concepts.
“I do not know if it is applicable in Sri Lanka. But I am sure the Sri Lankan god culture would definitely inspire any author.”
Amish Tripathi uses an English that appears natural to him. Language should not be a barrier. It should only be a medium to generate a creative genius. Criticism is his much favoured subject.
“Criticism is a must when you are an author. You should always listen to criticism. I’d pay thousands to get others’ feedback. The authors should have critics. That is essentially because I write to myself.”
Words, Tripathy said, should evoke the right mood. When you write a love scene, you should be in a Shah Rukh Khan mood, notes Amish Tripathi with a slightly sarcastic tone. Probably why his books sell in millions rather than thousands.
Described as ‘India’s first literary popstar’ by world-renowned film director Shekhar Kapur, Amish’s unique combination of crackling story-telling, religious symbolism and profound philosophies has made him an overnight publishing phenomenon, with spiritual guru Deepak Chopra hailing Amish’s books as ‘archetypal and stirring’.
Amish’s 4 books till now — The Immortals of Meluha (2010), The Secret of the Nagas (2011) and The Oath of the Vayuputras (2013), which collectively comprise the Shiva Trilogy and Scion of Ikshvaku (Part 1 of the Ram Chandra Series) (2015) — have over 3.5 million copies in print with gross retail sales of over Rs 100 crores.
His books have been translated into 18 Indian and International languages.
Ram crouched low as he bent his tall, lean and muscular frame. He rested his weight on his right knee as he held the bow steady. The arrow was fixed in place, but he knew that the bowstring should not be pulled too early. He didn’t want his muscles to tire out. He had to wait for the perfect moment. It must be a clean strike.
‘It’s moving, Dada,’ whispered Lakshman to his elder brother.
Ram didn’t reply. His eyes were fixed on the target. A light breeze played with the few strands of hair that had escaped the practical bun atop his head. His shaggy, unkempt beard and his white dhoti gently fluttered in the breeze. Ram corrected his angle as he factored in the strength and direction of the wind. He quietly cast his white angvastram aside to reveal a battle-scarred, dark-skinned torso. The cloth should not interfere with the release of the arrow.
The deer suddenly came to a standstill as it looked up; perhaps instinct had kicked in with some warning signals. Ram could hear its low snort as it stomped its feet uneasily. Within a few seconds it went back to chewing leaves as silence prevailed. The rest of the herd was a short distance away, hidden from view by the dense foliage of the forest.
‘By the great Lord Parshu Ram, it ignored its instincts,’ said Lakshman softly. ‘Thank the Lord. We need some real food.’
‘Quiet…’
Lakshman fell silent. Ram knew they needed this kill. Lakshman and he, accompanied by his wife Sita, had been on the run for the last thirty days. A few members of the Malayaputra tribe, the sons of Malaya, led by their captain, Jatayu, were also with them.
Jatayu had urged flight well before the inevitable retaliation came. The botched meeting with Shurpanakha and Vibhishan would certainly have consequences. They were, after all, the siblings of Raavan, the wrathful demon-king of Lanka. Raavan was sure to seek vengeance. Lankan royal blood had been shed.
Racing east through the Dandakaranya, the dense forest of Dandak, they had travelled a reasonable distance parallel to the Godavari. They were fairly reassured now that they wouldn’t be easily spotted or tracked. Straying too far from the tributary rivers or other water bodies would mean losing out on the best chance of hunting animals. Ram and Lakshman were princes of Ayodhya, inheritors of the proud Kshatriya tradition of the Raghukul, the descendants of Raghu. They would not survive on a diet of herbs, fruit and leaves alone.
The deer remained stationary, lost in the pleasure of grazing on tender shoots. Ram knew this was the moment. He held the composite bow steady in his left hand as he pulled the string back with his right, till it almost touched his lips. His elbow was held high, almost perfectly parallel to the ground, exactly the way his guru, Maharishi Vashishta, had taught him.
The elbow is weak. Hold it high. Let the effort come from the back muscles. The back is strong.
Ram pulled the string a notch further and then released the arrow. The missile whizzed past the trees and slammed into the deer’s neck. It collapsed immediately, unable to even utter a bleat as blood flooded its lungs. Despite his muscular bulk, Lakshman rushed forward stealthily. Even as he moved, he pulled out a knife from the horizontal scabbard tied to the small of his back. Within moments he reached the deer and quickly plunged the blade deep in between the animal’s ribs, right through to its heart.
‘Forgive me for killing you, O noble beast,’ he whispered the ancient apology that all hunters offered, as he gently touched the deer’s head. ‘May your soul find purpose again, while your body sustains my soul.’
Ram caught up with Lakshman as his brother pulled the arrow out, wiped it clean and returned it to its rightful owner. ‘Still usable,’ he murmured.
Ram slipped the arrow back into his quiver as he looked up at the sky. Birds chirped playfully and the deer’s own herd displayed no alarm. They had not sensed the killing of one of their own. Ram whispered a short prayer to Lord Rudra, thanking him for what had been a perfect hunt. The last thing they needed was for their position to be given away.
Ram and Lakshman made their way through the dense jungle. Ram walked in front, carrying one end of a long staff on his shoulder, while Lakshman walked behind, holding up the other end. The deer’s carcass dangled in the middle, its feet having been secured to the staff with a sturdy rope.
