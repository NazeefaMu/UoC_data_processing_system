Kingswood Principal under probe

The Education Ministry yesterday initiated an investigation into the Principal of Kingswood College, Kandy, who is alleged to have barred a group of students from sitting the term test for failing to pay the school development committee fees.
This issue has come for discussion at the Tell President Programme held at the Nuwara Eliya District under the patronage of Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake and State Education Minister R. Radhakrishnan.
The State Education Minister and the Central Province Governor have in turn informed the Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi to initiate a prompt investigation into this allegation
It has also been revealed that a number of students have watched the Big Mathes spending the money given by the parents as school development committee fees.
