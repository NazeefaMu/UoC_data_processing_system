Kingswood down Antonians 27/12

Kingswood proved there is still life in their rugby after beating St Anthony’s comfortably in their fourth match of the season’s first round school’s league rugby championship by 27 points (2 goals, 2 tries, 1 penalty) to 12 (1 goal, 1 try). At half time the scores were tied at 12-all.
This match that was postponed due to bad weather and ground conditions earlier was played at Nittawela yesterday. The match began early as 3.30 pm due to early fading light. It was played in ideal rugby playing conditions, and the ball handling of both sides was up to the mark.
The line outs were somewhat scrappy but the Kingswoodians enjoyed a good amount of possession in the second half, in that half the Antonian performance was disappointing.
They lacked the finish on several occasions and fumbled in a desperate attempt to penetrate the Kingswood defence.
Both teams got off to a good start with the forwards playing with determination and the score read 12-all at half time. But the real scoring chance for the Kingswoodians came in the second half, when the backs started some threatening moves.
For Kingswood Milan Weerasinghe, Asin Senaratne, Dinal Ekanayake and Shanuka Gedorgoda scored the tries.
Nethmina Sampath goaled the tries and Dahma Atigodage put over the penalty.
For St. Anthony’s Jithen Daulagala and Mathis Amarasinghe scored the tries of which one was converted by Mohamed Makram.
