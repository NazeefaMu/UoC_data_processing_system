Diyawanna Vesak Zone

The Diyawanna Vesak Zone jointly organised by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry headed by Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya’s office concluded yesterday.Inaugurated on May 10, it portrayed Buddhist customs and traditions of 10 Asian countries and drew large crowds on all five days.
The Zone offered a new meaning to traditional Vesak decorations by giving a digital orientation in line with technical decorations of the modern world.
For the first time in the country, it displayed a water screen pandal and a laser pandal. The 60 ft long, 30 ft tall water screen pandal displayed two jataka stories. The 60 ft long, 40 ft tall laser pandal displayed artworks on major events in Buddha’s life from the birth of Prince Siddhartha to the Buddha’s Parinibbana.
Diyawanna Oya was lit up by 2,500 floating bulbs depicting lotus flowers. The Vesak park adjoining Ape Gama complex on the Japan Friendship Road featured digital pandals, Vesak lanterns and decorations. A dansala accommodated 75,000 people each day from 7.30 pm to midnight from May 10 to May 12.
Several other dansals offering herbal food and soft drinks were also in the zone. A special meditation programme attended by 3,000 people was held at the Speaker’s residence on May 11 followed by a pindapatha round and a sanghika dana. Awards were presented to artistes and others who contributed to the success of the Vesak Zone yesterday.
