Another 15,000 teachers to be recruited:Akila

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that plans are afoot to recruit 15,000 teachers in the next few months to ease the teacher shortage. The recruitment of teachers to the College of Education will also be increased to 10,000 in the near future.
“This will help to carry out the 13-Year Compulsory Education Programme (CEP) to be implemented at 42 National schools islandwide,” he said.
“The new system will allow the students, who do not pass the GCE Ordinary Level to proceed to the Advanced Level, to pursue vocational studies to succeed in future,” the Minister said.
The Minister was speaking at the annual prize giving ceremony of Ananda Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo yesterday. “In order to maintain a developed education system, the scope of the syllabus should be reduced and pressure faced by the children minimised.We are formulating a policy for that,” Minister Kariyawasam said.
“Principals and teachers should always be practical. Children should be given freedom to enjoy their childhood.
Then only can they achieve better results in schools and other activities,” the Minister added.
“All principals and teachers should think of the students as their children which will reduce many problems. Especially, they should think about the mental stability of children. Due to the injustice caused to the girl in Kekirawa, we will provide her with a national school and a provide a monthly allowance of Rs.3000 to help her continue her studies,” Minister Kariyawasam said.
