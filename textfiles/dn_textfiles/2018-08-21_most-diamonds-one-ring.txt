Most diamonds in one ring

Jewelers Vishal Agarwal and Khushbu Agarwal of Surat, India, have broken the Guinness World Record for most diamonds set in one ring.
The ring the jewelers crafted contains 6,690 diamonds placed onto an 18 karat rose gold structure that is shaped like a lotus flower. The ring weighs more than a golf ball at just over 58 grams and is worth $4,116,787.
The previous record was set by Savio Jewelry’s Peakcock ring in 2015 which contained 3,827 cut diamonds.
Vishal designed the ring which has 48 individual petals while Khushbu, who owns Hanumant Diamonds, funded the project. The lotus flower style was created in order to raise awareness about the importance of water conservation.
“As fame is so much attached to a Guinness World Records title, we can put it to good use by bringing together like-minded people to work towards a beautiful world,” they said in a statement.
A video, posted by Guinness World Records on recently, chronicles the making of the ring including the cutting and placing of the diamonds.
