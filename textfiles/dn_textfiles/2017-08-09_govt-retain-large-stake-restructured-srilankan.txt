Govt to retain large stake in restructured SriLankan

The government would definitely keep a large stake during the restructuring of SriLankan Airlines as the country needs a airline brand in the sky, said State Minister of Public Enterprise Development Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena.
“Sri Lanka can only boost of its cricket, tea and tourism in the globe market and the country cannot afford to lose an international band such as SriLankan,” he said.
Abeywardena voiced that SriLankan is very strong in its engineering, ground handling and catering areas and these functions should be retained by the government.
He said that all the airlines have been bleeding from airline passenger operations. “Emirates suffered a 6%loss and Qatar losses were 9% but all of them have other related business like travel arms, hotels and this loss is not evident.”
The minister said there are 7,000 employees and their interests too should be taken in to account and the right model for restricting is the private public partnership. “When the loss making Malaysian Airlines was restricted and turned around there was a worker retrenchment. A similar thing cannot happen with SriLankan,” the minister insisted.
He said that SriLankan is now on the right path trying to cover the loss making areas and the new destination to Australia in October seems to be a success. “We have already sold over 10,000 seats,” he said.
The minister also said that they would also look at the PPP model when it comes to the restructuring of the Mattala airport. “It would not be done under similar terms of the Hambantota port deal.”
Speaking at a special press conference to spell out the SLFP stance on the bond scam he said that the actual damage of it would amount to around Rs one trillion in 30 years. “One must take in to account the loss suffered by the ETF and the investment opportunities where this money could have being diverted.”
