House for War Hero’s mother

 The sad story of a mother of a War Hero was highlighted on Face book recently and Housing and Construction Minister Sajth Pramadasa immediately called the mother at his ministry and granted her a land in the Anamaduwa Gamudawa area in the Puttalam District.
In addition, the Minister instructed to the NHDA Puttalam District Manager to construct a house within five months to the value of Rs.500,000 for her on the land.
The picture shows the Minister handing over a cheque to the late Ranaviru Ranjith Pramasiri’s mother at Sethsiripaya on March 9. National Housing Development Authority Chairman S. Palansooriya is present.
