LAUGFS International hosts workshop

LAUGFS International, the trading arm of LAUGFS Holdings, recently hosted a one day workshop for its Airman Generator dealers and service agents including its sales, operations and service teams, where individuals were exposed to an outstanding training programme exclusively with Airman Japan representatives.
The workshop covered an array of topics including crucial areas such as servicing and maintenance of generators, energy optimization and power requirement analysis. The objective of the training and workshop is to cascade the expertise of providing and maintaining the ideal generator for customers through a professional service team.
The workshop was conducted by Japanese Airman officials including Senior Manager of Customer Support and Service Takashi Shibuya, Assistant Manager Sales for Airman Asia Yusaku Endo and Managing Director of Airman Asia Tony Lin.
The training session focused on enlightening professionals on technical issues, products and services including sales training, which in return would enable professionals to provide an exceptional service to the end customer.
Since Airman Generators are technical products, the intervention of a professional when choosing the right product or service is crucial in order to prevent customers from being misguided and preyed upon by non-professionals in the industry.
The training workshop is yet another giant leap forward by LAUGFS International in trying to create better avenues for customers, where professionals with hands on experience are ready to cater to clients with world class products and services.
As the authorised and sole distributor for Airman Generators in Sri Lanka, LAUGFS International is the one-stop destination for those in pursuit of genuine power solutions.
“At LAUGFS International, we believe in maintaining stringent policy standards pertaining to the quality of our products and services.
We are committed to ensure that our valuable customers are guaranteed optimum customer satisfaction,” commented, LAUGFS International Director and CEO Wasantha De Silva
