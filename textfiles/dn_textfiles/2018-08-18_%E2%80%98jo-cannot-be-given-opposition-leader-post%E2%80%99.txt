‘JO cannot be given Opposition Leader post’

Kalutara District JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday said the Joint Opposition cannot be given the post of Opposition Leader even though all JO members become independent in Parliament.
He was speaking at an event in Kalutara yesterday.
“The Joint Opposition is in the habit of taking people for a ride by giving them false promises,” he said.
Meanwhile, UPFA parliamentarian Shehan Semasinghe said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should not protect the Constitution of the United National Party but the Constitution of the country.
“We don’t have any personal disputes with the Opposition Leader.
"But we have an issue when the Opposition Leader and the Chief Opposition Whip are attempting to protect the government in Parliament,” he said.
