Protest against name change

The Ceylon Workers Congress supporters together with the public staged a protest in Hatton against the decision of Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Ministry to change the name of the Thondaman Vocational Training Centre.
The centre was renamed as Pool Bank Vocational Training centre, recently. As a result, CWC supporters launched a protest causing heavy traffic congestion in the Hatton town, yesterday.
The protesters demanded that the name should not be changed and it was reported that supporters from all parts of the hill country participated.
The vocational training centre was established in 1998 by the late Sawmiya Murthi Thondaman with the help of the then German Ambassador to Sri Lanka. After the demise of Sawmiya Murthi Thondaman, Arumugam Thondaman opened the centre and named it ‘Thondaman Vocational Training Centre’.
The training centre was established to make vocational training in Tamil medium more accessible to plantation youth.
The protesters said since its establishment, the name remained as ‘Thondaman Vocational Training Centre’ and now the new government is trying to change the name.
