IP vital for sustainable  development: Envoy

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is pivotal to a rule-based global order built on sustainable peace and shared progress and prosperity, Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the UN in Geneva Ambassador A. L. A. Azeez said.
He was addressing the 58th Session Series of Meetings of the WIPO General Assemblies, recently.
He said “we should continue to strive together to make this vision a reality. Sri Lanka looks forward to proactively contributing to the effective realization of that vision, ensuring rich dividends of Intellectual Property (IP) for its people”.
Ambassador Azeez stressed the importance of IP for economic development with its potential to uplift the lives of millions.
Referring to reconciliation, peace-building and economic development in Sri Lanka, the Permanent Representative said “the continuation of targeted empowerment efforts, particularly since 2015” has “resulted in more and more innovations enjoying IP protection” while unleashing the potential for innovation among youth and women in all regions of Sri Lanka.
However, while advantages abounded, challenges too remained, he said, highlighting the requirement for a more balanced representation of regions in the composition of the WIPO governing bodies, which is more pronounced today.
Emphasizing the need for a fair and balanced Intellectual Property system for economic development, Ambassador Azeez said sustained efforts in mainstreaming the Development Agenda into WIPO’s work are vital for the long-term relevance and success of the organization.
