‘Gudppl’, Microsoft  BizSpark reinforced vision

Startups are established each year and are often paraded around with increasing fervour to describe scrappy young ventures, popular web-based apps and high-profile tech giants.
Gudppl (Good People) a social network based out of Sri Lanka, it is a dynamic mobile and web-based application which couples the skill-sets of volunteers with the interests of entities that need them.
Harinda Fonseka founder and Chief Executive Officer for Gudppl, said “The idea that people can tailor their volunteering experience to their schedule, location, and areas of passion was unheard of until now. For organistions to use a single outlet through which to recruit volunteers to get involved in their work; non-existent.”
The network wanted to allow local charities, religious institutions, and schools to consolidate their ‘needs’ onto one platform so that prospective volunteers would know what is required of them and how and when to deliver It. “Our primary goal at the time was to create a dynamic ‘one-stop shop’ for people who wanted to do good on behalf of society,” Harinda said. The network managed to develop a working prototype.
And while it seemed to work well for a while, it eventually brought a number of issues to the surface. “With a lack of financial resources and time, we reached an insurmountable plateau. We participated in a startup programme and came across Microsoft’s BizSpark programmes,” Harinda said.
