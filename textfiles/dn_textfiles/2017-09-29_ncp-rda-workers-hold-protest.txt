NCP RDA workers hold protest

A group of workers of the North Central Province Road Development Authority held a protest on Wednesday in front of the Anuradhapura D. S. Senanayaka Roundabout demanding the government not to privatise the Expressways in the country as well as insisting to reinstate their medical leave.
Nihal Ajith, Assistant Secretary of RDA United Workers Association sharing his views during the protest said that the workers have gathered to demand the government to expedite in providing the required leave quotas for the labourers and labour supervisors of the North Central Province RDA. He said the government has decided to privatise the expressways of the country. We are against the decision.
We will continue to fight until the decision to sell the expressways is dropped, and benefits provided for other workers are granted to the labourers as well.
