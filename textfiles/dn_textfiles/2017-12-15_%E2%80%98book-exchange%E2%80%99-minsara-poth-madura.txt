‘Book Exchange’  at Minsara Poth Madura

‘Book Exchange,’ an initiative by Minsara Poth Madura Founder Deshamanya Gamini Moragoda re-introduces the tradition of barter system where people can buy new books in exchange of the ones they have already read. 
“The Book Exchange at Minsara book stores is a wonderful initiative at low cost,” Moragoda said. “Readers can avail up to 75% discounts on new books in exchange of the books that are purchased from the book stores within 14 days of time. We hope that the concept can be the impetus for improving a reading habit and culture.”
The new Minsara book store in Kadawatha heralds the chain’s attempt to further ‘the journey of knowledge,’ as stated in their vision. All Minsara book stores offer a free reading corner, providing avid readers the opportunity for exploration and discovery. 
Described as the ‘cultural book store,’ Minsara book stores cater to Primary school children and University students alike, offering an eclectic collection of educational books, other publications, stationery items and office consumables. All Minsara publications are evaluated and recommended by an elite panel of authors and publishers.
