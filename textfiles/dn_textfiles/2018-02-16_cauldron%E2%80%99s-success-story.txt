CAULDRON’s success story

THE CAULDRON combines all good things to give Colombo a quintessential café experience. Since its founding this curated space has dished out delicacies that have gone on to become the city’s favourites.
However, the founders of THE CAULDRON now reveal the secret ingredient of their success story. To them it is not only the quirky food or the curious atmosphere of the café, but also their young and passionate team that make everything possible.
“Pol Roti Kottu, Kochchi Chicken Waffles and Homemade Meatballs would’ve not been possible if not for our small team of six dedicated individuals led by Manager Sampath Dissanayake” added the founders of this eclectic café located at Stratford Avenue, Kirulapone.
The team at THE CAULDRON with warm smiles adds much value to the beautiful ambience of this café.
The team boasts of the quality standards at THE CAULDRON with much emphasis on sticking to recipes and hygiene standards. When asked about service training the team responds gleefully Service is not a job for us as we feel ownership for the brand and we do what we can to make it the best café experience in Colombo for the YOUNG and THE YOUNG AT HEART.
THE CAULDRON has gained instant popularity since they opened doors in October last year, mostly due to their simple but delicious menu that consists of soulful dishes such as the Kochchi and Smoked Chicken Stuffed Waffles, Pol Roti Burgers and the famed Pol Roti Kottu. They later launched more interesting additions like the Chicken Ham, Cheese and Potato Stuffed Waffles, Homemade Meatballs
Spaghetti, Waffle Wrap with Thai Style Chicken and Caramelized Onion as well as Roast Paan Sandwiches to name a few.
