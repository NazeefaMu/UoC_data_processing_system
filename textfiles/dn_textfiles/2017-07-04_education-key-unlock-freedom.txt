Education: key to unlock freedom

Many understand education as a process of imparting instructions in various academic disciplines in schools, universities and other institutes of higher learning. But not only in modern society but from ages past education has been rightly understood as a wholesome life-long process of learning and imbibing all that one needs to pick up and absorb to live responsibly and contentedly in the community.
And there are obviously many ways and means of teaching and learning and processing young and maturing people to help them grow to adulthood to be conscientious and responsible human beings.
The clear and higher enlightenment that should come from the depths of religions should indeed raise human beings to elevated and nobler levels of life in the community. It is the function of religions to lead their adherents to higher and such nobler levels of living in solidarity and human fraternity and not leave them floating and drifting in superficial and mundane inanities. To so indulge in religion would be to denigrate religion itself and create an unhealthy dark environment and open the way to chaos and confusion in human society.
As we go through some of these phases of chaos and confusion in our society today, the political and religious leaders should open their eyes to the reality before them and acknowledge that there is ignorance on the part of the mass of people of the core values of religions and that their thoughtless spiritual impoverishment has been influencing them.
VALUE OF GOOD UPBRINGING
In the regeneration of society, elevating the level of education of all the people is of prime importance. This cannot be done unless some basic principles of life have been inculcated in the citizens during their home upbringing and school education during their early years of life as children. Not only good quality schools with good teachers, very good quality homes with responsible parents are necessary for a Nation to be healthy in mind, body and community spirit. Just as governments should be concerned about the policies and quality of school education, it should be equally concerned about the quality of married and family life that provides the background for the nurturing of children, the youngest citizens of the country whose healthy and wholesome upbringing is of crucial social importance.
Who could approve of the behaviour of university students who barged into the Ministry of Health, fought with the police and security forces, injured them and got injured themselves? While we shouldn't sneer at the young men, it should also be asked as to who their guides were who led them to such a pass. Who could approve of the doctors who were reluctant to treat the injured in the hospital? Their attitude shows that they are uneducated as to the intrinsic worth of every human being. They are all products of defective upbringing in deficient homes and very probably undisciplined and flawed education under uncaring teachers in schools with substandard ethos. Who could approve of the cowardly conspiratorial political ghostly figures who manipulate students and others as their cats’ paws to do their bidding, leave the sick uncared, cause confusion in the community and embarrass the government and do it all with apparent ulterior motives?
It is in the home and school that a child learns the first lessons of responsibility for oneself and for others. A child that does not learn to obey, honour and respect one’s father and mother, elders in the family and the neighbourhood and teachers do not learn the most important lesson of life which is to trust and defer to better knowledge and wisdom and submit to parental guidance and legitimate authority. Very clearly, many in the younger generation of today, as well as grown ups who have demonstrated immature and irresponsible attitudes as those in the GMOA, Principals and Teachers’ and other Trade Unions and in Parliament itself, are clear specimens of flawed home upbringing, school training and defective religious formation. Whence have come all these ‘learned peoples’ attitudes? Whither has their education brought them to? To force everyone to accept their opinion and enslave everyone to their way of thinking and acting mercilessly and inhumanly?
FIVE-YEAR OLD’S DREAM
In good homes and good schools, children from their young days learn wholesome personal and social attitudes. Many adults are not conscious that there are in our homes children of less than five years of age who attend pre-schools who show a keen sense of responsibility for oneself and for others. They become remarkable so when they are so taught by parents and teachers. The weekly newspaper Catholic Messenger of June 25, 2017 publishes a story of a five-year-old girl who inspired by what a four-year-old girl had done, felt sympathy for malnourished children and helped raise 20,000 dollars in Hong Kong in two weeks and who says, “My dream is to help more poor people”.
I myself have met a four-year-old girl who after the birth of her baby sister told me, “Father, now I have to be responsible and give a good example to my little sister!” There are many such children in our midst, in our homes and schools. They are children of good and responsible parents. Proper nurturing and preparation will motivate them to be very responsible adult citizens.
Those who are close to children in our schools know that a good many of them are indeed upright and virtuous. Parents and teachers should be able to pay careful attention to them and help them to build up their will and character as they grow in intelligence and acquire various skills and help them to grow to that adult maturity of responsible citizens who would be invaluable and great assets to the country. From the palpable environment of their home and school, they imbibe the ethos feasible to community living in responsibility.
It is up to government authorities to see that badly brought up and defectively educated individuals do not cause destruction and damage to people and property and disrupt good relations in the community.
LONG-LASTING INJURIES
It has to be admitted that all children do not get the care, attention and protection they need. It is a great social tragedy that not all parents, school teachers, elders, guardians not only do not take proper care of children at home and school, they neglect them and leave them uncared, to be on their own even at a very young age; they also through ignorance and lack of preparation ill-treat and hurt children and even punish them inappropriately and mercilessly, venting unrestrained anger and ill-temper on them. Some couples living together and bringing forth children, some parents, teachers and guardians in homes and orphanages have never been in any way prepared to handle and care for children nor have they by themselves acquired the capacity and skill to provide tender loving care that children need. Due to this failing on their part long-lasting physical injuries and psychological damage are caused to innocent children. It is heartbreaking to see that some religious persons too have abused children. Religious institutions have therefore been compelled to enforce zero tolerance of child abuse.
As prevention is better than cure, the government agencies of child welfare and protection could do much to raise the consciousness of the people in general and certain sectors in particular to aspects of child care many do not think about.
HONEST OFFICIALS PERSECUTED
The qualities that are glaringly lacking in the many agencies of public service of government are skill, enthusiasm, stimulus and motivation. Almost all government agencies of public service are overpopulated with political lackeys of incompetent and stupid politicians who have made the public service a channel to provide employment to their unemployed supporters who have also remained so in their frustrated situation due to lack of skills and training and the incomplete education they have received from an education system directed, controlled, influenced and administered by incompetent politicians who should never have been in the positions of power they hold. Politicisation by corrupt politicians has led many a government service into inextricably messy, fraudulent and freakish institutional caprice from which people cannot expect honest service. The people often hear of honest officials being transferred, persecuted and gunned down due to their not toeing the line of corrupt politicians in power.
If the people want a truly honest and honourable progeny of theirs to grow in an environment of truth, justice and freedom where merit and competence are valued by highly trained and qualified experts tried in the crucible of unrelenting hard work, they should become truthful, just and honest themselves. Then they should make a determined and decisive effort to get rid of the horde of hoodlum political crooks on the national stage who have taken to politics to embezzle, commit fraud and pilfer the peoples’ wealth and are a despicable ruffian lot ruining this land posing as nationalist patriots so well exemplified in the partners of the last regime.
