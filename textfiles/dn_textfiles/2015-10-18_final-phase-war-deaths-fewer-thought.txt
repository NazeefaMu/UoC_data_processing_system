PM tells The Straits Times
Final phase war deaths fewer than thought

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday estimates of death during the final phase of the war in Sri Lanka might be fewer than thought.
In an interview with ‘The Straits Times’ yesterday, the Prime Minister said while no firm estimates of deaths are available, his own sense was that the numbers may be fewer than thought.
“The government’s top priority now is national reconciliation. President Sirisena had called an All-Party Conference on the issue and the government was considering setting up a Missing Persons Office,” the Prime Minister said.
However, he indicated, allowing foreign judges to join Sri Lankan judges in special courts to try war crimes, as suggested by a UN human rights report, may be trickier.
“Already, foreign judges have participated in our commissions of inquiry. In the last two commissions foreign judges actually formed the panel that advised the councils. So, the question is, do we go up to that point or do we go further and have a foreign judge sitting on the Bench that will go on for some time,” he said.
The next priority was to restore the democratic institutions that, he said, had suffered under Mr Rajapaksa. This was one of the reasons why the government was pushing to end the executive presidency with a Cabinet system of government.
“The Chief Justice was unceremoniously thrown out by him,” Mr. Wickremesinghe said. “The rule of law had suffered. We had a proud record of democracy. Ours is the oldest parliament in Asia -our legislative council was formed in 1835.”
“Sri Lanka’s economy has accelerated since the end of the civil war and Mr. Wickremesinghe said he thought average growth rates of 7 per cent are achievable. At the same time, the economy is also feeling headwinds from the China slowdown and the prospects of interest rate hikes in the West, which could impact on his country’s ability to repay loans. Beyond that,the government is considering the next steps for economic reform,” THE PM said.
“The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is going to make a change in the Asian regional economy. All countries have to take note of TPP,”he said.
“And then,there is China and India. We are looking at our own location, and our natural resources and human skills. We are doing an Economic and Technological Cooperation Partnership with India. A Free Trade Agreement with China will follow and hopefully, also with Singapore after that.”
Commenting on Sri Lanka’s bilateral relations, the Prime Minister said, “We have put out the criterion for visits by naval ships. Under that, ships including submarines from all countries can visit Sri Lanka.
As far as we are concerned if it is a friendly visit we will inform the neighbouring countries and we will spread out the (frequency of the)visits.”
“The problem with the last visit by a Chinese submarine was that India claims it was not informed. So far, from what we found out, that seems to be correct.” he added.
