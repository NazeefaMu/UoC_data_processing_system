Meethotamulla and the Tale of Two Cities

Colombo’s garbage saga is really a tale of two cities. The affluent neighbourhood in Colombo 7 is cleaned not once but several times a day. At one O’ clock in the afternoon, street cleaners can be seen assiduously picking up a few stray leaves on Horton place. Environment Police is seen placidly patrolling as there is really nothing much for them to do. On the contrary, in the other City of Colombo ( for example Colombo North ) roads are blocked by wayside eateries and repair shops, garbage is piled up on the roads and slung into canals, open drains are man traps, sewage lines illegally directed to storm water drains raise a stink and ratepayers breathe a sigh of relief if the collection is done once a day.
The Environmental Police, once feared under a former regime for lying in wait for early morning garbage dumpers, is neither visible nor effective. And beyond Colombo is the permanent stinking life devouring hellhole of the Meethotamulla garbage dump.
Man made disaster
The Meethotamulla tragedy like many other recent disasters in Sri Lanka is a man made disaster. Made by man, by man’s actions and by man’s lapses. Solutions were sought and touted by many over a long period of time but with no action taken, the disaster was allowed to escalate. Warnings of a possible garbage landslide were long given by community members, civil society activists and university professionals . The last silent unheeded warning was given the stray dogs in the area who summarily evacuated the dump before it rained death and garbage on a hapless community, enjoying the National Sinhala and Tamil Aluth Avurudda holiday. The casualty rate is 30 now and yet escalating .The body search continues.
In the enraged public debate following the Avuruddu tragedy, three concerns emerge, constant official buck passing, long-term political apathy and large scale corruption. If as it is true as charged by community leaders that corruption was the real reason that dumping was continued unabated, that viable projects and effective alternate solutions were discarded due to rent seeking, then both bribe givers and bribe seekers now have blood on their hands.
Politicians are castigated by the suffering community as guilty for constantly putting the Meethotamulla issue on the back burner. Officers are seen culpable in that they did not look for solutions and failed to recognise the impending disaster or warn the political leadership in time. Communities from other alternate dumping sites cannot be blamed for their anti dump protests in advance of dumping, having seen and smelled Meethotamulla who would want to have that on your doorstep?
Quick to curb protests but problem unresolved
Why is the politicians’ solution to curb public protests but not to mitigate the problem which led to these protests? Why are the state officers and local politicians so unable to read the deep extent suffering of these communities at the correct moment and sound the warning? Is Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) never to be taken seriously by political leadership and officials or continue to be a mere theme for presentations at various seminars? Disaster risk reduction needs ongoing sensitivity to the local context.
The people of Meethotamulla had apparently held 15 protests against the continuance of garbage dumping. All these protests did not succeed in stopping the dumping. The state baton charged the protesters of Meetotamulla as it had baton charged the protesters of Rathupaswela. Both problems were left to escalate until there was no solution seen but to take the uncomfortable route of public protest. No one in his/her right mind would want to be holding boards on roads, be tear gassed and drenched by water cannon for demanding a clean environment if there was a sensible, acceptable solution for their problems.
Now the powers that be are in its customary reaction to most disasters, relief and resettlement for the affected, probably the easiest areas in which to find solutions. Long-term solutions for garbage which will escalate in a megapolis are more difficult to identify and implement.
It is clear that change, a radical change is essential in the way we handle our municipal solid waste. Waste minimisation, a ward system which will make a politician more sensitive and more accountable to his/her constituents and officers who can be held responsible for their actions if the country is needed to move with positive lessons out of the Meethotamulla tragedy .
But no change is possible if there is no immediate attempts at through waste separation and waste minimisation, for recycle and reuse, if garbage dumping merely continues to be paid for by the kilo (along with a corruption tag as is being publicly proclaimed by the enraged Meethotamulla victims). All the dumping sites currently being planned as an alternative for Meethotamulla will not suffice if we do not move very fast to separate and minimise waste, mainly plastic waste. The state needs to take several policy decisions, the first being on “sirisiri” bags. Not to do so, will only export the problem to another hapless community who will tread down the same grim path. It is not that there were no successful solid waste management pilot projects involving behavioural change in communities in the past.
Finding a viable solution
I recollect that the CMC had success in their ADB funded orange bin project, using community policing to curb dumping in the urban watta communities. Compost bins can again be given to those families who have space and want to use them. But, it would be a joke to ask the community to painstakingly do waste separation when, degradable and non degradable waste are collected together and eventually slung in to the same pit.
There are other less visible mini Meethotamullas in the making in Hatton, Nuwara Eliya, Aranayake and Ambuluwawa ( to mention a few recent viewings). Too numerous to count, these dumps proliferate often on river banks and places of great scenic beauty. And this, in a country which is trying to attract tourists!! These garbage dumps in the upper catchment will eventually poison our water sources.
But this is Sri Lanka, we have gone through so much trauma to constitute enough lessons learnt for several generations. This too shall pass away. We will probably move to viewing the next demonstration, the next accident, the next disaster, the next round of political antics with equanimity. But, for those families whose loved ones were buried under the garbage in Meethotamulla, this sorrow shall never pass away .
