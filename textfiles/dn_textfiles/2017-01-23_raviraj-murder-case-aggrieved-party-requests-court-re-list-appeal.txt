Raviraj murder case: aggrieved party requests court to re-list appeal

Filing a motion before the Court of Appeal, Sasikala Raviraj, wife of former TNA Parliamentarian Nadaraja Raviraj moved in the Court of Appeal that the appeal which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal last week be re-listed for support.
The appeal filed by Raviraj’s wife challenging the Colombo High Court’s judgement to release the five accused, including three Navy intelligence officers, in the Raviraj murder case was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on January 19.
When the application was taken up before the two-judge-Bench comprising Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Lalith  Jayasuriya neither the petitioner nor a lawyer representing the petitioner were present in Court.
The aggrieved party informed Court the document issued by the registry of High Court of Colombo was incomplete, with several critical documents ,including the order of the High Court Judge dated October 27, 2016 rejecting the objections of the aggrieved party to the matter being heard by a special jury and as such the aggrieved party is not in a position to seek a date of support of this application.
Therefore, the aggrieved party moved Court to be pleased to list this application for support for leave after the complete set of documents are made available them.
Furthermore, the aggrieved party moved that the Court be permitted the counsel for the aggrieved party to support this motion on January 24, 2017, January 25, 2017, or January 26, 2017.
The Court of Appeal had observed that the petitioner was not present in Court and unrepresented. Therefore, the Court decided to dismiss the appeal application.
Sasikala Raviraj filed this appeal seeking an order to set aside the verdict of the Colombo High Court dated December 23, 2016 to acquit and release all accused from the case.
On December 23, 2016, three Navy intelligence officers and two others, accused in the Raviraj murder, were acquitted and released from the case after they were found not guilty by jury trial.
The verdict which was delivered by High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke, as per the unanimous decision reached by the jury, following a month long trial. The jury’s decision was that the accused cannot be convicted based on the evidence in the case.
The petitioner further sought an order to set aside the order of the High Court allowing the request of the accused for the case to be tried before a jury. The petitioner stated that a trial by jury cannot be accepted in this case since three charges out of five had been levelled under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
The High Court allowed to proceed with the Raviraj murder trial in absentia of the three accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint who were evading Court since the initiation of investigations.
The indictments were filed against six accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Prasad Chandana Kumara alias Sampath, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda alias Vajira, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint on five counts, including committing the murder of Raviraj and his security officer Lokuwella Murage Laksman under the provisions of the PTA and Penal Code. Three accused who were not present before Court, had been identified as ex-LTTE cadres affiliated to the Karuna faction. Wijeya Wickrema Manamperige Sanjaya Preethi Viraj was made state witness in the Raviraj murder trial.
