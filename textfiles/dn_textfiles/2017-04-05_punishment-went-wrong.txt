A punishment that went wrong

A Grade 11 student attached to a leading school in Rideemaliyadde had suffered an injury in one of his ears when a discipline master cut his longhair with a pair of scissors after hauling him into a room assisted by another teacher on April 3.
A group of teachers had later got together and dressed the wound in the school itself and bought and dropped him at his house with blood stains on his uniform, a complaint made to the Rideemaliyadde Police by the boy’s father S.M. Wimalasena of Gasgolla, Rideemaliyadde said. Later in the day, Police summoned the Deputy Principal and several teachers of the school and the boys parents to the Police station and the two parties came to an amicable settlement.
The boys parents agreed to withdraw their complaint.
