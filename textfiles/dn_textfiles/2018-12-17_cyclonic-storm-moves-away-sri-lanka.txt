Cyclonic storm moves away from Sri Lanka

The cyclonic storm ‘Phethai’ over the southwest Bay of Bengal was located approximately 460 km northeast of Trincomalee at 08.30am yesterday. The system is very likely to move north-northwestwards and intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours, while moving away from the island.
The influence of this system is expected to gradually decrease from tomorrow. Mainly fair weather can be expected over the island and fairly cold weather can also be expected over the country. Fishermen are advised not to venture into the shallow and deep sea areas off the coast extending from Batticaloa to Kankasanturai via Trincomalee till tomorrow (17).
The fishermen who are in the affected areas are advised to move to safer sea areas or return to the coast. Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the sea area off coast extending from Batticaloa to Kankasanthurai via Trincomalee.
Heavy showers can be expected in the northern, northeastern and eastern deep sea areas. Winds will be northerly to northwesterly in the sea areas around the island.
Wind speed will be 50-60 kmph and gusting up to 70 kmph at times over the shallow sea areas off the coast extending from Trincomalee to Kankasanturai.
Wind speed will be 70-80 kmph and gusting up to 90 kmph at times over in the northern, eastern and northeastern deep sea areas.
Wind speed will be 30-40 kmph around the other sea areas of the island. The sea areas to the west of the island can be fairly rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 50 kmph.
