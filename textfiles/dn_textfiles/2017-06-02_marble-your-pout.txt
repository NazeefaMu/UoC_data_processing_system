Marble your pout!

Ready to deck up your pout with a wee bit of marble? Well, if you’ve been following beauty closely, the Marble lips trend shouldn’t come as a surprise. For the uninitiated, here’s everything you need to know about the unconventional and quirky trend.
Marble lips are in vogue, owing to its super intricate style. However, that shouldn’t stop wide-eyed make-up enthusiasts from giving it a shot. Marble lips is a look, which screams ‘DRAMA!’ and demands precision. Wear it at a fun girl’s nightout to jazz up your look.
To begin with, you will require a few different lip shades, a tiny liner brush, and a steady hand for drawing strokes of colours. Start with a solid base like a white. You may even opt for turquoise blue, and then use a thinner brush to add swirls and flecks of the second and third colour (colours like grey and black are best suggested) and create a marble pattern. Finish off with a layer of clear gloss, and voila! Your countertop lip art is complete. This lipstick trend gives you the freedom to experiment with different colours and vibrant hues. You can simply combine shades of white, grey and black, or opt for vibrant hues like blue and purple and even incorporate strokes of gold or silver!
Lip art demands maintenance. So, by that we mean, do not skip the routine scrubbing and moisturising. It’s important to exfoliate enough for the best results.
