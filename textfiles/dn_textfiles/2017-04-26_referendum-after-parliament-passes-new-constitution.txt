Referendum after Parliament passes new Constitution

The first-ever election faced by the Good Governance Government this year will be the referendum to be held for the new Constitution, Health Minister and Co-Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated.
Addressing a meeting at the Health Ministry recently, he said the referendum for the new Constitution will be held after the new Constitution is passed in Parliament.
Work on the new Constitution, such as appointing committees and educating the public has already commenced and it will be completed soon. Minister Dr. Senaratne said Provincial Councils and Local Government elections will be held after the referendum.
The government is considering the possibility of holding all Provincial Council elections on one day and all Local Government elections on another day.
