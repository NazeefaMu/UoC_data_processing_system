Silvermill wins Presidential Export Awards for third consecutive year

Silvermill Group of Companies won two presidential export awards at anevent held on September 14. Organized by Export Development Board of Sri Lanka, President Maithripala Sirisena, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickreme, State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Sanasinghe and State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne were present at the presentation.
S.A.Silva & Sons Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, the market leader in manufacture and export of desiccated coconut won the award as the Highest Foreign Exchange Earner for 2016 in the coconut kernel export sector.
This is the third consecutive year the company was awarded this prestigious award. Thereafter, Silvermill Natural Beverages (Pvt) Ltd, who pioneered manufacture of value added coconut water in Tetra packs, was recognized as the Highest Value Added Exporter in the Food and other Beverages sector for 2016. This is the second consecutive year the company won this award.
Silvermill, with its origins dating back to 1920, is one of the oldest coconut companies in the world. The Group has firmly placed Sri Lanka on the world map as a reliable source of high quality coconut products. These achievements were obtained despite several obstacles -a challenging environment of inconsistent raw material (coconut) supplies and high coconut prices verses other competing origins such as the Philippines and Indonesia caused by imposition of excessive import duties on edible oils.
“We wish to thank the dynamic Silvermill Team and our loyal customers without whom we would not have won these prestigious awards for three consecutive years” Suresh Silva, Group CEO and Managing Director at Silvermill said.
