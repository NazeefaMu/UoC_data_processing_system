Cobra drinks up pot of milk brought for pooja

A cobra had slithered into the Kannagi Amman Kovil in Vattapalai, Mullaitivu on the eve of its pooja and gulped down the entire pot of milk readied for the pooja yesterday.
Devotees who had gathered to participate in the pooja had run for their lives after spotting the reptile.
Some poosaris and devotees watching from a safe distance had seen the cobra entering the pot after emptying it and coiling inside it. After about half an hour, it had left the pot and slithered into the nearby thicket.
The poosaris thereafter fetched a fresh pot of milk and conducted the pooja behind schedule with the meager crowd which braved the episode and stayed behind.
