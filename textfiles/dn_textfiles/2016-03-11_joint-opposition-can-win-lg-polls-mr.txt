Joint opposition can win LG polls: MR

 
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Monday said that the joint opposition can ensure victory at the forthcoming Local Government election as they are contesting from anti-UNP faction.
Rajapaksa was addressing a meeting at Rathupaswala, Weliveriya.
The meeting was organised by Gampaha Pradeshiya Sabha former chairman Ranjith Gunawardana.
Rajapaksa said the people are aware of the activities of the government. It came to power giving various promises to the people.
"In the election manifesto, they promised to buy paddy from farmers at Rs. 50 per kilo, and to increase the public servants' salary by Rs. 10,000 and to distribute a bag fertiliser at Rs 350.
"They even promised relief for schoolchildren. The government has failed to implement these," he said.
A kilo of paddy is bought by the government at Rs. 16 and 18. The price of paddy has come down. But, the price of rice has gone up, he said.
During our tenure, the economy was stable, unemployment rate was low. The pockets of people were filled with money. But after January 9, the situation changed, he said.
"It is our responsibility to stop imports of food items and increase local products. We need not strengthen the farmers of foreign countries. We should strengthen our farmers providing facilities," he said.
"We stand for the people under any circumstances. We don't hesitate even to agitate in Parliament whenever anti-public Bill is submitted. Honest people's representatives don't raise their hands in support of any Bill that harms the people. The government doesn't adhere to Bandaranayaka principles, he said.
Rajapaksa reiterated that the UNP will never change its principles.
