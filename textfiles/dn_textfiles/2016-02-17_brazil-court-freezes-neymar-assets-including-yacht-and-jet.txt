Brazil court freezes Neymar assets, including yacht and jet

SAO PAULO: Brazilian authorities have blocked assets of Barcelona star Neymar, including a yacht, a jet and several properties worth almost USD 50 million.
A Sao Paulo federal court rejected an appeal from the Brazilian striker last week and started issuing warrants to freeze the assets worth 192 million reals (almost $50 million), Brazilian media reported on Monday.
Last year, Neymar, his family and related businesses were found guilty of evading 63 million reals in taxes (almost USD 16 million) between 2011 and 2013 when he was playing for Brazilian club Santos. He has denied any wrongdoing.
The 23-year-old Neymar used the jet to travel to Brazil for World Cup qualifying matches and holidays.
Iagaro Jung Martins, an auditor with Brazil's federal tax agency, told that Neymar isn't likely to go to jail if he pays what regulators say he owes.
