Post flood damage assessment sent to IMF, WB: PM

The reports on post-damage assessment and economic impact of the recent floods and landslides have been sent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) seeking their support, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was making a statement in Parliament yesterday in reply to a question by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
The Prime Minister said the Central Bank compiled a report on economic impact of the recent natural disasters while the National Planning Department compiled an assessment report on the damages caused by them.
“These have been forwarded to the IMF, WB and other international organizations. We hope to discuss with them on the aids and assistance we can get,” the PM said.
He pointed out the main challenge before the Government is to confront the natural disasters without losing the current pace of economic growth.
The Prime Minister said the Government has done its best to provide relief and assistance to the people affected by prolonged dry spell, floods and landslides and to curb the spread of dengue epidemic.
“The payment of compensation on property damages and agricultural crop damages would be expedited,” the Premier said.
Commenting on the dengue epidemic, the Prime Minister said the Government has taken all measures possible to bring the situation under control.
Replying to a proposal by MP Gunawardena to set up a Standing Committee in Parliament to monitor disaster management activities and advice the Government on them, the Premier said the proposal could be discussed at the next Party Leaders’ Meeting.
