Summons out on Namal for money laundering case

 
The Colombo High Court issued summons on five persons today, including Hambantota district Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa to appear before Court on June 6 for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.30 million through Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited, in 2012.  
Colombo High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe made this order for the purpose of serving indictment against the accused on next calling date.
The Attorney General filed indictments against Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Karunajeewa, Sujani Bogollagama, Iresha Silva and Senani Samaranayake under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.30 million in a company (Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited) owned by Namal Rajapaksa.
It was reported that Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited of Colombo 05, is providing coordinating services to Sri Lankan Airlines.
 The FCID had initiated investigations into this matter following a complaint made by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.
 Samarasinghe alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa has bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited while being a MP, from the Rs.125 million he earned through illegal means.
