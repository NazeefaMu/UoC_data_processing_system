National Freedom Front Leader Wimal Weerawansa has ended his nine-day hunger strike, Parliamentarian Jayantha Samaraweera confirmed today.
Weerawansa is currently being treated in the National Hospital after being transferred from the Prison Hospital yesterday.
He launched his strike in protest of the rejection of his bail application by the Colombo High Court.
He is in custody for causing the government a loss of Rs. 91 million by misusing state-owned vehicles.
