SLI revamps brand identity

Sri Lanka Insurance (SLI) yesterday announced the changing of its corporate identity to coincide with the organization’s three-year plan to improve processes and introduce products and features that address the needs of the modern consumer.
Sri Lanka Insurance’s new corporate logo is fresh and modern, highlighting the brand’s position as a strong dynamic leader who is relevant and focused on adapting to the changing needs of customers.
Sri Lanka Insurance is moving forward and adapting to times of change; the company is well-versed with the changing habits of its customers and keeping up with game-changing new technologies and products that include a total Life solution that caters to every stage of a person’s life cycle with ten Life Insurance policies to choose from. The company has also launched the only diabetic policy called Comprehensive D+, which gives a growing diabetic population in the country a sense of relief. Other additions to the life basket include the Rs.10 million Cashless Medical Card which allows customers to make payments with their Cashless Medical Card, without having the hassle or the worry of having to pay upfront across all hospitals in the island.
Sri Lanka Insurance has also expanded and revamped its Retirement Scheme ensuring pensioners get the highest returns on their pension plans.
Showcasing strength and stability with the recently affirmed AA+ (lka) rating from Fitch Rating, Sri Lanka Insurance is led by a dynamic group of individuals, from the appointment of industry specialists to its corporate management team, to a team of over 2,500 members that have extensive knowledge in every aspect of insurance and are spread over a 148 branch network across the island, which is set to expand further, ensuring convenience to the customer.
It has also invested significantly to improve IT infrastructure so that processes can be made more efficient.
