[Parliament]-12.12.2015

 
Twenty five pc LG elected representation to comprise of women - Prime Minister
Sandasen Marasinghe, Irangika Range and Ishara Mudugamuwa
Twenty five percent of all elected representatives of Local Government institutions would comprise of women under whatever system the polls is held, assured Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He said the motion related to this move would be presented in Parliament in January next year.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made these observations after he informed the House that the Gazette Notification for amendments with regard to the 25 percent women representation was to be issued later in the day (yesterday). He said the change would bring in laws to make political parties nominate 25 percent of women candidates to a local body.
He made this observation yesterday when opposition members, including Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and MP Dinesh Gunawardena inquired whether women representation was to be increased to 25 as a proportionate of the nominees or the members elected. They questioned so following Premier's statement on this matter.
The Premier in his response said the proportionate of elected women could range from 25 percent to 100 percent, while the men's maximum representation could be 75 percent.
However, Dissanayake said that it would be impossible to nominate 25 percent woman candidates under a ward system. He said a system of women only wards would have to be introduced to make 25 percent women representation a reality.
Premier Wickremesinghe stated that issues related to the system would be discussed at discussions to be held in Pelawatta yesterday (Friday).
MP Dinesh Gunawardena stated that such matters have to be debated in Parliament not at Pelawatta to which the Premier stated that it was discussed there as the Local Government Ministry is located there.
Premier Wickremesinghe commencing his statement said that the Cabinet of Ministers approved the increasing of women representation at the local government institutions to 25 percent.
"The women in the South Asian region join politics with family influences and it is some what impossible for others due to various factors such as social, economic and political," the Premier said. "But Sri Lanka which could produce the first woman prime minister as well as the first executive president, beats other countries in the region on this aspect."
He added that the UNP was interested in increasing women representation in politics. He added that former Parliamentarian Rosy Senanayake and Sudarshani Fernandopulle from the Woman Parliamentarians Association have worked hard on this issue.
"We promised to increase women representation at the last Presidential election," the Premier said. "So we have included the same in our programme to develop a new country within a period of 60 months. Now we have been able to accomplish the same," he said.
He said that the move would be discussed with party leaders in future and moved in Parliament in January. He requested all the members to support the move.
 
Former minister has no right to talk of ethics - Mangala
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said in Parliament yesterday, that a leading minister of the former government which destroyed the moral values of this nation for ten years, was today speaking about ethics and values and their talks are similar to a prostitute of a brothel praising virginity.
There had been many occasions where MPs have been fighting each other in the past. "We have instances of MPs resorting to fisticuffs, but it is the first time in the history of our Parliament where a MP was hit while he was speaking. We should take some disciplinary action against them. There are some ghosts of the Rajapaksa regime still haunting this Parliament. I apologize for the mishap that had taken place this morning because Foreign Ministry officials were not present in the official box during the time of the debate of the Foreign Ministry. I thought that the debate on the Foreign Ministry would commence at 1.30 p.m. and I asked the officials to be in Parliament at 1.30 p.m. I made a mistake and I do apologize for it. However, I will answer all questions raised by all members who participated in the debate in the morning, by going through the Hanzard report.
Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said a pension scheme for migrant workers would be implemented from January next year.
Special welfare scheme too would also be established for their families shortly, she said.
 
'Programme to minimize number of domestic workers travelling abroad'
Minister of Women and Child Affairs Chandrani Bandara said in Parliament yesterday, that there would be a programme at provincial level to minimize the number going overseas as domestic workers.
The minister made these observations joining the Committee Stage debate on Budget 2016, under financial heads of the Ministry of Foreign Employment.
At present, the percentage of women going abroad as domestic workers had dropped. Many social and family problems had been created as a result of women migration for domestic work.
When a woman returns to her motherland, of most occasions, she has to face terrible situations in her home, such as a husband's erratic behaviour, addiction to drugs, womanising, smuggling, children's erratic behaviour and love affairs at a very young age, drop in education, addicted to drugs, raped and being abandoned by their guardians.
New laws were brought banning women having children less than five years of age from going abroad as domestic workers.
Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P Perera said a systematic plan should be formulated to minimize migration of women for domestic work within the next five years.
Jobs as housemaids are not suitable for Sri Lankan women and it is a black mark on our dignity, the Deputy Minister Ajith Perera said.
 
Members walk out over foreign ministry financial head
Joint opposition members led by MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday, walked out of the House expressing their displeasure over the objection of the financial head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena joining the Committee Stage debate of the Budget under the financial heads of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, stated the the joint opposition would walk out of the House in objection of the financial head. He made this statement just before the speech of Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera commenced.
However, this incident took place following the sittings after the commotion in sequel to UNP MP Mujuber's speech.
The members were seen walking out of the House
 
'All ports maintained with Colombo Port earnings'
Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunge told Parliament yesterday, that all our ports are being maintained with the income earned from the Colombo Port.
He made this observation in Parliament in response to a question for oral answers raised by UNP Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana.
The Oluvil and Hambantota Ports are running at a great loss. We have cut down on all unnecessary costs at these ports. All the ports were filled with political appointees and we had to bear up extra expenses due to this reason.
We are now discussing several new projects for the Oluvil harbour and If they prove successful, there will be no financial problems.
 
'Foreign policy lost professionalism due to political interference'
Deputy Minister of Parliamentary Reforms & Mass Media Karunarathna Paranawithana said in Parliament yesterday, that the Foreign Affairs Ministry was enjoying greater freedom since the January 8th revolution.
During the previous regime, Sri Lanka's foreign policy had gradually lost its diplomatic professionalism, largely due to party political interferences and appointment of too many politicians, and henchmen of government leaders as high commissioners or ambassadors to important countries.
Sri Lanka's foreign policy had been messed up and muddled to such an extent during the previous regime, that we had to face the biggest international diplomatic crisis. Today, a conducive environment had been created at the Ministry, enabling employees to work freely without political interference.
During that period, many countries were hostile to Sri Lanka as a result of our belligerent attitude towards them. Today, several countries who were opposed to us earlier, have now supported our position.
We have initiated a process of national reconciliation. We will be having a domestic mechanism to probe accountability issues and march towards reconciliation.
There is no threat to national security, but communalism is in danger. We request Foreign Ministry officials to educate the international community of our reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa said that this is not a Asia-centered foreign policy pledged by President Maithripla Sirisena, but a Western-centered policy.
The Geneva Resolution are the causes to threats to our unitary states and the integration and it has not been approved by the Cabinet or Parliament.
 
Geetha bats for Lankan woman
Opposition UPFA member Geetha Kumarasinghe was involved in a cross talk with another member during her speech when the latter interrupted her.
Geetha Kumarasinghe said that measures should be taken to free the Sri Lankan woman who is sentenced death in Saudi Arabia, referring to the modus operendi followed by the Indian Government in a similar situation.
"India's late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said the Indian Government would imprison 100 Saudi Arabians working in India if the Indian woman would not be freed," Geetha Kumarasinghe said. "She also said that steps should be taken to stop Sri Lankan women going abroad for employment."
At this stage, a member was heard querying on the mike if this could be applied to us as there are around 500,000 women employed in Saudi Arabia. "You should keep quiet as a male member. I am speaking here on behalf of the Sri Lankan women. Only women are stoned in Saudi Arabia," Kumarasinghe said. "Men are not stoned there. I am representing the women, you keep quiet and resume your seat."
However, her allotted time had expired and she had to wind up her speech.
 
Country gained positive Int'l recognition - Mahinda Samarasinghe
Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Mahinda Samarasinghe told Parliament yesterday, that our country had gained positive recognition among the international community and we should make use of it to become an active member of the international community.
We have come back on to the right track again.
This situation has changed with the acceptance of our President by the international community.
There was much lsupport from the international community. Resolutions were brought against us in international forums.
Today this situation has changed. We should stand up as a nation that protects human rights.
 
Three months leave approved for Lands Minister Gunawardena
Lands Minister M K A D S Gunawardena was granted leave by Parliament for three months yesterday.

Leave was granted accordingly for three months from December 11.
 
New laws leading to banning of hate speech, communal violence presented to Parliament
Chief Government Whip Minister Gayantha Karunathilake yesterday, presented to Parliament new laws that would lead to the banning of hate speech and instigating communal violence.
The Bills titled Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) and Penal Code (Amendment) would be taken up for debate on a future date.
The Bill sought to amend the Penal Code said: "Whoever, by the use of words spoken, written or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representation or otherwise, intends to cause or attempts to instigate acts of violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony, or feelings of ill-will of hostility between communities or different racial or religious groups, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years."
The Bill seeking to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure would make provisions for sentencing two year imprisonment for "causing or instigating acts of violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony or feelings of ill-will or hostility by use of words spoken, written or intended to be read, or by signs, or by visible representation or otherwise."
The person violating the laws would be arrested without a warrant. The offense is bailable and should be referred to a Magistrate's Court, the Draft Bill said.
 
No agreement without Parliament approval - Harsha
Responding to JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said that the President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister or any other authority had not come to any agreement with any country arbitrarily without the approval of Parliament.
He made this response joining in the Committee stage debate on Budget 2016 held yesterday for the 8th allotted day under the financial heads of Foreign Affairs Ministry and Foreign Employment Ministry.
Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said that due to the policies of the present government, Sri Lanka had been refuted by many countries in the world. The foreign policy of the present government is "Friendship Towards All." Through this policy, we are hoping to deal with all countries in the world in a friendly manner.
The Deputy Minister also stressed that nobody had maintained international relations by-passing the Foreign Ministry.
Budget 2016 had allocated Rs. 9,469 million for the Foreign Ministry. Only Rs.1,375 million from that amount is used for local expenses and Rs. 8,097 million allocated for Embassies, High Commissions and foreign missions to improve the country's image in the international arena.
Though the previous government had spent millions of money by even getting additional funds from the Treasury apart from budget allocations, they had not succeeded in improving the country's negative image. It turned worse day by day.
The combination of the country's foreign policy and its economic policy to get the maximum use of international market opportunities to increase the country's GDP and uplift the living standards of people, is the main challenge that we are facing today. To do that, we are following the policy of economic diplomacy.
"As the first step to economic diplomacy, we motivated foreign missions to make the international community aware of the country's real situation. Discussions are currently on with regard to the GSP plus. We hope that we would be able to regain the GSP plus concessions by 2016." the Deputy Minister said.
