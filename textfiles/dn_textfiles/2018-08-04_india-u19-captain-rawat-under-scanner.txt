For playing in unsanctioned league in Mauritius
India U19 captain Rawat under scanner

Delhi’s wicketkeeper-batsman Anuj Rawat, who recently captained India U-19 in four-day matches in Sri Lanka, is under the scanner for playing an unsanctioned T20 league in Mauritius last year along with a host of Pakistani cricketers.
The tournament was held in June last year and Anuj played in it alongside some lesser-known first-class players like Asad Pathan.
Normally for playing in leagues in UK or Bangladesh, a cricketer needs (No Objection Certificate) NOC from BCCI to apply for visa.
However, for travelling to Mauritius, Indian nationals don’t need a visa if the intended stay is for not more than 60 days.
Anuj, who is currently playing a one day series against Sri Lanka colts, appeared to have not procured any NOC from the BCCI to play in the unsanctioned tournament.
Former England international Owais Shah also played the tournament.
Acting BCCI secretary Amitabh Chaudhary was shocked to know that some players have played in the unsanctioned tournament.
“The age group players are educated by BCCI at the national level. This is very unfortunate if junior players have gone ahead and played unsanctioned tournament. This needs to be looked into seriously,” Choudhary said.
