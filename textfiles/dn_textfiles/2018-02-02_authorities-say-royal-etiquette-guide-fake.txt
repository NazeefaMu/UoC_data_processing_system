Authorities say Royal etiquette guide is fake

 
The Foreign Affairs Ministry and the British High Commission said today that a document circulating on social media, giving advice on how to interact with the visiting British Royal family, is fake.
The one-page guide, is written in Sinhala, appears to be authored by a group called the “Welcome Committee of British Royals.”
But in a joint media statement, the Foreign Ministry and High Commission said the pamphlet was “not genuine,” and that no such committee had been set up.
The document contains of a list of guidelines for interacting with the visiting Earl and Countess of Wessex, who are visiting for the country’s 70th anniversary of Independence.
When meeting them, men should “bow down,” and women should always “curtsy,” the document says.
It also says never to turn your back on a member of the royal family, not to look directly into their eyes, and not to take pictures with them.
Anyone who does not follow “royal greeting etiquette” could face legal action, it says.
“Don’t forget that they were the last royals to rule Sri Lanka, so you have to be respectful to them,” the document concludes.
