Premakeerthi de Alwis
Versatile lyricist
Premakeerthi de Alwis was murdered on August 1, 1989. He was popularly known as Prem. He was a gifted lyricist, announcer and a poet who enriched the print and electronic media with his creations.
Prem had his pleasant and unpleasant memories while serving the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). He was politically victimised on many occasions. Prem had provided a yeoman service as a lyricist and radio announcer. He had produced beautiful poetic creations and programmes for radio and television. Among them Sarisara, Shanida Saadaya and Anduna were outstanding programmes.
Prem because popular among listeners within a very short period. He wrote his first lyrics in 1969. It was Hada Puda Asune Senehasa Bandune, which was sung by Rupa Indumathi and Malkanthi Nandasiri.
Prem wrote his first cinema song for the film Lokuma Hinawa directed by K. A. W. Perera. It was the era when Sinhala songs were influenced by Hindi tunes. It was Karunaratne Abesekera who wrote Sinhala versions of Hindi songs. Karu was the Prem’s mentor at that time. Some of the young composers condemned Karu for writing lyrics according to Hindi tunes. But later, those who condemned Karu and Hindi tunes also followed his footsteps and began to compose songs according to Hindi tunes.
Prem introduced a new style of writing lyrics, without copying Hindi tunes. For example, Eda Re Guwan Thotupaledhee and Aadaraneeya Neranjana. He masterfully used the Sinhala language and his literary prowess. His elegant and lively style of writing, attracted a large audience.
Prem’s songs can be separated into three categories: Romantic, religious and satirical. Ama Dahara Diya Galaa Galaa, Devram Vehere are some of the popular songs composed by him.
Prem revolutionised comedic songs. He chose Freddie Silva, who was a talented comedian and artiste in Sinhala cinema, to propagate his life experiences among the people. Aaron Mama, Onna Babo Billo Enawa and Rukada Balla are some of the satirical songs composed by Prem.
Prem skilfully utilised words for writing lyrics for romantic songs. Obe Dethol Pethi Lihee, Thalawe Wali Thalawe, Tani Tharuwe, Edhanden Piya Maninu Epa, Me Nagaraya Maa Oba Muna gasunu Nagarayay and Kurullanta Gee Gayanna occupy a prominent place among his romantic creations; they are immortal. They will live in the hearts of music lovers forever.
A great personality lived within a small-made body, Prem was gunned down by unknown gunmen nearly three decades ago. He was a humanist in every sense of the word and saw the realistic world in a different angle. It is the secret for the novelty in his poetic creations.
The untimely death of this celebrated lyricist and poet titillated the musical taste buds of music lovers for decades.

From Dennis to Chrissie; until we meet again
I met you many years ago, at a picnic you were present
When I saw you, my heart panged,
Little did I realise that it was the start of a long journey
I walked up to you to see you smiling
You looked at me with mischievous eyes
And handed me a cup of tea,
This was the first of the many cups you would hand me, my love
It took me time to realise that the pang was love; my first love
It was my greatest joy to hear you say “Dennis, I loved you at first sight”
But our romance was taboo; many sought to break us
It was then that we realised; our bond would never die
When they would not compromise, we left to face the world together
When you left them, Chrissie, you were crying
But never did you look back, my love
Your pain would not die, for you lost so much
But we both proved to be strong, together we withstood the storm
With the passing of time, they did accept us
All united and happy; love stood triumphant
My mother, Ann, met us at the door; she listened and gave her blessing The only woman I had loved before was my mother
On May 15, Chrissie, you became my wife; we were so happy
Five children did we have and we were complete
With our little bundles of joy growing up until that accident
Did shatter our lives; we lost Ruvani, our youngest
Yet the years that followed grew better
Until Chrissie left us years later
Now they are among the stars together
My Chrissie did you not promise me,
That one day, we would die together?
I had made all plans to be with you, but now lie alone in the darkness
Then God performed a miracle when our three children did step in
With all their love, the darkness abated
At times, I sit amidst the shadows and close my eyes
And there you are by my side again, laughing and talking
Like the time we first met, as if you had never left
I will be joining you soon, Chrissie
And this time, my darling,
We will never part.
Dr. Dennis Aloysius, Past President, SLMA

Vidwan Vaidyanathan
A devout Hindu
The recent demise of Vidwan Vasantha Vaidyanathan hurts the minds of Hindus immensely. She was a valuable asset to Hinduism who devoted her time and energy for the uplifting of the religion.
Most of us who are middle-aged and elderly, used to eagerly wait to listen to and watch her speeches over the radio and TV as it helped raise our spirits.
During a time in which western values have become more prominent; where people lack spirituality and worship money and materialistic objects, the service rendered by Vidwan Vaidyanathan cannot be erased from our hearts. She stands tall among us.
K. Somaskandamurthy, Batticaloa
