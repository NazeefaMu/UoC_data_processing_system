WETTIMUNYS – Role models in Cricket’s Folk Lore

CRICKET it is said is a gentlemen’s game. And three outstanding brothers who played the game in that spirit were the WETTIMUNYS – MITHRA, SUNIL and SIDATH. They were role models.
Today when winning is what matters with all the niceties of the game thrown to the winds if not the wilds or hit beyond the boundary with money being the pivot, its hard to find top cricketers who dedicate themselves totally to the core values of and traditions of the game. .
The WETIMUNYS while playing to win, did so with grace and dignity, never forgetting the golden adage that it is not the winning or losing that matters, but how one played the game.
Getting to know the father
As a cricket writer in the then ‘DAILY MIRROR’ and ‘TIMES’, and during my playing days, I played against SUNIL and SIDATH in competitive cricket and had the good fortune of getting to know their beloved father RAMSAY who was a former Sinhalese Sports Club cricketer and from whose genes flowed cricket that ran in the WETTIMUNY brothers --in every nerve, sinew and muscle. He was an Engineer. RAMSAY'S Fair Lady was INDRANI.
There were five brothers in the family, but it was SUNIL, MITHRA and SIDATH who took the game seriously and blossomed and broke out to make waves in the game, administration and being the pride of the school Ananda College which school SUNIL captained.
He later steered the Sinhalese Sports Club to win the Sara Trophy on many occasions and then played for the country. The WETTIMUNY brothers ranked with the three great Australian cricketing brothers Ian, Greg and Trevor Chappell.
Cricket fanatic
RAMSAY their father was a cricket fanatic. And what he did not know of the game and its history was not worth knowing. He was a likeable character, simple, unassuming and always accommodating and who one had to have the good fortune of meeting, knowing and forming a friendship. It was sad that he did not live long to savor the feats of his sons.
The father realizing the cricketing talent in the three right handed cricketing brothers and to further encourage them, he built the first indoor cricket net at the Health Department that still stands as a memory to him.
He saw to it that the sons got the best coaches, one among them being the legendary BERTIE WIJESINHA to show them the nuances of the game and they continued the game with great reverence, dedication and determination. The Sri Lanka cap their ultimate goal.
Punishing batsman
SUNIL, at school was not only a stylish and punishing batsman scoring heavily, but also a wicket keeper of class. But he chose to shed his gloves and took to concentrating on his batting that took him to the top and showing his ability also as a safe fielder.
To SUNIL went the honour of scoring the country’s first half century when he made a stubborn unbeaten 53 before retiring hurt, felled by a Jeff Thomson ankle crushing delivery in the World Cup one-day game against Australia in 1975.
In 1979 he scored a stylish 84 against the West Indies led by Alvin Kallicharan in a Unofficial Test at the Sara Oval facing venomous pace bowers in Malcolm ‘Black Bomber’ Marshall, Sylvester Clarke and Norbert Philips.
Life threatening
Playing in a one-day game at the SSC after making a gutty 28, he failed to duck a life threatening bouncer from Marshall bowling at terrific pace and was struck on the head.
He was wriggling and was carried off and to hospital where he miraculously recovered. SUNIL had what it takes to be the first captain of Sri Lanka after attaining Test status, but he chose right in becoming a pilot.
SIDAT made the first ever three figure score in Test cricket when he made a big, elegant and determined 157 against Pakistan in the Third Test in Faisalabad in 1982.
Vivid in my memory
This was Sri Lanka’s first tour after being admitted to the big league. I was the first journalist to tour with the team and had the fortune of covering the series for the ‘Daily Mirror’, ‘Times’ and ‘Sunday Times’. That record setting innings by SIDAT is still vivid in my memory.
But SIDATH rocked the cricket world when he became the first Sri Lankan batsman to score a century at the home of cricket Lord’s. He batted in the style of a Lord, lording over the England bowlers at Lord’s.
That knock forced cricket writers there to tag him ‘LORD SID’ a tag he richly deserved. That he missed making a double hundred by just 10 runs was a travesty of justice. But that’s how the game goes.
Inaugural Test at Lord’s
That was Sri Lanka’s Inaugural Test at Lord’s and after that magnificent innings he also became the first Sri Lankan to be honoured by the bible of cricket ‘WISDEN’ and being chosen as ‘WISDEN'S cricketer of the year’ in 1985.
In that Test where the Lankans made the Lords at Lord’s stand up and take notice of the country’s cricketing prowess, dusky Duleep Mendis and wicket keeper/opening batsman south paw Amal Silva also scored memorable centuries.
SIDATH played in 23 Test matches, scored 1221 runs, with a highest score of 190. He made two hundred and 6 scores of 50. He played in 35 ODIS making 786 runs with a highest score of 86 not out. He made his Tet debut vs England at the P. Sara Oval in 1982.
Last Test vs India
His last Test was against India at Calcutta in 1987.ODI debut against England at SSC in 1982 and played his final ODI vs India in Mumbai in 1987. He was a member of the inaugural Test team.
SIDATH after quitting the game had a stint as match referee when New Zealand plated Zimbabwe in a Test in Harare in 1997. He was also a selector and the crown in his jewels was when he headed a cricket Interim Committee.
The Wettimunys also had the distinction of giving to the country two brothers MITHRA and SIDAT opening batting. This rare feat unfolded in New Zealand in two Tests against the Kiwis in 1983. Pity that MITHRA could not further motor in the game.
The brothers three SUNIL, MITHRA and SIDATH were role models, sleek and shining much like the Rolls Royce limousines and were loved, respected and admired by everyone and they were gentlemen to the very core. A clan like the WETTIMUNYS enter our cricketing folk lore as each of them is a legend in his own right.
