FR against Htota Framework Agreement fixed for support

The Fundamental Rights petition filed by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara seeking an order to quash the Framework Agreement entered into by the Government of Sri Lanka with two Chinese companies was yesterday fixed for support on February 13 by the Supreme Court.
When the petition was taken up before Chief Justice K. Sripavan and Justice Anil Goonaratne, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appearing for the Sri Lanka Port Authority informed Court that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) pertaining to the Hambantota harbour had been signed in 2012.
“The original MOU was signed in 2012. This is a continuous and uninterrupted process from 2012. The petitioner has concealed this fact through his petition and he was a member of Cabinet at the time of cabinet paper was presented,”Rajaratnam added.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court directed the Secretary to the Ministry of Ports and Shipping that a copy of MOU signed in 2012 be submitted in Court on next support date.
The petitioner cited members of the Cabinet of Ministers, members of the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (referred to as the CANC and also sometimes referred to as the Committee of Secretaries), the Director General of the Department of External Resources of the Ministry of National Polices and Economic Affairs, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited and China Communications Constructions Company as respondents.
The Petitioner states that this petition relates inter alia to the infringement and imminent infringement and continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution, by the arbitrary, capricious, mala fide and illegal and unlawful decision of the respondents to enter into an agreement with the People’s Republic of China for the promotion of investment in Sri Lanka by Chinese investors and lease and convey and enter into an agreement or in any other manner dispose approximately 15,000 acres of land and/or 50 Square Kilometers.
The petitioner further sought a Declaration that the Framework Agreement dated 08.12.2016 as null and void, and declare that the said agreement has no force of law until the same is approved by Parliament, as required by Article 157 of the Constitution.
President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva with Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the petitioner.
