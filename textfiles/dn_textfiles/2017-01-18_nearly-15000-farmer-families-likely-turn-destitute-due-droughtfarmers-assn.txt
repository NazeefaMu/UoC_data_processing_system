Nearly 15,000 farmer families likely to turn destitute due to drought:Farmers' Assn.

Out of a total of 7,400 acres of paddy land that had been cultivated during this season under the Bathalgoda Irrigation scheme in Ibbagamwua, nearly 40 day old paddy plants in about 6,500 acres had dried up and withered due to lack of water, said Bathalagoda Farmers' Association Chairman A.R. Herath Banda. He said that the lands were cultivated for the Maha season by using the slight showers experienced earlier, expecting more showers later on, but a dry spell had set in dashing their hopes of water from the Batalagoda wewa which was sufficient to for only about 600 acres of paddy.
He also said that nearly 10,000 acres of paddy cultivated in Hiriyala by using the little rain water and small irrigation water had also faced imminent danger due to the drought. In Hiriyala alone, more than 15,000 farmer families are likely to become destitute if their cultivations were destroyed.
