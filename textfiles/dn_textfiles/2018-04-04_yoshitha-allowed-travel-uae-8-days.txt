Yoshitha allowed travel to UAE for 8 days

Yoshitha Rajapaksa, the second son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose passport was impounded by Court as part of the Magisterial inquiry over alleged money laundering at Carlton Sports Network (CSN), was yesterday permitted to travel abroad for a period of eight days by the Colombo High Court.
While permitting Yoshitha Rajapaksa to travel to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Colombo High Court Judge A. A. R. Heiyantuduwa ordered the Kaduwela Magistrate’s Court to temporarily release his passport.
Yoshitha Rajapaksa, through his Counsel, had sought an order from the Colombo High Court to temporary lift his travel ban.
Filing a motion before the Colombo High Court, President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing on behalf of Yoshitha Rajapaksa, had informed Court that his client was expecting to leave to the UAE between April 4 and April 12 to attend a function organized by a Sri Lankan organization.
Meanwhile, the Attorney General did not raise objections to the request. On March 14, 2016, four suspects including Yoshitha Rajapaksa, Nishantha Ranatunga and Rohan Weliwita were remanded over the alleged money laundering case. They are currently out on bail.
