Bangladesh head coach, Chandika Hathurusingha has extended his contract as the head coach of the Bangladesh national cricket team until 2019. The decision was made at a meeting of the board members of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Sunday.

Hathurusingha has been the head coach of The Tigers since July 2014 and has been instrumental in the rise of the national team's recent performances, especially in limited-overs cricket. During the meeting, it was also decided that the former Sri Lankan player will also be a part of the six-man selection committee.

The six-man committee includes the likes of former Bangladesh player and current Bangladesh team manager, Khaled Mahmud and BCB's cricket operations committee chairman, Akram Khan. Ruwan Kalpage, Richard Halsall and Mario Villavarayan have also been retained as the assistant coach, fielding coach and fitness and conditioning coach respectively.
