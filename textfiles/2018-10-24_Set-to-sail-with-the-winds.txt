There is a minor party leader in yahapalanaya whom one may immediately remember whenever the word, “Vilpattu’ is mentioned.

 


The man is reportedly going around these days singing praises of the former strongman, whom he ditched on time to join yahapalanaya.


The politico is said to be highly worried these days over numerous forces getting arrayed against him posing a serious threat to his political career.  


He had been pouring out his woes to the yahapalanaya high-ups, but to his grief, none of them had made any positive response so far, they say.


Meanwhile, the former strongman’s close ones finding the politico a worthy catch are said to be planning to hook him. The man is getting frequent telephone calls from them these days to commiserate with him over his predicament, they say.
