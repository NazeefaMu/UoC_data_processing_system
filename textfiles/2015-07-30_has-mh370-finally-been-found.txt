Video: Has MH370 finally been found?


	


	Air crash investigators have 'a high degree of confidence' that a piece of wreckage found on the Indian Ocean island of La Reunion is from a Boeing 777 - the same model as the doomed MH370 which disappeared in March 2014.
	Since the Boeing 777 was introduced in 1994, there have been five incidents - including MH370 -  which have led to the destruction of the aircraft. MH370 is the only aircraft of its type which has vanished over the sea.
	Investigators will need to examine closely the wreckage to link it to MH370, but it was the only aircraft of its type lost over water. (dailymail)
