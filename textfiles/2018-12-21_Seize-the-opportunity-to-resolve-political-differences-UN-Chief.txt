UN Secretary-General António Guterres yesterday called on all political actors in Sri Lanka to seize the opportunity of the appointment of the new Cabinet to resolve outstanding political differences.

“I welcome the resolution of the political crisis in Sri Lanka through peaceful, constitutional means, and applaud the resilience of the country’s democratic institutions. Outstanding political differences should be resolved in the same spirit of respect for democracy and in the interest of the people of Sri Lanka,” he said in a statement.
