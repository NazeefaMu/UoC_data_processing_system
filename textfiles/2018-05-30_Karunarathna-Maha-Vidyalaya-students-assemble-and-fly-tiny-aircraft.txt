It is a matter for pleasure that Karunarathna Maha Vidyalaya in Mattumagala is ready to produce a set of talented and innovative children whose service would be beneficial to the the country in the near future. The best example set by this school is that two of its children have assembled a tiny aircraft which can fly over 6000 feet from the ground level.   

It is the principal of this school, K.A. Nijamalee Palika who had paved the way to achieve this success with her guidance and advice. Dhananja Waidyasekera, the teacher-in-charge of the ‘technology subject’ had given every support to these two children to keep pace with the scientific and technological aspects of the world. In addition, they have been encouraged by the class teacher Aruna Warnakumara.   

The credit should go to the two children: Vimukthi Lakshan and Sadev Mihisara who have invented it while studying in grades 13 and 11 respectively. This is how Vimukthi expressed his views about their new invention:   


I began to look for the parts and accessories to assemble a toy aircraft. I got them down through using on-line facilities and assembled an aircraft with the help of my fellow schoolmate Sadev Mihisara. It was amidst the applause by our school children, we flew the aircraft in the air. Then, our joys knew no bounds


“After finishing my O/Level examination, I was watching the taking off of aircraft and the methodology of assembling them in the internet while I was at home. Then, I was toying with the idea of assembling aircraft and flying them. My father is a driver. He did not have any knowledge about technology but kept encouraging me. Further, I began to look for the parts and accessories which were required for assembling a toy aircraft. I got them down through using on-line facilities and assembled an aircraft with the help of my fellow schoolmate Sadev Mihisara. It was amidst the applause by our school children, we flew the aircraft in the air. Then, our joys knew no bounds.”   



He added that their parents as well as others have helped them to their maximum extent and to the best of their abilities. According to him, it was their dream to become engineers in the field of aviation technology.   

Vimukthi Lakshan and Sadev Mihisara thanked their teachers whole-heatedly for having helped them in numerous ways. In the meantime, he is happy to share the knowledge which he had gained with his fellow schoolmates with a view to producing intelligent citizens.
