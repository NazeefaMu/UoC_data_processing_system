TNA seeks right to self determination


	

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader R. Sampanthan, at his meeting with visiting UN Secretary General (UNSG) Ban Ki-moon, is reported to have stressed the need for the ongoing constitutional process to open avenues for a political solution while recognizing the 'right to self-determination’.

The Opposition Leader had requested the UN to influence the government to deliver on this should the process be delayed because the failure to work out a political solution to the national question would have serious implications for the country.

According to sources, Mr. Sampanthan had said the North and East would be ungovernable by democratic means in the absence of an acceptable political solution.

He underscored the fact that the TNA had no intention of dividing the country. (KB)
