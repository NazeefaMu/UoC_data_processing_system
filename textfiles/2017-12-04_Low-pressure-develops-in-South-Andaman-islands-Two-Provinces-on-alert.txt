Meteorology Department yesterday issued a warning to the public especially to the navel and fishing communities in Northern and Eastern Provinces to remain alert on a possible low pressure area possibly impact the country.

According to the Special Weather bulletin issued 2230 hours it said the low pressure area in the South Andaman Islands was located nearly 1350km away from the country and is likely to develop in to a depression over south-east Bay of Bengal during next 24 hours based on the current updates of the Global Numerical Models forecasts.

“The system is likely to move west-northwestward towards North Tamil Nadu – South Andra Pradesh across the Central Bay of Bengal during next 3-4 days. According to these Global forecasts, this system is likely to move closer to Sri Lanka on 5th and 6th of December,” the report said.

As a result it said the wind condition over the country and surrounding sea areas and the Bay of Bengal sea areas are likely to increase during next few days particularly from Tuesday onwards.

It said the wind speed is expected to increase up to 50-60kmph over the Island particularly Northern and Eastern Provinces while 70-80kmph over the Bay of Bengal and 60-70kmph over the surrounding sea areas of the Island.

Furthermore, the Met believes intermittent showers, strong gusty winds, and rough sea areas would occur over the Bay of Bengal and the sea areas around the Island. Therefore Naval and fishing activities in these sea areas have been announced unsafe.

While speaking to the Daily Mirror the Department Duty Meteorologist said forecast could be changed in accordance with the changes of the atmospheric condition however navel and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant in this regard.

Department of Meteorology is continuously monitoring this system for the latest update. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
