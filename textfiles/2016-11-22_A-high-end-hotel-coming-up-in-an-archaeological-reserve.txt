A high-end hotel coming up in an archaeological reserve


	



 

A high-end hotel is said to be coming up on an archaeological reserve in the Matale district.

 


The approval for the hotel project had been granted during the previous regime. However, no authority concerned appears to know as to who launched the project or approved it. Nevertheless, it has come to light that the construction work is making headway under the direction of a yahapalanaya politico. 
Priceless artifacts of archaeological and historical value are being bulldozed into smithereens in the process of constructing the hotel, informed sources say. 


Intelligence sleuths have now been asked to submit a report on the hotel project and the politico’s involvement in it, they say.
