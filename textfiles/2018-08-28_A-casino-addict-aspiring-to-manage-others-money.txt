A white -collar high-up who has yet to scale a few rungs to reach the top at the main revenue establishment won a fortune at a casino game recently, they say.

 


But the losses he suffered are hardly known.


By the way, this worthy is among the aspirants to the top post in the establishment that has fallen vacant and he is due to appear at an interview to be held shortly in this connection. He is also known to be a buddy of several powerful politicos.


Meanwhile, hoi polloi in the establishment opine in hushed tones that the establishment would go to wrack and ruin if this gamester addicted to gambling, were elevated to the top post.
