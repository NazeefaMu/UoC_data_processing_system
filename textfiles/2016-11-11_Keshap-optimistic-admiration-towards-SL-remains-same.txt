With the election of Republican Candidate Donald Trump as the President of the US, US Ambassador for Sri Lanka Atul Keshap said he hoped the admiration of the new administration towards Sri Lanka would remain the same.  

In a comment to a local radio channel, Mr. Keshap said “I can’t speak for the new administration but I think that the sense of admiration for Sri Lanka will long continue because of the leadership your people have shown,” he said.  

He said the diplomats, security officers and civil servants of the US would continue to follow the lawfully elected authority of the country.  “We look forward to what our president-elect will determine and how he will decide as administration goes,” he said.
