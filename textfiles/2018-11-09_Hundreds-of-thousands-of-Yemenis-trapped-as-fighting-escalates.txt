By Ali Al Mujahed, Sudarsan Raghavan (c) 2018, The Washington Post Nov 08, 2018 -  SANAA, Yemen - Despite U.S. calls for a cease-fire, fighting is escalating in a strategic Yemeni port city, threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians and deepening a humanitarian crisis where millions are already grappling with a possible famine.   


The clashes in Hodeida, pitting a U.S.-backed regional coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against northern Houthi rebels, has led to numerous civilian casualties over the past week, said residents, health workers and aid agencies. The violence is also nearing medical facilities, threatening the safety of patients and essential medical workers.   


The fighting has particularly intensified near Hodeida’s port, through which pass more than 70 percent of all food, fuel medicines and other essential supplies destined for the northern part of the country where large majority of Yemenis live.   


“Hodeida is once again trapped in violence with hundreds of thousands of Yemenis caught in the middle,” said Fabrizio Carboni, a senior official for the International Committee for the Red Cross in a statement Thursday.
