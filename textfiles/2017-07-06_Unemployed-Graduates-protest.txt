Joint Unemployed Graduates' Unions (JUGU) today staged a protest march in front of the Fort Railway Station to Presidential Secretariat demanding solutions for their unemployment. However, the protest march was stopped at the entrance to the Lotus Road. The road between the Ceramic Junction and NSA Roundabout towards Lotus Road up to Galle Face Green was temporarily closed due to the protest march. Pix by Kushan Pathiraja
