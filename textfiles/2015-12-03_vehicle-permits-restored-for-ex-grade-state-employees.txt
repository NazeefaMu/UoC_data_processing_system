Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today that public servants would be given a permit to import a vehicle once in ten years.
Speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget, he said the permits would be issued only twice during their career.
The Prime Minister said it was impossible to give a vehicle permit once in five years considering the traffic congestion on the roads.
He said the government had no option but to introduce a contributory pension scheme for the public sector because the government could no longer afford a handout.
As for MPs the Prime Minister said offices would be provided to all of them at a location close to the parliamentary complex.
He said a budget office would be set up soon by allowing Parliament to acquire the Agriculture Ministry office.
The Prime Minister said the stage was set to introduce the Right to Information Act and several other legislations soon. (Yohan Perera)
