Will support Govt. if it brings proposal to dissolve parliament: JO


	

We would support the Government unconditionally if it comes out with an early proposal to dissolve Parliament, Joint Opposition (JO) said yesterday.

Addressing a news briefing, JO member MP Shehan Semasinghe said the only option left open to the Government was to go for a General Election in order to resolve the prevailing economic crisis.

 “Economy is in a great jeopardy consequent to the continuous deprecation of Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar and poor economic management. The people of this country cannot tolerate anymore. Hence, the Government should go for a Parliamentary Election,” the MP said.

“The Government is attempting to create a picture that deprecation of Sri Lankan rupee is not something unique to Sri Lanka because the other countries are also experiencing deprecation of their own currencies. That’s all rubbish,” he added.

He said Sri Lanka was in a worse situation compared to developing countries like Zimbabwe and Ethiopia.

“The Government should admit its incapability and handover the power to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is well capable of handling the economy in a more efficient manner. Mahinda Rajapaksa has proved that how well he has managed the economy under worse circumstances,” he added.  (Sheain Fernandopulle)
