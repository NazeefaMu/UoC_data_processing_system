	The second phase of the Outer Circular Highway (OCH), the 14.3 Km stretch from Kaduwela to Kadawatha is to be opened for public use on June 20, Project Director Mrs. T. S. H. Abeywickrama said yesterday.
	The construction of the OCH is being carried out in three phases, Phase 1 from Kottawa to Kaduwela was declared open last year, Phase 2, from Kaduwela to Kadawatha; and Phase 3 from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya.
	“The construction is almost completed. Unlike the other expressways, we have taken measures to ensure greater safety. These days, we are trying to complete such work before the deadline,” Mrs. Abewickrama said.
	Meanwhile, she said due to accidents and difficulties people had to face when travelling on the other expressways, measures had been taken to reduce accidents. Accordingly, new technical inclusions and strategies have been used when constructing the second phase of the OCH.
	The building of the second phase commenced in 2012 at an estimated cost of Rs. 49 billion. The four lane expressway will have 3 toll buildings and 6 toll plazas.
	Mrs. Abewickrama said that the authorities have informed that this phase would be opened on June 20 but, some of small scale work is still being carried out. Therefore, she said that the date was not certain.
	According to the Road Development Authority (RDA) plan, the OCH will be developed as a four-lane highway with provision for future expansion to 6-lanes. The design speed of the highway is 100 kmph. (Piyumi Fonseka)
