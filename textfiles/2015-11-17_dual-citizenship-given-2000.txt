	President Maithripala Sirisena said dual citizenship was what most of the Sri Lankan expatriates asked for, whenever he met them during his tours abroad and the government had expedited in accordingly.
	He said this at a ceremony held at Temple Trees to award dual citizenship to 2,000 Sri Lankans this morning.
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the support of Sri Lankan expatriates would be vital in fulfilling the government’s objective of in winning the international support in bringing reconciliation, attracting foreign investors and for the development of the country.
	He said those who were unable to obtain dual citizenship also could support the country’s development as a Diaspora.
	“Get together with us in building up the country we all dream of,” he told the gathering who obtained dual citizenship at the ceremony. (Yohan Perera)
