Four teams from India for 12th Nelson Mendis cricket

Four teams from India will be among the 36 participating for supremacy in the 12th Nelson Mendis Challenge Trophy under-14 limited-over cricket championship that will be worked off from December 10 to 22 at 13 venues around Colombo. The tournament is conducted by the CCC School of Cricket with the main sponsorship of Singer Sri Lanka Ltd.
Considered to be the biggest domestic tournament for this age category, the tournament is very popular not only among local cricket schools and academies but also international cricket academies over the years. The CCC School of Cricket was inaugurated in 1998 and the annual tournament was started in 2004. Since then the school earned a name as a leading institution in fostering junior cricket in Sri Lanka.
The mastermind behind the CCC School of Cricket and the tournament, veteran cricket coach Nelson Mendis said: "This tournament has attracted teams from all parts of the country as well as many foreign teams from Australia, Pakistan, New Zealand and India in previous editions. But unfortunately this year a change of domestic seasons and examinations in those countries have prevented their participation.
"Our institution always aims to uplift the standard of school cricket and this tournament paves a good platform for youngsters to showcase their talents while playing with true spirit of the sport. This will open new doors to make new friendships and learn from each other," he said.
"We are very proud to say that our institution so far has produced cricketers who have gone onto represent Sri Lanka 'A', Sri Lanka U-19 and National teams. Madhuri Samuddhika, Dilshan Munaweera, Kusal Perera, Ramith Rambukwella and Ashan Priyanjan have reached National level while Andrie Berenger who represented UAE in the 2015 World Cup was a member of CCC School of Cricket 'Maroon' team which won the Nelson Mendis Trophy in 2005," Mendis noted.
Piliyandala CA, Kolitha CA Thalawathugoda, Colt CA Colombo, Oval CA Colombo, NCC CA Colombo, SA CA Moratuwa, Mighty CA Colombo, Great CA Moneragala, Athula Akkarawita Cricket Training Centre Kotte will mark their debut while teams from Rambukkana, Kurunegala, Madampa, Gampaha, Kirindiwela and Ambalangoda are some of the outstation participants.
The tournament will be conducted on a league basis during the preliminary round with six groups. Each group will have six teams each. The winners and runners-up of each group will qualify for the Super 12 Round. The 12 teams will be divided into four groups with each group having three teams where they will play each other. The four winners of the Super 12 Round will go for the semis.
Matches until the Super 12 Round will be played 30-overs per innings and the semis and final will be 45-overs affair. All officiating umpires will be from the Association of Professional Umpires, Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Association of Cricket Umpires while the scorers are from Association of Scorers, Sri Lanka.
Last year CCC School of Cricket 'Maroons' beat M.C.A. Cricket Academy 'Blue' in the final. Fingara CA won the loser's final to bag the CCC Runner-up Challenge Trophy beating Sanath Jayasuriya CA.
This year also there will be many special awards including Best Batsman, Best Bowler, Best Fielder, Best Wicket Keeper, Player of the Tournament, Best Disciplined Team, Best Performing Foreign team and Best Outstation Team. Man of the Match awards will be presented in semis and final.
