AG to decide on maintainability of Range Bandara's case


	

The Attorney General is being considered over the defence objection on the maintainability of the case where Minister Palitha Range Bandara was accused of obtaining Rs.5.4 million dishonestly inducing a person to deliver a vehicle registration permit, Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dilan Ratnayake told court today.

Earlier, the defence moved an objection over the maintainability of the case. However, the Attorney General is yet to make his stance on the objection, the DSG said.

Filing the indictment in the Colombo High Court, the Attorney General maintained that the State Minister had committed this offence on or around March 22, 2002 in Madiwela, after dishonestly inducing a person called Dinesh Ratnayake to deliver a vehicle registration permit for a luxury jeep (WP GK 4271).  (By Shehan Chamika Silva)
