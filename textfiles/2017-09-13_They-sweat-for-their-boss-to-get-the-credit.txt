A state mandarin sporting a high rank insignia now known to be in the bad books of a political authority in the highest echelons is said to be planning to enter politics with a big bang.




This mandarin has made it a practice to force his subordinates into performing social service and community development activity. Recently he had launched a housing project and ordered his subordinates to build five houses each in their respective divisions with funds raised with their own efforts.  “We have to sweat; the boss gets the credit,” complain the subordinates, they say.
