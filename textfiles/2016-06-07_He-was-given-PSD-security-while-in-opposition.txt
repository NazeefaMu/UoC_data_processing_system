He was given PSD security while in opposition


	

It has transpired recently that a prominent purohita in yahapalanaya had had six personnel from the Presidential Security Division assigned for his security when he was in the opposition.

 


He had also been provided with two super limousines in addition to the special security detail. 


However, the purohita’s party leadership had never questioned the ethics of his enjoying these special perks from the government as personal favours, they say.
