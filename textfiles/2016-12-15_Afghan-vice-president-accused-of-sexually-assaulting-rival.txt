KABUL AFP/ Dec 13, 2016-   
Allegations that Afghanistan’s first vice president and his guards sexually assaulted a political rival while holding him captive in his private compound prompted calls on Tuesday from the country’s Western allies for a government investigation.  Abdul Rashid Dostum, a former warlord who has a catalogue of war crimes attached to his name, is accused of ordering his guards to seize Ahmad Ishchi last month in northern Jowzjan province during a game of buzkashi, or polo with a carcass.

  Dostum allegedly kept Ishchi hostage in his private enclave for five days, where he was said to be tortured and sodomised.   But the United States joined a slew of Western governments to call for a thorough probe.
