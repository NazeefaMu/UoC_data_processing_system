Half an hour later Mohamed Ijaz, the other son of the businessman had received a telephone call from an unknown person demanding the ransom for the release of the boy.
Ijaz had told the caller that they did not have that amount of money and promised to give Rs. 150,000 and a certain amount of jewellery. The caller had first asked Ijaz to bring the money and the jewellery to a place and then had changed the place twice and finally had asked him to take them back.
