Former Sri Lankan cricket captain Mahela Jayawardena said today that everyone should remain positive and should not make early-statements about the result on the random drug test done on Kusal Janith Perera.
Kusal was recalled by the SLC yesterday from New Zealand after a sample he provided for a random drug test during the recent Pakistani tour had been positive for a banned substance.
Mahela in a tweet said we should not jump the gun with Kusal.
“Let’s not jump the gun with Kusal. We have to wait for the B test and even after that for the explanation how it happened,” the tweet said.
