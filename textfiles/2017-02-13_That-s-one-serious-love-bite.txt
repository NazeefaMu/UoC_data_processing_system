This is the moment a leopardess stalked an impala before killing it - with a 'death hug'.

One wildlife photographer spotted the full-grown impala first and then the three-year-old big cat lunged from the bushes.

The young leopard locked its jaws on the animal's neck by positioning itself underneath and 'hugging' the animal, in Masai Mara, Kenya. (Daily Mail)
