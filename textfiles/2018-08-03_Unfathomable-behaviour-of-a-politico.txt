Unfathomable behaviour of a politico!


	



 

A story about how the strange behaviour of an affluent top team member caused wonderment tinged with amusement to those present at a religious ceremony is reported from a distant area in the country.

 


The top team member who attended a religious ceremony at a Buddhist temple had taken the gathering by surprise when he launched a tirade against a prominent politico and his family.


The religious ceremony over, the incumbent bhikkhu of the temple and the Dayaka Sabha members invited the distinguished guest to tea. They were disappointed when he declined the invitation and their disappointment had given way to a big surprise when he had given the reason for turning down their invitation.


“Please excuse me, ape hamuduruwane,” said the guest. “Our Lokka … wants my chopper for a visit he had planned in another 15 minutes. Time now is 5.00 pm. I have to release the chopper for him at 5.15 pm on dot!”


The ‘Lokka’ he referred to was none other than the prominent politico he had berated in public a short while ago!


The bhikkhu watching with puzzled perplexity the top team member hurrying towards the waiting chopper with his security men at his heels had exclaimed: “This man is puduma yakek! He is giving the tea party specially arranged for him a miss just because he wants to oblige the guy he was blackguarding left and right a little while ago!”
