Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader Minister Rauff Hakeem said this budget was a progressive one with a new approach.

He said it was a budget aimed at preserving the environment and preventing natural disasters as well as promoting entrepreneurship among the people.

“It looks at areas where investments have to be made to attract tourism and to increase the country’s revenue. A variety of proposals have been put forward without burdening the people. This budget will give the less privileged sections of our society to get access to proper housing and help them with their livelihoods by giving them some concessionary capital infusion to fulfil their ideas and projects,” he said and added that the budget has taken a holistic view of what needs to be achieved.
