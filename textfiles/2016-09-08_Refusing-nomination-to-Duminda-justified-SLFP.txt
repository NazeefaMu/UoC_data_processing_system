Refusing nomination to Duminda justified: SLFP


	

The death sentence on former MP Duminda Silva by the Colombo High Court has shown that President Maithripala Sirisena was correct in refusing to endorse the Mr. Silva’s nomination for last year’s general elections, Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.

He told a media briefing today that the judgement was independent.

“I cannot comment on the judgement other than to say it was based on the evidence submitted by the prosecution,” the minister said.  “It is clear the judgment proves the correctness of the president’s decision.” (Chaturanga Pradeep)
