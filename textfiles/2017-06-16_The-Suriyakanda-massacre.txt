Young investigative writer Varuna Priyankara’s controversial book - ‘Andonawa’

Reader awards for the book relating the full story 



Young investigative writer Varuna Priyankara’s controversial book ‘Andonawa’ (Wailing)--an extensive investigation into the infamous massacre of 30 Advanced Level students from two schools in Embilipitiya during the 1989-90 terror period--was awarded the readers’ felicitation award on Tuesday June 13.

  

Organised by the Colombo Public Library Readers’ Society, the award was given by Librarian Waruni Gagabada Arachchi and Deputy Librarian Chintha Ailaperuma of the Colombo Public Library.  
The result of years of in-depth analysis and interviews of survivors, witnesses and court records, ‘Andonawa’ is an exposure of a society rendered lawless by violence and cruelty endorsed by political authority. In a landmark case in Sri Lanka’s judicial history, nine individuals including army officers and soldiers were tried for kidnapping and disappearance of more than 30 students, the story is told here with impartiality and exacting detail.
