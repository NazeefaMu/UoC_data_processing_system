Poised for the jump?


	



 

A fair Diyawanna politico has suddenly gone missing, they say.

 


It is her sister who is said to be answering the telephone calls that come unceasingly on her land phone these days and she would give all inquiring about the woman politico the stock answer:


“She is not at home. If there’s any message for her, I’ll convey it to her when she returns home!”


Almost all callers happen to be colleagues from both camps and some suspect that she is giving them all a wide berth preparatory to a political somersault.
