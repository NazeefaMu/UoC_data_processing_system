The Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) on Tuesday welcomed the statement made by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka that Sri Lankan security forces had committed war crimes against Tamils during and after the war ended.

Issuing a statement, the TGTE said ‘confirmation of war crimes by Sri Lankan forces comes after eight years of denial by successive Sri Lankan Governments that no war crimes were committed and calling Sri Lankan forces ’War Heroes’.

“Sri Lankan Government rewarded ex-servicemen with senior Government positions, including appointing Field Marshal Fonseka as the Minister for Regional Development and General Jagath Jayasuriya as the Ambassador to Brazil,” the statement said.

It said Field Marshal Fonseka’s confession to war crimes committed by forces under his command came on September 1 and said that he has information about General Jayasuriya committing war crimes and that he is ready to give evidence.

“I know he committed Crimes and I am ready to testify before a proper investigation. He committed crimes during and after the end of the war. I have a lot of information,” the TGTE said quoting Minister Fonseka.

It said the minister went on to say that war crimes were committed even after the war ended.

“Minister Fonseka also said that he had information regarding other ‘Officers who committed crimes’. We urge the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, UNHRC and others to act swiftly to bring perpetrators of these international crimes to face justice. UN should not miss this opportunity,” it said.
