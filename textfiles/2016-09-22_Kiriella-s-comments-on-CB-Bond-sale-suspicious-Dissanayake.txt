Continuous remarks made by Minister Lakshman Kiriella with regard to the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) proceedings into the Central Bank Bond sale scam, raises the question on whether he received a ‘commission’ from those who were involved in it, COPE member and MP Weerakumara Dissanayake charged yesterday (21).

He said Minister Kiriella had issued statements on behalf of the Bond Sale despite a warning issued by the Speaker not to do so. “When the minister goes to such lengths to speak on behalf of the scam it gives us idea that he too was involved in the fraud. It’s the responsibility of the COPE to make decisions in this regard", Mr. Dissanayake told a news conference.

He said the Bond Sale scam was not the only issue which is being probed by the COPE but unfortunately the minister seems only interested in talking about the Bond Sale.

The final report of the COPE on the Bond Sale issue is scheduled to be presented in Parliament next month. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
