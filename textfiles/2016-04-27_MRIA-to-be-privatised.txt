The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) is to be privatised within the year, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation said.

A ministry source said that it had received proposals from several companies, including three private Chinese companies.

“Since the airport was constructed by the Chinese Government it has not submitted a proposal,” the source said.

The source said the government was in the midst of searching for a way to repay the instalments on the loan taken to construct the airport.

“At the moment the loan is being repaid with the income from the Bandaranaike International Airport. This will not be done in the future,” the source said.

The MRIA was opened in March 2013, and US$209 million was spent on the project; with $190 million provided by the Chinese government. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
