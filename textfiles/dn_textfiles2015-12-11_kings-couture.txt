Kings of Couture

Haute couture is art for the body – exclusive, customized clothing made from scratch by hand, from expensive, unusual fabrics often tailored specifically to the user’s own measurements. Its high fashion, a giant leap above what we wear every day, the stuff of fashion show ramps and Lady Gaga’s wardrobe. A trademark of couture is that there is a lot of craft and creativity that goes into the clothing, and the collections try to be as unique and distinct as possible - Jean Paul Gaultiere’s crazy sculpture-esque designs of silk ruffles and tulles come to mind. In our roundup however we’re going to see less of conceptual fashion and stick to actually wearable couture, and only a few out there manage to create clothing that is both bold as true couture should be, and still tasteful. Here are our favourites of the lot.
Giambattista Valli: Born and raised in Rome, this Italian designer has made a name for himself that sticks out in the world’s fashion arena and his name has become synonymous with high fashion. Wide, frothy feminine skirts, symmetrical structures, tastefully combined incongruous colours – this is the stuff of his work. Valli’s strength seems to be in his creative sensitivity – he doesn’t resort to wild shapes and overly dramatic combos, but plays subtly with structure, whether it’s in the flair of the skirt or a row of tulle in the collar. He then highlights this with a striking mix of two or three solid colours – a natural range of yellows, creams, whites, reds and black pepper. The result is soft and subdued but bold, unforgettable couture. For a sneak peek into his style check out www.giambattistavalli.com
Louis Vuitton: Louis Vuitton is one of the biggest names in fashion – their clothing and accessories have become so popularized, it’s a rare example of mass-produced high fashion. Hailing from France, the LV couture line seems to follow the same theme of their mainstream collection – every-day glam, powerful and urban. There’s a heavier look to this brand of couture than the typical line-ups on catwalks, it’s very modern, city-chic and you get the feel from all the leather, the bold prints and the confident defined shapes and colours, that the clothing makes a very unapologetic, loud statement. Sleek silks, minimal lace and fitting bodices that elongate the wearer define this look.
Valentino: Another classic Italian designer Valentino is responsible for more classic haute couture, trusted by celebrities and big names for his flair. His couture feels more mature, serious and detailed, a clear cut apart from the rest. Silks, sheer materials, light brocade work – a very timeless, classic, sophisticated look defines Valentino couture. The designs are usually long and flowy, playing with colours and textures in a very classy, dignified way, and the result is a very expensive-looking, often regal, slightly vintage finish, perfect to stop the show at the Oscars.
Elie Saab: Elie Saab is an absolute delight for couture lovers. This Lebanese designer has now earned a spot for his collections in couture-capitals far from his own home, in Milan and Paris. His couture designs appear very light, almost airy and the models look almost fairy-like and ethereal in them, so it is no wonder that women considering wedding dresses stop and stare at Elie Saab’s collections. The designs are long and flowy, with colours that melt into each other, show-stopper gowns which are still calm and easy on the eyes, with miles of sheer fabric, white stonework and lace to complete that airy, feminine, princess look.
Zuhair Murad: This designer, again from Lebanon is our top favourite from the kingdom of couture. While some of his sheer-fabric designs are vaguely reminiscent of Elie Saab, his overall style is unlike any other. His designs are very feminine, but bold and well defined at the same time – there is a healthy mix of elements that exudes a powerful, confident feminine energy. There is a range of materials and colours used in his collections so although they share a common fun sense of creativity there is no single look. Generally the dresses tend to be long and youthful, in pale colours or dark maroons and blues, with a creative mix of silks, layers of sheer fabric and creatively placed embellishments. For an evening out or a very special occasion, Murad’s couture is 100% on-point. The designer has a recent interesting crowd-favourite of a wedding dress that features sheer figure-hugging material and subtle floral cutouts, so the bride looks almost nude, but still, somehow, absolutely graceful and regal.
