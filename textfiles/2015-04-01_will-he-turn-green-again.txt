Will he turn Green again?


	


	The second in command of the new regime threw a party to mark his birthday at his official residence the other day.

   Among the guests at this function were a number of Ministers and Diyawanna members and also several top brass of the Police and security services.
However, easily the most conspicuous guest at this party was a prominent Diyawanna member from the Colombo district.  Many guests present were seen stealing glances at this Diyawanna member, a former Green member now turned Blue. Some guests who discussed the presence of this member had in whispers wondered whether the latter was getting set to turn Green again. However, this member who held himself aloof from other guests had not stayed long at the function.  He had left after offering his greetings to the host.
