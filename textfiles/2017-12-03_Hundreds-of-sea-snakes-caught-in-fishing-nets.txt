Hundreds of sea snakes were found trapped in fishing nets at Nawaladi in Batticaloa this morning, fishermen in the area said.

They said they were finding it difficult to continue with their livelihood because of the rough seas and the incident with the sea snakes.

According to reports a large number of sea snakes had been caught in the wake of the 2004 tsunami as well.

However, some residents said the sea snakes were really a species of eels and that the adverse weather conditions might have triggered their exodus towards the fishing nets.

The frightened fishermen asked the authorities to look into this matter. (Tl Jawferkhan)
