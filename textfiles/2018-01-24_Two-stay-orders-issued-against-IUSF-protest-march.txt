The Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court and the Gangodawila Magistrate’s Court today issued stay orders preventing a protest march organised by the Inter University Student’s Federation (IUSF) which was scheduled for tomorrow, the Police said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera said the two stay orders had been issued preventing the protest march of the university students in Colombo.

“According to the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act, rallies and processions cannot be held during this period. Therefore, the university students cannot hold protest marches during this period,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
