A first-time report on Sri Lanka by the global publishing firm Oxford Business Group (OBG) will explore what’s next for the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), while tracking its activity and performance since the end of the war. 
‘The Report: Sri Lanka 2016’ will trace the CSE’s expansion in terms of new listings, volume, market capitalisation and upgrades to trading infrastructure. OBG’s landmark publication on the country’s economy will also consider how Sri Lanka can build on its position as a recognised high growth frontier market. 
First Capital Holdings PLC has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on research with Oxford Business Group for its forthcoming report on Sri Lanka. As part of the agreement, the investment bank’s representatives will work with OBG to compile and produce the capital markets chapter of The Report: Sri Lanka 2016. 
Dilshan Wirasekara, the CEO of First Capital Holdings PLC, welcomed the opportunity to contribute to OBG’s report, adding that he believed the publication would play a pivotal part in bringing the international investment community up to date on Sri Lanka’s post-war economic development.  
“The heightened activity that has been a hallmark of the Colombo Stock Exchange reflects the changing face of Sri Lanka’s economy, while also signaling the opportunities that are emerging for investors across the sectors,” he said. “I look forward to supporting Oxford Business Group’s team in producing what I’m sure will prove to be a valuable research tool for those keen to learn more about what Sri Lanka has to offer.”
OBG’s Country Director, Brooke Butler, said she was delighted to have First Capital Holdings PLC on board for the Group’s new project, which sees the firm enter a new phase in its operations across Asia.
“As a longstanding industry player, First Capital Holdings PLC has an in-depth understanding of Sri Lanka’s markets and how they are evolving,” she said. “I’m sure its team’s input will give our coverage of this important emerging economy an edge.” 
The Report: Sri Lanka 2016 will be a vital guide to the many facets of the country, including its macroeconomics, infrastructure, banking and other sectoral developments. It will also contain interviews with leading representatives, including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe. The publication will be available in print or online.
