This newly acquired finance company has been registered under the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in terms of the Finance Business Act No.42 of 2011 and is also a registered leasing establishment under Section 5 of the Finance Leasing Act No.56 of 2000. It is also an Approved Credit Agency under the Mortgage Act No.06 of 1949 and the Trust Receipts Ordinance No.12 of 1947.  It was incorporated as a Limited Liability Company on October 14, 1974 under the Companies Ordinance No.51 of 1938 and the company was re-registered under the Companies Act No.07 of 2007 on February 26, 2009.
