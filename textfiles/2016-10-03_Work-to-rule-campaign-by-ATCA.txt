Air Traffic Controllers’ Association (ATCA) of Sri Lanka commenced a work to rule campaign with effect from today, the Association said.

They said the campaign was started today at 4.45 pm because of the negligence of the Airport Authority of Sri Lanka.

“Recent allowances were given with the recommendation of internal committee, but some other sections were given allowances without the consent of ATCA. These and the ill treatment were also reasons for this move,” the Association said.

Although several discussions had been held regarding the issues on several occasions, no action has been taken so far, it said.

However, the trade union action would not affect to the emergency services such as checking up of flights which carry patients, but the outgoing and incoming passengers would be affected, it said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
