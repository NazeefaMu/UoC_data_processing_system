Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday that fresh legislation should be enacted to regulate the operation of NGOs in the country.

In an interview with Daily Mirror, he said the NGOs mostly operated in the country posing a threat to national interests and therefore their activities should be regulated. He said he would make some proposals to subject Minister Mano Ganeshan on this matter.

The previous regime had made an effort to prepare legislation with a Parliamentary Select Committee headed by JVP MP Vijitha Herath looking into the matter and making recommendations. (Kelum Bandara)
