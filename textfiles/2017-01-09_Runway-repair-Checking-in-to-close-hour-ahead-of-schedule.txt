Explaining as to why, outbound air passengers are required to arrive at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) five hours prior to the departure as a result of the repairs to the runway, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said passenger screening and checking in counters would be closed one hour in advance to departure schedules.

“Secondly, any unexpected vehicle congestion is possible on the roads leading to the BIA as traffic has been diverted through different routes and parking will be available only in the vehicle parks of the airport,” he added.

Minister De Silva said the refurbishment of the runway at the BIA was done by the Airport and Aviation Services Sri Lanka (AASL) Ltd.

“It has taken every effort to mitigate inconvenience to passengers who use the airport during the three months period from January 6 to April 5 during which the runway will remain closed from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m,” Minister De Silva said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
