The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), in a May Day resolution, requested the government not to increase the Value Added Tax (VAT) on food items consumed by the general public and education services.

The government, in its proposed tax reforms, has decided to rescind the VAT exemptions on private health services, education and the telecommunications.

TNA Jaffna District MP, M. A. Sumanthiran told Daily Mirror that his party would adopt a resolution calling on the government not to impose taxes on the education sector and essential food items. Besides this, he said, there would be two other resolutions calling for the development of the war affected areas and a political solution based on power sharing among the communities in the country.

The TNA, an amalgam of four parties, had its main event to mark May Day, in Jaffna yesterday. The TNA is the main opposition in Parliament today. (Kelum Bandara)
