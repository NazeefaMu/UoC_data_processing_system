British politicians take Trump to task

UK: Donald Trump has sparked a transatlantic row with Britain's most senior politicians as he said parts of London were so radicalised that police feared for their lives.
In the strongest criticism ever of an American presidential candidate by a Prime Minister, David Cameron said it was "wrong" to question the courage of Britain's policemen and then attacked his call for a ban on Muslims travelling to the United States as "divisive".
Boris Johnson, the London Mayor, mocked the idea police would stay away from some neighbourhoods as "ill-informed" and "complete and utter nonsense" and said the comments were an insult to London's "proud history of tolerance and diversity".
He mocked the US politician, claiming that "the only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump".
The row means that if Mr Trump wins the presidential election in less than a year diplomatic relations between Britain and the United States could become close to untenable.
There were calls from Labour and the SNP for Mr. Trump to be banned from entering Britain under rules designed to bar hate preachers. However, government sources indicated that this course was not being considered.
The White House, fellow Republican candidates, British political figures from all parties were united in condemnation of the remarks.
Scotland Yard also broke with convention to issue a statement, with a spokesman saying: "We would not normally dignify such comments with a response, however on this occasion we think it's important to state to Londoners that Mr Trump could not be more wrong."
Trump was speaking after the first Isil-inspired attack in the United States last week which saw 14 people killed in a shooting in San Bernardino, California.
There is growing concern among Americans over Barack Obama's failure to tackle Isil amid increasing support for deploying ground troops.
In the wake of the Paris terror there has been much debate in the US about restricting the number of Syrian migrants and tightening the borders to counter the threat from jihadists.
However, Mr Trump's comments were even condemned by his own rivals for the Republican nomination and the Pentagon which warned the proposals could make America more vulnerable to attack.
Trump also said that cities like London and Paris have effectively become no-go areas for the police.
He added: "We have places in London and other places that are so radicalised that the police are afraid for their own lives. We have to be very smart and very vigilant."
