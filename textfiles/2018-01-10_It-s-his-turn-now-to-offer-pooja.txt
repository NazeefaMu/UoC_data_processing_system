There was a time when his grandfather was the undisputed monarch of the upcountry estate-kingdom. The political landscape in the estate-kingdom has undergone much change since then and the grandson, the King Rooster who inherited the grandfather’s political mantle no longer reigns supreme there. 

 


There was a time when the lesser mortals in politics in the estate sector came to King Rooster on bended knees seeking party nomination or patronage otherwise.  However, the reverse is happening today.  King Rooster has to go to now powerful young politicos on bended knees to win them over to his party.
