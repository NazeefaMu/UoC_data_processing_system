The National Freedom Front (NFF) said yesterday that FCID’s arrest of former Minister Basil Rajapaksa was a planned action of the government and the JVP which supported it indirectly.

NFF leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said in a statement that the unofficial website of the JVP carried a news item beforehand saying that a member of the Rajapaksa family was to be arrested.
Mr. Weerawansa said the arrest was made to divert the peoples’ mounting protest against the government because of its anti-people actions.

“A huge protest is directed towards the government for its anti-peoples’ actions such as illegal increase of the Vat and NBT, government’s alleged plan to release LTTE terrorists who were under arrest by removing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and continuous postponement of the Local Government Elections. We believe that Mr. Rajapaksa was arrested to divert mounting protests against the government, Mr. Weerawansa said in the statement.

He said they strongly condemned the suppression of the government by using the FCID, the government’s hunting device to hunt down opposition politicians. (Ajith Siriwardana)
