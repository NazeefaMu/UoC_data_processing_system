Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa had been given a contract to divide the SLFP and weaken President Maithripala Sirisena allegedly funded by a neighbouring country, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera charged yesterday.asked whether it was a South Asian country, Minister Jayasekera did not deny it.
Minister Jayasekera said Mr. Rajapaksa, who deserted the SLFP and party supporters in the aftermath of the defeat at the Presidential election in January 2015, fled the country and returned to face an inquiry against him conducted by the FCID (Financial Crime Investigation Division). “He is now on a contract to destroy the SLFP, on malice and vengeance. He is the prime mover of the rebel May Day really at Kirulapone organised by the so called Joint Opposition. He is going from district to district round the country distributing money given to him by a neighbouring country to woo SLFPERS to attend the Kirulapone rally. This money is dirty money, as it is being used for a dirty game,” he charged.
Minister Jayasekera made an appeal to SLFPERS not to attend the Kirulapone rally, as it would definitely split the party, which would eventually be a big boost to the UNP and added those who love the SLFP would go to the main SLFP May Day rally in Galle and those who were scheming to destroy the party would attend the Kirulapone rally violating the party discipline and instructions.
He said it was extremely malicious, indecent and unethical to act against party leader President Sirisena as he was given the party leadership by former party leader and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa after his defeat at the Presidential poll.(Sandun A Jayasekera)
