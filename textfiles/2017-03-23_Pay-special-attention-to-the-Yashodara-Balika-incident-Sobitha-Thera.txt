Authorities should pay special attention when investigating the incident where students from Mahanama College had forcibly entered Yashodara Balika Vidyalaya during a big-match parade, Jathika Hela Urumya (JHU) Chief Patron Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera said yesterday.

While condemning the incident the Thera also said he was disappointed with the way the Police acted during the incident.

“These kinds of incidents cannot be considered trivial. These students had intimidated staff members and assaulted an employee of the school. I was criticized when I suggested that the big matches should be banned,” the Thera said.

The Thera said education without discipline was useless. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
