DPA, 23rd MARCH, 2018- Former US ambassador to the UN John Bolton will replace HR McMaster as US National Security Advisor next month, President Donald Trump said Thursday.


“I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor,” Trump wrote on Twitter.


McMaster had done “an outstanding job and will always remain my friend,” Trump added.


McMaster’s decision to depart was a mutual decision, according to a White House official.


“I am thankful to President Donald J. Trump for the opportunity to serve him and our nation as national security advisor,” McMaster said in a statement.


McMaster, a 1984 graduate of the US Military Academy at West Point, has served in conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and the 1991 Gulf War during a 34-year military career.
