The SLFP Central Committee will sack the parliamentarians who attend the proposed rival May Day rally to be organized by the joint opposition on May, a senior SLFPer said today.

When asked about the reported preparation by the joint opposition to hold a separate May Day rally at Kirula Grounds in Kirillapone, th said he believed that no SLFP parliamentarian would participate in that rally by violating party instructions and discipline, but assured that the Central Committee would definitely take punitive action against any MP who participates in that rally.

“It is true that the SLFP CC was lenient and did not take any disciplinary action against those who participated in the joint opposition rally at Hyde Park on March 17 despite strict instructions by the SLFP hierarchy not to do so. As a political party which gives a prominent place to discipline, we have decided to take tough action against those who participate in a rival May Day rally,” he said and added that those who violate party discipline might probably be expelled.

Meanwhile, UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the main SLFP May Day rally would be held in Galle under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.

"We have invited all constituent parties of the UPFA for the May Day rally in Galle and expect them to attend,” he said.

The minister said he would not give up his efforts to unite the SLFP, as divisions in the party would diminish the chances of returning to power in 2020.

“No one I spoke to was agreeable to the forming of a separate political party. I have already spoken to Communist Party leader DEW Gunasekara, MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardana, Deshavimukthi Party Leader Appuhami, parliamentarians Keheliya Rambukwella, Kumara Welgama and Udaya Gammanpila,who had earlier refused to talk to me. They all want to contest the forthcoming local government poll under the UPFA,” he said.

The minister said the SLFP CC last week decided to suspend the party membership of 10 local government heads who failed to respond to the letters of explanation and failed to appear before the CC when summoned. They are, former Maharagama mayor Kanthi Kodikara, former Moratuwa mayor Saman Lal Fernando, former Walallawita PS chairman Udeni Athukorala, former Gampaha PS chairman Ranjith Gunawardana, former Attanagalla PS chairman Priyantha Pushpakumara, former Mirigama PS chairman Sarath Nandasiri, former Matale PS chairman Kapila Bandara, former Ukuwela PS chairman W.Somasiri, former Dambulla PS chairman K.G. Somatilaka and former Boralesgamuwa Urban Council chairman Aruna Priyashantha.

The minister said the local government polls would be held in six months, after the issues pertaining to delimitation were addressed and the necessary ground work was in place. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
