Not our baby, says Higher Education Ministry Secretary

The Higher Education Ministry has no authority to interfere in the matter regarding the private medical faculty managed by the South Asia Institute of Medicine and Technology (SAITM), Higher Education Ministry Secretary, D. C. Dissanayake claimed.
The degree awarding status was given to SAITM first by the UGC and later by the Higher Education Ministry. According to regulations set out to recognise any private degree awarding status as per Gazette No 1842/21 issued on August 22, 2013, institutes "which offer study programmes leading to Degrees in Medicine, Engineering, Architecture and other similar professional degrees shall obtain compliance certification from the relevant Specified Professional body," a regulation which Dissanayake is not aware of.
"I haven't referred to that gazette yet," he claimed, stating that the matter is a complex issue which needs careful handling.
"The Higher Education Ministry gave SAITM a degree awarding status and apart from that the ministry has no connection with the issue," Dissanayake said.
The ministry cannot take any legal action against the administration of SAITM for failing to get the compliance from SLMC. It is a problem with SAITM, it is their responsibility to meet the standards in order to get the certification from SLMC. The students at SAITM will be considered as medical graduates but they will not be allowed to practice as doctors in Sri Lanka without the certification of the SLMC, he claimed.
Dissanayake also highlighted that as the gazette was issued under the tenure of the former government and the present government has not taken any decisions with regard to the issue so far.
