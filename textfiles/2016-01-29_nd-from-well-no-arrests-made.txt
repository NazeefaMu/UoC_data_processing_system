No suspect has been arrested so far in connection with the recovery of the body of a 6-year-old boy from an unprotected well at Sampur in Trincomalee on Monday night, police said today.
A big stone had been found tied to the stomach of victim who was identified as Kugathas Dharsan, Police said.
It has come to light that the boy had been playing with his brother and another little boy before he disappeared.
The other two boys had returned home but since Dharsan had not returned, the mother had gone looking for him and then had lodged a complaint with the Sampur Police.
The body was found following a joint search operation by the Police and the residents.
