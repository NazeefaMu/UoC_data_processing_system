These are tragic tales of the lives of some innocent parents who were compelled to grin and bear tragedies. These tragedies happened when their kids  breathed their last recently.   


For many years, it has been reported that the dengue mosquitoes were active and were sucking the blood of the people from all walks of life. But it is ironic that such tragedies befall on innocent kids. The loss of such kids is felt by their parents forever. It is not only the dengue mosquito, but also the lives of the infants that have been snuffed out in various devilish forms from time to time.   

Among those who died recently was a son by the name Shalika Shehan. This child is said to have lived with much hope. Having lived in Kalutara area, he was first educated at Kalutara Maha Vidyalaya and later enrolled at Royal College, Colombo. He showed a keen interest in education and extra-curricular activities. He had just sat for the Advanced Level Examination when this tragedy took place. When the son worshiped his father, who was about to leave home, he might not have thought that it was the last time he would get to worship his dad. Shehan, who died of a sudden heart attack, was also denied of the opportunity to know that he had obtained many distinctions at A/Level Examination. The house where he lived is isolated today.

Another ‘flower bud’ named Dewindi, who lived under the parents care, had a similar tragedy. She studied in grade 5 in Thri/Padavipura Jayanthi Wewa School. The cartoon ‘hero’ in a TV. Programme, that was shown on the TV, Influenced her to imitate this character and his actions. One such feat that repeated was binding a creeper around her neck.

Small children are like flowers. Their small hearts are warmed with the love and affection they show for fauna and flora. Susith Nirmal who lived in Inuwila in Chilaw also died unexpectedly. He was a resident of Samindugama (an area spanning 40 acres), in Chilaw. He had gone to the jungle with the hope of catching parrots with an unknown person. This person has had the habit of visiting the village to pluck king coconuts. But, he was unable to fulfill his expectations of catching parrots which was child’s hobby. It is said that this boy had been sexually abused, the incident leading to his death. It was after several days that the boy’s remains were found. The remains of the boy were found in a jungle in Inuwila.   


Even before the flames of Susith’s funeral pyre died down the death of another child, this time a daughter, was recorded. The name of the deceased was Saheli Niwarthika. She was a grade four student and attended Buddhist Primary school in Dehiowita. She was very humble and obedient to her teachers. The children in her class had to walk on the coconut shells as part of an extra-curricular activity, prescribed in the syllabus. The children in this class were seen practicing this activity earnestly on the gravel-less ground. Therefore, it was a frequent sight for the teachers to see these kids practice.   


All of a sudden, small Saheli had collapsed on the ground while trying this exercise. In spite of the fact that Saheli was hospitalized by the teachers concerned, she died unexpectedly.   The daughter, Madubhashini Buddhika Liyanage (16) was another student who faced an untimely tragedy as all others mentioned here. She studied in grade eleven in Udagama Maha Vidyalaya in Atabage in Gampola. She was a resident of Deniyagama area in Millagahamula in Gampola. She was well versed in music.   She played the violin well and was a gifted singer. She also attended dancing classes with her classmates. She had dropped her head saying that she was having a severe headache. Despite being taken to the nearby rural hospital for treatment, her condition had worsened. She was admitted to the Gampola Hospital for further treatment as per the medical instructions, but her life could not be saved.   


However, it is clear that these deaths have left a clear message for us.

 

‘Malnutrition also causes untime deaths’

According to Nutritionist, Harshani Meegaswatte, obesity has become an issue, especially among urban children. But, there are also children who suffer from malnutrition despite food being available at homes. Although some mothers give food to their children these diets aren’t balanced. Most children as a result don’t carry the proper weight for their age. The weight of some children are below average. Some children don’t have breakfast. Such children have their first meal during the interval.   


She added that it was not only child abuse, but malnutrition that has brought untimely deaths to children. These factors are the causes for their malnutrition, she emphasized.
