He pockets part of their pay!


	



 

Believe it not! There is a purohita who coolly pockets part of his private staff’s pay every month.

 


If the monthly pay of a staff member is Rs. 30,000, the purohita would pay him only Rs. 20,000 pocketing the balance himself, 
they say.


The man has found it convenient to play out his staffers pay in this manner, as their monthly paycheck comes to him direct.


Although the employees know that they are getting a raw deal, they keep mum about it as they are keen to keep their job.
