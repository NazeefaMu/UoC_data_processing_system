	South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to visit Sri Lanka in March, High Commissioner Geoff Diodge said.
	He told Daily Mirror that the exact dates could not be confirmed because the visit was still in the planning stages.
	Mr. Dodge said he believed that the discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena would be mainly focused on Sri Lanka’s reconciliation process.
	Meanwhile, South African Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Nomaindia Mfeketo will arrive in Sri Lanka on February 24 to attend the Sri Lanka- South Africa partnership forum which is scheduled to continue until February 28.
	Following an invitation by the then government, Mr. Ramaphosa visited Sri Lanka in July last year and held discussions with former President Mahinda  Rajapaksa and other political representatives on the reconciliation process and also visited the Northern Province. (Lakna Paranamanna)
