Look into issue of resettling Muslims with more concern - Hakeem

The government should look into the issue of resettling the Muslims with more concern, Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauf Hakeem said.
He was speaking at the commemoration ceremony of the 25th Anniversary of the Expulsion of Muslims from the North held in Colombo yesterday.
The resettlement issue of the Northern Muslims evicted in 1990 still remains unresolved, he added.
Hakeem said the Lesson Learnt Reconciliation Commission is of the view that durable solutions should be found to address this long-standing IDP issue concerning the Muslims evicted from the North.
"When measures were taken to resettle the Muslim IDPs back in their original villages, landlessness was identified as a serious setback for resettlement."
He said the government needs to have a uniform policy to deal with the issue adding that reconciliation will be a success based on trust and respect.
The plight of the displaced Muslim also should be addressed in the truth seeking process, Hakeem said.
