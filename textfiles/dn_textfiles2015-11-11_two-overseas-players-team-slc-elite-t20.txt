Championship will be forerunner to Asia Cup/World T20
Two overseas players per team for SLC ELITE T20

World T20 champions Sri Lanka will begin preparations to defend their title won in Bangladesh an year ago with the Elite T20 Championship to be conducted by Sri Lanka Cricket in January.
The tournament which was originally scheduled to take place at the tailend of March has been brought forward as a forerunner to the Asia Cup and the World T20 championship.
The Asia Cup normally a fifty-over affair has been changed into T20 matches as a prelude to the world event. It will be held in Bangladesh from February 24 to March 6 with the World T20 scheduled in India from March 11 to April 3.The Elite T20 championship will consist of five teams sans the fancy names used in past tournaments. They will be called Colombo, Galle, Kandy, Kurunegala and Hambantota.
“We've got to build on the cities otherwise there won't be affiliation,” said interim committee chairman Sidath Wettimuny.
“All these bases will have trainers, physios, managers etc and will have facilities similar to what is available in Colombo. We need to make sure those base are as strong as Colombo.
“Ninety percent of our cricketers come from the outstations, we must go to them rather than bring them to Colombo,” he said. Wettimuny also stated that they would do something novel by enabling the team sponsor to voice his opinion.
“We are clustering the clubs in each of the districts so that we can play them in different teams. Selection of these teams will be made by a selection committee comprising one national selector along with three selectors from the respective districts,” Wettimuny said.
“We will also make the sponsor to have a say in his team like in the IPL. Each team will also be entitled to have two overseas players for the T20 tournament.”
