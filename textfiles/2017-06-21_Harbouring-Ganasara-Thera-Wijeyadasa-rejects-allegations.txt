Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapkshe yesterday denied allegations of harbouring Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Galabodaatte Gananasara Thera.

"I am extremely saddened by the false allegations which have been made by some Muslim extremists that I am harbouring the monk. I have nothing to do with him" the minister said in Parliament yesterday.

"The BBS has been engaged in various activities in 2014. Accordingly Ganasara Thera should have been arrested after the clashes in Aluthgama that year. I ask those who make allegations against me whether the others was harboured by the then justice minister Rauff Hakeem during that time," the minister said.

He said it was the duty of the police to arrest the monk. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
