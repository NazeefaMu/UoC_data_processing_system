Sarath Fonseka likely to get Cabinet portfolio

 
Parliamentarian Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka is more likely to receive a Cabinet portfolio in the government within the next week.
Political sources said that the former Army Commander Fonseka is to be appointed Minister of Megapolis of the North Central, Uva and Central Provinces. Fonseka took oaths as a Parliamentarian on the United National Front National List. The Democratic party led by Field Marshal Fonseka tied up with United National Front led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently.
