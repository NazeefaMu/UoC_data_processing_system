The ‘Paada Yathra’ to mark the National New Year was held on April 15 for the 28th year. This was started by Yogendra Duraiswamy and Bogoda Premaratne, deputising for the Bauddha-Hindu Maha Sabha.   

The National New Year was celebrated by a gathering at the Vajiraramaya, Bambalapitiya, where a simple ritual of lighting oil lamps and offering of flowers was carried out; this was followed by a ‘Paada-Yathra’ to the Kathiresan Kovil in Wellawatte. Here too, people participated in the pooja, followed by a fellowship.
