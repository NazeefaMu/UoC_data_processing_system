	The Uva Chief Minister has made a move to ban the use of mobile phones by teachers during school hours.
	Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake said yesterday that teachers would be instructed to switch off their mobile phones and place them at the Principal’s office during school hours.
	He said a new circular would be issued and sent to the zonal education offices.
	The new rule would be in effect from January 2016, he said.
	“The use of phones had reduced productivity in the schools apart from other issues like pictures being taken without permission. Therefore we have directed the phones be left at the Principal’s office during the day and if there is an emergency the principal or the school can be contacted,” Dassanayake said.
	Taking it a step further, the Chief Minister said the regulations on mobile phone use would be strictly regulated.
	“Students who do not follow this rule will be dismissed, while teachers will be transferred,” the Chief Minister said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
