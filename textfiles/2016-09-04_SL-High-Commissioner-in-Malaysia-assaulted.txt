Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia and the Second Secretary were reported to have been mobbed by a group of protesters at Kuala Lampur airport in Malaysia today when they arrived at the airport to send off MP Dinesh Gunawardena who was on a visit to the country with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Former Minister Johnston Fernando said the attack was carried out by a group of LTTE sympathizers, who were protesting against Mr. Rajapaksa.

The Sri Lankan High Commissioner who sustained head injuries and the Second Secretary, who was also injured, are currently being treated at a hospital in Kuala Lampur.

According to former minister Fernando, the protesters had asked whereabouts of Former President Rajapaksa from the High Commissioner and he had told to the protesters contact the Police and inquire about it.

The protesters who were irritated by his response had ‘critically’ attacked the ambassador until he bled from his forehead, Mr. Fernando said.

However, it is reported that when the Police arrived in the scene, the High Commissioner had already been beaten up.
He said none of the delegation of Mr. Rajapaksa had faced attacks.

The Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa is scheduled to return to Sri Lanka tomorrow morning with  his delegation comprising his Private Secretary Uditha Lokubandara, Former Minister Johnston Fernando and Former Western Provincial Minister Upali Kodikara.
