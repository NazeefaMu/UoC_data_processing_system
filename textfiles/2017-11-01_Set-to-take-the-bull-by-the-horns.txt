Set to take the bull by the horns


	



 

The Blue party members of the JO met the other day to take a decision on a collective stand they should take when they attend the special meeting with Number One scheduled for a day in the first week of next month.

 


Some of the members openly wondered whether there would be any purpose in attending a meeting with Number One. However, some others argued there was no harm in meeting the big man when summoned. 


Arguments for and against attending the meeting were being bandied about when one of them came up with a brain wave. “Let us first ask Number One whether he was summoning us as the head of the party or as the head of the government.” 


“Yes, yes. Go on!” the others urged him to go ahead with the proposition.


“If he says that he is summoning the meeting as the head of the government, we can say that we do not wish to have anything to do with the Greens in the government! If he says that he is calling us as the head of the party, let us tell him, ‘Speak to us after ending the union with the Greens!’.  And they all hailed this idea.


They also decided to keep mum about their decision until they receive a formal invitation.
