The Government is to build a separate new terminal at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) for the use of domestic flights in order to promote domestic air travel for the benefit of tourists, with the development of all domestic airports and using bigger aircraft.

The Cabinet Approval was granted for a proposal made for this purpose jointly by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs and State Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Asoka Abeysinghe last week.

Accordingly, the National Agency for Public-Private Partnership (NAPPP), with the assistance of the Director General Civil Aviation (DGCA) has called for Expression of Interests (EOIs) to set up scheduled domestic air services and five investment proposals have been received

They are- Saffron Aviation, FITS Aviation, SJ Global Investments, Lotus Air and IWS Aviation.

These companies are ready to use bigger aircraft with more seating capacity up to 118 seats for domestic flights from their own investment.

These Expressions of Interest (EOI) s have been evaluated by a committee composing Director General of Civil Aviation, the NAPPP Chairman and Executive Director Airport and Aviation Services.

Based on the evaluation of the proposals made by prospective investors and several post-bid discussions, a few recommendations have been made by the committee:

Each of those who responded to the EOI may submit applications to the DG-CA for required licenses, permits and facilities for operations and such permits shall be provided on a first come first served basis.

The domestic terminal to be created at BIA for common use on identified AASL land. Also, there is no hangar space at BIA for each operator separately, but one hangar to be constructed for maintenance work of all domestic operators.

A portion of Apron D at the BIA to be designated as Domestic Apron for use of domestic flight enabling application of different charging mechanisms and avoiding possible complaints by foreign airlines for discriminatory practices at the international airport.

Hangar space to be provided at Ratmalana for night parking of aircraft as this cannot be done at BIA.

Batticaloa, Sigiriya, Palali, Hingurakgoda, Koggala and Trincomalee to be made available in Phase 1 for scheduled carriers on a needs basis.

Domestic aviation needs to be carried out under the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) rules in conformity with international standards. As such, CAA and SLAF would jointly work out modalities for Trincomalee, Sigiriya, Palali, Hingurakgoda and Koggala airports to ensure that all civilian operations at these airports are carried out under CAA rules.

Self-handling by private operators will be permitted other than at BIA. Ground handling charges and cargo rates OF BIA to be revised downward for domestic carriers in consultation with Sri Lankan Airlines.

Suitable arrangements to be made for fuel supply at each airport through SLAF or CPC. Allocation of slots will be subject to providing priority to international, SLAF and VIP air traffic as determined by DGCA

Due to constraints faced by private operators, the DGCA in consultation with the Ministry of Defense and UDA to identify few locations in Colombo City for passenger pick-up and drop-off. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
