Several Districts throughout the country might experience a rise in temperature up to about 34 Celsius, as the sun would shine directly over Sri Lanka, the Meteorological Department said today.

Duty Meteorologist of the department said the sun would be aligned directly above Sri Lanka from April 5 to 15 as it enters from Hambantota District and leaves over the Jaffna District.

“During this period the country may experience a rise in temperature,” he said.

Meanwhile, Department today announced that showers or thundershowers would occur at most parts of the country after 2.00 p.m.

It said the showers could be expected in the Western and Southern coastal areas during the morning.

Heavy rain falls above 75 mm could be expected at some places particularly in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Uva and Southern provinces.

There may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers.

General public was requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity.

“Meanwhile, showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in the sea area off the coast extending from Batticaloa to Puttalam via Hambantota, Galle and Colombo.

“Winds would be westerly to south-westerly or variable in direction and speed will be 20-30kmph.

“Wind speed can increase up to 40 kmph in the sea areas off the coast extending from Puttalam to Kankesanthurai via Mannar.”
