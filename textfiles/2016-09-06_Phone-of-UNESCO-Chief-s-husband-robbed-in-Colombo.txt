A mobile phone worth over Rs. 45,000 belonging to the husband of UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova had been stolen from at a five-star hotel in Colombo during her recent visit to Sri Lanka, police said.

However, the police arrested a suspect-a drug addict- from the Slave Island area yesterday in connection with the robbery.

The Fort Police launched an inquiry, after the husband of the UNESCO’s top officer lodged a complaint stating that his mobile phone had been robbed while he was at the swimming pool of the hotel with her wife on August 15.

After monitoring CCTV footage at the hotel, the police identified the suspect. After questioning the suspect, police found the mobile phone from a phone shop in Kotahena. The phone had been sold for Rs.200.

The shop owner was also arrested for possession of a stolen item. Police are investigating how the suspect entered the hotel premises despite private security being deployed at the hotel. (Indika Ramanayake)
