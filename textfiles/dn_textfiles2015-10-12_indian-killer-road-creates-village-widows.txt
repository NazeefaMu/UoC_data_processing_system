Indian killer road creates village of widows

INDIA: For developing India, dangerous and potholed roads have long been a way of life.
But one highway running through a village in the southern state of Telangana has gained a dire reputation, blamed for the deaths of scores trying to cross it.
A bypass road of national highway 44 snakes through Peddakunta village, cutting off the community from its headquarters on the other side.
Since the road was built in 2006, Peddakunta has been dubbed the “village of highway widows” with only one male adult left among the huts of 35 families. The rest of the village comprises women, children and the elderly. Some 35 male residents have been killed in Peddakunta trying to reach the other side, locals say. “My husband died in a bypass road accident and so did my brother and my father. There are no men to look after us in the family,” Kurra Asli, 23, told AFP, holding up a faded photograph of her husband. Another widow held up a black and white printout of her dead husband, his body laying on the bypass, his left foot crushed.
Locals have demanded a foot bridge or tunnel so they can safely cross the four-lane stretch to reach the headquarters to collect monthly pensions or find employment in other villages.
India has some of the world's deadliest roads with more than 230,000 fatalities annually, ccording to the World Health Organization.
