US warns citizens against travel to UK


	



 

Donald Trump was embroiled in a new row last night after Washington said the UK was as dangerous as countries he has described as ‘s***holes’.   


Security advice issued by the State Department ranks Britain on par with the Congo and Zimbabwe, with US travellers warned about ‘heightened risks to safety and security’.   


It comes amid the continuing fall-out from Mr. Trump’s decision to cancel a trip to London next month – and growing global anger over his reported remarks about the number of citizens of ‘s***hole’ countries in Africa and the developing world being allowed to enter America.   


Under a new system, the US now divides countries into four levels of danger for 
its citizens.   


Level 1 is deemed as safe as staying in America, while Level 4 means ‘do not travel’.   
The UK is classed at Level 2, the same as the Congo, Zimbabwe and Algeria.   


Under its advice for the UK, the State Department says its citizens should ‘exercise increased caution’ because of the threat of terrorism.
