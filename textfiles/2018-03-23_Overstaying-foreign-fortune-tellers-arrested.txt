Four Indian nationals, who were illegally remaining in the country while working as fortune tellers by violating their visa regulations, were nabbed by the Department of Immigration and Emigration yesterday in Mannar.

Officials of the Department’s Investigation Division carried out several raids in Mannar and seized three male Indian nationals and one female.

Out of those arrested three persons including the female were working as astrologers who had made their living through soothsaying and performing bogus black magic. The other male had reportedly been engaged in the fisheries trade.

According to Immigration Assistant Controller Ports M G V Kariyawasam, all four foreigners had arrived in the country on short-stay tourist visas a couple of months ago and had overstayed.

The foreigners, who were between the ages of 30 – 36, were to be removed from the country on the instructions of Immigration and Emigration Controller General Nihal Ranasinghe. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
