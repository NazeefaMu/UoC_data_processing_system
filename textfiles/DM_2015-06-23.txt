AxIB launches reinsurance brokering, actuary advice operations
	
By Chandeepa WettasingheAx Insurance Brokers (Pvt.) Ltd (AxIB) launched its operations last week to provide the insurance industry of Sri Lanka with reinsurance brokering and actuary advice, in partnership with NMG Consulting, the largest provider of general insurance actuary advice in Sri Lanka.
The reinsurance space is not being provided analytics. The reinsurance business was Rs.3 billion in 1998. It has gone up to Rs.9 billion in 2013. Since big international brokers wont come, we found a gap, AxIB Managing Director Roshan Perera said.
He further added that AxIB is currently in negotiations with a large international reinsurance company to expand its service base in Sri Lanka.
Currently, the state-owned National Insurance Trust Fund claims over 80 percent of the reinsurance market, as regulations require primary insurance businesses to cede 30 percent of their liabilities to the state institution.
NMG Consulting Partner Matthew Maguire said that since the Sri Lankan insurance industry is capitalized above the risk-based capital requirements, the industry will be moving into an optimization phase, giving AxIB a golden opportunity.
The industry is moving into an optimization phase of linking business plans to capital requirements. They will attempt to find the optimal mix in business, pricing structures, reinsurance and assets and also go into enterprise resource management and stress testing, he said.
Perera said that for the past 15 years, the gross loss ratio in the local industry was lesser than the net loss, unlike in other countries, showing a good pattern of profitability.
Maguire said that while 80 percent of the insurance industry is still comprised of motor insurance, trends show medical insurance having strong growth. AxIB was formed earlier this year, following the purchase of Asset Eye Insurance Brokers (Pvt.) Ltd in October 2014.
It will be approaching every major insurance company in Sri Lanka with the support of NMG Consulting to jump start its business in the coming weeks.

BoC-GMOA sponsor medical interns website
	
Bank of Ceylon (BoC) recently joined with the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to upgrade the medical interns website www.medicalinterns.lk.
The said website facilitates medical interns to enhance their knowledge and skills. This also lays a platform for the members to communicate concerns that arise on the job and to obtain the guidance and support needed. 
A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was singed recently at the BoC head office Colombo 1, to extend banks sponsorship to develop the website.
The banks Chief Marketing Officer Dr. Indunil Liyanage and Assistant General Manager Marketing K.P. Anandanadeeshan signed on behalf of the bank and Assistant Secretary Dr. H.N.D. Soysa and Treasurer Dr. W.I.N. Wijesooriya signed on behalf of the GMOA.
Dr. M.L.D.S. Saman Abeywardena, Dr. E.K.G.D. Chandika Epitakaduwa from the GMOA and BoC Chief Manager Consumer Credit Mahinda Hettiarachchi also participated in the event.
The bank has established a good working relationship with the GMOA and its members over a period of time. The bank also has its Regent Street branch to cater to the needs of the Colombo General Hospital doctors, medical staff and in coming patients.
The GMOA Sri Lanka was established in 1926 and currently has over 16,000 members. It provides extensive support to medical professionals in the country in terms of knowledge and skill development.
The GMOA has also initiated the interns programme as a preparatory course for doctors who were awaiting internship. Consultants of major disciplines, medical administrators and legal officers participate as resource personnel in the programme which addresses both theoretical and practical aspects. BoC is proud to have sponsored this website in aiding doctors to update their knowledge, sharpen their skills and align their attitudes in rapidly changing medical science.
Recognizing the value of members of the GMOA, BoC offers special personal loan facilities for its members. With a minimum security and attractive interest rate and flexible repayment period the doctors can avail themselves a personal loan facility up to a maximum of Rs.6 million for maximum repayment period up to seven years.
However, this special benefit is offered only for medical professionals as they can obtain personal loans up to a maximum of Rs.10 million depending on their repayment capacity earned from their professional income. Doctors can also obtain a special housing loan facility in collaboration with the Health Ministry for a low interest rate. BoC recognizes the GMOA members with a specially endorsed GMOA affinity credit card that is linked to amazing seasonal offers provided by exclusive service providers.
BoCs Prestige Plus current account also provides tailor-made facilities to suite the busy schedule of professionals. Those benefits include a personalized cheque book, no joining fees involved for BoC credit cards, BoC Internet banking facility and special rates when applying for air tickets via BoC Travels (Pvt.) Ltd. BoC also offers leasing facilities for doctors at a special concessionary interest rate.
BoC earned global recognition as one of the top 1000 banks in the world, (country rank No.1) as listed by The Banker Magazine (UK) in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The bank claimed its award as the only Sri Lankan brand recognized as one of Asias Best Brands in 2013 by the Chief Marketing Officers Council (CMO Council) based in Mumbai, India. Brand Finance Lanka ranked BoC as the countrys No. 1 brand for the last seven consecutive years.
The bank has passed exceptional milestones in recent years such as becoming the first to earn over Rs.1.0 trillion assets and over 1,000 customer touch points covering all parts of Sri Lanka. Focusing on the banks achievement, Fitch Rating Lanka ranked BoC at AA+(lka), which is the highest rating awarded to a local commercial bank and AAA from ICRA (lk). BoC maintains international presence with branches in Chennai, Male, Seychelles and a subsidiary in London.

ComBank makes dream of being a millionaire achievable
	
Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC (ComBank), Sri Lankas benchmark private sector bank, has just launched a new, aspiration-linked savings account that offers account holders an opportunity to become millionaires in a short span of two to six years. In this interview, the banks Deputy General Manager Personal Banking Chandana Gunasekera elaborates on the Commercial Bank Millionaire Account and why it is one of the most exciting new savings products to reach the market in a long time.
Excerpts:What was the thinking behind the launch of the Commercial Bank Millionaire Account
This is a product that was born out of a brainstorming session involving the banks senior managers and regional managers, who have a good understanding of the banking needs of the masses as a result of their constant interaction with our existing as well as potential customers. It was felt that there is a need in the market for a product that will motivate saving on a structured basis among the younger segment in particular. When we discussed this, we realised the potential for a product that is target-linked, affordable and short term, so that a clear, achievable benefit becomes the motivating factor. The view was that becoming a millionaire is still very much a milestone that could be aspirational for a large segment of our target market and so, we designed the Millionaire Account that offers depositors the possibility of becoming a millionaire in as little as three years.How does this product work
The beauty of this product is its simplicity and affordability. All it requires is for the depositor to choose the savings period, between two and six years, based on how much he or she can afford to deposit each month. A monthly deposit of Rs.38,800 for two years, guarantees the depositor an account balance of Rs.1 million at the end of the two years. If a depositor cannot afford to set aside Rs.38,800 a month, the period of saving can be extended up to six years, with a correspondingly lower monthly deposit for every year that is added on. To become a millionaire in six years, for example, the monthly deposit required is just Rs.11,225. Depositors can simply make a standing order for the transfer of their monthly deposit for the pre-agreed duration and collect their million at the end of the saving period.Wouldnt a depositor be able to achieve the same result via a normal savings account
Interest rates can, and do fluctuate, so a normal savings account holder will find it difficult to calculate how much will be saved at the end of a specific period. The Millionaire Account guarantees the target balance, protecting the depositor against interest rate fluctuations. Additionally, a normal savings account does not require a commitment on a monthly deposit, so the motivation to keep depositing a fixed amount each month is self-generated. What we find is that generally, saving via a bank savings account is somewhat unsystematic in that people deposit whatever they can, whenever they can and also tend to withdraw whenever there is a need. As a result, the account balance in a normal savings account also fluctuates, as there is no savings target.How does the Commercial Bank Millionaire Account compare against other investment options such as fixed deposits (FDs) or treasury bills (TBs)
It compares very well for one very compelling reason: affordability. If someone wants to build up a balance of Rs.1 million through an investment in a fixed deposit or in treasury bills, that person would need to have the funds for a large initial investment. For example, to have a balance of Rs.1 million in three years via a fixed deposit that pays 6 percent interest per annum, the depositor would have to start with more than Rs.800,000. With the Millionaire Account, the process can begin with Rs.25,000 and requires the same amount over three years. Therefore, this product is infinitely more affordable, making it accessible to a much larger segment of the populace than FDs or TBs.Can this product also cater to those who want to raise more than a million rupees
Yes, it can, because we offer the option of saving in multiples of Rs.1 million, up to a maximum of Rs.10 million. Depositors who wish to raise more than Rs.1 million may increase their monthly deposit according to the number of millions they wish to raise, up to a maximum of Rs.10 million. For example, if a depositor can afford to deposit Rs.50,000 a month for three years, he or she will have an account balance of Rs.2 million.
Our intention is to encourage the middle-class segment, young professionals and executives, to look at saving in a structured, target-linked manner, so that their savings can make a significant contribution to their future.What other benefits would this product offer
Building up an account balance of Rs.1 million can provide a good platform for many things. If the money is not required for an immediate purpose like a wedding or higher education, the account can be used, for example, as equity to obtain a higher loan from the bank for another purpose. Therefore, the Millionaire Account can be the beginning of a long-term relationship with Sri Lankas largest and strongest private sector bank. This product is a good articulation of Commercial Banks brand promise of For a Better Future.What would happen if, for some reason, a Millionaire Account holder cannot keep up with the required monthly deposit
We have provided a grace period of up to two months with a nominal penalty payment in the event of an interruption in deposits. However, if an account holder wishes to exit the scheme, there is provision to do that as well and the bank will pay the accumulated capital along with interest at an adjusted rate based on how much is in the account. Account holders may also nominate a beneficiary to receive the capital and interest in the event of the premature demise of the account holder.In conclusion, can you summarise why you think the Commercial Bank Millionaire Account is one of the most exciting new savings products in the market
This account is fundamentally affordable, flexible, easy to understand, hassle-free and aspirational. To many salaried workers with day-to-day expenses, becoming a millionaire in three to six years can seem a daunting, even impossible dream. But the Commercial Bank Millionaire Account shows how it can be done, in partnership with the countrys strongest and most stable financial institution. It can provide a great launching pad for a better future for thousands of young Sri Lankans.

Maggi Noodle samples sent to ITI for testing
	
	Health Service (DGHS) Director General Palitha Mahipala yesterday directed that samples of Maggi Noodles, particularly popular among children and other varieties of noodles be tested at the Industrial Technical Institute (ITI) to determine their lead content.
	Dr. Mahipala's directive comes in the wake of the multi national global food giant in India deciding a fortnight ago to temporarily take the Maggi brand of noodles off the shelves countrywide.
	The directive came after several Indian states banned the product which is alleged to contain high levels of lead-making it unsafe for human consumption.
	Indian states, including Uttarakhand, New Delhi, Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir have either banned the noodles or are conducting further tests to confirm whether the product contains higher than the permissable level of lead. However, the food giant said in a statement that Maggi noodles were completely safe and had been a trusted snack in India for more than 30 years.
	The trust of our consumers and the safety of our products is our first priority. Unfortunately, recent developments and unfounded concerns about the product have lead to confusion among the consumers to such an extent that we have decided to withdraw the product off the shelves, despite the product being safe, the company said in a statement.
	The samples Maggi noodles have already been sent to the ITI for tests and other samples will follow.
	Dr. Mahipala said the next step would be decided on the receipt of the test report.(Sandun Jayasekara)

Six million votes not only for MS but also for UNP: Akila
	
	The United National Party (UNP) said today it was certain to obtain almost six million votes at the general elections similar to the January 8 presidential election where the UNP and the common opposition were able to muster the most number of votes for the then opposition candidate.
	UNP Media Spokesman Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told a media conference held at the UNP headquarters Sirikotha that the people voted not only for President Maithripala Sirisena as the common opposition candidate but also for the UNP.
	Excluding those who voted on behalf of the TNA, the JVP and the JHU, the rest of the votes were on behalf of the UNP. We are not expecting a new mandate from the people at the next general election but only a re-confirmation of the votes obtained at the January 8 presidential election, Mr.Kariyawasam said.
	"The UNP is well-known in the annals of Sri Lanka's political history as the only party with a flexible and disciplined administration that has not shied away from facing the many arrows shot at it by its ill-meaning opponents. These bitter experiences have motivated party members to strive hard towards achieving a definitive victory and the forming of a UNP-led government," he said.
	Speaking on the 20th Amendment, UNP MP and Minister P. Harrison said even though the Opposition claimed that the UNP had no clear stance on it, the UNP MPs would vote in favour of 20A and extend their fullest support for its successful passage in parliament.
	He said the reason behind the accidentally appointed opposition leader Nimal Siripala de Silvas behaviour is obvious because those who say they are from the SLFP or the UPFA are afraid the UNP's certain victory at the general election.
	The so-called Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala is suffering from 'asai bayai symptoms on 20A. He may be wanting to support 20A, but afraid of peoples positive response towards the UNP after it is passed. People will trust because even as a minority government we fulfilled the pledges given to the people, he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Sri Lanka at high risk of heart diseases: Report
	
	People in South Asian countries including Sri Lanka have a higher risk of heart disease at an early age than any other ethnic group, says a report released by Stanford South Asian Translational Heart Initiative.
	Men appear to face a slightly higher threat of the disease than women, the report said.
	People from South Asia -- India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka -- have a four times greater risk of heart disease than the general population, the report said adding it has a much greater chance of having a heart attack before the age of 50.
	Heart attacks strike South Asian men and women at younger ages are more deadly compared to any other ethnic group. Almost one in three in this group will die from heart disease before age 65, the Daily Star said.
	
	Research has shown that even in infancy, children of South Asian heritage may have high levels of cholesterol and lipoproteins in their blood.The five reasons behind South Asians are at risk for heart disease:
	1. High amounts of Lipoprotein (a), or LP(a) - LP(a), is a type of LDL cholesterol, which is commonly thought of as bad cholesterol.
	2. High amounts of homocysteine - Homocysteine is an amino acid that your body produces, and it is strongly associated with an increased risk of heart disease.
	3. High levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) - High hs-CRP levels are associated with both heart disease and diabetes.
	4. Metabolic Syndrome - Having metabolic syndrome puts you at high risk for heart disease and diabetes. One third of South Asians have metabolic syndrome.
	5. Abdominal obesity - Many South Asians have a normal BMI, slim arms and legs, and a large belly. This is called abdominal obesity, and its more strongly associated with heart disease and diabetes than BMI.
	A high number of South Asians appear to be insulin resistant, a pre-diabetic condition in which the body does not process insulin efficiently.

	The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) today requested the Sri Lanka Customs to stop consignments of rejected Maggi Noodle from India being released to the importers because they are said to contain high levels of Mono Sodium Glutamate (MSG).
	The Indian High Commission had requested the CAA to ban the import such noodles to Sri Lanka from India.
	Responding to the written request, CAA Director General J.M.A. Douglas has written to the Customs asking it to prevent any Indian-rejected noodles entering the country for the safety of consumers. Both Singapore and Nepal had already banned the import of Maggi instant noodles from India, CAA Spokesman Udayajeewa Ekanayake said.

	Colombo Mayor A.J.M. Muzammil said yesterday that street vending would be allowed only on certain pavements in Pettah and nowhere else in the city.
	We have decided to allow street vending on certain pavements in Pettah, with the exception of 1st Cross Street. This is a temporary solution for the Ramazan season, and once we decide on a permanent solution they will be moved to other areas. Street vending will not be allowed anywhere else in the city, he said.
	He said that the decision to allow street hawkers on pavements again was reached because of political considerations.
	There was a lot of political interference in the decision to allow pavement hawking, because elections are coming up. Everybody wants to be the hero of the vendors, so I had to take that decision. But now everything has been sorted out, he said.
	Speaking to Daily Mirror, the mayor said that he did not take this decision for his own political advantage, and that such a rumour was spread as a politically motivated slander to discredit him. (Jehan Gunasekara)

	Islamic banking is a concept of Sharia Law, which prohibits the charging and receiving of interest rates. Islamic banking is one of the fastest growing sectors in the global banking industry and had been adopted by several countries, where the majority is not Muslim, BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera said at a media briefing after the meeting. The Thera also asked Parliament members, why they were mum on the issue in Parliament.
	He charged, the Sharia Law had made its way into the school system as well as into the legal system smoothly without being screened.
	We directly blame the previous government for not taking actions on the spread of Sharia Law as we showed them, who are behind these moves. An immediate discussion was called with the CB Governor to discuss the issue, which is a threat to Sri Lankan society, the Thera said.
	Meanwhile, BBS Chief Executive Officer Dilantha Vithanage addressing the media outside the Central Bank said that there was no legal basis to establish Islamic, Sharia or Halal Banking system in the country.
	These banking systems had been introduced through the weak points after the Banking Act-2005 was amended. According to information, it had been clearly mentioned that the Islamic banking system is a part of the Sharia Law. Sharia Law is not a law in Sri Lanka and this is totally against the Banking Law in Sri Lanka, he said.
	He said the Sharia banking system would alter the present Banking system, accounting system and financial fundamentals.
	He said that according to the documents presented supporting the introduction of Islamic banking, which is a key facet of the Sharia, was the prohibition of socially and morally harmful investment activities, in terms of Sharia Law. (Chaturanga Pradeep)CLICK HERE TO VIEW PICTURES
