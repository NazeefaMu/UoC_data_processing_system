A youngster from the Sri Lankan refugee camp at Uchapatti near Thirumangalam was arrested on Monday under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act for his misbehaviour with a minor girl from the camp.

According to a complaint filed by the mother of the 15-year-old girl, the youngster named S. Karan (21) forcefully entered their house when the girl was alone on Monday and tried to sexually misbehave with her. As she resisted his move, he ran away. The woman alleged that when she confronted him in the evening, he verbally abused her. Based on a complaint, the police arrested the youth. (Hindu)
