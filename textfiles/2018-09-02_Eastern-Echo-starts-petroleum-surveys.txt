The Minister said collecting data would be the initial work and within eight weeks Eastern Echo expected to the get the data.

“From there we will take the next step. We were very concerned and interested in getting the exploration started. We will know for sure that we would have gas and oil. We are on a positive track and we can’t give a date or what will happen in the future but to do exploration we need to have the data first,” he said.
