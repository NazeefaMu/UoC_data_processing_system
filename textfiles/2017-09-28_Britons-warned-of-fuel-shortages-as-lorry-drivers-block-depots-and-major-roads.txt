Britons travelling in France have been warned to expect petrol shortages as militant truck drivers took part in anti-government protests.  


Trade unions opposed to employment reforms by President Emmanuel Macron’s government started blocking fuel depots and major roads first thing yesterday morning.  
By midday there was chaos across the country, with vast traffic jams and pumps running dry, especially close to the Channel ports in northern France.  


‘Dozens of petrol stations have run dry because of panic buying, rather than because of the blockades’ said a spokesman for the CGT (General Confederation of Labour), France’s largest union.Mr Macron’s ministers had insisted there would be no shortages, and that police would be used to keep forecourts operating normally.  -Daily Mail
