Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa should light a lamp in honour of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe because it was he who saved MR from being branded as an international criminal, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.

He said it was the yahapalanaya government which prevented Sri Lanka from becoming a blotch in the world map.

The minister told a meeting of the UNP ‘balamandalaya in Matara on Sunday and pointed out that Mr. Rajapaksa and his fellow travellers in the joint opposition had got the opportunity to insult, abuse and attack the government in the global arena because this government had restored democracy in Sri Lanka.

“No one must forget the pathetic situation that prevailed in Sri Lanka before 2015. Sri Lanka was black mark in the world map as a result of the actions of one family and one dictator. There were allegations of violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) judicial and media suppression, breakdown in the rule of law and human rights abuses. Sri Lanka was branded a ‘pariah state’ and the entire global community was against Sri Lanka,” he said. “By the time, this government took office in January 2015, the UNHRC with the support of member countries had decided to initiate an international probe on Sri Lanka without our consent. One of the main tasks of the new government was to rebuild the confidence and respect on Sri Lanka among the global community.”

The minister said the rule by an oligarchy lost Sri Lanka the GSP+ and fish exports to the UE to Sri Lanka. "

The fuel price formula was introduce by the government to pass the benefit onto the consumer if there was a price drop in fuel in the global market. But unfortunately today we see the opposite of it. Mahinda Rajapaksa has not right to tale about fuel price formula because he did not bring down prices of fuel even after the Supreme Court ruled to that effect," he said. “We must get ready for an election soon. There will be three in 2019. Those elections are as important as the elections in 2015. All UNPers must work harder and be determined to win all three polls for the UNP."
