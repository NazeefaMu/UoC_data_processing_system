Pathfinder Foundation to launch Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives

The Pathfinder Foundation (PF) will launch the "Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives" on the 8th December, in Colombo at a ceremony officiated by Indian High Commissioner. Y K Sinha and PF Founder Milinda Moragoda.
A visiting delegation from the Pathfinder Foundation's Indian Track-2 Partner, Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF), will also participate at the opening. The high level 5 member VIF delegation will be headed by retired General Nirmala Chander Vij, former Indian Chief of Army Staff from 2002-2005.
Since its inception the Pathfinder Foundation has placed a special focus on identifying ways and means through which the Indo-Lanka bilateral relationship can be strengthened. In 2002, the apex body of the Pathfinder Foundation, the Milinda Moragoda Institute for People's Empowerment, set up the first Sri Lankan non-governmental demining project in collaboration with two Indian organizations, Horizon and Sarvatra. During the ensuing 10 years, this initiative was responsible for clearing a large number of land mines in the North and East of Sri Lanka.
For nearly a decade, the Pathfinder Foundation has put out regular briefs and held forums on various aspects of Indo-Lanka relations.
In 2012, with the assistance of the Indo-Lanka Foundation, the Pathfinder Foundation conducted a preliminary study on how Sri Lanka could integrate into India's manufacturing supply chain.
In the same year, together with the Manipal Global Education Services, PF conducted a Track-2 initiative, which resulted in the publication of the groundbreaking report: "Resetting Indo-Lanka Relations".
This document, which was prepared by a group of retired senior officials from the two countries, was presented to the then National Security Advisor of India and the Secretary to the President of Sri Lanka. In 2014 the Pathfinder Foundation together with the Indo-Lanka Foundation inaugurated the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Lecture, and invited respected Indian author and journalist M. J. Akbar to deliver the first lecture.
In 2014, the Pathfinder Foundation signed a Memorandum of Intent with the Vivekananda International Foundation.
As part of this understanding these two institutions have begun a Track-2 process that aims to devise a road map for Indo-Lanka relations for the short and medium term.
It is now the intention of the Pathfinder Foundation to build upon these activities by setting up a Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives aimed at bringing about a special focus on this important relationship.
