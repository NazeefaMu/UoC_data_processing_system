Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said today the new government has given less priority for national security which was crucial for the development process in the country.
“When we stabilised the security in the country, we were charged to be war fanatics. We can clearly see how the national security deteriorated during this short period,” he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa expressed these views at a function held at Ape Gama in Battaramulla to launch the election campaign of UPFA candidate Udaya Gammanpila.
Mr. Rajapaksa said some people charged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as a dictator but if it was so he would still be the president and I would be the defense secretary. Mr. Rajapaksa said some individuals who were with them had committed wrongdoings and that led to the downfall of their government.
“Mahinda Rajapaksa has identified those who committed wrongdoings. We are ready to rectify our mistakes based on the past experience,” he said.
Western Provincial Councillor Udaya Gammanpila said it was not Mahinda Rajapaksa who left on January 09 would be coming on August 19 but a fresh leader after rectifying his mistakes.(Ajith Siriwardana)
