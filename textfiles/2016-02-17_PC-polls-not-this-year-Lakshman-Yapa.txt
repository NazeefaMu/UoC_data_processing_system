The Provincial Council (PC) elections were unlikely this year, because the delimitation of the Wards in all the Districts had not yet been completed, State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said today.

He told a media briefing held at the Information Centre in Colombo that the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Mustapha was working hard to complete the delimitation process covering the entire country.

“The Government has allocated the necessary funds for this purpose and President Maithripala Sirisena is also keen to complete the work quickly as possible,” he said.

“The delimitation process is near completion in about six districts, for example the work in the Gampaha District is about 99 per cent complete,” the State Minister said.

“In such a situation the holding of PC elections this year is very unlikely.”

He said the PC elections could not be held in an instant without addressing the reasonable concerns of all stakeholders. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
