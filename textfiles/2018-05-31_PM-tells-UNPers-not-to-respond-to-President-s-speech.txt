Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told UNPers not to respond to the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.

Informed sources said the Premier had said this when he met party members including seniors at the UNP working committee meeting held at Sirikotha this morning and was responding to a suggestion made by young MPs that the party should respond to the President immediately.

“The ministers and MPs should not respond to the President but should resolve the problems faced by the people,” the Prime Minister had said. (Yohan Perera)
