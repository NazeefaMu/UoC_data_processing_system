Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today apologised for the burning of Jaffna Library in 1981 and urged the Joint Opposition to apologize for what happened during that time as well.

“The public library in Jaffna was burnt during a United National Party (UNP) Government in 1981. We know it was wrong and tender an apology for it,” he said.

“You too should tender an apology for the wrong things which your Government did," he told the Joint Opposition MPs, who was heckling at him at that time.

This House turned noisy when Mr. Wickremesinghe rose to answer a question posed by TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran, who opposed the move by the Ministry of Resettlement and Rehabilitation to construct per-fabricated houses in the war affected regions.

"We want to see that 80 percent of the houses in the North are reconstructed and are willing to discuss matters with the Northern representatives," the Prime Minister added. (Yohan Perera)
