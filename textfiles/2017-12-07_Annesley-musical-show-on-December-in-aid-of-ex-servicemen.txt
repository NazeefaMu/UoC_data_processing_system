A musical show titled Golden Hits of 70’s by Annesley Malawana and organised by the’ Sri Lanka Army Electrical & Mechanical Engineers Ex-Servicemen’s Association’ (SLEMEESA) will be held at the Bishop’s College Auditorium tomorrow (Friday, December 8, 2017) at 7.00 p.m, SLEMEESA said in a news release.   

Wijeya Newspapers is the media sponsors of the show.  

The SLEMEESA said that the event was organised with the prime purpose of raising funds to uplift and enhance the welfare activities provided to the members of SLEMEESA.  

“The aims are to foster the Esprit de Corps and well-being of the Corps and to keep those served in or with the Corps of Sri Lanka Electrical & Mechanical Engineers in touch with one another, with a view to keeping alive a spirit of comradeship,” SLEMEESA said.  
It said:  

“As a corporate social responsibility, it is also planned to conduct at least one medical clinic per year in remote areas in order to assist our own citizens who do not enjoy or have limited access to such facilities,” it said.  

“Through the show it is envisaged to raise funds for the association which will be utilised in several ways to provide welfare for its members which includes death donations, urgent medical support, spectacles and various other financial support for those who are in need of such assistance,” SLEMEESA said.   SLEMEESA consists of retired officers and men of the Corps of Sri Electrical & Mechanical Engineers of the Sri Lanka Army, which is responsible to ensure the operational fitness of all types of vehicles including armored vehicles, weapons ranging from small arms to heavy artillery, optical and biomedical equipment, cooling equipment and office equipment in the Army.  

SLEMEESA was inaugurated in 1993 and is the only organisation representing veterans of the Corps of EME with an affiliation to the Sri Lanka Ex-Servicemen’s Association (SLESA) which is the umbrella organisation for the Armed Services Ex-Servicemen’s Associations in Sri Lanka having member associations in the Army, Navy & Air Force with over 40,000 veterans that consist of retired men and women of armed forces.
