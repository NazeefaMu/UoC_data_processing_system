A powerful fair private secretary of a white collar high-up at Diyawanna has got three women recruited as her personal assistants. 

 


According to the normal practice, a private secretary is given only one assistant, but in an unusual departure from this practice, this lady has got three assistants – all graduates to be at her beck and call. 


One of these three assistants is a close relative of the white collar high-up.  Another assistant is a school mate of the private secretary and the other assistant is also a relative of a politician hailing from Kegalle. 


The three assistants who are keen on doing some productive work while receiving a useful on the job-training in some department are said to be lamenting that they have been compelled to while away their precious time dancing attendance on the powerful private secretary.
