Lanka selected for inclusive mutual insurance

Sri Lanka is one among the five countries which has been selected for the development of inclusive mutual insurance for the next 5 years under the ICMIF's AOA 5-5-5 Inclusive Mutual Insurance initiative.
Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said the Philippines, Kenya, India and Sri Lanka and one Latin American nation has been selected based on their performance and potential as emerging markets in the insurance industry.
Delivering his keynote speech during the inaugural day of the International Cooperative and Mutual Insurance Federation's (ICMIF) three-day symposium, he said the forthcoming budget has proposed an Export Import Bank (EXIM). However he noted that the establishment of such a corporate institution was not solely sufficient to drive the country's exports.
Commending the initiatives of the International Cooperative Mutual Insurance Federation for its efforts to integrate Sri Lanka into its partnership program of attempting to reach out to 5 million underserved households in 5 countries, over 5 years, the Deputy Minister said we need to unlock the economic potential of the country.
"I must stress that while the government is here to serve the people, it realistically can't rescue a firm or industry at every turn. In fact, government rescue is a weak form of insurance."
Sri Lanka's export finance sector should be given due recognition since it lacked sufficient insurance whereas the sector was concerned, he said."
One longstanding, major problem in the insurance sector has been insuring against risks that affect rural communities.
For example, agricultural crop insurance is difficult.Insuring farmers against fluctuations in weather or bad harvests is a serious issue.
