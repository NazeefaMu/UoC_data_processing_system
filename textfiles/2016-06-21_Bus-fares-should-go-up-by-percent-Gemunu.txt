Bus fares should go up by five to six percent July 1 onwards, in keeping with the agreement with the National Transport Commission (NTC), Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said today.

According to the NTC the bus fare increment for this year was calculated as 3.2 percent, he said.
“Bus fare should be increased from five to six percent. The 3.2 percentage increase had come out due to calculation error,” he said.

“As LPBOA, we do not request 15 per cent increment. Five to six percent increment is bearable for the people in the country,” Wijeratne said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
