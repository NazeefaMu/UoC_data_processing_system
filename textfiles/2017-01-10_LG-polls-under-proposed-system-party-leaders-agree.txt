Leaders of political parties representing Parliament, have decided to hold the forthcoming local government election under the proposed mixed system, a party leader said.

The decision had been taken during a special party leaders meeting, that was held to discuss the delimitation committee report. The meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the party leader said after attending the meeting yesterday at the Parliamentary complex.

He also said that they would discuss about the matter in-depth after the Prime Minister returns from Switzerland.

Accordingly, during the meeting, Ministers Rauf Hakeem, Rishad Bathiudeen and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake spoke in favour of the existing systems as there are a few shortcomings in the proposed new system.

The SLFP and Joint Opposition had spoken in favour of the proposed new system.

After heated arguments, the SLFP and UNP collectively agreed to hold the local government election under the proposed system. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)
