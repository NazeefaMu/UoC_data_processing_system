The Frontline Socialist Party, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), Hela Urumaya, Joint Opposition and several trade unions today pledged their support to the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) to form a new alliance to abolish the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).

In a press briefing where four political parties, trade union representatives and student unions participated, the GMOA announced the means of defeating Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne’s alleged move to violate the Medical Ordinance and establish the SAITM by forming the new alliance, called ‘SAITM Virodi Jana Pawra’.

Representatives of the unions in the fields of health, electricity, petroleum, education, water, postal, ports, transport had participated in the event.

Meanwhile, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soysa said they would hold a national convention to gather all the anti SAITM protesters on July 20.

He said the new alliance would carry its fight until the government abolishes the SAITM.

Dr. De Soysa warned the government that they would take stern action if the government moves further with its stance to continue the SAITM.

He said the Government has two choices left which is to safeguard the SAITM and watch it topple or abolishes the SAITM and remain in power.

It was learnt that the GMOA has formed the country’s biggest alliance with the biggest private and public trade unions and political parties. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
