Little Grey and Little White will leave their concrete tank for a brand-new sanctuary
 

After seven years in captivity performing tricks at a Chinese water park, two super cute beluga whales are heading to Iceland for retirement.  Little Grey and Little White will leave their concrete tank for a brand-new sanctuary created by the Sea Life Trust. the process involves transforming a rocky oceanic inlet covering 32,000 square meters into what will be the world’s first open sea sanctuary for whales and dolphins.  As they were both born in captivity, Little Grey and Little White are currently learning skills to help them survive in the wild ahead of their long and difficult journey. Relocating the two whales will be the first time that a captive beluga whale has ever been released to an ocean sanctuary, hopefully setting a precedent for other performing whales and dolphins in the future.
