	The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) today alleged that a 'huge tax fraud' had been committed on the income earned from the Latin Musical Idol Enrique Iglesias’s “Sex and Love Tour” live concert held last Sunday at the CR&FC Grounds.
	Municipal Commissioner V.K.A. Anura said this fraud had been revealed after an investigation was carried out by the CMC treasurer.
	He said the exact amount of the defaulted payment could not be ascertained yet because the accounts were still being finalised.
	“The tickets had to be approved and sealed by the Colombo Municipality. However, we had found that the organizers had sold some tickets which have not been in the sealed packets so that the real income generated from the concert is higher than the amount in the accounts they submitted to us. This is illegal,” Mr. Anura said.
	The Commissioner said legal action would be taken against the organizers of Enrique Iglesias' live concert “Sex and Love Tour." (Piyumi Fonseka and Chaturanga Pradeep)
