The Police Department today announced that IGP Pujith Jayasundara had not issued an order to restrict sending daily Police news to private media institutions.

“Several media outlets had reported stating that the IGP had instructed the daily updates be sent only to State media institutions,” the Police said in a statement.

However, the statement did not mention the reason for not sending daily Police news updates to media institutions from December 21.

Earlier, the National Police Commission (NPC) Secretary Ariyadasa Cooray said that Police was under obligation to provide news to private media institutions, especially when the Right to Information (RTI) Act is in effect in the country. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
