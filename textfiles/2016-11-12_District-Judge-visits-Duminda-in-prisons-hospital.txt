Two days after the conviction Duminda Silva was admitted to the prison hospital after he caught fever and there was also an arrangement to send him to the Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital on the recommendation of doctors, he said.

It is also said this judge had come to the prison on the day Duminda Silva was convicted and her entry to the prison had also been registered in the documents at the gate of the Welikada Prison.
