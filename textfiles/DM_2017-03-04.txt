A gentleman and philanthropist par excellence
	
The third of March is the birth anniversary of the late Charles Henry de Soysa, commemorated annually by his descendants, others connected in one way or another with the schools he built, Prince and Princess of Wales Colleges, Moratuwa, the De Soysa Hospital for Women, the hospitals of Lunawa, Marawilla and Panadura, and by the thousands who have benefitted in a myriad ways through a visionary who was far ahead of his time. It has been said of him that he had a golden touch and that everything he began became a goldmine. But what is most admirable about his success was that he shared what he had with others. This was as rare then, as it is now.
He did all this, not as a surefire passport to popularity, but by showing amazing vision in the fields he chose; education, health and land, for his largesse to one and all, which showed that he thought far beyond the time and age he lived in.
In the era in which he lived, prejudice and bias were blatantly believed in and widely-practised. But, although he donated generously to the development of his hometown Moratuwa, in education, religion and health, his generosity to other is totally unconnected with him, either by ties of blood or business interests; are a living testament to his thinking, which was far beyond the peripheries of those existing divisions, strictly adhered to in every sphere of work or activity at that time. Again, this was an era of gracious living, gentility, peace and contentment, in which he could have lived a life of ease, in an ivory tower, far removed from reality, with the wealth he inherited. But he worked hard to increase his wealth, not for his family only, but shared it with the less fortunate, improved their lifestyles and gave them opportunities, opening doors and windows to them which enhanced and gave them a better deal in life. He strove hard all his life to release people from poverty, which is another kind of enclosure. He was among the Founders of the Ceylon National Congress, from which emerged the United National Party and was the first Ceylonese to start a bank.
Today, we live in a world of much publicised philanthropy where corruption reigns supreme. We live in constant fear of violence, danger, plunder and rape. We seem to thrive on conquest and it is only now that we see some hope in achieving conflict resolution. Efforts towards permanent peace are only being set in place now, after years of nothing being done to get this. This turbulent atmosphere we lived in until recently was ruled by greed and cruelty to man by man, while the Rule of Law was blown away, out of sight.
As a man, the late Charles Henry was one who set incredibly high standards of integrity, punctuality and dedication, and expected his family and those who worked for him to follow his example in these virtues. Many legends about him are related time and time again, within the family, among past and present students of Prince and Princess of Wales Colleges, doctors and patients who have been at the various hospitals and institutions donated by him to the nation. Among them are, that at the precise time he was born, a cock had crowed which was rare and said to denote that it was a singularly fortunate person who was born at this time. His donation of The De Soysa Hospital for Women is said to have been inspired by his seeing a woman in labour, crying out for help on the roadside, while he was out riding his horse. He organised swift medical help for her and the idea of this hospital and the many others he donated later in various parts of the country stemmed from this episode.
The Alfred House which he built specially for the banquet in honour of the visit to Ceylon by Prince Alfred, the then Prince of Wales, is yet another fascinating legend, almost akin to a fairytale. It is sad that neither the Alfred House or the special cutlery and crockery of gold and precious stones made for the banquet no longer belong to the family.
Apart from the hospitals, schools, churches, temples and kovils, he donated 10,000 sterling pounds and 87 acres in Kanatte to the State for a model farm. A hundred poverty-stricken farmers in Walapane were gifted paddy fields and houses. His generosity was not confined to our shores but reached far beyond.
The Great Ormond street hospital for children in London where a plaque mentions his contribution, The Brompton Hospital, Royal Free Hospital, the Victoria Chest Hospital, the hospital for accidents to dock labourers, all benefitted from his largesse, which has had no equal up to date. It was just recently that I heard another tale about him. The late Isaac de Silva who was a relative of Lady Catherine de Soysa, wife of the late Charles Henry, had been a close advisor and friend of his. When the late Charles Henry built Prince and Princess of Wales Colleges, the late Isaac who was a devout Methodist got the Methodist schools in the area closed down and saw that the pupils there went to Prince and Princess of Wales Colleges. The late Isaac was a scholar and wrote the first Sinhala novel in 1888, which was published by the Wesley Press. It was later translated into English by him titled The Happy and Miserable Families. A copy of this is in the British Museum and in our museum here in Colombo.
As the great granddaughter of the late Charles Henry, I am filled with a great sense of pride, combined with deep humility, that the blood of a man such as this flows in my veins and in those of my children. It is no wonder that some who are not his descendants, but only connected to him through his wife claim that they are his descendants. An awareness that our family history is prized and beyond value has made me a repository from the past. The late CHs life is an inspiration and an example, not only to us as his descendants, but to each and every citizen of our country.

From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.

Adaptation to local context a better proposition than remake
	

The problem with Sarigama is that it attempts to be the Sound of Music. If its filmmaker Somaratne Balasuriya had tried a local adaptation, it would have worked better.

Sarigama is absolutely faithful to the 1965 original. It is a remake minus the second half of the story. It would be very difficult to transpose the Von Trapp familys escape from the Nazis to a local context, and the director has wisely opted to omit that part.
The story revolves around an exuberant young woman with a hopeless goal of becoming a nun, a stern, widowed Naval commander with a heart of gold under a rough exterior and his seven impossible children (interestingly, Austria has no navy, though from 1958 to 2006 the Austrian army operated patrol boats on River Danube).
This story has been transposed to Sri Lanka, include the period settings. Much of the dialogue and indeed many of the scenes are similar. This means comparisons are inevitable. Sound of Music became such a landmark film that no Western filmmaker attempted a remake (except for a T.V. series a decade ago) because that would be a daunting task. Apart from the electrifying performance of Julie Andrews as Maria (with Christopher Plummer as the unsmiling naval captain playing perfect counterpoint), it would be hard to better the Rodgers-Hammerstein musical score and songs such as Do Re Mi and Edelweiss.
But an adaptation to a Sri Lankan context with liberal changes from the original would be a much better proposition than a remake of this classic. Thats where Sarigama fails to take off despite some beautiful backdrops. Much of the cast is able. Ashan Dias as the dour naval captain is excellent, Malani Fonseka as the mother superior is ever dependable and Pooja Umashankar as Maria offers a fine performance while the children, ranging in age from tots to age sixteen (made older for some reason in this version) are convincing. But there is always the inevitable problem of comparisons with the original.
This would not matter to audiences who have not seen it. As said earlier, most of the scenes faithfully follow the original, and the director is able to carry it off. But one key scene fails to come alive, and that is the famous You are sixteen, going on seventeen sequence where 17-year-old Liesl and her boyfriend Rolfe perform a dance of love in the garden summerhouse during a rainstorm. It absolutely fails to generate the kind of visual magic and cinematic electricity generated by the original.
However, if one assumes that many of those came to see Sarigama havent seen the Sound of Music, though the DVD became available everywhere after Sarigama opened, the film could work for them. But a subsequent viewing of the original will show where Sarigama truly fails to deliver, which is in the sound of its music. Rohana Weerasinghe is a capable musician but neither his score nor the songs come anywhere close to the splendour of the original, whether its the unbridled exuberance of Do Re Mi or the more restrained joy of My Favourite Things to the elegiac elegance of Edelweiss. Without that rousing score, the Sound of Music just wouldnt be the same.
Just an afterthought: since this follows so faithfully so much of the original, whats wrong in remaking the original music (Unless there is a copyright problem involved. But would whoever owns the music now bother with a lawsuit if songs are sung in Sinhala to the original sound track) Sa Ri Ga would sound just as sweet to the ear as Do Re Mi but only if the music is right.

Army Jawan found dead after accusing senior officers of harassment
	
Thiruvananthapuram, (Hindustan Times), 03.03.2017- An army jawan from Kerala was found dead near his camp in Nashik, barely a few days after he accused senior officers of harassment, his family members said on Friday. 
The body of gunner Roy Mathew, 33, was recovered on Thursday near his camp in Maharashtra. 
Though the army believes it to be a case if suicide, family members of gunner Roy Mathew, 33, said they suspect foul play. They have demanded a probe into the circumstances leading to
his death. 
The alleged suicide comes amid of a spate of allegations of poor working conditions and harassment faced by jawans in the armed forces. 
Roy went missing on Monday, a day after calling up his wife at Kollam to say that he had made a big mistake, an apparent reference to an interview he had given to a local television channel accusing senior officers of mistreatment at the Nashik camp. 
His interview to a Marathi language channel was airedon Monday. 
Though the channel had promised to keep his identity a secret, Roy told his wife, his senior officials came to know about it. Roys wife, Fini Mathew, said after the call he was incommunicado for last three days.

Bangladesh arrests cafe attackers spiritual leader
	

DHAKA AFP March3, 2017- Bangladesh police said Friday they had arrested the spiritual leader of a banned Islamist outfit alleged to have carried out a series of deadly attacks in the country. 
Police detained Maolana Abul Kashem, 60, from a hideout in the capital on Thursday night after an investigation linked him to the Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) group. 
Mohibul Islam Khan, deputy commissioner of the Dhaka police counter-terrorism unit, said Kashem had inspired the attack on a Dhaka cafe last July in which 22 people including 18 foreign hostages were killed.  He was the spiritual leader of the JMB, Khan told AFP. 
Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group have claimed responsibility for several of the attacks, but Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas secular government has pinned the blame on local extremists.

Deforestation in SL decreased by 0.4 per cent in past decade: UN
	
According to the report issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, deforestation in Sri Lanka has decreased to 0.4 per cent during the past decade, Conservator General of Forests Anura Sathurusinghe said yesterday.
Mr. Sathurusinghe told the Daily Mirror that the FAO report, issued every five years, has rated Sri Lanka as a country with less deforestation during the period of years 2000  2010. During the past decade (2000-2010), the deforestation in the country has decreased to 58, 791 hectares of forest land, which was rated as 1.3 per cent as against 104, 380 hectares during the period 1990  2000. At present the FAO has rated Sri Lanka as a country with minimum forest cover, he said.
Meanwhile, he said they had decided to launch an web portal to detect the places where deforestation was prevalent around the country. The website will be launched in the coming month. Any person who has information of deforestation taking place in their areas can inform us so that we can investigate it, he said, adding this would help immeasurably to control deforestation in the country.

Divided Security apparatus weakens effort to combat overseas LTTE
	
By D.B.S. Jeyaraj

Case No. B 85/17 concerning the assassination attempt targeting Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Jaffna district MP M. A. Sumanthiran was taken up at the Kilinochchi courts before Kilinochchi District Judge A. A. Anandarajah on February 27, 2017. Five ex-LTTE members were again produced in courts as the chief suspects by the Police Terrorism Investigation Department (TID). The five ex-Tigers are suspected of being involved in a plot instigated, devised and financed by overseas LTTE operatives to assassinate MP M.A. Sumanthiran. 
At the outset, the TID officials filed a further report outlining the progress made by the Police in investigating the assassination plot against the high profile lawyer MP who is also the accredited spokesperson of the TNA as well as its chief constituent the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK). The Police report in essence comprised three parts. 
The first part was about information gathered from one of the suspects Gnanasegaralingam Rajmathan who had been taken by the Police to specific areas in the north where the would be assassins had planned to slay the MP by exploding a claymore mine. Police had earlier obtained permission from courts to do so when the case was heard by Judge Anandarajah on Feb 13, in Kilinochchi. While the suspect had been willing to re-visit places with the Police and re-trace the contours of the assassination conspiracy, the other four suspects had not consented to do so. 
The second part of the report was about the information gathered from the other four suspects being held at the Anuradhapura prisons. Police had obtained permission from courts to do so when the case was heard by Judge Anandarajah on Feb 13. Since the five suspects have been remanded to fiscal custody and are not being detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) the Police have to obtain court permission to record statements and must also do so in the presence of prisons officials. The Police report incorporated further statements recorded from Karalasingham Kulendran, Murugaiyah Thavaendran, Velayuthan Vijayakumar and Mariyanayagam Lewis Ajanthan. 

As the anti-terrorism sleuths pursued investigations there emerged clear evidence that the unholy trinity spearheading a coordinated campaign to revive the LTTE comprised Gobi, Appanand Deiveegan

The third part of the Police report was a status update on further investigations made about the overseas LTTE operatives involved in the assassination plot.Three persons known as Amuthan, Maran and Vetri allegedly operating from Malaysia, France and Australia respectively are suspected of masterminding, coordinating and directing the assassination attempt on Sumanthiran MP. While Malaysian officials have said that Amuthan was no longer on Malaysian soil, Australian officials have indicated that Vetri had been identified. Maran from France is suspected of being a Swiss resident who operated out of Paris in recent times. The trail had turned cold in all three cases after the ex-Tigers in Sri Lanka were arrested. 
After submitting the report to Kilinochchi court the Police requested permission from Judge Anandarajah to escort Rajmathan to designated areas once again and re-construct the assassination further. Police also sought court permission to interrogate the suspects Kulendran, Thavaendran, Vijayakumar and Ajanthan further at the Anuradhapura jail. Police also wanted courts to sanction their interacting with relevant authorities
in the USA to gain further information regarding communications among the five ex-LTTE cadres arrested in Lanka and the overseas Tiger trio of Amuthan, Vetri and Maran. Mobile access Apps (WhatsApp/Viber) had been used to communicate. Judge Anandarajah granted permission for all requests made by Police.He also re-remanded the five suspects and set the date of the next hearing for March 13, 2017. 
TID Director DIG Nalaka de Silva 
As stated in these columns earlier, the probe into the Sumanthiran-assassination attempt is being conducted solely by the Police. It is reliably learnt that while the knitty-gritty aspects of the case are being handled on ground by different TID officials, the overall thrust of the investigation is being overseen by TID director DIG Nalaka de Silva himself. Usually in a case such as this, with overtones of political terrorism, the TID would have invoked the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and detained the suspects for a longer period. They would also have had unfettered access to the suspects in their custody and perhaps subjected them to an intensiveinterrogation.White vans would have scoured the north and east renditioning suspects particularly ex-LTTE cadres.

This however is not being done, as the Maithri-Ranil Govt has taken a policy decision to repeal and replace the PTA with new counter -terrorism laws. The old PTA is not operational any more,
Secretary General of the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) Mano Tittawela stated in Geneva this week. The decision not to utilise the PTA has been welcomed by the victim concerned Sumanthiran himself. The TNA MP cum lawyer who has appeared in several landmark human rights cases has been strongly against the PTA in the past. 
As such the Police are handling the assassination plot case under normal laws of the land.With the suspects remanded to judicial custody the Police have to obtain court permission to continue further investigations by questioning them. All this leads to some delay in the pace of the probe. The law enforcement machinery used to decades of excessive power under the PTA and emergency regulations finds it cumbersome to proceed under normal laws. Despite the delay it is indeed commendable that the investigation is being conducted under normal laws. It is time for the country at large to free itself of baggage such as the PTA and proceed positively towards a brighter future.

What is troubling however is the deeply-divided security structures particularly the intelligence gathering apparatus. Intelligence gathering and analysing is of crucial importance in combatting attempts by the overseas LTTE to foment violence in Sri Lanka. Intelligence is essential to maintain and ensure national security.When Mahinda Rajapaksa was in power his brother Gotabhaya was the all-powerful Defence Secretary. It was he who oversaw
the intelligence agencies. One of the arrangements he put into place was to hold a weekly meeting for all relevant intelligence agencies and divisions. Gota himself chaired the meeting while the then State Intelligence (SIS) Chief Kapila Hendavitharane functioned as secretary. 
The SIS, Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) of the Army, Terrorism Investigation Department (TID) of the Police, Special intelligence branch of the Police and the multi - disciplinary Colombo intelligence unit were all part of this weekly briefing/meeting. It is well known that all reputed law enforcement and national security agencies are plagued by inter -departmental rivalry. From the CIA - FBI divide in the US to the RAW - CBI schism in India, these Tensions go with the territory.
Effective leadership is required to manage these inter-departmental contradictions and undertake a coordinated effort to combat potential terrorism revival and safeguard national security. 

Hiatus between police and intelligence agencies 
This spirit of cooperation and coordination is conspicuously absent at present. The armed forces are under the Defence ministry while the Police are under the Law and Order Ministry. Worse still is the prevailing hiatus between the Police and the intelligence agencies. This has led to inter-service enmity of a very high order. This is patently visible in the probe into the Sumanthiran- assassination attempt. The TID is conducting it alone without enlisting the support of intelligence agencies. The intelligence agencies remain aloof without extending any help to the investigation. Both sides are also engaged in an unofficial campaign to blacken each other. Thus we see media reports critical of each other. On the one hand there are reports suggesting a military intelligence link to arrested ex-Tigers while on the other, reports say, there was no LTTE revival attempt. 

The assassination attempt was planned and coordinated by LTTE operatives in the global Tamil Diaspora.

Against this backdrop of a divided security apparatus the chances of the Sumanthiran- assassination attempt probe proceeding beyond a certain stage seems uncertain. The TID has apprehended the would be assassins on ground but they are virtually clueless about the overseas angle. The assassination attempt was planned and coordinated by LTTE operatives in the global Tamil Diaspora. The ex-LTTE cadres arrested by Police were to execute the task assigned by the overseas LTTE.

The intelligence agencies remain aloof without extending any help to the investigation

A comprehensive investigation therefore requires the capacity to delve deeply into both the internal and external dimensions. The TID is primarily a law enforcement agency confined to Sri Lanka. It is the State intelligence Service and Directorate of Military Intelligence who have the best information about the overseas Tigers. In fact the intelligence agencies have even infiltrated some of the overseas Tiger structures. The TID has no knowledge of these aspects. 
The plot to assassinate Sumanthiran is not one which should be treated lightly. This is the first time after the war ended in May 2009, that there has been a planned attempt to assassinate a prominent Tamil political leader on Sri Lankan soil. Five ex-Tigers have been arrested and there is evidence of Diaspora Tiger involvement in the exercise. It is therefore very important that a comprehensive investigation be conducted. For this, close cooperation and coordination between the TID and intelligence agencies are necessary. 

They would also have had unfettered access to the suspects in their custody and perhaps subjected them to an intensive interrogation.

There have been several attempts by overseas LTTE to foment violence in Sri Lanka after the Tigers were defeated in May 2009. The most serious and well-organized attempt to revive the LTTE was discovered and crushed in early 2014. This attempt was spearheaded by a trio comprising Suntharalingam Gajatheeban alias Theiveegan, Navaratnam Navaneethan alias Appan and Ponniah Selvanayagam Kajeepan alias Gobi. 

Well-organized effort to resurrect LTTE 
This was the most serious well-organized effort to resurrect the LTTE in Sri Lanka after May 2009. This was thwarted by the concerted efforts of the Police and Armed Forces. A crucial factor in this exercise was the close cooperation of State Intelligence, Military Intelligence and Police TID in combatting a common threat. I have written extensively about this in the past. A re-run of those events relying upon such writings would help to emphasise the importance of a united security apparatus in combating perceived threats to national security. 
A five week period from March 6 to April 11 in 2014 saw a concerted drive by the police and security forces to combat the resurgence attempt of the LTTE in Sri Lanka. Many cordon-and-search operations were conducted. A large number of people were rounded up, questioned and released.
Many persons were detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) for intensive interrogation. As the anti-terrorism sleuths pursued investigations there emerged clear evidence that the unholy trinity spearheading a coordinated campaign to revive the LTTE comprised Gobi, Appan and Deiveegan. All three were members of the LTTE who had not undergone rehabilitation after the fall of the LTTE in May 2009 at Mullivaaikkaal. The highly motivated trio had the single-minded objective of reviving the LTTE again in Sri Lanka. All three had been in foreign countries after May 2009 and had the option of leading a comparatively safe and comfortable life abroad. Yet they had voluntarily returned to Lanka with the blinkered vision of reviving the LTTE and pursued their goal with missionary zeal. 

What is troubling however is the deeply-divided security structures particularly the intelligence gathering apparatus.
Deiveegan was born in Manthuvil in the Thenmaratchy division of the Jaffna district on May 2, 1979. He joined the LTTE voluntarily in 1995 and his real name

is Suntharalingam Gajatheeban. Among his many noms de Guerre and noms de plume are Theiveegan, Thevian, Navaneethan, Vallan and Devan. He served for a long time as a bodyguard of LTTE Leader Veluppillai Prabhakaran and wife Mathivathani. He had also obtained a piloting licence and participated in air strikes by the LTTE air wing Vaanpuligal (Air Tigers). Deiveegan has reportedly been involved in the aerial attacks on Kerawalapitiya and Anuradhapura during the war. 
After the war ended in May 2009, Deiveegan went clandestinely to India and established contact with Nediyavan in Norway and moved to South-east Asia and later went to Europe and shuttled among different countries. He then returned to India and was placed in charge of operations in India and Sri Lanka by the Nediyavan group. Deiveegan is believed to have been moving back and forth between India and Sri Lanka on a false passport or by using clandestine country boats. Ponniah Selvanayagam Kajeepan alias Gobi 
Gobi; whose real name was Ponniah Selvavanayagam Kajeepan was around 31 years of age. His other alias is Kaseeyan. Gobi hailing from Iyakkachchi in the Pachilaippalli division of Kilinochchi district also joined the LTTE voluntarily while in his early teens and served in the Kittu Artillery unit of the LTTE. Later he functioned in the LTTE intelligence wing commanded by Pottu Ammaan. 
Gobi worked as an intelligence operative in the LTTE under Perinbam master. He was stationed in Colombo for a long time and was engaged mainly in reconnaissance and logistical transport. He reportedly spoke Sinhala fluently. Gobi was married to Sharmila Balamurugan from Paalaiootru in Trincomalee. Both were in the Wanni when the war ended. Gobi with his then pregnant wife posed off as a civilian and was housed at the Ananda Coomaraswamy Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp in Chettikulam. They were allowed to relocate to Sharmilas fathers house in Paalaiootru when the baby was born in the camp. Gobi who had a heavy vehicle driving licence went abroad from Trinco to Saudi Arabia to work as a driver. 
After his Saudi contract was over, Gobi went to Europe and travelled to different countries from there. He reportedly met with Irumporai - the de facto leader of the Nediyavan LTTE faction in Europe. Gobi then made contact with Deiveegan and returned to Sri Lanka. He cut off links with his mother and wife. Gobi bought a lorry and rented it out for transport as an owner/driver. He used this as a cover and moved around the North and travelled to and from Colombo, recruiting people and setting up clandestine cells. 
Appan, whose real name was Navaratnam Navaneethan was born in Oorani in the Jaffna district on December 22, 1978. He joined the LTTE voluntarily in 1996. Among his other names were Abishan and Thiru. Appan worked under LTTE leader Gandhi who was supervising the LTTE prisons and detention camps for many years. Later he was moved to the intelligence wing under Pottu Ammaan. 
In 2006, Appan was sent to Colombo and worked under an LTTE operative known as Kaanthan. Appan like Gobi, was used for reconnaissance and transport and he was in Colombo when the war ended. He then moved to Qatar and worked as a driver. Appan also was in contact with Gobi while in the Middle-East. He too returned to Sri Lanka like Gobi and set about the task of trying to revive the LTTE. He too cut off contact with his family. 
Appan, Gobi and Deiveegan, though having the opportunity of residing outside Sri Lanka made the choice of returning to the Island and reviving the LTTE. Fortunately for the country, and all its peace-loving people, the LTTE renaissance project that was planned, coordinated and executed by the three was detected in its formative stages and nullified beforehand through adroit action. Although it was thought initially that Gobi was the live-wire behind the enterprise, fresh information gained subsequently indicated that Deiveegan was the brainy dynamo who was primarily responsible for this attempted resurgence. 
Apparently, the three revivalists were in charge of three broad wings. Gobi was in charge of intelligence, while Appan was responsible for propaganda. Deiveegan was responsible for operations or military strikes and was the overall chief of the new entity. 

Envisaged LTTE had short, mid and long-term goals 
The nouveau LTTE that they envisaged had short, mid and long term goals. They went about recruiting people and setting up safe houses. They targeted mainly LTTE cadres who had not surrendered to the armed forces and therefore had not undergone rehabilitation for recruitment. Next of kin to dead LTTE cadres or family members of those who had disappeared were also recruited. In some instances they also enlisted the services of some people who were actually innocent of the sinister design but had got involved without realising the diabolical machinations at play. 
What was frightening about the LTTE revival project was that it had ample support from Tiger elements cutting across intra-LTTE divisions. Members from the LTTE branches as well as front organisations had been backing the Deiveegan-Gobi-Appan triumvirate. The funding for LTTE revival attempts seem to have been channelled through money transfer agents as well as reputed banks. The five key figures who had been funding LTTE resurgent activities in Sri Lanka from abroad are Yathavan alias Santhosham master in Switzerland, Veeramani alias Regan in France, Shanthi in Germany, Deva in Canada and Soori in Britain. 
The money sent from abroad has been used by the Deiveegan-Gobi-Appan trio to help finance the LTTE revival attempt in Lanka. Lands and houses were acquired and vehicles also had been purchased. Equipment such as computers and cameras had been bought. Leaflets and posters were printed. More importantly money was liberally used as an incentive to recruit people. The abject poverty of many former LTTE cadres and families of ex-LTTE operatives had been exploited. Some were co-opted through lure of financial rewards and remuneration. 
The entire network was broken up into three or four cells and linked to each other via the net. Overseas contact was maintained through internet and telephone. Most of the people functioned compartmentally on a need-to-know only basis. The lynchpins however were Deiveegan, Gobi and Appan. Of these three persons, Deiveegan adopted a relatively low profile. Much of the spadework in widening contacts and setting up cells was done by Gobi and to a lesser extent by Appan. While Gobi posed as the owner/driver of a lorry, Appan had his own three-wheeler. Both vehicles were purchased through a reputed firm in Sri Lanka. 
State Intelligence, Military Intelligence as well as the Terrorism Investigations division of the police worked together on the matter. Traditional inter-departmental rivalry was shelved and the different arms cooperated wholeheartedly with the common objective of preventing a tiger renaissance. As investigations progressed and more suspects were detained and interrogated, it became glaringly obvious that the three persons evading arrest were the most important figures in the LTTE revival exercise. 

Investigation had been a constantly evolving one 
The investigation itself had been a constantly evolving one with many an unexpected twist and turn. In the preliminary stages when the name of Gobi cropped up the police had published wanted posters with Gobis name only. Later when Appan was also implicated his name too was added. Posters and leaflets saying both Gobi and Appan were wanted were distributed and rewards for information offered. Subsequently when the name of Deiveegan emerged another notice was issued separately for him. 
When it was clearly obvious that the three were the kingpins of the LTTE revival attempt another type of posters and leaflets were issued. The names, images and descriptions of all three were published in one notice. A reward of one million rupees leading to their capture was offered. Telephone numbers were publicised where members of the public could ring and supply information. Official sources said 42,000 such leaflets were distributed as well as pasted in public places throughout the North. This made a terrific impact on the people and evoked a positive response at many levels. 
Several tipoff and leads were received about movements of suspicious individuals. Many of these were followed up and found to be erroneous or false alarms. Finally a positive lead was received from the Vedivaiththakallu area in the Vavuniya North division. It was reported that people engaged in wood-cutting had seen suspicious movements in the dense forest. One informant was positive that it was Gobi who was moving around there. 
The Vavuniya North division also called Nedunkerni division is a sprawling region in the Wanni. The sparsely populated Southern areas of the region are infested with thick jungles. Vedivaithakallu was about 8 miles to the south of Nedunkerni. Acting on the information received a contingent of troops were stationed in the area on the outskirts of the jungle. Small teams of military trained in jungle warfare were deployed to penetrate the jungle interior and scout around. 
It was around noon at about 1.00 pm on Thursday April 10, 2014, when a deep penetration patrol stumbled upon a secluded spot under a canopy of trees where a makeshift hearth and army mess tins were discovered. The burning embers suggested that the fugitives had heard sounds of the soldiers approaching and had quickly run away. A rapid search in the surrounding bushes resulted in four military backpacks being recovered. 
Three of the backpacks had jungle-survival items like medicinal capsules, ointments, spirits, bug repellents, bandages, knives, flash lights, small mirrors, batteries, handy instruments, lighters, matches, tinderboxes, cords, candles, light apparel etc. The fourth backpack was stocked with dry rations and eatables like noodle packets, canned beef and fish, soup cans, tinned milk, biscuits, chocolates, nutrition bars and chewing gum packets. A thorough examination of the contents suggested that the trio could have survived on the food items for about 7-8 days in the jungle. 

Overall command of Maj. Gen. Boniface Perera 
Once these backpacks were detected, the security apparatus went to work expeditiously. Additional military personnel were hastily deployed. 3,000 soldiers from Vavuniya, Kilinochchi and Mullaitheevu districts were detailed for jungle combing operations. They were under the overall command of the then Wanni security forces commander Maj. Gen. Boniface Perera. 
The soldiers were put through training drills and exercises that would have been helpful in the jungle terrain search operations. The exercises were conducted in batches at points far away from the target zone so as to prevent the fugitive trio from being alerted. Once the training exercise was over each batch was transported quietly up to a point from where they proceeded on foot to the target area. The training exercises went on throughout the night. 
The military operation went ahead as planned. Under cover of darkness the soldiers were positioned around the jungle area with about one soldier for every five metres at most places. By first light at the crack of dawn, deployed military personnel had surrounded the tract of jungle in which the fugitive Tiger trio was hiding in. Silently the soldiers waited for their quarry to emerge from the jungle and walk into the military cordon. 
It was about 6.45 am on Friday April 11, 2014, when the trio came out to the edge of the jungle slowly. Apparently the Tigers did not expect the soldiers to be lying in wait for them. Since the area was of a secondary forest type with dense shrubs and thick under-brush, visibility was somewhat obscured. Deiveegan and Appan were in front with Gobi following behind. 
Suddenly Deiveegan spied the soldiers through the bushes at a distance less than 10 metres. He whipped out a pistol and the soldiers also opened fire. There was a sharp exchange of gunfire. Both Deiveegan and Appan were hit. Deiveegan fell down on the spot while Appan ran back and fell. Gobi ran back as the firing started and took cover in a clump of bushes. Then he tried to drag the fallen Appan back into the bushes. The soldiers opened fire when they thought Gobi was trying to throw a grenade. He too was killed. The skirmish ended with the three Tigers being killed and two soldiers getting slightly injured. Apparently the military gave no quarter and had taken no prisoners. 
A total of six telephones, including two satellite phones and a Global Positioning System (GPS) were recovered from the fallen Tigers. A large amount of cash in Sri Lankan, Indian and US currency was also retrieved. So too was a notebook with addresses and telephone numbers. Contrary to expectations, the three Tigers were not heavily armed. There was only a 9mm pistol used by Deiveegan and some ammunition rounds plus four hand grenades. When the latters gun was examined, it was found that 14 of the 16 shots in the magazine had been fired through it; it was not clear as to whether all the shots were fired in this particular confrontation. 
The Kebbithigollewa Magistrate visited the spot and held an inquiry. Thereafter the three bodies were first taken to the Padaviya hospital and from there to Anuradhapura where the Judicial Medical Officer conducted a postmortem examination.The bodies were identified by family members. The father, sister and brother-in-law of Deiveegan identified Suntharalingam Gajatheeban. The mother, wife and father-in-law of Gobi identified Ponniah Selvanayagam Kajeepan. There was however a hitch in the case of Appan whose old mother was unable to identify her son as she had not seen him for 10 years. This caused a delay. Finally, Appans two brothers came and identified Navaratnam Navaneethan. All three bodies were buried according to a Court Order at the Vijayapura burial grounds in Anuradhapura. The last rites were conducted by a Hindu priest from the Kathiresan temple in Anuradhapura. Only family members of Deiveegan, Gobi and Appan were allowed for the funeral. The media and public were forbidden to attend. 

Adopting a compartmentalised approach 
Thus ended in 2014 the saga of the Tiger trio, Deiveegan, Gobi and Appan who embarked upon the quixotic mission of reviving the LTTE in Sri Lanka. It is too early to say whether MP Sumanthirans assassination attempt was an isolated instance or part of a larger conspiracy to revive the LTTE in Sri Lanka. One thing, however, is certain. The current situation where a divided security apparatus is adopting a compartmentalised approach can only weaken the efforts to combat attempts by the Diaspora Tigers to foment violence in Sri Lanka.

## Title: Efforts to graduate SL to upper middle-income country

Efforts to graduate SL to upper middle-income country
	

A workshop to discuss strategic aspects for developing a national system that supports innovation and entrepreneurship was held at the Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry recently.  
Several distinguished personalities including government officials, representatives from the research and private sectors, investors, members of the startup community and World Bank experts marked their presence at the workshop. Among them were Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha and State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe.
Subject Minister Malik Samarawickrama addressed the gathering on the vision of the national economy as it liberalised trade with regional partners. Excerpts of the ministers speech: 
It is well-understood that one of the key factors in establishing competitive advantage in aggressive markets is through the development and commercialisation of high-end products and services. To deliver such expectations, it is imperative that the country emphasises innovation and entrepreneurship. The successes of these two elements rely on research outcomes, be they funded publicly or privately.
The Sri Lankan Governments National Economic Development Plan (Balagathu Sri Lankawak) was unveiled in January this year, and it identifies that in order to create long-term employment and to improve income, we should move towards an export economy. Furthermore, it recognises the facilitating of business initiation and improvements, becoming a member of the global product chains and creating a powerful and modern digital economy as key aspects that need to be looked at in conjunction to achieve this objective.
In my opinion, innovation and entrepreneurship stand at the centre of all these components, thereby providing the basis to achieve our goal of creating a positive investment climate and trade regime which will generate more and better jobs for the countrys youth. Our plan to create development corridors that will be set up for investment in public and private sectors with the role of the private sector being duly recognised to offer additional exposure and opportunities for entrepreneurs and professionals with the focus on digital economy, tourism, commercial agriculture as well as accelerating the process of industrialisation, is a highlight that shows the government has identified innovation as a key driver for progress.
However, given the size of the small market of a mere 21 million people, we understand that the growth potential of Sri Lanka inevitably lies in global integration. To benefit from opening itself for trade, local products and services should be able to compete in the international markets.
A handful of Sri Lankan enterprises have been selected as they have shown rapid growth in export-oriented products. For example, the apparel industry has moved from a commodity-export model in targeting niche markets to higher value-added production. There is also an emerging but growing digital industry reflecting greater export potential. However, these islands of success are few in number. Compared to countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, the export product mix in Sri Lanka has not seen a drastic change since the 90s. In fact, exports, as a percentage of GDP, have declined significantly in the recent years. The sluggish growth of exports is due to very little diversification. When Vietnam added 48 new products/line items and Thailand added 70 to their export baskets, Sri Lanka has added only seven new businesses during 2000-2015. Further, Sri Lankan exports tend to be commodity products rather than higher-value products and services.
We are very ambitious that the GSP+ preferences will make a significant contribution to the local economy through increasing exports to the EU market beyond traditional exports. After signing the three FTAs with India and China, we will have access to a market of Rs. 3 billion. These are the avenues for new businesses and quality products.
At the same time, we need to identify our challenges, what forces might prevent our small businesses gaining new opportunities from such avenues. The following are a few findings that came up in the rapid assessment the World Bank team conducted on the request of the government on Sri Lankas innovative andentrepreneurial environment.

  There are a number of factors that inhibit the formation and development of innovative startup companies which are often the source of innovative business models, products and services that can have a transformative economic impact. These detrimental factors include a variety of policy, regulatory and tax issues, the lack of a robust innovative technology pipeline and a very nascent early stage venture capital and angel-funding network in Sri Lanka.
	  SMEs in Sri Lanka generally lack the knowledge and experience required to adopt and adapt new technologies and thereby develop newer/higher value products and services to address domestic and international market opportunities. It is also the case that these SMEs are removed from and unable to access global value chains which may offer them the opportunity to sell their products and services in international markets.
	  The focus of the R&D that is being undertaken would benefit from a less traditional, academic focus to one that focusses on creating economic value for Sri Lanka. As a middle-income country aspiring to embark on a knowledge-based growth trajectory, Sri Lankas expenditures on R&D at 0.16 per cent of GDP could be a lot higher.

Over several years, the ministries made efforts to address these issues. It is evident that we cannot tackle all these challenges in isolation, but instead we need to come into one platform where we could have a holistic approach. I believe todays discussion will be the first step towards this path.
We welcome the opportunity to work in close partnership with the World Bank and other organisations to help Sri Lanka become a highly-competitive economy and fast track to an upper middle-income country.

Giving Police powers to PCs is not the solution: Champika
	
Transferring police powers to provincial councils will create thousands of people like Samayan and violent groups like Jaffna-based Aava, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
He said Sri Lanka was a country that had undergone a series of violent riots, where 2 to 3 per cent of the population was assassinated by unidentified gunmen and people were killed on roads in bomb attacks.
We dont have the practicality to devolve police powers only because some NGOs and elements depending on foreign funds request to do so. The best option is to recruit Tamil speaking officers who have the knowledge of the Tamil culture to the police service. The new government has recruited such officers in abundance. The solution to the national question is not devolution of police powers but the recruitment of Tamil speaking officers, the Minister told a ceremony held to inaugurate the carpet laying ceremony at Kudamaduwa Road.
He said requests to devolve police powers had been generated from the 13the Amendment to the Constitution which was introduced by India.
What is happening in India today There are terrorist groups in at least 14 States. One of the main obstacles the authorities have to face when fighting terrorists is devolution of police powers among different states. This is a blow to the law and order of that country, he said.

I have backbone to reject foreign judges: MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena told the SLFP executive committee meeting that he had shown his 'backbone' to the International community by rejecting UNHRC Chief Zeid bin Ra-ad Al Hussein's recommendation for a hybrid court to probe war crimes allegations in Sri Lanka.
"Two weeks ago the UN Human Rights High Commissioner in his report on Sri Lanka called for a probe by foreign judges. Within 24 hours, I rejected it saying I am not ready to bring foreign judges here," he said. "There can be people without a backbone. But I am not ready to go forward with those without a backbone. I will go forward with only those with a backbone," he said.
The President said if financial crimes, misrule and other misdeeds took place under the Unity Government, he would create an anti corruption power base under the SLFP and lead the party to electoral victory and form an SLFP government.
The President expressed his displeasure at some of the matters that had cropped up under the unity government and said he had left the SLFP under Mahinda Rajapaksa to fight against corruption, misrule and frauds and as such he would not tolerate any financial crimes or mismanagement taking place under this government.
I want to lead my party on a path free of corruption, misdeeds and misrule with the objective of forming an SLFP government. I am not happy about certain things that has happened but glad that we have done a lot of positive things like introducing the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Therefore, we need a new beginning and new thinking and each and every SLFPer must be ready to face that challenge, he said.
The President reminded SLFP members that he did not have certain executive powers after the 19th Amendment was passed and said though independent commissions were set up as required by the 19th Amendment, the people were still to reap its full benefits.
The people who elected me as the President in January 2015 expect a clean and democratic rule from me and therefore we have a big task ahead to fulfill the aspirations of the people," President Sirisena stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The newly-appointed Chief Justice Priyasath Dep yesterday stressed the need for making ordinary people aware of the law and ensuring them access to the judiciary.
He emphasised this during his inaugural speech at the opening ceremony of National Law Week organized by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka .
Creating awareness of the law among citizens is important. Citizens must know of his or her legal rights and the remedies available. Mitigation may not be the only option. We all thought that if there is an issue we need to resolve it through courts. There is the gamsabha system where citizens of a village got together and resolve issues. However we have other alternatives or options available now. Citizens should be aware of these as well. These comprise mediation, reconciliation and arbitration, he said. The other issue is to be aware of various Acts, Ordinances and Amendments. Unfortunately most of the amendments are not available. The Bar Association, the Justice Ministry and the Government should publish these documents and make them available to the people, he added.
Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe said arrangements were being made to translate some of the statutes and legislation into Tamil and that it would be completed within the next two and a half years. (YP)

RSMA Secretary Ruwan Pathirange said their main demand was to seek permanent appointments in higher ranks; especially railway station masters.
He said the authorities had failed to make permanent appointments for station masters in main railway stations since 2004.
There are vacancies for railway station masters in more than 60 main railway stations in the country, including in Colombo Fort and Maradana railway stations, he said.
Mr. Pathirange alleged such vacancies were filled with employees in acting capacities, while there were qualified people to fill such vacancies.He said the last examination to appoint railway station masters was held in 2002 and since then the government had not conduct an examination for the post.

US Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Thursday he would recuse himself from any probe into the presidential election campaign as Donald Trumps administration moved to cut short a snowballing controversy over itsties to Russia. 
Facing calls to resign over newly revealed meetings he held with Russias ambassador before the election, Sessions denied any impropriety or that he lied about those encounters in his Senate confirmation hearing. 
The Republican US president declared his total confidence in Sessions -- while adding that he wasnt aware of the contacts between Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Sessions, who was a senator actively supporting his campaign at the time. 
But top US Democrats -- unswayed by Sessionss account of events -- maintained their calls for him to step down immediately, accusing himof perjury. 
They also called for an independent prosecutor to investigate contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow, which US intelligence says interfered in the election to hurt Trumps Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
Adam Schiff, a Democratic ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, rejected Sessionss claim that his contacts with Kislyak were unrelated to his work with the Trump campaign as simply not credible. 
I have come to the reluctant conclusion that the Attorney General should step down, he said, echoing calls made earlier by the top Democrats in both chambers of the Republican-controlled Congress.

UN voices concern over Bangladesh child marriage law
	

DHAKA AFP March2, 2017- The United Nations voiced its criticism Thursday over a controversial new law in Bangladesh that allows underage children to be married off bytheir parents. 
The new rule keeps the minimum marriageable age for males at 21 and for females at 18 but relaxes the restriction for special circumstances -- including for girls who elope, are raped or bear children out of wedlock. 
Rights groups fear without an age limit in these cases, underage children could be married off, undermining Bangladeshs efforts to curb such unions and improve womens health. 
The UNs child protection agency in Bangladesh said it remains concerned about the special provision, and its potential impact on childrens wellbeing. 
Marrying as a child has a lifelong impact on a persons wellbeing. It limits opportunities and the chance to be a child, UNICEFs representative in Bangladesh Edouard Beigbeder said in an email.
