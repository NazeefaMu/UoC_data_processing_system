With leading hospitals in Colombo and the suburbs over crowded with dengue patients, the Health Ministry today decided to equip rural hospitals in Wetara, Piliyandala, Aniyakanda and Dankotuwa with additional staff, drugs and medical equipment to ease the congestion.

A special dengue control committee headed by Health Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa were informed that the North Colombo and Colombo South Teaching Hospitals, Negombo District Hospital, Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) and the Ratnapura General Hospital were over crowded with dengue patients.

The committee decided to use the yet unopened wing of the Ratnapura District Hospital to accommodate dengue patients.

Mr. Sugathadasa instructed officials to immediately supply these hospitals with medical specialists, nursing and minor health staff, drugs and medical equipment and if necessary to appoint medical interns to assist the medical staff.

Meanwhile, the Education Ministry has instructed principals of National Schools to carry out a cleaning programme at their respective school premises between 11.00 am to 12.00 noon every day. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
