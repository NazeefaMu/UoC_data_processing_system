Sri Lanka Labour Party leader and millionaire entrepreneur A.S.P. Liyanage said he had received a letter from the Commission to investigate allegations on Bribery or Corruption(BC) to appear before the commission on Monday in connection with his offer to hand over Rs.730 million worth Peacock Mansion at Rajagiriya to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He had intended to offer the Peacock Mansion to Mahinda Rajapaksa about eight months ago.
Sources said the former president had consulted architects as well as exorcists and the necessary rites had been observed before occupying the house.
Dr. Liyanage was called to appear before the commission with the relevant documents available to record a statement, commission OIC IP A.H.M.P Abeysinghe said.
When asked about the matter Dr. Liyanage said he would definitely appear before the commission and he in fact had intended to give the mansion to Mahinda Rajapaksa for a period of about two years. But he couldn’t give it due to numerous pressures.
I love my wife and children most and I decided to withdraw my decision of giving him the mansion. (Bimal Shyaman Jayasinghe)
