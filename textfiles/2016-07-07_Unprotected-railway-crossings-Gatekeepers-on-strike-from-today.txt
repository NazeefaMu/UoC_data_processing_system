Gatekeepers at unprotected railway crossings countrywide had decided to launch a token strike from this morning against the delay in granting them the Rs.5,000 salary increased promised by the Government.

“We have about 2,061 gatekeepers at unprotected railway crossings countrywide and all of them will stop work,” Gatekeepers of Unprotected Railway Crossings Association President J.A.C. Premalal said.

He said Deputy Transport Minister Rohana Dissanayake had during earlier strikes had assured a salary hike of Rs.5,000 but nothing had happened so far.

“That is why we decided to launch a countrywide strike from 6.00 a.m. today until we get paid. We have been getting a monthly salary of Rs.7,500 for three years,” Mr. Premalal said. “We are urging the Transport Minister, the Deputy Minister and the relevant authorities to pay us the extra Rs.5,000 and absorb us into the government salary scheme.” (Chaturanga Pradeep)
