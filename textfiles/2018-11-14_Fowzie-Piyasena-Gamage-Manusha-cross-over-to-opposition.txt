Minister AHM Fowzie, Piyasena Gamage and Manusha Nanayakkara crossed over to the opposition in Parliament.

MP Manusha Nanayakkara who crossed over to the Opposition said he did so because he did not want to participate in any action that was against the mandate given by the people in 2015.

“The present administration tried to buy over MPs and work against the mandate given by the people in 2015. It was an undemocratic move. Therefore I decided to stand up for democracy,” he said.

MP Piyasena Gamage who also crossed over said he did so because of his love for the nation.

“I did not want to work against the sovereignty of people,” he said.

“I was always striving to form an SLFP led administration but I decided to sit in the opposition today to defeat a move which was against the democratic norms.

Minister of Tourism Vasantha Senanayake also said he would resign from his Ministry shortly.

“I will resign from my ministry shortly. I have realized that the present administration has no majority in the House,” he said.

“I have not left the UNP though I accepted a ministry in the new government and will remain with the party,” he added. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)
