Joint opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa today charged that the police had refused to provide him security on his way to Parliament from the remand prison.

Raising a privilege issue in the House, the MP said one Sergeant in the Bambalapitiya police headquarters had requested to send armed policemen for his protection last morning.

“I came to Parliament with two constables attached to the police post in Prison" the MP said claiming that he could not attend sessions on time this week due to police inefficiency.

He questioned as to how does the police act on its own.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who responded said he would meet the police and prison officers soon and resolve the issue. (Yohan Perera)
