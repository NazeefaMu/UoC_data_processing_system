The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today warned trade union action by next week over curtailment of medical officers’ allowances.

Addressing a media conference, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said the government had deliberately ignored to amend their ‘extra duty’ allowance and other allowances like transportation and telephone.

“The extra duty allowance was paid based on a formula which was prepared according to the basic salary of a medical officer.This was last increased in 2016. Though the basic salary was increased afterwards, the extra duty allowance had not been amended,” Dr. Herath said.   (Sheain Fernandopulle)
