Drunken kinsmen are bullies!


	


There is a certain yahapalanaya purohita who has appointed several family members to high posts in his Ministry.  
These new bigwigs are said to be clueless regarding the powers and functions they have to discharge and the employees say that this is no matter for surprise because their only merit to high office is their kinship to the purohita. 
What is worse, they say, is, that two of these guys have made it a habit to attend office drunk and bully the employees just for the fun of throwing their weight around. 
Now the highly concerned Ministry employees have planned to take trade union action against the two topers and also to get the Police to subject them to a Breathalyzer test before pursuing the necessary legal action.
