Samsung Sri Lanka launched the latest model in its stellar J Series line-up, the J8, to an eager audience in Sri Lanka, who can’t seem to get enough of the models in the series. Galaxy J8, which is a part of the new Infinity series of models from Samsung, packs a larger 6” Super AMOLED Infinity Display and industry-first dual camera innovation. Galaxy J8 is priced at Rs.51,190 which will be available from the first week of July 2018. The devices will be available across authorized distributors and online through wow.lk. The latest devices will be available in Blue, Black and Gold colours.
 
Commenting on the launch of Galaxy J8 in the market, Shantha Fernando, General Manager and Head of Mobile Biz said, “The J series combines affordability and innovation to add immense value to J smartphone users, clearly rendering Samsung J as the favourite smartphone series amongst Sri Lankan consumers. Our consumer insights showed that photo editing is big amongst millennials which is why we worked on an advanced dual rear camera for Galaxy J8. Artificial intelligence allows users to experiment with the foreground and background of an image on Galaxy J8, thereby delivering professional grade photographs. Users can adjust the level of background blur both before and after clicking the shot. Moreover, our signature Samsung Infinity Display powered by Super AMOLED technology enhances J8 users’ viewing experience owing to best in class contrast ratio and superior colour reproduction. By catering to these ‘real’ needs of users, Samsung is poised to further strengthen its leadership in the affordable smartphone segment.”
 
Galaxy J8 unveils three new powerful dual camera features – Background Blur Shape, Portrait Dolly, and Portrait Backdrop for images that stand out on social sites. The dual camera delivers Samsung’s flagship ‘Live Focus’ feature where users can bring sharp focus to the foreground while blurring out the background. With Background Blur Shape, you can make the pictures talk by adding soft light effect in different contextual shapes. The Portrait Dolly feature delivers a moving GIF image with zoom movements in the background for a cinematic photography experience. The portrait backdrop mode gives a professional touch to photography by creating cool and funky background effects. The primary dual rear camera set up has 16MP with f/1.7 aperture and 5MP with f/1.9 aperture. The front camera is a 16MP setup with f/1.9. The new device also comes with the latest Android Oreo 8.0 operating system.


 
The J Series has incorporated users’ favourite Infinity display and the Galaxy J8 too comes with an 18.5:9 Infinity display which provides nearly 15% more display area without increasing the overall size of the device. To further enhance the infinity experience the physical home button has been swapped with software powered in-display home button and the fingerprint sensor has been placed on the back below the dual camera set up.
  
Further catering to the strong demand for Chat Over Video, the Galaxy J8 facilitates an uninterrupted and uncompromised video viewing experience while messaging, hence eliminating the need to compromise between video viewing and communicating. The transparent keyboard allows the user to continue watching the video while continuing to enjoy the video content.
 
Galaxy J8 comes with a premium polycarbonate unibody and has a 6” HD+ super AMOLED Infinity display. It has sleek curves and an ergonomic design with elegant style and comfortable grip. Its performance is further bolstered by Snapdragon 450 processor which provides premium performance without draining the 3,500 mAh battery. Galaxy J8 has a storage capacity of 4GB + 64GB memory (expandable up to 256 GB).
