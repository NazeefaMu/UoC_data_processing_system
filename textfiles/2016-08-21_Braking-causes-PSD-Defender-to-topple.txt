Braking causes PSD Defender to topple


	



In an attempt to avoid an accident, a PSD Defender had toppled on the Dambulla-Kurunegala Road today when a woman had attempted to cross the road ‘carelessly’.

Neither six PSD officers were traveling in the Defender at the time of the accident, nor had the woman been injured.

The driver had used the emergency brake, however, the vehicle had toppled on the road. Pix by Kanchana Kumara Ariyadasa
