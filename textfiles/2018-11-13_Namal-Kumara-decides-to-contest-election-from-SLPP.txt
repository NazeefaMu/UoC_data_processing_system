Anti-Corruption Force Operations Director Namal Kumara today said that he would contest at the upcoming Parliamentary Election as the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said people had requested to contest for the election for the betterment of the country.

“I have revealed many secrets and confidential recording to protect the President and the country. By revealing those things I did not expect anything. I risked my life for the country to protect the President,” he said.

“I asked from which party should I contest, and they said it was better to contest through the SLPP. I did not select,” he said.


“I don’t have money to spend on campaign. According to Sri Lankan culture to contest an election, the candidate should have money to spend. I can do media campaigns and do poster campaigns. I don’t have anything to hide in my life.

“I expect to meet Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to discuss how to contest at the election. 
“I do not hope to come to Parliament as a National List MP. I want to come to Parliament from the people’s votes. 

“And I do not want to stay as a lifetime Minister in Parliament. If I were elected, I would only stay only for four years. With the work, I’m doing in Parliament and to the people, they will decide my future,” he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
