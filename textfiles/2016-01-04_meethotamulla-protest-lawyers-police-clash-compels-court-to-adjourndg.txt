Meethotamulla protest: Lawyers, Police clash compels court to adjourn


	

Court adjourned for ten minutes amid heated arguments between the Police and the lawyers for the aggrieved party when the case, on the attack on those protesting against the dumping of garbage at Meetotamulla, was taken up for inquiry today.
Magistrate Mohamed Mihiran left the bench during the heated inquiry between the two parties accusing each other of insulting the Court.
In this case, the Kolonnawa UC Chairman Ravindra Udayashantha is charged with having assaulted those who participated at a peaceful picket against dumping of garbage in Meethotamulla.
The lawyers said the police had not arrested the other suspects who are alleged to have assaulted the protesters because the police was biased in favour of the UC chairman and his supporters.
Later the Magistrate who resumed the inquiry released Mr. Udayashantha on bail with two sureties of Rs.100,000 each.
The Magistrate said the UC chairman would be remanded until the adjudication of the case if he engaged in such acts again.
The Magistrate also directed the Police to arrest the other suspects involved in the assault and to produce them in Court. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
