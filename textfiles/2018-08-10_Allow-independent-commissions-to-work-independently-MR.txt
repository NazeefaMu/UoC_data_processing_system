Allow independent commissions to work independently: MR


	

Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday it was pointless increasing salaries of chairpersons and members of independent commissions if they were not allowed to function independently.

Raising a question during the debate on revising the emoluments and allowances of chairpersons and members of nine independent commissions, he said certain decisions taken by the police commission had been halted by the police chief.

Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara urged Mr. Rajapaksa to reveal any instances where a decision taken by the police commission was not implemented.

Mr. Rajapaksa said the promotion recommended by the police commission to Palitha Siriwardana had been halted for a long time and asked that justice is meted out to him.

The subject minister said his promotion to the rank of the DIG was halted as there were two charge sheets against him and added that such a promotion was not possible according to the law.

Mr. Rajapaksa said it was unfair to submit charge sheets based on personal issues after the promotion was given and added that it could have been done earlier.

"If the decisions of the police commission could be changed by the IGP or higher officials of the police department, what is the use of such a commission," he asked and added that independent commissions take decisions based on some facts and that their decisions should be respected.

He said independent commissions should be given powers and allowed to function independently.

Minister Maddumabandara said he would look into the matter. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
