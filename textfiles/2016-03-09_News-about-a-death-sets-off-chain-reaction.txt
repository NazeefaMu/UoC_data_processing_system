This one is a purohita in yahapalanaya and a Betel leaf bigwig to boot.

 


The other day he entered a private nursing home for a medical checkup. No sooner than had the checkup begun, he heard that the general secretary of the party under treatment at the same hospital had expired. This piece of news sent the purohita into a flutter. Next he learnt that a party heavyweight from Wayamba too had been admitted following a heart attack. Then it occurred to him that the hospital would soon be swarming with media people and they would invariably inquire about his illness. So he called off the medical checkup and rushed back home.


As the story was going viral that several political big guns one after the other were getting hospitalized due to heart trouble, another story said that several other purohitas were in a mad rush trying to get their cholesterol level checked by medical laboratory technologists got down from private hospitals
