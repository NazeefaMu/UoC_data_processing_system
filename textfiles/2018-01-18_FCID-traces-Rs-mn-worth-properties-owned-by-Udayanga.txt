The FCID today informed court that it found Rs. 94 million worth properties belonging to former Ambassador Udayanga Weeratunga, while probing the financial loss incurred by the government when purchasing four Ukrainian MIG 27 aircraft in 2006.

Filing a report, FCID Inspector Nihal Francis said Mr. Weeratunga owned an eight-acre land worth Rs. 40 million and a one-acre land worth of Rs. 25 million in Dompe and a luxury apartment (Trillium Residencies) worth Rs. 29 million in Borella.

The FCID sought court direction on the land registrar to prevent the sale of identified properties. Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne will today consider the request of the FCID to hold the sale of properties.

Accordingly, the magistrate permitted the prosecution to obtain certain bank details regarding a suspicious transaction of Udayanga Weeratunga amounting to Rs. 20 million. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
