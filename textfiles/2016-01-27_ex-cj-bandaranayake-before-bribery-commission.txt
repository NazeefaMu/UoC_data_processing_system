Ex-CJ Bandaranayake before Bribery Commission


	

Lawyers for former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake appeared before the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption in connection with the ongoing case against Ms. Bandaranayake.
 The group of lawyers appeared before the Commission to make a presentation on behalf of Ms. Bandaranayake relating to the case on non-declaration of assets by her. On January 21, the Colombo Chief Magistrate had directed the former CJ to make a presentation with regard to the case before the commission.
The Bribery Commission had filed a case before Colombo Magistrate against former Chief Justice Dr. Bandaranayake over non-declaration of assets during 2010, 2011 and 2012, at a time when she was holding the post of Chief Justice. However, counsel for Ms. Bandaranayake had maintained that the allegations levelled against former CJ were false and baseless. They had asked that steps be taken not to proceed with the case.
The Magisterial inquiry is to be taken up before court on February 19.
