Appointments of new ministers: Acts of political bribery-JVP


	

The recent appointments of four deputy ministers were acts of political bribery by President Maithripala Sirisena to retain power, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) General Secretary Tilvin Silva charged today.
While slamming the decision to appoint more ministers, he said the incumbent government was following the footsteps of the previous government in expanding the Cabinet of Ministers.
“There is no political requirement to appoint a new set of ministers. We are completely against this decision. We can only assume that the appointments were given for narrow political gains,” he told a news conference held at party headquarters.
Mr. Silva said that a proposal was included in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which was enacted recently, to limit the number of ministers in a government because of the peoples displeasure received for maintaining a jumbo cabinet in the past.
He claimed that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had split into two factions today, one supporting President Maithripala Sirisena and another backing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He said the ministerial appointments were attempts of strengthening “Maithripala” faction.
“Former Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne had been appointed as a senior adviser to the President today. Mr. Rajapaksa also did the very same thing. He made numerous appointments to secure the two thirds majority in the parliament. Though Mr. Rajapaksa was defeated, the political culture he followed still continues,” Mr. Silva said.
Meanwhile, Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Hearth said the 20th Amendment to the Constitution is being delayed because of cold war brewing in the SLFP. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)
