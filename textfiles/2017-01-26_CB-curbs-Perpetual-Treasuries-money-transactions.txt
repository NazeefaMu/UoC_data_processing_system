The Central Bank has restricted transactions of bank accounts belonging to Perpetual Treasuries Limited, State Minister of Finance, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said yesterday.

He told a media briefing that the income allegedly earned from the Central Bank bond sale by Perpetual Treasuries Ltd would not be transferable to any other account as directed by the Central Bank.

The state minister said the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd could only carry out a limited number of transactions.

“The Central Bank has taken whatever action possible for the present.  The Perpetual Treasuries Ltd has violated the Central Bank and auction sale procedures,” he said and added that the next step would be to investigate the matter and recover the loss incurred by the State under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena.
