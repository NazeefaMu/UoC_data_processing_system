Namal accuses police of haphazard arrests

UPFA Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa yesterday accused Police of mishandling the recent case of the gruesome rape and murder of a five-year-old.
"The initial haphazard arrests that were made appear to have been made without adequate investigation. On the one hand, the teenager who was initially arrested has been further remanded. Meanwhile, another suspect has allegedly confessed to the crime. If the latter is proven to be true, then the life and future of a second innocent child has been completely destroyed," Rajapaksa said in a statement yesterday.
"There is little doubt that criminal activity in this country has drastically increased in recent months. The underworld has risen once again. And just this year, we have seen an unusual number of rapes, murders and shooting incidents," he said.
"While all societies have to deal with some criminal activity, the incidents of recent months have gone to show that our law enforcement does not appear to be as vigilant or properly equipped as it used to be. Two incidents that took place in September alone are cases in point," Rajapaksa added.
