Despite assurance of uninterrupted power supply from today by Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, power cuts have been experienced in many parts of the country this morning as well.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Chairman Anura Wijepala said the Noraichcholai coal power plant would be back in operation providing continuous electricity at least from this evening.

“We have activated three of the Noraichcholai power plants but it takes at least a day to load them. There will be scheduled power cuts in several areas of the country till then,” he said.

He said the power generated from the Noraichcholai power plant was being added to the national grid and that a further 100 MW had been added to the grid. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
