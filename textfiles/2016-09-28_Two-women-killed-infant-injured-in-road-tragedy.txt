Two women were killed and a one-year-old infant was seriously injured when a speeding jeep veered off the road and knocked them down before crashing into a wayside tree at Pubbogama in Galkiriyagama last evening.

The two women, one carrying her baby, were walking along the road when they were knocked down. One of the women crushed between the tree and the jeep and her child was seriously injured when he fell into a nearby drain. The deceased P.G. Amarawathie (49) and Indika Niroshani (24) were residents of Patthagama off Galkiriyagama.

Police said the driver had either lost control of the vehicle because of the excessive speed or by falling asleep at the wheel. The driver was arrested pending investigations.
