An epistle was handed over to President Maithripala Sirisensa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by the parents of anti-SAITM students headed by the SAITM Medical Faculty Parents’ Forum chairman Gemunu Wijeratne today, urging the authorities to take instant actions against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) which thus far failed to comply with the required standars.
