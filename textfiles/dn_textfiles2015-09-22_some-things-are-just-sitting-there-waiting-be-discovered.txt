Confessions of a bookworm 7:
Some things are just sitting there, waiting to be discovered

How it unfolds
It is the story of a nine year old boy growing up during the World War II in Berlin. Following a visit by Adolf Hitler, whom he calls “the Fury” (the childish interpretation of the Führer), his father is promoted to Commandant, and Bruno and the family moves to a place that he calls “Out-with”. He is initially sad about moving, and leaving all of his friends. And very much home sick.
Home alone, and with a lot of time to kill, Bruno explores a wire fence and a camp that he sees. The story begins with him meeting Shmuel, a Jewish boy, who shares his birthday. Being barely a child himself, Bruno fails to understand the gravity of the wire fence between them. The story is woven around their friendship, the boys grow closer and closer, and we warm up to them. The story, told through Bruno’s eyes is brilliantly written. The childish ignorance of children, and the innocence at the face of a much greater tragedy is captured well by the writer.
Though small in size, and written in the simplest language, this is a treasure of book, beautiful, sad, happy and simple at the same time, it steals the minds of the readers. Effortlessly written, the story takes you on an emotional journey due to its impactful and elegant storytelling of an unlikely friendship.
MEET BRUNO
He is the protagonist of the story, born on the 15th April he is nine years old at the time the story takes place. Being a son of a Nazi commandant he has no choice but to move to “Out with” as his father’s job requires them to. Out-with is discussed by the critics as the “Auschwitz concentration camp”. Away from Berlin and miserable, the little boy sets upon his own adventure. As he loiters around the “Wire-Fence” he was forbidden to be near of. There he encounters the boy who wears “striped Pyjamas”.
The name of the book is special, as the striped Pyjamas are a decisive factor of the story. I would not spoil the amazing twist of plot you are yet to be exposed to.
MEET SHMUEL
Born on the same day as Bruno, he is on the other side of the fence for a reason. He and his family were Jewish. He explains. Shmuel is Polish, the son of a teacher and a watch-mender, who lived in a watch shop with his brother and the sister. But one day they were taken away from home, by soldiers he says. Stripping them of all the valuable possessions, and the mother was separated from the family and only the men of the family were sent to the Auschwitz Concentration camp. The two make friends with each other, due to their common birthday, and ironically despite them identifying each other as friends, a barbed wire fence separated them from each other. Though they were just inches apart, there was an immense distance, of a cruel world in between them.
Words to Remember
And now let me tempt you into reading this wonderful book!
“Just because a man glances up at the sky at night does not make him an astronomer, you know.”
“And who decided which people wore the striped pajamas and which people wore the uniforms?”
“Some things are just sitting there, waiting to be discovered. Other things are probably better off left alone”
“I think this was a bad idea,’ he repeated. ‘I think the best thing to do would be to forget all about this and just go back home. We can chalk it up to experience,”
“But there was something about the new house that made Bruno think that no one ever laughed there; that there was nothing to laugh at and nothing to be happy about.”
“Don't make it worse by thinking it's more painful than it actually is.”
Bruno: Why do you wear pajamas all day?
Shmuel: The soldiers. They took all our clothes away.
Bruno: My dad's a soldier, but not the sort that takes people's clothes away.
REASONS TO READ
The book is simple, and small and not too much of burden if you do not have much time to read. It is a wonderful read- trust me you won’t put it down until the very last page. And you will have your own story to tell once you put it down.
This is the ideal book to gift your book worm friend, or if you really want to get someone to start reading, yes, this is the ideal book to gift. A book so small, doesn’t even hint that it could carry a story so deep. Yet the way it is written, and the fairy tale like ease that the story is told will leave you craving for more.
Unlike, other stories of its kind, it doesn’t carry too much information or depth at a glance as it is told through the eyes of a nine year old. But that is the beauty of the book, the way the child thinks of the world versus, the way the adults treated the world. It is indeed one amazing book, a must-have if you are a bookworm.
