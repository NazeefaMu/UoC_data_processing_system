UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said yesterday he had no intention of accepting the post of Prime Minister at this point in time but indicated that he could be the party's prime ministerial candidate at a future general election.

Mr. Premadasa said this at a media briefing held at parliamentary complex when responding to s question asked by the journalists with regard to a statement made by UNP spokesman Harin Fernando that Mr. Premadasa would be party's prime ministerial candidate at a future general election.

"Mr. Fernando has referred to what may happen in the future and not about the present," he said and added that in any case it was the party's working committee which had to decide on such matters.

Meanwhile, Mr. Premadasa said the party had decided that its current leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should be the Prime Minister in the event of reverting to status quo prior to October 26.

He said had had not had any political discussions with former president Maihinda Rajapaksa or with anyone else at a recent religious ceremony held in memory of late educationist R.I.T. Alles. "Some media reports said I was playing a political game. Sajith Premadasa does not play political games," Mr. Premadasa said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
