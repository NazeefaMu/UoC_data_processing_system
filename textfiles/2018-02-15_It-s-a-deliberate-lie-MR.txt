Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today rejected Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Seneratne's claim that he had requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe not to step down from the Premiership.

"It is a deliberate lie; this is another lie of Rajitha. As a senior minister he should now stop uttering these kinds of lies and making irresponsible statements," former President Rajapaksa told the media at the Narahenpita Abhayarama Temple.
