Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa today said that his phone was tapped and that was not a problem for him as his approach was straightforward even during telephone conservations.


This was transpired by him when he spoke to the media after attending the Avant Garde Maritime Services case which was taken up for hearing at the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court, where seven suspects, including his brother Gotabhaya were released on bail today.


“Some ministers of the current government had been inquired by some people to know for what reason I spoke to them over the phone. To know that I had made such calls, it was clear that my phone has been tapped,” he said.


He further said the democracy of the country is questionable if these kinds of activities are allowed to repeat.
