The Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC recently signed two three-year Collective Agreements with the Ceylon Bank Employees’ Union (CBEU) in furtherance of the bank’s commitment to uphold the principle of effective recognition of employee organisations and their right to collective bargaining.
These new agreements are revisions of the 2015 agreements which lapsed on December 31st 2017, and will be in force till December 31st 2020, the bank said. They cover non-executive staff and the Junior Executive Assistants and Allied Grades of the bank. A Memorandum of Understanding covering the Junior Executive Officers of the bank was also signed along with the Collective Agreements on January 16th 2018.


Commenting on the signing of these agreements, Commercial Bank Human Resource Management Deputy General Manager Isuru Tillakawardana said: “The arrival at a mutual understanding on matters that are important to both parties, as major partners of the industry, is significant and mutually beneficial. Much intense discussion, debate and brain-storming went into negotiations during the process which was supported by the Employers’ Federation of Ceylon. These agreements provide for clear understanding and a basic plan for enhancing productivity for the benefit of the organisation coupled with rewards to the employees. They form a framework that is focused towards achieving sustainable growth while protecting all stakeholder interests.”


Commercial Bank has signed agreements of this nature on time with the CBEU for the last 17 years, creating a proud tradition and an example for productive partnership in the industry, he added. Commercial Bank Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Jegan Durairatnam and Chief Operating Officer/Executive Director S. Renganathan signed the agreements on behalf of the bank. CBEU President T.G.W. Gunawardana and Secretary General S.M.A.R. Senanayake signed on behalf of the CBEU.

Nandula and CBEU (Commercial Bank Branch Union) Secretary Samantha Ratnayake witnessed the Agreements.
