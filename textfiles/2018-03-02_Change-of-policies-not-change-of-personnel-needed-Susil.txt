Without changing the policies of the government, merely changing heads would not bring about the results that were needed, SLFP National Organizer, Minister Susil Premajayantha said.

He added that a failure to understand this message delivered by the people at the recently concluded Local Government election has resulted in there being no way forward for this government.

He pointed out that these election results showed that their was a clear need to change the policies of the government and that things cannot be solved just by a change of personnel. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)
