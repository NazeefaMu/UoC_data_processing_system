A coordinating secretary of a certain Ministry is reportedly receiving a high monthly pay from a statutory body dealing with foreign economic aid in violation of a Treasury Circular. 




This white collar one is said to be continuing to draw a higher monthly pay of Rs.80,000 from the statutory body where he worked before joining the Ministry staff.


By the way, this coordinating secretary is due to go on retirement in March this year. His terminal benefits will include the EPF and ETF awards for his service at the statutory body in addition to a monthly pension for serving on the Ministry staff in the capacity of a coordinating secretary for over five years!
