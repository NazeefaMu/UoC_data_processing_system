The widow and the children of the late JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera had been asked to vacate the Navy quarters they had been occupying in Welisara on October 1, the party’s general secretary Tilvin Silva said.
He said that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna would continue to provide protection to the family.
He said that the party had been providing them with their requirements in the past as well and would continue to provide such relief and accommodation in the future.
Mr. Wijeweera’s widow and six children handed themselves over to the Army Headquarters following the assassination of Wijeweera in 1989. The then government assured protection to the family providing protection and shelter at the Naval Quarters in Trincomalee and Welisara.
The letter informing the family to vacate the house had been signed by former Navy Commander Admiral Jayantha Perera, following the peaceful situation in the country. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
