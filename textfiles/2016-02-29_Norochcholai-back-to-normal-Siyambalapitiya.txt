The Norochcholai coal power plant would supply its full electricity capacity of 900 MW to the national grid from today, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

The power plant was not running to the full capacity during the last few days due to maintenance work and inclement weather.

He said following the Norochcholai adding more power the national grid had become normal.

The Minister announced this while on an inspection tour this afternoon to accelerate the construction of Kegalle Urban Council Stadium, which is built at a cost of Rs. 300 million.

Earlier the Ceylon Electricity Board had requested utility users to use power diligently following an islandwide power failure on Thursday. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
