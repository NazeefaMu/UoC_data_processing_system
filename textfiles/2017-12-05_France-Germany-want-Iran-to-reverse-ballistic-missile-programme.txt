REUTERS, 04th DECEMBER, 2017- France and Germany agree that Iran must reverse its ballistic missile programme and end its “hegemonic temptations” across the Middle east, the French foreign minister said on Monday.


“We also have the same view on the necessity for Iran to go back on its ballistic missile programme and its hegemonic temptations,” Jean-Yves Le Drian said at a news conference alongside his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel.
