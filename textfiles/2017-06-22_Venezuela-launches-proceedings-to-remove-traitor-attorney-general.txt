DPA, 21st JUNE, 2017- Venezuela’s highest court on Tuesday approved proceedings against Attorney General Luisa Ortega, the highest- profile government critic of President Nicolas Maduro, which could lead to her removal.


The Supreme Court approved a lawsuit against her by Socialist lawmaker Pedro Carreno, who accused her of committing a serious offence in the carrying out of her office, according to El Nacional newspaper.  He also accused her of failing to respect the court’s democratic decisions. Ortega has been called a “traitor” by the ruling Socialists since March when she opposed a bid by the Supreme Court - loyal to Maduro - to strip the opposition-controlled National Assembly of its powers.
