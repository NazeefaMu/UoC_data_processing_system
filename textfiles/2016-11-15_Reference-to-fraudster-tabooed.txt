Reference to fraudster tabooed


	

A group of employees of an august institution who were recently at a meeting with the institution’s white collar heavyweights had not been allowed to bring up for discussion a case of embezzlement of Rs.100 million from the institution’s savings and thrift society. 

 


Informed sources say that in an obvious attempt to shield the fraudster involved, the heavyweights had told the employees: “Let us not talk about this case as it is already before courts.”


The embezzler who was virtually running the affairs of the society all by himself had exploited the trust placed in him by the members of the society. It has come to light that the culprit had been diddling the society funds over the years and had also made gratuity payments from the society funds only to a select few on their retirement.
