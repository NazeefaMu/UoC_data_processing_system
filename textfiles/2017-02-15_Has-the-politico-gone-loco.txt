Has the politico gone loco?


	



 

The politico presiding over the country’s popular game at national level has thrown the functioning of the body controlling the game into a melting pot by becoming a law unto himself, they say.

 


Often bragging that he is on the way to a much higher political office, the politico is reportedly poking his nose into all affairs to the annoyance of those working with dedication to promote the game.

 
Even the Master Blaster who is handling the task of selecting the team making necessary changes now and then too has found the politico’s meddling and his overbearing attitude intolerable and has sent in his resignation in utter disgust.


He had been prevailed upon to withdraw the resignation he submitted on two previous occasions, they say.
