President seeks SC determination -- On expiry of his term of office


	

President Maithripala Sirisena has sought a determination from the Supreme Court as to when his term will expire, an official said yesterday.

The President is reported to have done so because of an ambiguity on the term limit after the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Earlier, the Constitution said a President was elected for a term of six years but it has been restricted to five years after the enactment of the 19th Amendment. The Supreme Court has listed the case for January 11 and SC determination is to be communicated to the President on January 14.

Sri Lanka Bar Association Chairman U.R. De Silva told Daily Mirror that his organization and the Attorney General's Department had been asked to make their submissions in this regard. (Kelum Bandara)
