The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today warned of an indefinite strike without prior notice in protest against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).

GMOA Secretary, Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the decision was unanimously approved by its Central Committee.

“We will be forced to launch an indefinite strike if the related authorities continue to provide fake solutions to the issue which will lead to the legalization of the SAITM,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
