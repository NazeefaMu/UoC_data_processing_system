One-time stalwart is now an irritant in their side!


	



 

A JO stalwart hailing from mangosteen growing Pasdun Korale is said to be on the way out of Pohottuwa.

 


A series of public statements highly critical of the military sibling of the R-family made recently by this politico have reportedly stirred up a hornet’s nest in the JO and some JO seniors including the Blues who recently threw in their lot with the group are reportedly livid over the criticisms made against the popular sibling despite Pohottuwa not having decided on their candidate for the big poll yet. 


They have now asked the former strongman to suitably deal with the dissident shooting off his mouth.
However, the former strongman continues to keep mum on the issue, they say.
