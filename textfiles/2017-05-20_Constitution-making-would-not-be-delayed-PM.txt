Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that he had informed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders that the constitution-making process would not be delayed.

He said this at the opening of the new District Secretariat Office in Mannar and underscored the fact that Mr. Modi and other world leaders including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had hoped Sri Lanka would resolve the national question through a constitutional process.

"Prime Minister Modi discussed this matter with me, President Maithripala Sirisena, the Leader of the Opposition and with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. I told Mr Modi that the steering committee of the Constituent Assembly will submit their report within in two months to be followed by enacting the new constitution after discussions," he said. “We cannot drag the constitution-making process anymore. President Sirisena was elected in 2015 to fulfil this purpose."

He said economic development would include the North as well, when permanent peace was established in the area with a fair proportion of power devolution.

"This is a time when Sri Lankans are commemorating those who died during the armed conflict. Those on both sides of the divide are Sri Lankans. However, the important factor is to ensure that there won't be another war in the future," the Prime Minister said.

Industries and Trade Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said it was important to include the North in the Government's development plans and that the northern people should also enjoy the benefits of GSP plus which the country re-gained yesterday.

Deputy Chairman of Committees, MP Selvam Adaikkalanathan said issues pertaining to resettlement and employment should be addressed by the government. He said President Sirisena has been invited to visit the North on another day other that on the day tha war heroes were being commemorated. (Yohan Perera)
