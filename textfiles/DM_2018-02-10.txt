## Title: Ceylon Manohar died, but did we know

Ceylon Manohar died, but did we know
	

Singer and actor A. E. Manoharan passed away in India last month and his funeral was held in Chennai on January 24.
His death was little noticed in Sri Lanka. He wasnt a fan of attention-grabbing through social media. The latent racism ever present in our arts and politics meant that even people who knew him personally chose to ignore the end of a remarkable bi-cultural product of a more culturally eclectic era and remained silent about his demise rather than write a few words about this remarkably talented artiste.
I didnt know him personally, though Ive been an admirer of him ever since Mal Muruga Yezhil (The Tamil version of Kanda Surinduni by the Super Golden Chimes) came out.
Clarence Wijewardenas song came out in the mid-1970s as an EP vinyl record on the Sooriya label, with that famous black and white photograph of the Super Golden Chimes posing for the camera near the Kataragama Devalaya (Shrine).
Manoharan isnt in this picture, since he wasnt part of the group.

The latent racism ever present in our arts and politics meant that even people who knew him personally chose to ignore the end of a remarkable bi-cultural product of a more culturally eclectic era and remained silent about his demise rather than write a few words...

I dont remember exactly when the Tamil version followed. But I remember that the bi-lingual version sung by Clarence and Manoharan became a hit over SLBC radio waves soon after. Vernon Corea was a big fan of Clarence and he aired the Sinhala version on the SLBC English Commercial Service, and in 1976 on his BBC radio programme London Sounds Eastern.
He may have aired the bi-lingual version, too, though I cant vouch for that.

Soothing voice
This bi-lingual version occupies a unique place in our music. Its not known whose idea it was. Whether Clarence thought about it and spoke to Manoharan, and vice versa, or if it was the latters idea, or if Gerald Wickremasooriya, innovative businessman and owner of Sooriya Records, saw the potential and got them to it.
No matter whose idea it was, the result is one of the most innovative and moving pop songs ever produced here. Manoharans mellifluous, soothing voice is a perfect match for Clarences more sonorous and strident baritone.
When I tried to contact him in the 1990s, Manoharan was working for the BBCs Tamil service in London. I continuously tried during the past decade, but he was always away in India. Its from secondary sources that I learned that he was a prolific actor in South Indian films.
He started his acting career in Sri Lanka, having been spotted by Joe Dev Anand, but achieved much greater success in India. He is said to have acted in over 200 films, and his co-stars have included Kamal Haasan, Rajnikanth and N.T. Rama Rao.
He has reportedly said that his success as a 70s pop singer in Sri Lanka is derived at least partly from his fluency in Sinhala.
Born in Bogawantalawa, he was taught Sinhala and Pali by his father, a school Principal. The family was musical. While Manoharan sang as a child in a church choir led by his mother, his father played the organ.
Gerald Wickremasooriya spotted the ebullient young singers talent and invited him to sing a new version of Wally Bastians baila hit Surangani, to which he owned the copyright.
This was followed by Tamil versions of other baila hits such as Hai Hooi Babi Aachchige.
Manoharan with his excellent command of Sinhala may have translated the songs himself, though much research needs to be done to unearth this fascinating musical history.

He was born in 1945, three years before the Independence. His formative years were in a cultural setting still steeped in the colonial legacy.


Tolerant individual
In the 1970s, he was employed as a radio drama producer for the SLBC and lived in Colombo.
Though the embers of ethnic strife which openly erupted into civil war and race riots in the early 80s were simmering underneath, the career of Manoharan in the 1970s offers us a fascinating example of culturally more tolerant, hence more productive, socio-political milieu able to bridge the racial divide.
Rukmani Devi has been cited as another example, but lets not forget that the masses thought of her as Sinhalese.
She underwent a cultural and racial metamorphosis as an iconic heartthrob of the Sinhala cinema, and as a singer. While everyone knows her Mevila Penevi Rupe or Malbara Himidiriye, it is hard to think of a Tamil song sung by Rukmani.
Even her name, Daisy Daniels, doesnt sound half as bad as say, Thangamma or Saundarie.
But Anthonypillai Emmanuel Manoharan was always Manoharan. He became a pop icon in the 70s for both Sinhala and Tamil pop fans, but he didnt become a Sinhalese by cultural osmosis.
In South India, he was known as Ceylon Manohar. He sang his successful version of Surangani in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu and Malayalam.
Its impact in India can be gauged by this  when Sri Lankan-born Indian violin prodigy L. Subramaniam performed at the BMICH recently, the Sinhala song sung by his daughter and granddaughter was Surangani.

Best of both worlds
Manoharans repertoire included more than 500 pop songs.
Manoharan was finally able to have the best of both worlds, as a pop star and broadcaster in Sri Lanka, and as an actor in India. But the credit for that goes to a unique time frame in our history.
He was born in 1945, three years before the Independence. His formative years were in a cultural setting still steeped in the colonial legacy. Despite all that one may say about British colonialism, its imperial and racial arrogance as well as exploitation (and one can say quite a bit), one cannot deny the element of cultural tolerance and moderation it left behind.
It is this sense of moderation which led to the bi-lingual version Kanda Surinduni. It is hard to imagine a song of this sort becoming popular today, and being promoted by our dime-a-dozen FM radio stations.
Let alone a new venture in racial harmony, I have not heard the old song aired by a single station, Sinhala or Tamil, in many years. Is this collective cultural amnesia
Whenever I listen to Mal Muruga Yezhil now, I am terribly saddened by a sense of something precious lost forever.
But one cant help reflecting that Manoharans success here in the 70s owes much to the absence of television. Relatively few Sinhalese fans saw him at concerts.
It is his voice that they knew. If the image too, comes up every time one hears the song, the subconscious feeling that it is being sung by a Tamil works like poison into the mind.
Today, with the ubiquitous television, social media images and videos, artistes are seen by many as Sinhalese and Tamils first, and as singers and artistes second.
This is the reason why we have never been able to have a truly national cinema. We have a Sinhala cinema and its poor cousin, a Tamil cinema. No Tamil actor has ever become an icon of the Sinhala cinema. Even an intellectual film like Welikathara, mostly happening in the north, has Tamil actors only for the minor parts.
In Hollywood, despite a deep racial divide in the US, both black and white actors are successful. One cant argue it is because they both speak the same language.
African-American English is distinct and you dont find white actors strutting across the screen in balaclavas, shouting yo man.
Manoharan acted in South Indian cinema rather than in Sinhala films because of that racial divide. If anyone says that isnt true, the answer to that is yo.

China says US bill on Taiwan ties  threatens stability
	

REUTERS, 09th FEBRUARY, 2018- A U.S. bill that encourages reciprocal visits by U.S. and Taiwanese government officials threatens stability in the Taiwan Strait and the United States must withdraw it, Chinas Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
The bill passed the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations this week and will now move to the Senate.
Beijing considers democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province and integral part of one China, ineligible for state-to-state relations, and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.
The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the islands main source of arms. China regularly says Taiwan is the most sensitive issue in its ties with Washington.
Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said though the clauses in the bill are not legally binding they are a serious violation of the one China principle.
If it is passed and put into effect, it will cause serious disturbances to Sino-U.S. relations and the situation in the Taiwan Strait, Geng said.
China is extremely dissatisfied and resolutely opposed to this and has already lodged stern representations with the U.S. side, he added.
The One China principle is the political basis of Sino-U.S. relations.

Dilip: Memories that refuse to go
	
On January 25, 2016 when the Good Lord above decided that Dilips stint on earth must come to an end, it was a very sad and rude shock to all of us as he was such a vibrant and healthy person that none of us saw this coming.
I had a very close relationship with Dilip from my early days in school as we were not only in the same class but also we resided not more than 200 metres apart with the Peterson Playground, Wellawatte separating our homes.
Dilip set up a lending library at his home and I availed myself of his library to borrow and return all the favourite books at that time, like Hardy Boys, Fredrick Forsyth, Tintin and Agatha Christie to name a few.
This made me frequently visit his home and this led to a very close relationship ever since.
In addition, this library service that Dilip graciously provided to us at a very early age played a very significant part in inculcating the reading habit in me which contributed significantly to my success in the later years of life especially in my tertiary studies. Likewise, our other classmates and numerous other friends too benefited similarly from this library.
This sense of community service was demonstrated throughout his entire life by being a member of the Rotary Club for several years where he was involved in several service projects, being on the committees of professional organisations like the IAA and most personally and significantly by his immense contribution to our class of 75, also known as Archibald Group for over 30 years.
He played a big part with a few others in organising the 50th anniversary reunion which was a resounding and memorable success and brought us together from all corners of the globe as one big family with our immediate families together with the camaraderie and fellowship that ensued.
As for his traits and qualities, throughout the entire period I knew Dilip very closely, I never knew him to get angry and irritable even once.
He was quiet and never imposed his will. He was a great team player and always went out of his way to oblige anyone who wanted any assistance without expecting anything in return and this will be attested to by the many, who benefited by this wonderful trait that Dilip, dmonstrated. throughout his life.
Dilip went into the accounting profession and I went into the banking sphere after leaving school.
On a very personal note the most significant impact that Dilip had on my life was when he persuaded me to join him in his accounting studies of the UK accounting body- CIMA, promising that he would guide and mentor me. Singlehandedly, without my having to attend a single lecture or seek guidance from anyone else, he ensured that I successfully completed the tough examinations to gain professional membership to the UK body and the huge impact that these studies had on my later life professionally, would always be attributed and dedicated to him.
Dilips yeoman service to the Community, his friends, classmates and all others around him would not have been possible if not for the support from his wife Niranjali and a big Thank you is owed to her in these difficult times as she copes with his sudden loss from her midst. May God give her the strength and courage to cope with Dilips demise.
People come and go in our lives but memories dont and I am sure pleasant and fond memories of Dilip will be embedded in us for the rest of our lives.

May the Lord shower choicest blessings
	
Delighted to send my greetings and congratulation to dearest, Emmanuel Cecil Sandrasegara of Mathagal, Jaffna, born on January 24, 1918, gifted and blessed to celebrate his unique journey reaching one-hundredth birthday.
The centenary was celebrated on January 24, 2018, in Colombo.
All his beloved children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, relatives and friends from abroad celebrated the god gifted precious day at the Mount Lavinia Hotel, Sri Lanka.
Late Mr Muthiah Sandrasegara and late Mrs Victoria Chellammah Sandrasegara were orthodox Catholic parents of Mathagal and were blessed with four sons and two daughters.
Emmanuel as the third chubby and fair son in the family enjoyed the love and affection of all and became the pet of all.
After completing his secondary education at St Henrys College, Illavalai Emmanuel joined the Bank of Ceylon very early in life and served with exemplary records and retired in September 1976 after serving his full term.
His honesty, punctuality and hard work appreciated by his Superiors enriched with promotions and he received the highest respects from his colleagues and juniors.
Mathagal is a village in the Jaffna Diocese, where St Joseph Vaz preached the Word of God and converted many to Christianity.
The Catholic inhabitants built a church in honour of St Anthony and invoked his blessings.
Emmanuel having inherited his faith in God from his parents became deeply religious in his faith and in St Anthony Patron of Mathagal.
Cecil Emmanuel better known as Sinnathamby in Mathagal and among his relatives cherished a long fruitful life by the graceful blessings of Saint Anthony.
Emmanuel married Mangiairkarasy and both were blessed with one daughter Ratneswary and two sons Raveendran and Pullen ran.
Being a devoted husband and affectionate father, educated his children and brought them up in the fear of God, instilled in them noble qualities to blossom in their lives.
A man of sound character with virtuous qualities ever cheerful with pleasant and charm disposition, greeting everyone with his radiant smile. He is always there to serve others voluntarily in their needs and never spoke harsh words or ill of others. Very talented to entertain his friends with witty jokes and laughter by relating their family history and spirits up all at parties even being a teetotaler.
His priority in life is to attend all weddings when invited and to be there always for all the funerals of friends, relatives, and every known person in the village.
His life was not that rosy. He lost his beloved wife Mangai and his daughter Ratnes but his faith in God and St Anthony sustained him in all his trials and triumphs.
The Late Augustine Sandrasegara, the elder brother of Emmanuel, who was working as Govt. Officer in Kayts often visited our home in Karampon to renew the family relationship with my mother Thangarasam Soosaipillai.
In fact, his mother late Mrs Chellammah Sandrasegera called Akka by my mother brought the marriage proposal for my sister Clinett to Dr Joe Peter from Green Shade, Mathagal and he became my bro-in-law.
As an Extraordinary Eucharistic Minister of Holy Communion from St Lawrences Parish, I was privileged to visit Emmanuel at the Elders Home in Wellawatte and offer him to receive Holy Communion on 1st Fridays.
May Lord Almighty shower choicest Blessings on Emmanuel and grace him Good Health and Long life.

15.8 mn voters to mark their choice today
	
Nearly 15.8 million voters will cast their votes today to elect 8,356 members to 341 local government bodies in a nationally important and decisive election to be held in Sri Lanka's recent political history.
This election is the first-ever local government polls held under the new electoral system in the wake of the enactment of the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No.22 of 2012, which was the outcome of the recommendations of an all-party parliamentary select committee chaired by parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardana.
Nominations were received in two stages after several civil society activists filed objections to the delimitation report.
It resulted in nominations being received to 93 LG bodies from December 10 to 14 and for 248 LG bodies on December 21. The final tally stood at 2,076 nomination lists submitted by political parties and independent groups being accepted and 52 nomination lists being rejected.
On the basis of the accepted nominations lists, 15,760,852 registered voters will mark their choice from among the 57,252 candidates from 43 political parties and 222 independent groups who will be vying for 341 LG bodies comprising 24 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 276 Pradeshiya Sabhas making a total of 341 LG bodies made up of 8,356 slots in 4,913 wards.
Some 560,020 eligible voters have been registered to vote by post on January 25 and 26. The election secretariat has set up 13,374 polling centres which will also be used to count votes and declare the results. It has also deployed 175,000 public officials on election duty.
The relatively peaceful election campaign ended on Wednesday midnight with the major political parties -- the UNP, the SLFP, the JVP and the SLPP focusing on corruption, financial and administrative mismanagement and the economic crisis as their main slogan during the campaign. Meanwhile, Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said all precautionary measures had been taken to ensure a free and fair election with the deployment of 65,758 police personnel including STF personnel.
The voting begins at 7.00 am and ends at 4.00 pm. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Modi heads to Palestinian territories to balance warming ties with Israel
	

REUTERS, 09th FEBRUARY, 2018-After a public embrace of Israel as a strategic partner, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is heading to the Palestinian territories and the Gulf on Friday to bolster long-standing political and economic ties.
India was one of the earliest champions of the Palestinian cause but in recent years turned to Israel for high-tech military equipment and anti-terrorism cooperation.
Under Modi, whose nationalist party sees Israel as a natural ally against Islamist extremism, ties have flourished. Modi made the first trip to Israel by an Indian prime minister last year followed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyanus visit to India last month.
But Indian officials said India continued to support the Palestinian cause and that Modis visit is aimed at helping build up the Palestinians capacity in the health, information technology and education areas. We have de-hyphenated our relations with Palestine and Israel and now we see them both as mutually independent and exclusive and as part of this policy the prime minister is undertaking this visit, B. Bala Bhaskar, a joint secretary in the Indian foreign ministry, said.
The two sides are building a India-Palestinian technology park in Ramallah, the Palestinians seat of government, which will develop IT expertise and generate employment.
Modi is due to arrive in Jordan later on Friday and travel to Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, on Saturday. During his visit to Israel last year, he did not travel to the Palestinian headquarters as is usually the case with visiting leaders.
Looking forward to my discussions with President Mahmoud Abbas and reaffirming our support for the Palestinian people and the development of Palestine, Modi said in a Twitter post.

REUTERS, 09th FEBRUARY, 2018-North Koreas ceremonial leader and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence may have their first face-to-face encounter on Friday at the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, as Washington prepares more sanctions against the North.
Any contact between the two will likely be tense after Pence said South Korean President Moon Jae-in gave his backing to additional measures the United States is planning to try to curb North Koreas missile and nuclear programs.
Pence said Moon acknowledged the effectiveness of sanctions in bringing North Korea to inter-Korean talks.
President Moon reaffirmed to me his strong support of our extreme pressure campaign to continue to bring additional sanctions on North Korea, Pence told reporters.
He spoke after paying tribute at a memorial for 46 South Korean sailors killed in the sinking of a warship in 2010 that Seoul blamed on a North Korean torpedo attack.
Pence arrived in South Korea on Thursday and spoke with Moon, both reiterating their commitment and cooperation to defuse tensions as North Korea pushes ahead with its weapons programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
Kim Yong Nam, North Koreas nominal head of state, landed in South Korea on Friday along with leader Kim Jong Uns younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, aboard her brothers private jet.
The white aircraft had Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, North Koreas official name, inscribed in black in Korean on its side, followed by the North Korean flag.

Pangolin found inside freezer: Tourism authority launches inquiry
	
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) said it had launched an inquiry into the incident where a Pangolin was found inside a freezer at a restaurant in Kollupitiya.
In a statement, the SLTDA said the license of the restaurant would be cancelled, if found guilty.
"We will not hesitate to take action against tourism service providers who fail to adhere to the country's legal and regulatory framework. With the cancellation of the license, the restaurant would no longer be considered a legal tourism service provider in Sri Lanka," it said.
The SLTDA said, in such an event, it would also request the Department of Immigration and Emigration to cancel the visa of the Chinese national who functioned as the restaurant operator.
A similar request would be made to the Excise Department to cancel its liquor license.
The restaurant in question, 'Tong Ni Roast Meet', is located at Walukarama Mawatha, Colombo o3.
"Our intention is to ensure that all registered tourism industry service providers adopt highest professional processes. We will expedite our screening processes with the establishment of the Enforcement Unit under the SLTDA, " the statement said.
The Police found the Pangolin inside a freezer of the restaurant when they conducted an inspection following a tip-off, last week.

US govt. shuts down, again
	

The Senate has passed a two-year budget bill and sent the legislation to the House for approval in a bid to end a shutdown of the US government, the second in three weeks.
The bill, which had been held up by Republican Senator Rand Paul over objections to the impact on the national debt, was passed by 71 votes to 28 early Friday.
Lawmakers in the House of Representatives were expected to endorse the bill in coming hours and end the hours-long shutdown.
The US government technically ran out of money at the stroke of midnight.
Senate leaders and their counterparts in the House of Representatives had been working all week toward meeting the deadline to pass the 400-billion-dollar two-year budget bill, which is paired with a short-term spending bill that funds the government through March. But a vote hit a snag over Pauls objections to hundreds of billions of dollars of additional spending included in the legislation. Paul repeatedly blocked votes on the bill in an effort to force a vote on an amendment that would keep current spending limits in place.
Speaking on the Senate floor, Paul said US taxpayers are getting stuck with the bill as spending levels beyond the amount of revenue are allowed. The bill, announced Wednesday, represented a rare bipartisan achievement. It includes spending for both domestic programmes and funding for the military that President Donald Trump has sought.
The bill was meant to avoid another government shutdown like the last one - a three-day closure in January. But with the clock ticking late Thursday, the White Houses budget office directed federal agencies to prepare for a lapse in funding.
