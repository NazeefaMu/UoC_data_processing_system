Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara today confirmed that the case productions (passport and National identity cards), relating to the inquiry conducted against Sashi Weerawansa over allegedly obtaining a forged passport submitting fraudulent details, had not gone missing but were in the possession of Court Production Officer.

Reprimanding the CID, Chief Magistrate explained that the CID officer had recklessly requested court productions of case from the Chief Registrar but at the time the case productions were with the case production officer of Chief Magistrate’s Court Complex.

The Magistrate ascertained that due to the irresponsibility and not following procedural aspects properly before complaining such allegation the CID officer had defamed the court staff setting false news to the Media.

The Chief Magistrate further observed that disclosure of such false information in open court could lead general public to lose the faith on independence of the judiciary. (Shehan Chamika Silva and Yoshitha Perera)
