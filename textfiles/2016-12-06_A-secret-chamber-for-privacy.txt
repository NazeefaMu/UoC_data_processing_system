A secret chamber for privacy!


	

A purohita in yahapalanaya hailing from the South is said to be maintaining a secret chamber in his official residence.

 


He is using this secret chamber for safe-keeping of his highly confidential correspondence and documents apart from a few personal effects such as reference books and stationery items. And he has allowed only his son the ‘open sesame’ to it, they say.  The purohita had remained inside this secret chamber when a big party thrown by the family last week got underway. And when he made a late appearance at the party, a political high-up from the Western province who was among the guests had inquired from him where he was when the merry making was going on. The purohita had replied: “I am writing a book these days. I wanted to jot down certain important things I suddenly remembered before they could fade from my memory.”
