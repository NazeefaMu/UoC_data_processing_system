SLTB also to strike over SAITM


	

Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) has threatened to stop work on Friday (5) over what it claims as a move to privatize higher education system by recognizing SAITM as a degree awarding medical institution, the SLTB Joint Trade Union Alliance said.

It rejected the efforts of a powerful minister to establish private institutions in the country and said those institutions will sabotage the State Universities.

Expressing his views on this matter the All Ceylon Transport Employees’ Association General Secretary Sepala Liyanage said it was not possible to produce a doctor just like producing a bus driver or a conductor which was the reason behind entering to an alliance with the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA).
