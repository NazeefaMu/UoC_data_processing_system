Joint opposition to family contender for key post


	



 

The ‘joint opposition’ has now laid the groundwork for launching the much publicized new political party.

 


However, a cold war has already begun between two prominent contenders for the post of national organizer of the new party. One contender is a member of the former royal family and the other is a big-mouthed Diyawanna member from the South, they say. 


Meanwhile, a powerful section of the ‘joint opposition’ has taken up the stance that no member from the former royal family should be picked for the post of national organizer if the former strongman is elected the party leader. 


The member of the deposed royal family eyeing the coveted post in the proposed new party is not a popular figure in the ‘joint opposition’. His rival Diyawanna member from the South is not well-liked either.
