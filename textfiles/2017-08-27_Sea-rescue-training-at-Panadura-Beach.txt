A comprehensive Sea Rescue training program was carried out by the Sri Lanka Air Force on Friday (25) at the Panadura Beach.

The Training programme included winch operations as well as rappelling operations which are used to rescue people who are stranded over water. Since, it is essential for all personnel involved to be thorough, the exercise was carried out in real time, where people simulated being stranded at sea, while the rescue teams were flown over water to carry out the rescue.

The operation was carried out with 2 helicopters and Commanding Officer of No 4 Squadron, Wing Commander Asela Kuruwita and the Commanding officer of Regiment Special Forces Wing, Squadron Leader Thusitha Nandaka Kumara led the training program.(SLAF)
