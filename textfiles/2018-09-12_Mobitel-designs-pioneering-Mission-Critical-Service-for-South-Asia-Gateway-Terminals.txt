Mobitel, the National Mobile Service Provider was selected by the South Asia Gateway Terminals (Pvt) Ltd (SAGT), a leading container terminal operator in Sri Lanka, as its trusted provider of mission critical communications. This collaboration is even more significant for Mobitel, because this is the first-ever mission critical secure communication network implemented in Sri Lanka, with Mobitel being the sole technical partner for SAGT. After designing and implementing the system, it is currently managing the network on behalf of SAGT.

As part of this exciting partnership, Mobitel has delivered a communication system based on the ubiquitous LTE technology, which it customised for SAGT’s mission critical communications within the shipping port. In doing so, Mobitel ensured SAGT benefitted from the advantages of deploying the world-renowned 3GPP standardised LTE technology. Some of the benefits accrued to SAGT as a result are mass market device availability at significantly lower costs, utilisation of licensed spectrum ensuring the network is safeguarded from radio frequency interference, proven network security and secure communications, and alignment with Mobitel’s 25-year experience in operations.

Mobitel has firmly positioned itself as an Innovator and as the National Mobile Service Provider, it is driving Sri Lanka’s ICT transformation. Mobitel’s march on its strategic path is ever more apparent in the solution it has deployed for SAGT. Ensuring mission critical services over LTE required Mobitel to specifically optimise service reliability within the geographic boundaries of the port, while increasing bandwidth and redesigning the network for reduced latency, a key parameter for mission critical services. 

As the National Mobile Service Provider, the company has put its ‘We Care. Always.’ promise into operation by institutionalizing the same in its strategic organizational framework. The innovative customisation of Mobitel’s globally acclaimed LTE network has resulted in improved productivity of the port operations owing to Mobitel’s unparalleled service reliability. 

This solution was customized for SAGT by Mobitel Business Solutions (MBS), which is a dedicated division of Mobitel formulated to cater the corporate clients with unique ICT solutions embraced with mobile technologies to realize their fullest business potential.
