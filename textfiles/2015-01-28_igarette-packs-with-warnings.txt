	The Cabinet of Ministers yesterday approved legislation to make it compulsory for cigarette manufacturers to cover 80 percent of the outer surface of cigarette packets with pictorial warnings against the dangers of smoking, Daily Mirror learns.
	The Cabinet, with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in the chair, met President Maitripala Sirisena last evening.  The law is to be enacted by Parliament during the 100 day programme of the new government.
	At present, only 60 percent of space has to be covered with such warnings. (Kelum Bandara)
