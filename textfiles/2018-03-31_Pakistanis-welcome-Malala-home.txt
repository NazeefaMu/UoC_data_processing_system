Pakistanis welcome  Malala home


	

ISLAMABAD AFP March30, 2018- Malala Yousafzai’s whereabouts in Pakistan were being kept a tightly-guarded secret Friday, one day after her emotional return more than five years after being shot by Taliban gunmen.   


But with intense criticism among the many messages of welcome, her itinerary was being kept under wraps over security fears, with even those meeting her not being told of her presence until the last moment.    Women’s rights activist Nighat Dad said that she and a group of other feminists from across Pakistan who were gathered on Thursday were not told they would be meeting Malala until the last moment.    The organiser, Oscar-winning director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, only told them “It’ll be the highlight of your year,” Dad said -- adding that she had been right.
