AIA Group Limited, the largest independent publicly listed pan-Asian life insurance group, announced the achievement of becoming the only company in the world to have achieved the largest number of Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) members for three consecutive years.

 
A record total of 8,324 AIA agents and agency leaders were registered as MDRT members as of 1 July, representing an increase of 46 per cent in members from 2016 and a tremendous 460 per cent growth since the company’s IPO in 2010.  


MDRT is internationally recognised as the standard of excellence in the life insurance and financial services business. Its members are required to generate a certain level of premium, commission, and income, and demonstrate professional knowledge, strict ethical conduct and outstanding client service.  


Ng Keng Hooi, Chief Executive and President of AIA Group, said, “AIA’s Number One position in the world for MDRT qualifiers reflects our deep commitment to investing in our people to ensure industry-leading standards in everything we do. We achieved an impressive 46 percent growth in MDRT members from 2016, and we will continue to do everything possible to further advance our agency force, to enable them to help our millions of customers live longer, healthier, better lives while assisting them to achieve financial peace of mind through the provision of life protection and long-term savings products.”    


Following the launch of its premier agency strategy in 2010 which placed a high importance on quality training and selective recruitment, AIA introduced its interactive Point of Sale (iPoS) system, an industry-leading technology, to enhance the customer experience and increase agent efficiency and productivity. The group further advanced the technology and launched the second-generation interactive Mobile Office (iMO) platform in 2014 which has enabled AIA’s agents and agency leaders to manage all of their activities, from recruitment and lead generation to the face-to-face sales process and training, efficiently on one single mobile device.  


Joe Cheng, CEO of Group Agency Distribution of AIA Group, said, “I would like to congratulate every one of our agents who have made this historic result possible. Being Number One in the world in MDRT for the third consecutive year further strengthens our belief that we are correct in our approach and will continue to invest in our agents and agency leaders by offering the best training, advanced technology and career opportunities in the industry. We will continue to strive to do our best to serve our millions of customers and the communities in which we operate across the region.”
