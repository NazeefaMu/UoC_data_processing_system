In the backdrop of a legal challenge against recent increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT), the Government yesterday sought to give legal effect to the VAT increase by enacting fresh legislation through the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill which was presented in the House.

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake sought an immediate date to take up the bill for debate.

House Leader Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament that the Bill would be debated on July 20 unless it were challenged in a court of law. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
