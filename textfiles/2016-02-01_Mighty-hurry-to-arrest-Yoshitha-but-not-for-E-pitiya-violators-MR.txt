Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today said that the urgency to arrest Yoshitha Rajapaksa, was not there to arrest those involved in the Embilipitiya incident.


“Despite the Magistrate’s order to arrest those involved in the Embilipitiya incident, no arrest have been made so far, but what was the hurry to arrest Yoshitha Rajapaksa?” the former President said in Kandy today.


After visiting the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the former President also said every individual who were with him were subjected to some kind of harassment by the government.


“Tomorrow, they would call me and ask me to come for questioning and would be arrested. Gotabaya and Basil would be taken in. Shiranthi would be questioned. There is pressure mounted on all those who were around me. When I was in power did I take any revenge? , " he asked.
The reason that Yoshitha was arrested, was not because any revenge with him, but there was a score to settle with me,” the former President said.


When asked whether he was ready to solve these problems amicably with President Maithripala Sirisena, the former President said, “How can I solve the problem? Those henchmen around were pressurizing to take action against us. Although I am an advisor to the SLFP, no one takes my advice.”


Commenting on the forthcoming local government elections, he said he had no idea how the election would be held. “We are also waiting for the election. I have enough experience holding elections.

Former members of the local bodies want me to come and help them. That was their request and not mine. We are waiting to watch the people’s mandate at the election,” he added. (J.A.L Jayasinghe)
