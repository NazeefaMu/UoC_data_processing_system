Price of 50kg bag of cement increased by Rs.60


	

The price of a 50 kg bag of cement had been increased by Rs. 60 with effect from yesterday, the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) said.

The Authority said several companies had requested the CAA's approval to increase the price because of the recently introduced VAT charges and fluctuation of the value of rupee in relation to the Dollar.


Accordingly the new price of a bag of cement would be increased from Rs. 870 to Rs.930.
However, it said the increment would not be applied to bags of cement manufactured prior to June 1. (Sanath Desmond)
