	Several Opposition MPs today urged the government to hold a referendum to implement the UNHRC recommendations including a Hybrid Court to investigate war crimes allegations in Sri Lanka.
	United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Wimal Weerawansa said if the UNHRC approves the resolution, Sri Lankans should have the liberty to decide if they want any foreign involvement in solving internal issues.
	“If the people feel they are fine with the UNHRC recommendations and a court with foreign judges and investigators to probe alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka, then the government can go ahead with the proposals. We also request the people to urge their MPs to vote against an Act to be tabled in parliament asking for the approval of the UN recomendations,” he told a news conference.
	Meanwhile, MP Udaya Gammanpila said they were considering seeking legal advice on challenging the UN report in the Supreme Court.
	MP Dinesh Gunawardane urged the government to pull back from co-sponsoring the US backed resolution on Sri Lanka and said if not the sovereignty and integrity of the country would be severely damaged.
	“Co-sponsoring a resolution is similar to writing one’s own death certificate and is a bad precedent to other countries. This move has also put our allies in a difficult situation,” he said.
	MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the government decision to back the US-led resolution was a betrayal similar to the 1815 agreement signed with the British. “We all know the nature of the US. They just want to get closer to their prey,” he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH
