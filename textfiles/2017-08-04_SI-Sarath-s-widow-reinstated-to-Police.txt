The National Police Commission (NPC) yesterday approved reinstatement of the widow of the Policeman, who had died following a shootout in Jaffna, to the Police Service Secretary of the Commission Ariyadasa Kure said.

He said the decision was given by the NPC to appoint the widow K.G.T. Kumudini to the Police Service following a special order by the Commission.

Police Sergeant Sarath Premachandra (24330), attached to the security detail of Jaffna High Court Judge M. Ilanchezhiyan, died at the Jaffna General Hospital on July 23 following shootout at Nallur, Jaffna.

Kumudini was in the Police service but resigned a few years on personal grounds.
Sergeant Premachandra (24330) was posthumously promoted to Sub Inspector (SI) rank.
Mr. Kure said the decision was taken at a meeting held yesterday at the Police Commission office and appointment would be made by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara soon.

“The appointment will be made after identifying a Police Station closer to the schools of her children and her residence,” Mr. Kure said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
