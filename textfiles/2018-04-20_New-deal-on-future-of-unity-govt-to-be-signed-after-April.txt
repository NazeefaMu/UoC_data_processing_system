The SLFP ministerial committee appointed by President Maihtripala Sirisena to look into the future of the unity government has made strong recommendations to drastically bring down the Cost of Living and provide facilities to achieve accelerated development in agriculture, industrial and education sectors and create employment opportunities, committee chairman and Minister Sarath Amunugama said yesterday.

He said a fresh agreement based on the recommendations of the five member cabinet committee will be signed between the UNP and the SLFP after President Maithripala Sirisena returned on April 24.

Minister Amunugama told the Daily Mirror that President Sirisena would discuss the recommendation of the SLFP committee with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe before signing the agreement by the General Secretaries of the UNP and SLFP.

“I expect to hand over the committee report to President Sirisena soon after he returns from London on April 24," he added.

The new agreement is not an extension of the agreement signed between the two main parties after the August 2015 General election to form the ‘Yahapalana Government’, Minister Amunugama said.

“This is basically a strategic arrangement on how the unity government should run in the tenure running for about 18 months up to 2020. We have focused our attention to fulfill the pledges given to the people at the Presidential and general elections in 2015 and made amends to the weaknesses and failures of the ‘Yahapalana Government’ in the last three years,” the Minister stressed.
