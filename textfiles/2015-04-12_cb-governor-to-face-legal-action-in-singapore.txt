Voice against Corruption is to file legal action against Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran in Singaporean High Courts on violation of emigration laws of that country, its Convener Wansantha Samarasinghe said.
Mr. Samarainghe told Daily Mirror that legal experts of Voice against Corruption are planning to file action against Mr. Mahendran in Singaporean Courts for violating that country’s emigration laws. “We decided on this action as Mr. Mehenadran is a Singaporean Citizen,” Mr. Samarasinghe said.
He said Mr. Mahendran had violated the Singaporean emigration laws by accepting the post of Central Bank Governor in Sri Lanka while obtaining permanent residency in Sri Lanka. Mr. Samarainnghe said no Singaporean citizen can obtain permanent residency in another country according to that country’s emigration laws.
Meanwhile, Voice against Corruption had filed fresh charges against former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal, members of EPF investment board and some stock market agents with the criminal investigation authorities and the Bribery Commission on certain unprofitable investments of EPF funds.
Also he said Voice against Corruption had received information on some fraudulent deals by some Ministers in the present government and will make complaints against them to law enforcement institutions.
Mr. Samarasinghe who responded to the allegations made by few opposition MPs that the Voice against Corruption was engaged in getting the government to harass them and their families , said denying all charges and acting innocent had become a fashion today. He said the charges made by Voice against Corruption are not false at all as these are made by a panel of lawyers and audit experts.
