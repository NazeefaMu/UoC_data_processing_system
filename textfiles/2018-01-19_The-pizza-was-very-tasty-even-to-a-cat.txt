The pizza was very tasty, even to a cat


	

A manager in a private firm in Colombo was placed in a difficult position after a cat that frequents the office helped itself to the pizza left for his employees in the lunch room.

This manager in question was in the habit of rewarding his employees for their hard work with treats that he ordered from out.

This time he had ordered pizza which he planned to serve to them at teatime. He had spent a good sum on his 'treat'. The time came for them to help themselves to the food, but what greeted them when they entered the eating room brought fits of laughter to some and consternation to the manager who had spent a tidy sum on the pizza. A cat was happily devouring their 'treat'.

Since there was nothing left to do he gave what was left of the pizza to the cat and ordered another expensive pizza for his employees. (Akila Baddewithana)
