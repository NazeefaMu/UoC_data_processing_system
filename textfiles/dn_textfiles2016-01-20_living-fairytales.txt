Living with fairytales

People have been fascinated from the childhood on reading and listening to fairytales irrespective of the country of its origination. It is believed that the tales of magic and supernatural has a power of changing the attitudes of the reader and the listener.
As such the tales which contain and centre round the aspects of characters with magical and supernatural powers are named as fantasies or fairytales. Why are they called fairytales may make one wonder. This aspect was in the first instance spelled out by a specialist in the field of fairytales named Geoffrey Brereton who translated the fairytales collected by Charles Perrault (1628-1703) from the well known French collection to English titled as 'Fairy Tales'.
He says: 'from many of the fairy tales it is possible to deduce patterns of ancient ritual, usually connected with sun worship or seasonal ceremonies. The fairies themselves would be then be nature spirits, presiding over particular streams lakes and woods. Where nature is kindly, them incline to benevolence Where life is hard, they are hostile like the mountain trolls of Scandinavia.' This explains a lot about the background nature of the fairytale.
It is also believed that in the prehistoric times there lived some small men and women. But as time went by they were replaced by long or tall men and women. The tall and strong beings had ousted the small creatures driving them to forest abodes to live. From time to time they had been trying to mix. The small creatures had been helpful in many ways.
But the tall and big creatures who are humans had not been too kind. Those who showed kindness were replayed with equal gratitude. At times this attitude changed due to circumstances beyond the control of humans. This view had given way to the belief in fairies who are normally kind-hearted and witches who are said to be unkind and hostile. Traces of such beliefs are still found in various cultures.
As Margeret Mead the anthropologist points out in her 'Culture and Commitment', 'humans are destined to believe in supernatural gods goddesses fairies demons and witches due to their own follies and pitfalls. This too tends to give vested interest in the study in fairy tales which are basically fantasies or make believe tales and legends. There is also the belief that fairy tales stem from the folklore. As Perrault states, the fairies had another function, more intimately bound up with human affairs than their role of nature spirits.
They attended births and weddings in order to bless the humans. The gifts which they brought had a decisive effect on the life of the new born and the married couple. In this manner some of the friendly fairies were named as godmothers and attributed divinity to them.
Fairytales remain a genre that excels all other narrative forms due to the creative layers that are embedded in them. This factor was observed when the Grimm Brothers collected their stories from Germany and Andersen from Danish regions and sources and Perrault from French and Scandinavian sources. The counterpart is seen in the Orient with the Jataka, Upanishad and Panchatantra sources.
They are more known as Hindu and Buddhist mythology. They in turn over the years, kindled the interest as religious forms of popular communication.
Through the oriental fairytales the most significant factor that emerged was the way paved to think of happiness in reality itself. In moments of grief the humans tend to be crestfallen.
But the reminder in a tender life-giving episode in a fairytale makes it forgotten. Leo Tolstoy was one writer who believed in fairytales. He made others believe that magical powers could lead a person to be a good human being.
This ideology enabled him to collect a large number of Russian folk tales which centre round supernatural events. It was Tolstoy who branded them as Russian fairytales.
Though some child educationists detest the reading and listening to fairytales, the great writers like Dickens implied the necessity of thinking beyond the material realty popularly known as realism and naturalism.
While Dickens wrote a short novel called 'The Christmas Carol' he never wanted to say that it is either a fairytale or a ghost story.
But the readers feel that he had been influenced by the supernatural and magical elements in fairy stories. On the other hand, George Orwell stated in his celebrated short novel 'The Animal Farm' that he is writing a fairytale.
But in the subtext it happened to be a narrative of realism and a social comment. Maxim Gorki who took the cue from Andersen's 'The Little Match Girl' wrote an inspiring Christmas story titled as 'About a Small Girl and a Boy who did not Freeze to Death'.
This according to literary sources had been translated into several world languages. This remains as the only fairy story written by Gorki.
