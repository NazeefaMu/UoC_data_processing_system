AG indicts Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera under PPA


	

The Attorney General has indicted the Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera in the Colombo High Court on charges of having retained an elephant calf aged two and half years old at the Alan Mathiniyaramaya without a valid license.

On an earlier occasion the CID detectives informed the Magistrate that they were expecting the Attorney General’s advice on this offence because it came under the public property and the Fauna and Flora Acts.

Wildlife Conservation officers took the elephant calf into their custody after discovering it at the temple in January last year.

The monk was arrested and subsequently released on bail. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
