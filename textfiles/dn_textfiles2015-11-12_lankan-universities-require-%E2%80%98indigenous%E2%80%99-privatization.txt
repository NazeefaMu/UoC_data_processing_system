Lankan universities require ‘indigenous’ privatization

Notwithstanding street protests, Sri Lanka’s university system will undergo privatization relentlessly. Arresting this process is inconceivable, because it is taking place almost totally outside the jurisdiction of the state (it is virtually impossible to even monitor it!) and is driven by an insatiable demand from a public that has placed great faith on education as an investment for a better future.
The question is no longer about embracing privatization, but how best we should embrace it – nor about accepting privatization today, but how to shape it today so that we could have tomorrow the private sector we would want to live with.
The shape that privatization is taking now is far from satisfactory. Privatization, like other things in life, also comes in many colours and shapes. A wrong type of privatization can be as bad as no privatization for a country that needs the right type of privatization. Those who promote privatization, even for the right reasons, ought to be conscious of this.
Let me outline what I believe is an appropriate, macro-level response to this situation. What I mean by privatization of the university system is the enlargement of the portion of the private sector within it: a change in its ‘sectoral balance.’ I do not refer to, nor attempt to justify, other possible manifestations of ‘privatization,’ such as the sale of state institutions to the private sector or the incorporation of private sector ‘machinery’ into state institutions.
I am also not trying to justify the efforts that the previous regime made to promote privatization by undermining state universities – my conceptualization is exactly the opposite. Furthermore, although the point is obvious, I would like to take care to point out that a private, post-secondary educational institution may not necessarily be for-profit.
Opportunity and funding
From a country’s viewpoint, the development of a private university sector is a cause for celebration, not worry. It would give the country a flexible, responsive segment that could seek out, take risks and grow in areas commanding local and international demand. From the masses’ viewpoint, it could facilitate the percolation of a useful education to all strata of society, including even the lower strata, allowing their upward social mobility, without burdening state coffers with unrealistic demands.
To see this, we must realize that ‘equality’ is not ‘the absence of diversity’ – or put more simply, diversity is not inequality. Equality is necessary for opportunity and access, but this is not the same as eliminating the diversity in the ways of funding or paying for access.
Japanese example
Let us consider what happened in Japan in the 1960s. At that time she was just becoming industrialized, an achievement that did not need too many universities or graduates. But the world economy was shifting from factory-based industries to knowledge-based industries. Japan realized that she had to invest in the knowledge industries to remain competitive against other emerging countries, and this required large numbers of graduates. But her state universities (which served only the elite in society, like our own university did until the late-1950s) were unable to meet this demand.
She responded by encouraging the expansion of her private sector, which consisted of private universities and colleges. The state universities regulated and supervised them while also focusing more strongly on tasks such as research, while the private sector predominantly took up the task of training. This is division of labour– not “selling education.”
Interestingly, therefore, privatization in Japan brought university education from the elite to the masses and contributed positively to her economy. We all know what results she has achieved with this strategy.
A local tale
In fact, contrary to popular belief, broadening access to education through privatization is not unknown to us too. We used this strategy ourselves – in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries when we were a British colony.
At that time, an English medium education was essential to secure a sought-after employment. This was almost the sole conserve of elitist, fee-levying schools set up by Christian missionaries, such as S. Thomas’, Trinity and St John’s (Jaffna).
In response, indigenous Buddhist and Hindu private organizations set up schools like Ananda, Mahinda, Dharmaraja and Hindu College.
Furthermore, at post-secondary level too, most of the sought-after options were available in elitist, English medium institutions, like the medical, technical and law colleges of Ceylon and the universities in London and Madras. The indigenous organizations responded to this by setting up the Vidyodaya and Vidyalankara pirivenas which, although not English medium institutions, broadened the choice available to the masses and also helped in an indigenous revival.
These events broadened access to education which was hitherto available only to the elite – through the setting up of indigenous, private educational institutions. They were not-for-profit institutions funded mostly by private philanthropy.
Indigenous model
Several key characteristics stand out in the Japanese example. It was an endeavour of her indigenous entrepreneurs from local industries, organizations and families (much like our own example). It was initially regulated and supervised by state universities, and hence received crucial guidance from the start. The government and the elite supported it, for instance with incentives, which must have brought its costs down significantly. All this in turn meant that it was affordable to at least her middle class, which was why it was able to successfully meet the increasing demand for graduates. Being indigenous in origin, it would have used methodologies, and focused on areas, that were locally appropriate.
Let me call this the ‘indigenous model’ of privatization.
Resistance and loopholes
In Sri Lanka, the state universities’ stiff resistance to privatization since the late-1970s, mainly at the behest of the JVP, inhibited the development of a local private sector on the indigenous model. Private post-secondary education developed in general (e.g., accountancy, finance, management, computing – where the JVP had no stronghold) but avoided the university sector (in which the JVP was strong).
But privatization of even the universities cannot be blocked forever when the demand is strong. Eventually, it is bound to sprout through loopholes in existing obstacles – this may be difficult to see at the start, but it is impossible to stop. And that was indeed what happened.
Initially this took the form of the elite flying off to foreign countries, along with foreign exchange, to obtain overseas degrees. But in our globalizing, borderless world and given the huge local demand, it was only natural that foreign universities would eventually set up local agents here, using loopholes such as BOI projects to circumvent governmental and state universities’ resistance. And when the time was ripe, the banks joined in with loan schemes.
Satellite model
But this is not in the indigenous model. It is founded on overseas universities, with courses that are designed for their contexts (while the students may study here, abroad or both). It charges international fees, which are invariably higher. (It may offer affordable courses, but this is a reflection of a wider variety of courses, not corresponding courses at cheaper rates.) All this leads to the loss of huge amounts of foreign exchange from the country. It is thus affordable to a smaller, higher socio-economic stratum of society, while courses in greater demand might only be affordable to the elite.
Furthermore, the government-state-private coordination that was possible in Japan and which guided the private sector there to work towards national economic goals (maintaining a global perspective, naturally) is not possible in this model. In addition, since state supervision or regulation is not possible, we have no way of knowing which courses are value-for-money or even which establishments are genuine.
Let me call this the ‘satellite model’ of privatization.
Entrepreneurs
We should not blame local entrepreneurs for setting up private universities in the satellite model. If the environment had been conducive – as it was in Japan – they would have gladly set it up in the indigenous model. The fault lay with the state universities (especially its JVP-controlled elements) themselves, for their selfish, narrow-minded and short-sighted anti-privatization attitude.
An excellent illustration comes from the private medical college issue. In 1981, a local organization set up a not-for-profit private medical college here in the indigenous model: the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC). But the government caved in to JVP-led opposition and nationalized it less than a decade later. Today, thousands (along with millions in foreign exchange) are flying off overseas to study medicine.
The NCMC story proved that our entrepreneurs are capable of forming even a private medical college in the indigenous model. And having been robbed of that chance, they have also proven that they can do it in the satellite model too, as hundreds fly off to get medical degrees from Nepal, Bangladesh, China, Malaysiaetc. The entrepreneurs didn’t choose the satellite model – the society chose it.
The satellite model is unsuited for us, for two reasons. Firstly, it is bad economics, individually and nationally. Individually, an indigenous model would have been cheaper, while the satellite model charges fees that only the elite could afford.
Once again the NCMC example illustrates this point. At the NCMC the fees were on average about Rs. 25,000 annually, while nowadays an overseas medical degree fee alone will cost at least several millions annually.
Nationally, an indigenous model will not burden our foreign exchange reserves and might even contribute to it by attracting foreign students, while the burden that the satellite model has become is quite evident.
The NCMC alone earned our country about US$ 400,000 per year through foreign students’ fees. On the other hand, today our elite pay to foreign universities more than what our government allocates to state universities! For example, in 2008 we paid over US$ 170 million (over Rs 18 billion) to foreign universities.
(This is apart from what was paid to local colleges that remit foreign exchange to overseas universities, a figure that I could not even find.) In comparison, the total allocation to state universities in 2007 was Rs 14 billion. I believe that the figures for subsequent years would show a similar, if not worse, picture.
Regulation and supervision
The second reason for the satellite model’s unsuitability is that it does not lend itself to state regulation and supervision, something that was crucial to Japan’s success. State academics already have close relationships with private institutions.
The institutions need the academics as visiting lecturers, while the academics need the extra income.
A new role for them in the supervisory and regulatory apparatus (with an additional income for their consultative services) will not be difficult for either party to get accustomed to.
A stronger state university system will actually enable this – an undermined state university system will only serve to oppose privatization, out of the fear of competition.
The existence of several successful public-private partnerships involving universities shows that state academics are now well-versed in the etiquette of working with the private sector.
Although during the previous regime the allegation was made that state university academics associating themselves with private institutions were ‘bending the rules,’ this might have happened because their involvement was informal and ‘handpicked.’
If it is formal and widespread, academics will take part in these roles out of their official capacities, not through relationships that might be designed to serve dubious ends.
Policy change
It would be to everyone’s advantage if the government encouraged and guided the private sector into the indigenous model.
It would then be affordable, and its quality would be the state’s responsibility. The foreign exchange now leaving our country will remain, and the moneys that students pay will go to strengthen our own institutions. (Let us remember that institutions, whether state or private, are all public institutions – they are all part of our collective public sphere.) The government will have the apparatus to monitor the private sector, and this will help planning of both the education sector and the economy.
The only downside that I see is that the private sector will lose some of its flexibility – a vital attribute in a changing world – when it comes under the supervision of state universities. The legislation must keep this in mind and incorporate effective safeguards, and the state universities must be broad-minded.
On the other hand, if state universities continue to mindlessly reject and resist privatization and the government continues to turn a blind eye to what is happening, the private sector will be compelled to grow in the satellite model. This will not serve the country in the long term. Adopting an indigenous model does not mean that private institutions should be barred from having links with foreign universities (especially prestigious ones); it only seeks to give them a more economical option. It also does not mean a regression in today’s era of globalization; it sets the stage for a more effective response to it.
Pragmatism
The direction that privatization is taking now – the satellite model – is wrong from the country’s viewpoint. What the government must do is gently guide it towards the indigenous model by formalizing and defining relationships into statutory roles.
There must be ample flexibility and reflective practice built into the new arrangement, so that changing trends lead to appropriate responses. Otherwise, one of the private sector’s most important advantages – flexibility – would be lost.
An essential corollary of this plan is the improvement of state universities to a level that they can play this supervisory role effectively and confidently – and the NCMC story, where the University of Colombo played exactly this role, proved that this too is possible. It is a win-win situation, even for politicians – except the JVP, of course.
We must proactively and judiciously mould our university system into an integrated, efficient amalgam of state and private components – by promoting the indigenous model. Or else, we will eventually not have a university system of any consequence that can be called our own.
