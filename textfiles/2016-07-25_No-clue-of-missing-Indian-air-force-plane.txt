More than two days since an Indian Air Force’s AN-32 aircraft (K-2743) with 29 persons on board went missing from the radars, no clue could be obtained to its location.

Ships, aircraft and a submarine are involved in an intensive search operation in the Bay of Bengal, some 150 nautical miles east of Chennai.

The aircraft took off from the Tambaram air base at 8.30 a.m. on Friday and its last blip was seen at 9.16 a.m. while flying at an altitude of 23,000 feet over the Bay of Bengal. Besides the 18 ships of the Navy and the Coast Guard, aircraft and a submarine are also part of the search operation. (From The Hindu reports)
