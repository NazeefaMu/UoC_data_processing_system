UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday urged former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to take legal action against the wrongdoers involved in the Central Bank bond issue without making false allegations against former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and him.

He told a meeting at Sooriyawewa that she should make a complaint if she was a true patriot and rejected an allegation made by Ms. Kumaratunga recently that he had US$1 billion in a bank account in Dubai. He asked her not to mislead the people.

“I challenge her to prove my connection with this account abroad. Please don’t make false allegations against me. The Government wasted millions of rupees to send FCID and Bribery Commission officers around the world, to locate the US$18 billion alleged to have been hidden by my father. ” Namal Rajapaksa said.

He said the former president was also following Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne’s footsteps by making false allegations against opposition members. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
