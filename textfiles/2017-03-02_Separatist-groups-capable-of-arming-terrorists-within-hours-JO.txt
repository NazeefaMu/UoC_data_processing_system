Separatist groups capable of arming 15,000 terrorists within 48 hours: JO


	

Separatist groups have gathered information regarding 11, 000 rehabilitated and released Tamils and yet another 4,000 Tamils who did not surrender to the army, and have sufficient hidden arms and ammunition, enabling them to create a group of terrorists within 48 hours, the joint opposition warned today.

Addressing a press briefing former Parliamentarian, Sarath Weerasekara said that the background has been created by the Unity government for separatist groups to roam freely in the country, putting the country at risk.

“In the period between 2009-2013 the LTTE attempted to raise its head. Separatist groups such as the Global Tamil Forum (GTF) were given the freedom to roam about in the North without restraint. Now they have collected the details on the Tamils that were released after being rehabilitated and have hidden weapons and have the ability to regroup as a terrorist organization once again," he said.

Mr. Weerasekara also stressed that State intelligence officials had been sent behind bars, which he warned, posed a grave risk to the country’s security. “Intelligence agencies are the backbone of national security in any country and there is an attempt to weaken the country’s intelligence network by arresting military officers in order to please the Tamil Diaspora," he said.

Furthering, he said that whether there is a war or not the possibility of terrorism raising its ugly head was greatly reduced if the intelligence network of the country was strong. “Today the government is offering dual-citizenship to Tamils. Though we think people from western countries will come flooding into the country as a result of this offer, there is a real threat that this would enable Tamil separatist groups to enter the country. No government has ever betrayed the country like this," he said.

Meantime, he said that according to the last year’s ‘HIS Jane's Defence Weekly’ magazine, the annual income of the LTTE is USD 300 million. He said LTTE cadres were still involved in various businesses including smuggling, generating huge incomes for it. These funds could be channelled into the country to purchase properties here. This phenomenon could increase by giving Tamils dual-citizenship, he warned. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
