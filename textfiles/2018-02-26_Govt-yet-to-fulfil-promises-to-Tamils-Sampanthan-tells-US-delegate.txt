The Good Governance Government had not fulfilled the promises it had given to the Tamil community when it was elected to office in 2015, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan told US Congressman James Sensenbrenner at the Opposition Leader’s office in Parliament on Thursday.

Sensenbrenner and his Chief of Staff Matt Bisenius met with the Leader of the Opposition and the Tamil National Alliance R. Sampanthan on Thursday at the Office of the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament.

Mr Sampanthan apprised the US lawmaker on recently concluded Local Government Elections and the political situation afterwards.

Making a reference to the Cosponsored resolution at the UN Human Rights Council Mr Sampanthan echoed that the Government of Sri Lanka is bound to implement the UNHRC resolution both in spirit and letter.

“Tamil people are still awaiting the Government to fulfil all that was promised to them,” he told the delegation.

However, the Opposition Leader who focused on Human Rights said that Tamils people still had their confidence in President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Spokesman of the Tamil National Alliance and Jaffna District Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran was also present at the meeting.

The political situation prevailing in the country following the recent Local Government elections was also discussed at the meeting.  (Dayaseeli Liyanage)
