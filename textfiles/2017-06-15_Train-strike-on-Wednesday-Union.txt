The Locomotive Engineering Operators’ Union (LEOU) today warned that they would launch an islandwide strike from Wednesday (21), LEOU Secretary Indika Dodangoda said.

He said the union decided to resume its strike against the Ministry for not failing to provide solutions for its demands.

“The union launched a strike on March 27 and during meeting with the Transport Ministry the union members were assured that our demands would be met within three months but it had failed, he said.

He said the LEOU would launch a 24hr token strike seeking several demands as the Transport Ministry had violated the appointment process by assigning the Engine Drivers’ duties to the Co-Drivers.

He said the Co-Drivers’ Gazetted pension scheme had also amended in their appointment letters stating they had to agree to whatever the future decisions take n by the Government on the particular subject.

“During the strike there would be no Trans operated. The strike would continue indefinitely if the authorities fail to respond,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
