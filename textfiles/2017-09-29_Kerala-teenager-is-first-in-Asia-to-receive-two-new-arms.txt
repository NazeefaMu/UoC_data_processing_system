Kerala, (Daily Mail), 28 September 2017 -   
A teenager who lost both her arms in a horror bus crash has had one of the world’s first double limb transplants.   


Shreya Siddanagowda, 19, had to have both her arms amputated above the elbow when they were crushed in the accident.   


Amazingly, she was able to crawl to safety, and four months later she started using prosthetics – which she found limited.   


Then, last month the selfless family of a 20-year-old male student, who suffered a fatal head injury in a motorbike crash, agreed to donate his arms.   It meant she could have the 13-hour operation, which was the first in Asia – and one of only ten double upper arm transplants ever carried out in the world.Chemical engineering student Shreya has now been discharged from hospital and is undergoing an intensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation programme.
