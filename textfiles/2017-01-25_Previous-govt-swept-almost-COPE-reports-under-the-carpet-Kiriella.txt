Previous govt. swept almost 30 COPE reports under the carpet: Kiriella


	

Almost 30 COPE reports had been swept under the carpet by the previous government, said Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella yesterday.

Speaking during the adjournment debate on the bond issue, Mr. Kiriella said a presidential commission had been appointed to look into one COPE report by this government while it had also allowed a debate to go ahead.

He said the present government had appointed an opposition member as the Chairman of COPE unlike governments in the past.

Mr. Kiriella said the Supreme Courts had dismissed a petition filed on the bond issue, as the petitioner had only assumed that the bond issue of February 2015 had cost the government billions of rupees. He said the Supreme Courts had asked the petitioner to show how he had calculated the losses. (Yohan Perera)
