The Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Rajith Siyambalapitiya said the CEB would manage the supply of electricity  so as not to affect the National Grid even in an event of future decline in the generation of electricity that may arise due to the low water level in the  reservoirs  caused by the lack of rain.


The Minister expressed these view at a ceremony held in connection with the forming of School Power Societies in the Eastern Province recently.


He said, today we in are successfully  processing and managing the electricity supply at a time  when the demand for  power had increased  by 200 megawatts from  the average  daily  usage of 2000 megawatts.


The Minister further said all the challenges could be overcome if all of us contribute to  save  400 megawatts considering it as a social obligation.
