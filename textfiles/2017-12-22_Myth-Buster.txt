MYTH: High carb diets are unhealthy.   

BUSTED: “Usually what we include in a healthy person’s balanced diet is half a plate for carbohydrates. That is starchy food which comprise cereals, yams and jackfruit. Two thirds of the remaining half have to include vegetables and greens and the balanced one third is for proteins and lentils. This is a normal healthy person’s diet. But in Sri Lanka, 75% of our plate contains rice, yams and starchy food. When consuming carbohydrates in the excess make sure to do adequate exercises.  Otherwise the excess amount of carbohydrate consumed will deposit as fat in the body and that will increase your body weight, which can be unhealthy,” explained Dr. Shanthi Gunawardana, Consultant Community Physician, Non Communicable Diseases Unit, Ministry of Health.
