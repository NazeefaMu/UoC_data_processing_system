Gaza massacre: Distorted scriptures, Zionist goons and daddy’s little ghoul


	

The Nakba Day massacre and the grotesque ceremony to mark the opening of the United States’ embassy in Jerusalem turned Monday, May 14, into one of the darkest days in recent history. 

Television footage of the massacre reminded us of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre 99 years ago at Amritsar in British India. The two massacres had many parallels, but one that is most disgusting is that the perpetrators had no remorse. General Reginald Dyer, who gave orders to his troops to open fire at the unarmed Punjabi protesters, died unrepentant and his only regret was that he did not have time to kill more. 


The Israelis were unrepentant, too. Monday’s death toll of more than 60 brought the number of Palestinians killed from March 30 to more than 100. On March 30, the Gaza Strip’s Palestinians, living in abject poverty, began their Great March of Return for a sit-in protest on the border.  Killing Palestinians is no sin, for they are not humans, according to Zionist hardliners, including deputy defence minister Eli Ben Dahan. Israel and its American supporters will not shed a tear even if a million Palestinians are killed. This desensitization process began even prior to the setting up of Israel. Israel was founded on the deaths of thousands of Palestinians and the ethnic cleansing of more than 750,000 Palestinians.  Rarely is this horror story highlighted in the Israeli-friendly corporate media, under whose spell we have come into. We let our thoughts to be shaped by the corporate media’s propaganda aimed at promoting the evil designs of the Zionists, the capitalists and the agents of war, also known as the arms industry.  Global justice activists insist that such stories need to be told and retold. Otherwise, evil will thrive in the silence of the good people.  One such less spoken about stories in the corporate media is the Deir Yassin massacre.


Just before the dawn on April 9, 1948, armed members of the Zionist terrorist gang Irgun, headed by Menachem Begin who later became Israel’s Prime Minister, and the terror group Stern Gang raided the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin, inhabited by some 750 Palestinians. The village on a high ground overlooking Jerusalem lay just outside the United Nations drawn partition line.  The villagers were ordered to leave. When they resisted, the terrorists killed more than 125 people. Similar massacres took place in Jaffa and other places in the run-up to Israel’s declaration of Independence on May 14, 1948. From 1947 to 1949, some 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from their villages.  In the Palestinian annals, the tragedy is called Al-Nakba or the Catastrophe.  The Palestinians who lost their homes still live in refugee camps or are scattered all over the world. Every year on Nakba Day, they hold high their corroding house keys for the world to see.  Their history has been erased. As George Orwell said, “the past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became the truth.”


The charade continues. In Zionist narrations, the oppressor, a nuclear power, is presented as the oppressed, injustice is portrayed as justice and freedom fighters are branded as terrorists. No wonder, the US President Donald Trump kills the peace process and calls his action a great push for peace.  At the Jerusalem embassy opening ceremony, boycotted even by the United States’ allies, Trump’s Zionist son-in-law Jared Kushner, without any moral compunction, accused the Palestinians of being part of the problem and said the “journey to peace started with a strong America recognising the truth.”


For the Zionists, the injustice caused to the Palestinians does not construe the truth. For them, the truth is that Jews are the chosen people of God and Jerusalem is the ‘eternal’ capital of the Jews. With Judaism being hijacked by hardline Zionists from Europe to achieve political ends, such misinterpretation of the scriptures is repeated. American evangelicals who adore the criminal Zionists say there is a God-given foreign policy which America needs to follow. Quoting from Genesis, they say, “Whoever blesses Israel will be blessed, and whoever curses Israel will be cursed.” But they seem to have overlooked the fact that Jesus called them the “faithless and perverse generation”. 


The evangelicals need to be asked that if Jesus were to come today, on whose side will he be. Will he be with the oppressed Palestinians or oppressor Israel? Those who say that Zionists are God’s chosen people are committing blasphemy, for they make God a god of apartheid, a god of injustice, a god who encourages discriminatory practices.  Trump is part of this Zionist-Evangelical axis, which has sold God’s commandments for justice – you shall not covert your neighbour’s property -- for 30 silver coins. 


At the Jerusalem embassy opening ceremony – a clear violation of International law -- were those who financed his White House campaign in 2016. Among them was Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who prodded Trump to shift the embassy to Jerusalem. Then there was Southern Baptist Pastor Robert Jeffress who has repeatedly said that divine providence has a hand in Trump’s election and that God has authorised Trump to do, basically, whatever he wants. 
As the celebrations went on in Jerusalem, there was little pity for those who were being killed, just 70 km away in Gaza. Dancing on the dead bodies of Palestinian children was Trump’s daughter Ivanka. The New York Daily News, a liberal newspaper, aptly described her in a page one headline as the ‘Daddy’s Little Ghoul’ for her obscene indifference to the killing of Palestinians by Israel, whom her father described as a country that, like the United States, believes in human rights and democracy.


Imagine a massacre of this magnitude had taken place in Iran, Syria or Sri Lanka.  There would have been worldwide outrage with calls for international probe.  At the UN Security Council emergency meeting on Tuesday, US envoy Nikki Haley blamed Iran and Hamas for the deaths of the Palestinians. She was reminded by the Bolivian envoy that the problem was simply Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestine. 
Yes, that is the root cause of the problem. It is a shame that in the 21st century, the United States, the greatest democracy on earth, has become part of the Zionist colonial project. Until the US frees itself from the clutches of Zionism, the Palestinians’ freedom will remain elusive.
