A controversial head of a department responsible for civil security and law and order was the subject of a discussion held at a very high level recently.

 


A very high authority in yahapalanaya, the top team member presiding over the subject and several other authorities at the top level had participated in these deliberations. 


Informed sources say this departmental head has now squandered away the vast fund of goodwill he enjoyed at the time of his appointment to the coveted post. And a number of allegations now being made against him had received the serious attention of the top men at this discussion. His insolent attitude towards the top team member in charge of the subject, peculiar propensity to give lectures for hours, dereliction of duty and involvement in a dubious Kelani river-based project at Dompe are among the allegations he is facing now, they say. One of the participants had also recalled that even the Diyawanna boss had occasion to sound a note of warning to the departmental head quite recently. 


At the conclusion of the deliberations, the top brass had decided to issue the final warning to the controversial departmental head – to mend his ways or to face the worst.
