HNB awarded Top Ten Best Corporate Citizens Award

In recognition of its sustainability initiatives Hatton National Bank (HNB) was once again selected as a Best Corporate Citizen under the Top 10 category at the Best Corporate Citizens Sustainability Awards 2015 organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
The awards ceremony, held on November 26, at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo, saw the 'Sustainability Stars' of the Corporate World being recognized for their untiring efforts to adopt Best Sustainability Practices in their business processes.
Environmental management, environmental integration, environmental value addition, employee relations, customer relations, community relations, governance, financial performance and economic contribution were some of the stringent evaluation criteria for this 'sustainability' award.
As one of the foremost financial institutions in the country, HNB has proved the sustainability of its operations through existence in the market since its inception as Hatton Bank in 1888.
Today, the Bank has demonstrated sustainability through diverse initiatives which are directly linked to its core business activities, to make a greater impact on the country and the communities in which it operates.
HNB's renowned micro-finance product 'GamiPubuduwa' is one of the greatest steps in the industry towards social sustainability.
As a leading commercial bank in Sri Lanka, HNB's contribution to the economy of the country is enormous.
This contribution is not limited to the payment of taxes and funding infrastructure projects, but creating employment directly as well as indirectly through the customers of the Bank. The procurement policy of the Bank is also geared to support local suppliers.
