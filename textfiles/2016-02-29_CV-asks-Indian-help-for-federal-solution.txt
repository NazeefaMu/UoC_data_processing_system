India might ‘intervene’ again in Sri Lanka to help the Tamil minority and provide a federal solution to the ethnic reconciliation problem, a media report quoted Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran as saying.


The BBC’s Sinhala service has reported that the Chief Minister made the remarks in Jaffna on Sunday while addressing a group of academics who had returned to the north after their educational pursuits in India.


Mr. Wignewswaran said he believed that India would intervene again in Sri Lanka as they had come to the assistance of the Tamils in politically sensitive situations in the past as well, referring to the Indo—Lanka Peace Accord of 1987.


According to the Hindu which picked up the media report, he has said as a direct result of that intervention two provincial councils were created in the north and east.


“The Tamils are currently caught in political turbulence once again since the end of the military campaign of the LTTE in 2009 and a federal solution is best to address the issue,” the Chief Minister was quoted as saying by the BBC.
