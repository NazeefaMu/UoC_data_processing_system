Amãna Bank recently launched its fifth remote ATM at the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka in Oluvil. 
This offsite ATM marked the bank’s 34th ATM, allowing customers in the vicinity to access their accounts 24 hours a day providing greater convenience and accessibility. 
The offsite ATM was declared open by the bank’s Vice President Operations and SME Banking M.M.S. Quvylidh along with the university’s Vice Chancellor Prof. M.M.M. Najim.
Commenting on the launch of the offsite ATM, Quvylidh said, “Over the last few years, Amãna Bank has received an overwhelming demand and acceptance in the Eastern Province. To facilitate greater access and convenience to our customers, we launched the concept of remote ATMs in the Eastern Province. The ATM at the Oluvil University marks our third offsite ATM in the Eastern Province in addition to having the province’s first drive-through ATM in Kalmunai.”
