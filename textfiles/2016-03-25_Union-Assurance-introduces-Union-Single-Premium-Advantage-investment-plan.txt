Union Assurance, a company that is constantly reinventing the face of life insurance in Sri Lanka, has brought the benefits of investment to countless policyholders through its revolutionary Union Single Premium Advantage investment plan.  


This policy stands out from its more traditional peers on account of its ability to generate higher investment benefits, while providing for a dependable life insurance cover. The plan was designed as a tool for those who are looking to invest their money in a dependable and trustworthy plan with a guaranteed life cover.


Union Single Premium Advantage requires only one premium payment and the policyholder can decide the period of investment, between five and 30 years. Union Assurance will then maintain a separate investment account on behalf of the policyholder and annual dividends will be paid directly to this account. A key advantage of this plan is that the life insurance cover, which it comes with, guarantees to be 105 percent of the initial single premium payment. 


The greatest benefit that the Union Single Premium Advantage policyholder will be able to enjoy is the ability to invest with a company that has won the trust of the people of Sri Lanka with over decades of dependable and trustworthy operation. As a result, there is absolutely no room for doubt or worry about the security of such an investment. 


Further, the policyholder is in complete control of his/her account, particularly in deciding the duration of his/her investment period – which clearly sets it apart from other investment plans in the market at the moment.
