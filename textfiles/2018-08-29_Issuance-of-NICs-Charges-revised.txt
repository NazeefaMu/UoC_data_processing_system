The charges for registration and issuing of National Identity Cards have been revised with effect from September 1 this year, the Department of Registration Persons said.

According to the media release issued by the Department's Commissioner General, the revised charges for obtaining an NIC for the first time upon reaching the age 15, is Rs.100, for obtaining an amended duplicate of an NIC is Rs.250, and for obtaining a duplicate of a lost NIC is Rs.500.

The receipt obtained from the Divisional Secretariat or Grama Niladhari Office after paying the above fee should be affixed on the application.

“If a person is unable to pay these charges due to poverty, a certificate for exemption obtained from the Divisional Secretary should be sent along with the application,” the Department said.
