The UAE said the men had been carrying out "humanitarian, educational and development projects".

Among the projects was signing an agreement with Kardan University, in the capital Kabul, to offer scholarships funded by the UAE.

The Taliban has denied earlier reports that it was behind the deadly bombing, blaming an "internal local rivalry".
