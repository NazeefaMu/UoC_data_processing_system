Changing management could make SriLankan Airline profitable: Ravi


	

SriLankan airlines could not be operated as a profitable venture because of its inefficient management, UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday said.

He told journalists at Thotalanga that appointing a team of competent officials to the Board of Directors to SriLankan airlines could solve the issue.

“The Board of Directors of SriLankan Airlines takes decisions without consulting the Minister,” MP Karunanayake said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
