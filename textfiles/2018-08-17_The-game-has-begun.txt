A provincial political authority for transport with close ties to a bigwig at the centre has now turned his office into a virtual employment exchange, they say. 

 


  He is said to be generously offering appointments as clerks, timekeepers, mobile inspectors etc. to party supporters regardless of educational and other qualifications when there are hundreds of unemployed graduates and educated youth in the province among the applicants.


It has come to light that most of the party supporters have secured employment under this Ministry by producing forged certificates and providing false information, but the politico had ordered the Ministry high-ups to go easy on such cases, they say.
