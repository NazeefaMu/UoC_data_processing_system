In response to Archbishop Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith’s remarks that human rights had become the religion among the Western nations, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the Cardinal seems to got things wrong in trying to be a populist.

In a tweet, the Minister said, “The need for Human Rights was an outcome of the marauding religious zealots of the Inquisition and the Crusades,where non believers were massacred "En-Bloc". Pity, the Cardinal always seems to get things wrong in trying to be a populist,”

The Cardinal had expressed his views while attending the morning service of the St. Matthew’s Roman Catholic Church in Ekala on Sunday.
