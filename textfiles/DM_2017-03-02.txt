Appoint Ravi as cultural minister: Bandula
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake will be better off with another portfolio like that of Cultural Affairs or Buddha Sasana Affairs, the joint opposition said yesterday.
It said the minister should resign as he had made baseless allegations that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was responsible for the controversial bond sale issue.
If he didnt resign, the President should remove him. The country's economy will be saved if instead of his current portfolio he is appointed Cultural Affairs Minister or Buddha Sasana Affairs Minister, MP Bandula Gunawardana told a news conference.
He claimed the finance minister had attempted to convince people that the bond issue was a result of a gazette notice issued by ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa but the acting Government Printer had told the Commission of Inquiry that Mr. Rajapaksa was not involved in any way.
When the Printing Department had inquired about the discrepancy in the signatures, the Debt Department had not given specific instructions to avoid using Mr. Rajapaksas signature. Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy has also said Mr. Rajapaksa was in no way involved in the gazette notice as claimed by the Finance Ministry, the MP said.
He said Minister Karunanayake had visited the Central Bank on February 26, 2015 and informed officials that the ministry was in need of Rs.15 billion to pay for the construction of roads.
This information was sent to the Perpetual Treasuries by then Governor Arjuna Mahendran. On February 27, they won the jackpot. Not a gazette or Mr. Rajapaksa but this government itself is responsible for the bond issue, he claimed. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Bangladesh Islamists to hang
	


THE HINDU, 01st FEBRUARY, 2017- Five Islamist militants were sentenced to death on Tuesday by a special court in Bangladesh for murdering a Japanese citizen in 2015.
The convicts are the members of the banned outfit Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), which orchestrated a string of explosions in 63 Bangladesh districts in 2005. The JMB was later outlawed.
The Islamic State (IS) had claimed responsibility for Kunio Hoshis murder in October 2015, but the government has repeatedly said the West Asia-based terrorist group has no presence in Bangladesh.

Big matches: Sobitha Thera to file case against Police
	
Founder of the Sri Bodhiraja Foundation Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera yesterday said that he would file a case against the police and other authorities for neglecting their duties and not banning school big matches.
The venerable thera had earlier called for the banning of school big matches as they promoted alcohol and immoral behaviour.
Sobitha thera said he had resorted to legal action as relevant authorities had failed to take any action to prevent malpractices from taking place under the guise of big matches in schools. Law enforcement authorities have turned a blind eye to all the deteriorative practices involving big matches. They have disregarded the nuisance caused to the public and ignored the numerous traffic violations reported during the big match season.
Therefore I will file a case against the police, for the wilful neglect and omission of their duties, he said. (Kalani Kumarasinghe)

Careful when criticizing young cricketers: Whatmore
	
Former Sri Lanka coach Dav Whatmore said that care should be shown when criticizing the current crop of young national team cricketers, since the team was going through a rebuilding phase.
In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Whatmore said that criticism should be more objective and that more opportunities and support should be provided to young cricketers.
Clearly they are in a rebuilding phase, and its not easy to cover two great players that have left the game. (Theyve been) Without the services of a Lasith Malinga, who has been injured also for a lengthy period of time. Its not easy. Its a rebuilding phase but I can see obvious talent there, so we just need to be a little careful about the criticisms that come their way and we need to be more objective, keep providing more opportunities and support, Whatmore said.
The former coach, who helped Sri Lanka to a memorable World Cup win in 1996, was in the island as a consultant coach for the S. Thomas College cricket team ahead of the 138th Battle of the Blues encounter against Royal College.
He also said he was open to an opportunity to coach at national level again in Sri Lanka, where he was born before moving to Australia, but that he was more keen to work at a developmental level.
Im about to swing into a more development side of things. I can never say never I guess, with full member countries or associate countries, but I think development now gives me a real kick; a buzz. So Im looking to spend a bit more time in India with the Sri Ramachandra University where were hoping to develop a number of camps and programmes there that will offer some real good advice to boys not just in Chennai or India but also in the region, and anywhere in the world, Whatmore said.

Health Ministry Deputy DG refutes JOs allegations over vaccine imports
	
Deputy Director General (Dental Services) of the Health Ministry Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara today refuted all allegations levelled against the ministry by the joint opposition (JO) over the importing of vaccine Taxacad -- known as Hearticad in Sri Lanka -- that is given to the breast cancer patients.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Bandara said Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had not incurred a financial loss to the ministry as the JO claims so.
The JO said a large-scale financial fraud took place in the tender for the importing of vaccine which is totally false. Until very recently, there was only one importer and he gave us per vial at a cost of Rs.285,000. However, we now have the opportunity to purchase a vial at a cost as low as Rs.160, 000 from a newly-registered company under the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC). Thus, after awarding the tender to the new company, the Health Ministry has been able to save up to Rs.570 million, he said.
Dr. Jayasundara Bandara further stated that the vaccine was certified and tested by the National Drug Regulatory Authority (NDRA) and was not detrimental to cancer patients as claimed by the JO.
The joint opposition, under its Top Ten Yahapalana Mega Thieves investigation programme, complained to the Bribery Commission on Wednesday that Health Minister Senaratne committed a crime by importing Rs.1, 500 million worth vaccines, thereby violating tender procedures and causing a huge loss to the ministry.
Responding to MP Ranjith De Zoysas comment that the subject minister appointed his close confidante Rumi Mohammad as the SPC Managing Director for the smooth functioning of their business, Mr. Rumi Mohammad said though Minister Senaratne was a close acquaintance of him, the minister never instructed him to engage in any wrongdoings or even interfere in tender protocols.
The JOs claim that the newly-formed company has a connection with my family is a false allegation. I will seek legal action against those who made false statements in a bid to tarnish my image, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Jaffna public servants say armed gangs threatening them
	
Some public servants in Jaffna staged a demonstration opposite the Jaffna District Secretariat alleging that the presence of armed gangs is creating a fear psychosis making it difficult to carry out their duties. They demanded an assurance of safety from the government.
The public servants said the recent disclosure by the Assistant Lands Commissioner of Batticaloa about a land grab had resulted in him being shot and injured.
"Immediate action should be taken to arrest the perpetrators of this crime," one of them said.
The protesters said when the public servants were discharging their lawful duties, the shooting by these armed groups had led to frustration among them and the failure to arrest them had made the other public servants also to fear for their lives.
The protesters handed over a petition detailing their demands to Jaffna District Secretary Nagalingam Vedanayagam. He said he would inform the Ministry of Law and order and the Police about this situation. (Romesh Madushanka)

The joint opposition today said it would file cases against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in the Supreme Court next week, regarding allegations made by him against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in connection with the issuance of the gazette notifications linked to the Central Bank (CB) bond issue.
Joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane told a media briefing that Minister Karunanayake had challenged Mr. Rajapaksa to take legal actions against him and added that a leader like Mr. Rajapaksa was not worthy of such a challenge since he was the one who had taken up the challenge to end the 30-year long terrorism in Sri Lanka.
Therefore, Mr. Rajapaksa does not need to take legal actions against him, as the joint opposition we will file many cases against him on the matter. The gazette notification was issued in January, 2015 in connection with the Appropriation Bill (2014-No.41). However, the issued gazette notification included details related to years 2011-2013. It is not acceptable, he said.
He said Minister Karunanayake and the government were attempting to put the blame of the issue on Mr. Rajapaksa and former CB Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal, and to sweep the issue under the carpet. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Oracle and Mastercard to deliver seamless payments
	
Mastercard announced a global partnership with Oracle that is designed to deliver a streamlined digital payment experience to the retail and hospitality industries at the Mobile World Congress.
The partnership will initially focus on three needs for restaurants, hotels and retail stores:
 In-store experience  Oracle and Mastercard will partner to develop and scale enhanced in-store payment experiences including Qkr! with Masterpass. This is a mobile app that enables consumers to seamlessly order and pay for goods and services via their smart phone without having to wait in line or for a restaurant server. This integration will make transactions simple, convenient and secure and remove friction for
the customer.
 Operational efficiencies  Rather than develop and implement separate payments solutions for their in-store and online operations, retailers can benefit from a fully-integrated digital payment and fraud prevention offering through Mastercard Payment Gateway Services.
 Cross-channel consistency  The integration of Masterpass, the digital payment service from Mastercard, into Oracle products allows retailers to provide a seamless check-out experience across different channels.
Mastercard and Oracle are already working with joint partners such as wagamama, Carluccios, Young &Co.s Brewery and Geronimo Pubs. They are using Qkr to let their customers order additional items during meals, pay at the table when they are ready and split the bill with others.
In 2017, Mastercard will expand the Qkr platform to six additional markets  Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Singapore, South Africa and the United States  to seamlessly pay for fees, supplies and excursions at schools, and make payments at gas stations, parking, sports arenas, and unattended retail such as vending machines.
Commenting on the announcement, Chris Fendley, SVP Merchant Development, Mastercard said: With close to 80 percent of consumers using technology at some point along their shopping journey, Mastercard is committed to unlocking omni-channel commerce for every device and delivering convenient experiences to users at-home, in-stores and on-the-go. Building on the success of our joint initiatives with Oracle in the UK, we can help retailers and hospitality providers connect with their customers in more engaging ways while enabling them to grow their businesses with scale, speed and security.

REUTERS, 01st MARCH, 2017- South Korean and U.S. troops began large-scale joint military exercise on Wednesday conducted annually to test their defence readiness against the threat from North Korea, which routinely characterizes the drills as preparation for war against it.
The exercise, called Foal Eagle, comes amid heightened tension following the latest test launch of a ballistic missile by the North on Feb. 12 and in the past prompted threats by Pyongyang to launch military action in retaliation.
South Koreas Defence Ministry and the U.S. military based in the South confirmed the start of the drills on Wednesday that will continue until the end of April but did not immediately provide further details.
The exercise last year involved about 17,000 American troops and more than 300,000 South Koreans.
U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis spoke with South Korean Defence Minister Han Min-Koo early on Wednesday by telephone and said the United States remains steadfast in its commitment to the defence of its ally.

Separatist groups capable of arming 15,000 terrorists within 48 hours: JO
	
Separatist groups have gathered information regarding 11, 000 rehabilitated and released Tamils and yet another 4,000 Tamils who did not surrender to the army, and have sufficient hidden arms and ammunition, enabling them to create a group of terrorists within 48 hours, the joint opposition warned today.
Addressing a press briefing former Parliamentarian, Sarath Weerasekara said that the background has been created by the Unity government for separatist groups to roam freely in the country, putting the country at risk.
In the period between 2009-2013 the LTTE attempted to raise its head. Separatist groups such as the Global Tamil Forum (GTF) were given the freedom to roam about in the North without restraint. Now they have collected the details on the Tamils that were released after being rehabilitated and have hidden weapons and have the ability to regroup as a terrorist organization once again," he said.
Mr. Weerasekara also stressed that State intelligence officials had been sent behind bars, which he warned, posed a grave risk to the countrys security. Intelligence agencies are the backbone of national security in any country and there is an attempt to weaken the countrys intelligence network by arresting military officers in order to please the Tamil Diaspora," he said.
Furthering, he said that whether there is a war or not the possibility of terrorism raising its ugly head was greatly reduced if the intelligence network of the country was strong. Today the government is offering dual-citizenship to Tamils. Though we think people from western countries will come flooding into the country as a result of this offer, there is a real threat that this would enable Tamil separatist groups to enter the country. No government has ever betrayed the country like this," he said.
Meantime, he said that according to the last years HIS Jane's Defence Weekly magazine, the annual income of the LTTE is USD 300 million. He said LTTE cadres were still involved in various businesses including smuggling, generating huge incomes for it. These funds could be channelled into the country to purchase properties here. This phenomenon could increase by giving Tamils dual-citizenship, he warned. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

An abduction that was buried and allowed to be forgotten over time resurfaced with the arrest of five Army intelligence officers by the CID recently. Facts and incidents hidden for eight years came to light with the commencement of investigations by the CID. It was 2008; the defeat of the LTTE was obvious and the end of the war was near. While the North shattered under the explosions of artillery fire, the South was also feeling the heat.
Keith Noyahr at the time was the Deputy Editor of The Nation newspaper. He was well known as a journalist of repute and was a versatile investigative journalist.
On May 22, 2008, he headed as usual towards the Rivira Media Corporation, a private company in Maradana, where he was employed.
At the end of the day, after attending to other errands, Keith proceeded towards a restaurant at Duplication Road, Bambalapitiya.
He was accompanied by the executive director of Rivira Media, Chrishantha Cooray and the Editor of The Nation, Lalith Allahakkoon.
They had dinner together and Keith had left in his car (PC 3023). He arrived at his residence in Dehiwela around 11 p.m., and had just opened the gate when a gang who had arrived in a white van surrounded Keith and assaulted him with pistols and poles.
Keith fought back against the assailants but was overpowered by a dark, hefty person among the gang, who struck a blow to his head with a pistol.
The attackers then carried Keith into the white van, blindfolding and handcuffing him.
Rs.2,000 was also stolen from his wallet and his gold ring worth one sovereign was also forcibly removed by the attackers.
The attackers continued their assault inside the van during a journey which lasted for about an hour. Later, he was taken out of the van and with a pole inserted through his handcuffed arms, he was carried inside a house with a number of large rooms, as stated by Keith to the CID. Once inside one of the rooms, he was stripped and the attackers continued to beat him.
What is your relationship with the LTTE, and who gives you information to publish in your paper the attackers asked.
As these incidents unfolded, his closest friends Chrishantha Cooray and Lalith Allahakkoon who had dinner with him the previous day, heard about Keiths abduction. They rushed to his house in Dehiwela.
Ranga Kalansuriya, Director of the Sri Lanka Press Institute, and another friend visited Keiths house. They observed that his telephone had also gone missing. They tried to contact him on the phone but failed as there was no response.
Lalith Allahakkoon informed the then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa about Keith Noyahrs abduction. A few moments later, DIG Anura Senanayake who arrived at the scene instructed them to come to the Dehiwela Police Station and lodge a complaint.
Keiths wife, who wept on hearing of her husbands plight, began praying beside a religious statue. Two persons from Keiths household also visited the Dehiwela Police Station as instructed by Anura Senanayake.
At the time of their visit to the Dehiwela Police Station, Anura Senanayake was occupying the chair of the OIC.
Have no fear, Keith Noyahr will come back without any issue, Anura Senanayake assured the complainants.
While he was speaking, he continued to ring Keiths number. Suddenly, it rang but there was no answer. A check with a service provider revealed that the call had originated from Dompe. Someone among the crowd then said Keith has been taken to Dompe. A police team and a friend of Keiths then set off to Dompe.
While this was taking place at the Dehiwela Police Station, the scenario at the Dompe hide-out was different.
The attackers continued to assault Keith, while questioning him. A call was received by one of the attackers, who replied Sir, Sir. Soon after this call, Keith was ordered to wash and dress up.
Thereafter, he was again put in the van with his eyes covered and brought to Dehiwela.
After dropping him, the attackers had threatened him with death, warning him not to tell anyone about the incident.
He was later admitted to hospital.
Keith sought shelter abroad. The investigations came to an abrupt end.
However the case was opened again with the dust off the files in 2015. The CID faced an uphill task in getting to the root of this crime through the circumstantial evidence.
It was revealed that at the time this call was taken, the telephone had been in the area covered by the service providers signal tower in Dekatana. After perusing the numbers of the calls that had originated, the CID obtained a list of official telephone numbers issued to the camp at Tripoly Maradana by the Army. From the investigations that followed, it was revealed that during the incident, five telephones listed by the army had been in use at the same time along with Keith Noyahrs phone in and around Keith Noyahrs house, his office and the Dompe and Dekatana areas.
The CID further investigated the officers who had used these phone numbers and were able to identify them, and in order to corroborate the evidence obtained by the CID, had recorded statements from some others as well.
The CID further uncovered the fact that a group from the intelligence unit had rented out a house at Dompe Lansiyawatte and Dompe Baduwatte Walawwa. Records also indicate that they had used Dompe Lansiyawatte from the end of 2007 to the beginning of 2008 and after vacating it had obtained on lease Dompe Baduwatte Walawwa in March 2008.
They had occupied this house from that date to March 2009 for a one-year period. It is believed that this house had been used by a sub-unit of the intelligence unit of the Tripoly Camp of Maradana.
The Police suspect that Keith Noyahr may have been taken to the Dompe Baduwatte Walawwa.
After a long investigation into the attack on Keith Noyahr, the CID took five Army Officers into custody last week and produced them before the Mt. Lavinia Court.
The suspects were remanded till March 3.
The CID, during its investigations, travelled to Australia and recorded a statement from Keith.
He stated that he could identify those who had assaulted him if he saw them again, according to CID sources.
Accordingly, the CID requested the Court to produce the suspects at an identification parade, but Keith was not present as he was abroad.
The arrested Army men are still suspects. No charges have been filed against them.

Trump softens immigration stance
	
President Donald Trump told Congress on Tuesday he was open to immigration reform, shifting from his harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration in a speech that offered a more restrained tone than his election campaign and first month in the White House. 
Trump, in a prime-time address to a country that remains divided over his leadership, emphasized his desire to focus on problems at home by boosting the U.S. economy with tax reform, a $1 trillion infrastructure effort and an overhaul of President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, known as Obamacare. 
After a first month in office dominated by a fight over his temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations, Trump looked for a reset to move past a chaotic period that sowed doubts about his ability to govern effectively. 
He called for national unity and showed a more measured tone, avoiding a repeat of his attacks on Democratic opponents and media organizations. 
Democratic Senator Tom Carper said that the person who wrote this speech must not have written the inaugural address. That one was dark and this one was more uplifting. 
At his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump painted a bleak picture of the country and described it as beset with American carnage. 
U.S. stock futures advanced at the start of Trumps address, but gave back some gains later in the speech. 
Trump focused part of the speech on foreign policy, stressing his support for NATO but insisting allies pay more for their defense.
