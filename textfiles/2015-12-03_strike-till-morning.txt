	The token strike launched by Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) and 18 other public sector professional outfits would continue until tomorrow morning, the GMOA said.
	The decision to continue the strike had been taken during the GMOA Central Committee meeting held today with other 18 outfits including Sri Lanka Administrative Services Association and State Engineers Service Association, a source said.
	The strike was based on several demands of the public servants against certain budgetary decisions. (Piyumi Fonseka)Video by Danushka
