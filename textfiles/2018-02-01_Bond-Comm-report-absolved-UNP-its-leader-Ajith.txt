Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said yesterday even though the bond issue was a minor issue for the United National Party, the Bond Commission report had clearly stated that no one from the UNP, including its leader, had done anything wrong.

“The Bond Commission report clearly proves the innocence of UNP members and its leader. Even parents would not give us a character certificate such as this,” he said.

He said the case against Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) owner Arjun Aloysius would be taken up as the first case before a 3-judge-bench as a trial-at-bar to be established next March.

“Aloysius has damaged our reputation and has done a great injustice to the country. He cannot go anywhere in the world to hide from his sins. If he is hiding anywhere in the world, we can bring him back as we can request for INTERPOL help. Justice will prevail,” he said.

Mr. Perera said the money acquired by Aloysius could be recovered as his assets were frozen.“It is possible to recover the money looted by him. Unlike what happened during the previous regime, Aloysius's money is in our country not in other countries,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
