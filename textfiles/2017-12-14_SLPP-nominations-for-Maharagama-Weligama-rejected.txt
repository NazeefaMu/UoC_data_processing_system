The nominations submitted by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) for the Maharagama Urban Council and Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha were rejected today.

The SLPP nomination for Weilgama had been rejected by Matara District Returning Office Pradeep Ratnayaka on the ground that the nomination had not been submitted by a member of the party or an authorized agent.

The returning officer had taken the decision after considering the objections raised by Provincial Council Minister Jayantha Pathirana (JVP) and other authorized agents of political parties.

Meanwhile, the nomination list for Maharagama UC had been rejected due to a technical issue. The gender of a female candidate had been marked as ‘male’. (Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk and Muditha Dayananda)
