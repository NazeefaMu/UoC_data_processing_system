'Hibaku' rice grown to recall horror of atomic bombing

JAPAN: Hibaku rice tasseled again this year in various parts of Japan as a "living witness" to the horror of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki 70 years ago.
The rice is derived from seeds collected in October 1945 by Kyushu University researchers in areas close to the hypocenter of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki just before the end of World War II in August of that year.
Hibaku (exposure to radiation) rice looks healthy, though greener than normal. But its husks are "almost empty," Kikuo Sakai, 81, said in early October, pointing to the rice grown in a 100-sq.-meter plot in his rice paddy in Motomiya, Fukushima Prefecture.
"The taste isn't good," added his wife, Ko, 76.
Sakai learned about the hibaku rice seeds from a farming magazine and began growing it, not for sale but to remember relatives who went to war and never returned, and the acute food shortages experienced in Japan during and after WWII.
