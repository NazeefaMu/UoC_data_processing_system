	United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein would visit Sri Lanka in the first-half of February, Resident Coordinator of United Nations in Sri Lanka Subinay Nandy said today.
	He revealed this while paying a courtesy call on Minister Rishad Bathiudeen at his Ministry.
	He said among High Commissioner Zeid’s points of focus in Sri Lanka, would be issues of IDPs stranded in Puttalam and other areas of the country.
	“He is also pleased with Sri Lanka’s present leadership and their commitment towards the minorities,” he said.
	However, Mr. Bathiudeen had gone beyond his call of duty in the IDP cause, Nandy said.
	“You always went beyond the call of your duty. In my discussions with Lankan political leaders I stressed that other IDPs too have to be re-settled. It is interesting to note that Muslim IDP issue has resurfaced again.
	“I never see any difference among various Sri Lankans. We at the UN see our roles beyond our jobs. Looking at Sri Lanka’s present leadership and their commitment, I am pleased that there’s a frank discussion taking place on securing the status of minorities,” he said.
