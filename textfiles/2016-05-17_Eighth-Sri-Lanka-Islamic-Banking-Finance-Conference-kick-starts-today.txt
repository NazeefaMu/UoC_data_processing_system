These would encompass most of the latest developments in the industry, not least of which would be the Sukuk, which has gained fresh momentum as a result of the Budget Speech by the Minister of Finance, in which the subject enjoyed special mention. 
The IBF industry’s contribution to the overall economy would also be discussed, whilst the increasing importance of Managing Risk in IFI’s, Marketing and New Product Development, and the issue of Intellectual Capital, are some of the discussions that would feature prominently.
SLIBFI Conference 2016, the premier event in the IBF industry in Sri Lanka and conducted without interruption for the past seven years, promises to bring together many of the key industry stakeholders, including some new players to the IBF fraternity.This year’s programme, under the theme “Convergence towards Common Goals”will witness various panel discussions with a focus on how the IBF industry could contribute to Sri Lanka’s growth.
