The Railway Operation Supervisory Officers Unions would launch a 48-hour token strike from Wednesday midnight demanding solutions to salary anomalies, the Railway Guards Union said.

Union President Janaka Fernando said they had sent proposals to the National Salary and Cadre Commission two weeks ago requesting to resolve salary anomalies.

“We met with the officials of the Commission this morning as well but there was no positive outcome. Therefore, we decided to go ahead with a token strike. We will meet the Ministry Secretary tomorrow and the decision could be revised following the outcome of that meeting,” he told the Daily Mirror.
