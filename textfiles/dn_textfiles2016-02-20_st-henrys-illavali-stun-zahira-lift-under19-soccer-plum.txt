St Henry's, Illavali stun Zahira to lift under19 soccer plum

Newcomers St Henry's College, Illavali, Jaffna stunned defending champions Zahira College Maradana by 3 goals to 1 to win the Kotmale Under 19 Schools football final played at the Race Course ground yesterday.
That it was not Zahira's day was clearly proved when one of their players gave St Henry the lead with an own goal.
Anthony Raj made it 2-0 for the school from Illavali when he netted one before half time.
Zahira pulled back the lead to 1-2 shortly before the short whistle when Amad found the net.
In the second half after a tough contest St Henry's ensured they would emerge worthy winners when Krishanthan put the issue beyond doubt making the final score 3-1.
