Bringing Conspiracy Theories & Paranoia To The Stage

If you’ve ever toyed with the idea that the CIA might have killed JFK, that Nasa might have faked the moon landings, or that shape-shifting reptilian Illuminati might rule the world – or if you’ve simply ever wondered how anyone else could entertain such ideas – Real Enemies, the multimedia production at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s New Wave festival, may stoke your conspiratorial embers.
Writer-director Isaac Butler, composer Darcy James Argue and theatrical designer Peter Nigrini have crafted a show that uses music, video and set design to explore the world of conspiracy theories. (The title is drawn from Kathryn Olmsted’s comprehensive history of paranoia in American politics, ranging from the first world war up to 9/11.)
The program, which is divided into 12 chapters, involves very little spoken text. Instead setting, mood and thematic content are conveyed almost entirely through music and visual imagery. When treating the theory that the CIA helped introduce crack cocaine to South Central Los Angeles in the 1980s in order to fund Nicaraguan contras – a notion popularized by the late journalist Gary Webb – Argue establishes a sense of time and place by nodding to LA electrofunk-influenced hip-hop, while footage of Nancy Reagan giving her 1986 “Just Say No” speech lends a dash of video-driven irony to the proceedings.
Real Enemies is not only about particular conspiracy theories, however. It is also about conspiracy thinking as process; about how – and why – people of all races, classes and creeds invent these (sometimes plausible, often outlandish) narratives.
As such, Darcy says, the show grapples with our fundamental urge to make sense of the world through storytelling, and with the very nature of belief itself; with our genius for finding meaning and order in the universe, and with the comfort that such meaning and order provide.
“It’s really telling that for so many people, it’s more terrifying to contemplate a world full of randomness and chaos than of governmental incompetence and long-standing ineptitude,” he says.
Real Enemies doesn’t just want audiences to understand conspiracy thinking, however. It wants them to engage in it. And it does so by exploiting the same narrative instinct that allows us to connect the dots between seemingly disparate events. This might mean using music that alludes to the unnerving scores of conspiracy thrillers such as The Parallax View, while simultaneously splashing different images on to each of the 15 projection screens arrayed on stage.
“Sometimes,” admits Nigrini, “we intentionally present more information than the audience can digest.” That information overload mixes with elements of conspiracy thinking which pervade every aspect of the production.
Nigrini drew visual inspiration from movies like The Parallax View and The Manchurian Candidate, which used filmmaking techniques to engender a sense of paranoia among viewers. (“If the picture works,” Parallax director Alan J Pakula allegedly told his star, Warren Beatty, “the audience will trust the person next to them a little less.”) He also looked to the work of Stanley Kubrick, a man who was the subject of more than a few conspiracy theories himself.
