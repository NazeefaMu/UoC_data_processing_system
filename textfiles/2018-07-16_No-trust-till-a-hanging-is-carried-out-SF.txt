No trust till a hanging is carried out: SF


	

Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka on Sunday commented on the death penalty and said he has no trust in the assurance given to hang drug smugglers, until a hanging is carried out.

He expressed these views after visiting the Elephant Conservation Centre at the Lunugamwehera National Park, that spans through 7,000 acres.

Speaking to media, the minister said a number of actions which were said to be taken in the past were not implemented.

“Similar to the polythene and the asbestos ban which were never implemented, I have no faith until I see this for myself. If the death penalty is being implemented, there is no need to select only the convicted who are still engaged in drug smuggling. It doesn’t matter whether you are inside or out. Action should be taken. I have no trust until it is done. It is commendable, if it happens,” he said. (Aneesha Manage)
