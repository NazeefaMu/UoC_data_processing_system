The eligible bachelor of the family at the centre of the bond scam which is still making sensational news in the country recently tied the knot at a prominent hotel in a European country, Diyawanna sources say.

 


The bride is said to be a white national.


The family senior, now a fugitive from justice, had been conspicuous by his absence at the grand wedding.  The most prominent family member now at the state lodge, of course, had to miss the important event given his current status. 


Following this news breaking out, some interested parties have started making discreet inquiries to find out whether any of our politicos had been the guests at the wedding. If so, their names will soon come out, they say.
