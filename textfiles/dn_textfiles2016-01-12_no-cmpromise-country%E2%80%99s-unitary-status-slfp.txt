No cmpromise of country’s unitary status - SLFP

 
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would not draft the Constitution in a manner that affects the unitary status of the nation, said Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody.
He also said that the status given to Buddhism in the Constitution will remain,while ensuring the rights of other religions.
He said that SLFP assures that the new Constitution that is to be drafted would protect the country’s unitary status and religious freedom. He added that the new Constitution would curtail the powers of the Executive Presidency by vesting the same to Parliament while introducing a new electoral system.
