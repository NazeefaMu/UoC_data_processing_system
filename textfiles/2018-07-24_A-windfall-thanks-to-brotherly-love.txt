A windfall thanks to brotherly love!


	

The Head of a State Owned ‘hello …’ undertaking had picked a high-end hotel in the central hills belonging to his own sibling to hold an official conference at a whopping cost of Rs. 30 million.




Employees of this establishment, who frowned upon holding this conference at a distant place involving logistical problems and heavy expenses, had pointed out that the management could have found an easily accessible venue for the conference at a much lesser cost in the city itself. 


Some 300 white-collar ones had attended this conference summoned to work out the business plan for the next year and their food and lodging bill had run up to about Rs. 100,000 per head.
