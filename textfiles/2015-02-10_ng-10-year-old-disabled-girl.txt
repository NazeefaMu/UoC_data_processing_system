Dubai Court of First Instance was told that the 29-year-old Sri Lankan sexually abused the Syrian girl then flashed her.
Prosecutors said that, on August 31, 2014, the girl’s dad, also Syrian, left his home in International City in Dubai, with his two daughters, one of whom has been was disabled since birth.
The 35-year-old dad dropped them at a nearby grocery shop and headed to work before receiving a call from his wife informing him that someone had molested his daughter, the court heard.
The daughter testified that she was with her sister, who was pushing the wheelchair and collecting goods, when the man stood beside her and touched her chest.
“I yelled at him and he left,” the wheelchair-bound girl told the court. “My sister asked me what had happened and I told her that we needed to leave.
“We bought the goods and rushed to our building and I saw him chasing us.”
The man got in the lift with them and went to the second floor while they continued to the third floor, the girl said.
“I was shocked when I saw him in front of the lift,” the young girl said. She added: “I saw him unzipping his trousers and exposing himself.”
The court heard the twin sister didn’t see him exposing himself but noticed that there was a tattoo on his arm. When the dad arrived, he began searching for the attacker and identified him from the tattoo described by his daughter, it was said at the court.
“He said sorry to me and was looking at my daughter but I called Dubai Police, who came and arrested him,” the Syrian father testified.
The Sri Lankan man denied the charges in court.
The trial has been adjourned until later this month. (7daysindubai)
