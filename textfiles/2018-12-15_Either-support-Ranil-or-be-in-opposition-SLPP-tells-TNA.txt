Either support Ranil or be in opposition: SLPP tells TNA


	

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) should decide either to ally with the United National Party (UNP) or to sit in the opposition, MP Kanchana Wijesekera said.

He told a news briefing the recent conduct of the TNA had been quite partial to the UNP in Parliament.

“We witnessed the TNA voting in favour of the confidence motion in support of Ranil Wickremesinghe. They cannot continue to be like this. If they are to play the role of the opposition they should work against the government,” he said.

He said if the TNA wished they could form a government with 117 seats in Parliament with the UNP and added that won’t happen because TNA had said they would not join any party to form a coalition government.

“If they want to support the UNP, they should handover their opposition post to a party that has secured the most number of seats in parliament. They cannot sit on the fence,” he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
