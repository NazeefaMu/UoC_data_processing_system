All his whiskey gone down the drain


	



 

A Blue purohita who had vowed to team up with the JO group has, in a surprise move, decided to stick with yahapalanaya, they say. 

 


The first to react with anger and disappointment at the volte face by the nap-loving Blue purohita was a Diyawanna member from the Puttalam district who rushed to the former strongman to open up his heart to him. “Sir, what a double gamer this fellow is! It was he who urged me to quit yahapalanaya and it was at a meeting held at his residence that they decided that I should be the first to quit. And I acted true to that decision and now he had decided to hold on to his office and perks!”


Encouraged by a sympathetic nod by the former strongman, the member continued: “I took dozens of whiskey bottles to his residence on the days we met there to discuss our future plans. All in vain!”
