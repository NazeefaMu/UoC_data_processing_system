A British woman has been left stranded in Sri Lanka after selling her home and marrying a Sri Lankan man who was shot dead, Daily Mail reported today.

The 59-year-old Diane De Zoysa says she gave £100,000 to 26-year-old husband Priyanjana when she moved to live with him in Ahungalla last year.

She had met the hotel worker when she was on holiday in the country six years ago, before returning seven months later to marry him.

However, her husband was tragically killed last month after being shot three times at a friend's house.

Mrs. De Zoysa says her husband was killed by men trying to blackmail him for money.

She has told the Daily Record that the killers thought he was a rich man as he had a nice house, a minibus and a tuk-tuk. “He paid them but they wanted more” she said.

'My husband and his family are very poor, so I have helped them. I gave up everything to join my husband here,” she said.

She says she is now desperate to return to Scotland, but is unable to do so due to her financial situation.
