Underlining the widely believed view that the pursuit of knowledge knows no age limit, a 73-year-old woman sat for the Information Communication Technology (ICT) subject at the GCE (O/L) examination yesterday at Ilma College, Matara.

N.H.S.Kalyani, a retired CWE employee of Nadugala, Matara said she studied the ICT subject by redoing the past papers without the assistance of a teacher, just to improve her knowledge. She however said that the paper was difficult.

Ms. Kalyani stated that she hoped to sit for two more subjects including Hindi Language of the same exam next year. "At this age I do not expect any job, but I just study in order to improve my knowledge" she added.
