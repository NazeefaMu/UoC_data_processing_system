Hambantota Port workers continue satyagraha for 5th day


	

The ‘MV Hoyanger’, which was the other vessel to be taken control of by the Navy after the Hambantota Port employees seized it last week, is still berthed at the pier under naval security, Navy spokesman Akram Alavi said today.

He said the ship was yet to unload its cargo before proceeding to the next port of call.

The vessel 'Hyperion Highway' sailed to Oman after leaving the harbour under a navy escort.

Meanwhile, the sathyagraha staged by the Magampura Port Workers Committee continued to its fifth day over demands that all 483 workers be absorbed into the permanent cadre of the Ports Authority.

Magampura Port Workers Committee Secretary Gayan Sandaruwan said none of the senior officials of the Ports Authority had intervened to solve this matter. (Darshana Sanjeewa and Kalathma Jayawardhane)
