Magical effect of the word, ‘dissolution’


	

The New Big Boss recently had a meeting with a group of Blue party radicals in the government. He had been unhappy with the conduct of this group known to be contributing to their share to the continuing mayhem in the House.
It was no secret to the New Big Boss that these radicals were hand in glove with the rebel group out to destabilize the government to pave the way for a new government under a Blue party Prime Minister for the remainder of the present term.
The New Big Boss at this meeting is said to have severely warned the radicals that he would dissolve the Diyawanna council if they continued to be a party to creating chaos in the House.
The radicals meekly listened, they say.
