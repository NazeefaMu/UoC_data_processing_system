NZ adds more funds to bring SL jumbo despite court hold up


	

Auckland Council's finance and performance committee meeting on Tuesday had approved a correction of $549,000 to the previous $1.6 million needed to move Sri Lankan elephant Nandi to Auckland, New Zealand media reported.

In May 2011, Auckland Council approved $3.2m to transport two gifted elephants from Sri Lanka to New Zealand.

Anjalee joined veteran elephant Burma at Auckland Zoo in 2015.

A hearing about whether the second elephant, Nandi can be moved to New Zealand is underway after campaigners in Sri Lanka petitioned the Sri Lankan Court of Appeal.

At the committee meeting, Auckland Zoo deputy director Kevin Burley said the court case in Sri Lanka was not about Nandi specifically, but rather the gifting of elephants as a whole.

Anjalee had thrived under the zoo's care and he thought Nandi would thrive also, Burley said.

Councillors Cathy Casey, Efeso Collins, Mike Lee, Wayne Walker and John Watson voted against the decision.

"It's a lot of money to transport an exotic, endangered animal from one part of the world to this part of the world. Two elephants are enough," Casey said.

$1.6m could go a long way for community groups and the council's homelessness programme, she said.

Collins said he was voting against the correction because $549,000 could be used to double council's commitment to homelessness.

Regional facilities Auckland board external relations director Paul Brewer said it was delighted at the correction of $549,000. "There was good robust debate," Brewer said.

If the court in Sri Lanka ruled in its favour, getting Nandi to New Zealand would be quickly underway, he said.

A spokeswoman for Auckland Zoo said it was confident it could give Nandi an excellent home and life but her arrival was ultimately up to the Sri Lankan courts.

"If we subsequently hear definitively that she will have to stay at Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage, then we will then explore what other options are for our elephant programme," the spokeswoman said.

SAFE campaign director Mandy Carter said Nandi had established her own family at the orphanage and an "artificial group" at Auckland Zoo could cause issues.

Residents commented on community website Neighbourly about Auckland Council spending $1.6m on an elephant.

Remuera resident Zoe Spinks said having another elephant at the zoo would attract more visitors.

"I see this as an investment to bring more interest and funding toward conservation, including our own native species," Spinks said.

Grey Lynn resident Jo Ryan said she wondered what Auckland Council's perspective was on spending money on an elephant rather than safe and affordable housing.

"$1.6m could change the lives of many of those who are homeless," Ryan said. (Stuff NZ)
