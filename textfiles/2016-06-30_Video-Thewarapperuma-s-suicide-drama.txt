Deputy Minister Palitha Threwarappperuma is reported to have attempted to hang himself from the ceiling fan in a classroom at the Meegahathenna Primary school in protest against the non-admission of 10 students.

His attempted suicide today came after he staged a hunger-strike outside the school from Monday. He was admitted to the Nagoda Hospital.

The deputy minister yesterday threatened to quit the Yahapalanaya Government if the demands made by the parents of the Meegahathenna Primary School students were not met.(Bandu Thambawita)
