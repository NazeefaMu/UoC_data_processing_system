Number Two in yahapalanaya the other day summoned uniformed high-ups of a department handling law and order for a conference at his official residence. The top team member responsible for the subject too attended this conference.

 


Both Number Two and the top team member left the conference hall after giving the uniformed top brass present guidelines on how they should tackle certain specific situations.  By the way, this conference was held at the round table in the hall where top team members usually meet for important deliberations. 


Following the departure of Number two and the purohita in charge of the subject, the department’s head moved over to the head of the table, sat in the chair just vacated by Number Two and began lecturing to his subordinates, they say. 


This could be the first occasion when a departmental head was so brash as to occupy a seat reserved for Number Two of the country, they say.
