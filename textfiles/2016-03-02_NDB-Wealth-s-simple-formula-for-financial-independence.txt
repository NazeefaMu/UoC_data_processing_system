With another Sri Lankan Independence Day already passed, isn’t it time you did some thinking about how well you’re doing in achieving your own financial independence, asks Prabodha Samarasekera, CEO of expert financial planner NDB Wealth.


Samarasekera also said, “Financial freedom means different things to different people; not having any debt, having enough saved for emergencies or being able to retire early. Another way to look at it is to have your assets generate income that is greater than your expenses.”


Samarasekera advised, “Here’s the big catch: Your career is your most powerful tool for financial independence. That often means more work in the short run, but that additional work simply serves to shave years off of your goal of retiring early. You’ve got to keep your eyes on the prize and that means sometimes doing things in an innovative and non-traditional way, while also working very hard. If you do, you’ll find financial independence creeping closer and closer.”


“There are two ways to achieve financial independence; increase your assets and reduce your expenses. While a simple lifestyle will help you manage your expenses, accumulating assets require careful planning and knowledge,” suggested Samarasekera.


As such, Samarasekera recommended freeing your money from traditional bank deposits and allowing your heard-earned savings to reach their full potential, with the help of NDB Wealth, an exemplary financial advisor that has been recognized by Global Banking & Finance Review magazine as the ‘Best Asset Management Company, Sri Lanka 2015’.

So, ‘it’s time’ to go beyond the limitations of financial independence and achieve true freedom.
