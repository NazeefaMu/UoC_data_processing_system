REUTERS, 05th SEPTEMBER, 2018  - South Korean envoys held talks in North Korea on Wednesday to finalize details on a third North-South summit to be held this month amid stalled talks on denuclearization between the North and the United States.  


South Korean officials hope the one-day visit will revive momentum after a broad but unspecific agreement on denuclearization between the United States and North Korea at a Singapore summit in June.
