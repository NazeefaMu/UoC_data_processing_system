The second generation of UNP leaders, including it’s Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa will have to wait for another 11 years to get hold of the reigns of the party from its current Leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, MP Susil Premajayantha said today.

Speaking at a news conference of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), he commented on PM Wickremesinghe’s speech made at the UNP’s 72nd Convention held recently.

“The Premier said the next generation of party leaders are being groomed to take over the party by 2030. This means Sajith, Akila, Navin and others will have to wait 11 more years. Even at 2030, there is no assurance as to who will get the party leadership. There were many demands within the UNP asking for a leadership change. The people who asked for a change are silent now,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
