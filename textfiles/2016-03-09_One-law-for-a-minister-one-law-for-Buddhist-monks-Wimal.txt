One law for a minister, one law for Buddhist monks: Wimal


	

Commenting on the arrest of the Venerable Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera allegedly for illegally keeping an elephant calf in his possession, Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa today queried as to why the law was not similarly enforced on ministers who clear the Wilpattu Wildlife Park.

“The law does not apply to ministers who clear out the Wilpattu National Park, but is strictly enforced on Buddhist monks. Is this Yahapalanaya (good governance)?”, Mr Weerawansa said in Parliament.
In response, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said that the Government would submit a report on the details of the arrest of the Buddhist monk to Parliament soon.

Minister Kiriella explained that he did not have all the details of what led to Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera being taken into custody but that he would revert back to Parliament once he gets all the facts. Minister of Law and Order Sagala Ratnayake also promised to look into the matter. (Yohan Perera)
