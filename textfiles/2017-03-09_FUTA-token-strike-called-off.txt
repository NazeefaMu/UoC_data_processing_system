FUTA token strike called off


	

The token strike, which was launched by the Federation of University Teachers' Association (FUTA) had been conditionally suspended with immediate effect due to a sudden decision made at the association ExCo meeting, Assistant Secretary Athulasiri Kumara Samarakoon said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror Mr. Samarakoon said the trade union action would be conditionally suspended on the basis of the letter dated 07.03.2017 received from the UGC, as a reciprocal gesture to demonstrate FUTA's desire to resolve the issues quickly and fairly.

The FUTA commenced a trade union action yesterday demanding the Government to resolve their salary issues and urging the Government to safeguard the State education.  
However, the Secretary said they had received an invite to a meeting scheduled for March 13, 2017 with the Minister of Finance and his officials and the UGC.

He said depending on the outcome of the meeting, the FUTA would take decision resuming its trade union action. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
