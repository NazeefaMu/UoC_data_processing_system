Gota at Bribery Commission


	

Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa arrived at the Bribery Commission this morning after he was summoned to record a statement over various allegations.
Meanwhile, a tense situation prevailed due to a protest staged by several organisations and political parties including Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) outside the Commission against the summoning of Mr. Rajapaksa.
The protest was carried out despite an order issued by the Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday banning the protest.
