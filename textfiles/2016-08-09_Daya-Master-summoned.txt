Daya Master and LTTE’s interpreter George Master had been found not guilty in the respective cases filed against them and acquitted in a previous case filed under the PTA.

He had been an English teacher and a confidante of LTTE’s Anton Balasingham.  

He had been LTTE’s interpreter and the media coordinator for several years before he became the spokesman.  During the last phase of the war he surrendered to the security forces. (Romesh Madushanka)
