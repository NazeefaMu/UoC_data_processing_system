Council workers are now his domestic servants!


	



 

Some minor employees of a big city council have been compelled to do the odd jobs at the official residence of a district level engineer.  

 


By the way, this high – up is said to be a close buddy of a provincial chief. 


These employees are required to do all types of household chores full time at the high-up’s residence though they are on the payroll of the council, they say. 


No council member would dare protest this illegal practice as they are keen on being in the good books of the high-up as his co-operation is essential for the implementation of their respective projects, they say.
