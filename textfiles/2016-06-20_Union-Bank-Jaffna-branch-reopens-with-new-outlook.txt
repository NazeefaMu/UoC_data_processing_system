Union Bank recently extended its new look and design to its Jaffna  branch located at Hospital Road , Jaffna  to provide customers a redefined banking experience. The newly remodeled branch now provides even greater banking convenience with spacious banking facilities, improved experience and enhanced levels of customer engagement. 


With the reopening of the Jaffna branch, the bank further strengthened its commitment of over 07 years to the people and business community in Jaffna.  The Jaffna branch was opened in 2009. The remodeled branch offers a broader spectrum of products and services to personal and SME customer segments.


Addressing the gathering Alex Lovell, Deputy Chairman of Union Bank, stated “subsequent to the capital infusion from US based global investment giant TPG union bank has been repositioned as a fully- fledged commercial Bank and is today one of the fastest growing banks, with industry leaders in the top management that will steer Union Bank to be one of Sri Lanka’s leading commercial Banks.”
Supplemented by enhanced technology and the expertise of a dynamic team, the re-modelled Jaffna branch of Union Bank will continue to enrich the lives of its residents by providing a host of retail banking services; such as current and savings accounts, children’s savings accounts, NRFC/RFC Accounts, fixed deposits, housing loans, personal loans, and Visa international debit cards coupled with the convenience of internet banking, a mobile banking application and a contact centre that operates 24 hours.
