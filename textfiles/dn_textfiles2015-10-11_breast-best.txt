Breast is best!

Dr. Dhammica Rowel (MBBS, MA (Health Promotion), MSc. MD (Com. Med), Consultant Community Physician and the National Programme Manager of the Intra-natal and Newborn Care Unit of the Family Health Bureau (FHB) of the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry talks to T n'C Health Watch on newborn care and importance of breastfeeding.
Q - What is essential newborn care?
A - Essential Care for the newborn is the care that should be received by every newborn from the time of birth and it includes breastfeeding, keeping the baby warm, preventing infections, identifying any risk conditions and attending to it and giving routine care for the baby. As soon as the baby is born, the baby should be dried up, covered with a dry towel a cap and cloths. The baby should be covered (if necessary) with another towel and should be kept in skin- to- skin contact between the mother's breasts. While doing this the baby is assessed for breathing, colour and activity.
Q - Why is breastfeeding important?
A - Early initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour is very important to the baby as it provides many benefits. It has been found that about 25 percent of newborn deaths can be averted by early initiation of breastfeeding. The baby will get much needed colostrum when fed early and colostrum provides perfect nutrition, immunity that protects from infections and factors that help in maturation of the gut. For the gut maturation, the growth factors secreted with breast milk is essential. For early initiation of breastfeeding the mother and the baby has to be in close proximity, as when the baby gets hunger cues, on its own it will get attached to the breast and be breastfed.
Q - Why is it important to keep an infant warm?
A - Keeping the baby warm is also very important at this early period of life. Much attention is still not paid for this care. This is especially important for the babies who are born with a low birth weight or born prematurely. Covering the head of the baby with a cap in the initial period in addition to other garments that the baby would usually wear, helps prevent the baby from getting cold. If a baby gets cold, it can lead to many other complications that can eventually lead to death. Therefore much attention needs to be paid to keep a newborn warm.
Keeping the baby in ‘Kangaroo Mother Care’ (KMC) is another method of providing essential care for the newborn especially the small babies. In addition to keeping the baby warm, KMC also helps prevent infections in the newborn, supports in breastfeeding, and improves mother child - bonding.
Preventing infections is another key aspect of essential care. Hand washing or using a hand rub before handling the newborn is a useful practice to prevent infections in the newborn. Also, we have a good cultural practice of visiting a new mother and a baby with gifts which we should preserve. However in these visits, the visitors better not handle the newborn babies as it can lead to infections in the newborn. This is especially so for newborn babies with a low birth weight or born prematurely.
Q - Please explain why breastfeeding is essential and what are the complications associated with breastfeeding when done for the first time and during the initial stage of the life of an infant.
A - Breastfeeding is a natural phenomenon and many mothers very successfully breastfeed their babies without any problems. Some mothers get problems in breastfeeding and need extra support. Mainly first- time mothers and mothers with small babies commonly need more support to breastfeed.
The best time for a mother to learn how to breastfeed is during pregnancy. Classes are conducted by the Medical Officers of Health for pregnant mothers where all the aspects of breastfeeding are taught to the mother.
Q - Please explain the importance of breast milk.
A - Benefits of breastfeeding for the baby are many. Breastfeeding is the most important intervention to keep the newborn healthy and prevent newborn morbidity and mortality. For the newborn it provides not only short term benefits, but also many long term benefits..
It has to be understood that breastfeeding is a process and it entails receiving much needed breast milk as well as receiving benefits from the process of breastfeeding such as preventing infections in the newborn, preventing the baby getting cold and improving mother child bonding.
For the first year or so of life a baby's immune system is not fully developed and cannot fight infections as well as an older child's or adult's. So a baby needs to be protected by his mother. Breast milk contains white blood cells and a number of anti-infective factors which help to protect a baby against infection. Breast milk also contains antibodies against infections which the mother has had in the past. Therefore breastfeeding protects the baby from many infections especially ear infections, pneumonia, diarrhea. Some childhood malignancies and leukemia are also known to be less in breastfed infants. Breastfeeding is known to protect the baby from non-communicable diseases such as Diabetes, hypercholesterolemia in adult life. And not only physical health, breastfeeding helps improve cognitive development as well.
Q - How does breastfeeding help young mothers?
A - Breastfeeding benefits the mother as well. Breastfeeding mothers are bound to have better health as the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer is less in breastfed mothers. Longer you breastfeed your risk of breast cancer will be less. And moreover breastfeeding mothers are happy, productive mothers. This fact is important for the working mothers as well.
Q - Can a mother returning to work after 84 days stick to exclusive breastfeeding?
A - It is best for the working mother to continue breastfeeding even if she has to return to work before completion of six months and even thereafter with complementary feeding.
The mother has to get working on a routine to express and cup feed baby and get herself organized at least one week before she starts working. Breast milk can be easily expressed and fed with a cup to the infant. The correct technique of hand expression has to be learned by the mother at the antenatal class, from her midwife or at a Lactation Management Center. Expressed breast milk can be kept in the outside environment up to 6 hours and in the lower compartment of the fridge for 24 hours and in the freezer compartment about a month.
Express your breast milk before you go to work and leave it for the carer to give to your baby. Leave yourself enough time to express your breast milk in a relaxed way. Express as much breast milk as you can into several clean cups and store. Leave about half cupful (100ml) for each feed. Cover the cup of expressed milk and keep it in the coolest place.
