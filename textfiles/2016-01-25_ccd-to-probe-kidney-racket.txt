	Police Chief N. K. Illangakoon has instructed the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) to investigate the alleged kidney transplant racket at some private hospitals.
	Health Service Director General Palitha Maheepala on Saturday wrote to the Police Chief requesting that this matter be investigated.
	Dr. Maheepala said kidney transplants had now turned out to be a large scale racket.
	Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said the IGP had directed the Western Province Senior DIG to conduct the investigations.
	Last week, the Indian Police filed legal action against six Sri Lankan doctors, working in four private hospitals in Colombo charging them of having performed these surgeries illegally.
