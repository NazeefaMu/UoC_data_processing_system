Massive profits earned by Bond Trader: Monetary Board to decide on Friday


	

Acting Finance Minister Lakshmana Yapa Abeywardane said today the SLFP members in the Government were awaiting the decision of the Monetary Board (MB) on the phenomenal profits earned by bond trader Perpetual Treasuries for the year ending March 2016.


He told the media briefing held at his office that they would take their next step based on this decision but he did not elaborate what that step would be.


He said this controversy had tarnished the image of the unity government and therefore a quick response from the Monetary Board was vital to clear the air.


“The SLFP parliamentary group is of the view that a thorough and quick inquiry is necessary so as to clear the air before the image of the unity government is further tarnished,” the acting finance minister said.


“Please wait till Friday. We must give an opportunity to the Central Bank Governor to carry out a formal inquiry to determine what has happened. We are confident that the Governor will conduct an independent inquiry and find out the truth behind this controversy,” he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
