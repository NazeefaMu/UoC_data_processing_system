Christmas tree back on track


	

The construction of the world’s tallest Christmas tree at the Galle Face Green has been resumed today after it was put on hold two weeks ago, the Ports and Shipping Ministry said.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is reported to have asked Minister Arjuna Ranatunga to resume the construction of the Christmas tree.

The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister had met Colombo's Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith on Sunday and informed him that this tree was being built from private donations.

Earlier the Cardinal had said the construction of the Christmas tree was a waste of money and that it would have been much better to use the funds to construct houses for the poor or provide scholarships to poor children.

Later, the Prime Mover Driver's Union of the Ports Authority and Social Welfare Committee announced that the construction of the Christmas tree had been stopped.  (Lahiru Pothmulla)
