Work to rule protest by CEB Engineers


	

The Engineers of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) have decided to engage in a work to rule trade union action within two weeks.

The Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union Saumya Kumarawadu said their intended trade union action was decided upon the non-responsiveness of the CEB with regard to their proposals on executing long-term power generation plants and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power generation plants.

CEB authorities show a lethargic attitude to install long-term power generation plant but are interested in plans to buy electricity from profiteering private companies and gain commissions, he alleged.

He further said a letter has also been sent by the union to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressing the need of stipulating an LNG power plan suitable for the country and preparing an appropriate procedure to be adapted in purchasing electricity thus generated.
