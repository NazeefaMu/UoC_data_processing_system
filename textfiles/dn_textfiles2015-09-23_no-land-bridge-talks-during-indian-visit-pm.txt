No land bridge talks during Indian visit - PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday that no discussion took place on a land bridge connecting India and Sri Lanka during his visit to India.
“I was surprised to read about a proposal to build a bridge linking Sri Lanka and India in a newspaper”.
“This news item has been published without verifying the facts and it could breach the confidence of readers.
This could only lead to a loss of confidence in the newspaper concerned, the Prime minister observed. Making a special statement on his recent visit to India, the Prime Minister said that greater attention will be focused on strengthening the economical relationship between India and Sri Lanka. He said that the relationship between the two countries go back thousands of years. “I would like to keep you informed about my fruitful visit to India and my talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” the PM said.
“The Indian Prime Minister and Ministers of the Indian government warmly welcomed me and my delegation,” he said.
“The Indian Prime Minister expressed his gratitude for selecting India for my first official trip abroad as the Prime Minister. This year had been a very good year for Indo-Lanka relations with a visit by president Maithripala Sirisena to India in February, my visit to India and also the visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Sri Lanka in March”.
“I also informed Indian Prime Minister about the consensual government established in Sri Lanka. He praised Sri Lanka Parliament’s decision to appoint R. Sampanthan as the Leader of Opposition. He also expressed pleasure over the end of political instability in Sri Lanka.” Primier Wickremesinghe further said that he had invited his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to visit Sri Lanka to sign the Indo – Lanka economic and Technological Agreement.
The Indian Premiers also expressed his government’s readiness to work cooperatively with Sri Lanka in future. The Indian government expressed its pleasure on the change of stance of the UNHRC in Geneva in favour of Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan government thanked India for its assistance in development and resettlement projects.
“We discussed the means and methods of improving bilateral economic relationship between the two nations and signing of the Indo Lanka Economic and Technological Agreement. The Indian Premier agreed that we should enter into the agreement around May or June 2016”.
Delegations of the two nations discussed the development plans to continue the Trincomalee Oil Tank farm as a joint venture, establishing a oil refinery by Indian companies in Sri Lanka with the permission of the Central Environment Authority and to finalize the work on thermal power plant, he added. The two nations agreed to address the problem of Indian fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters and to sort out matters in an amicable manner.
