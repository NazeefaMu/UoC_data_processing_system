Lankan superstar MALAGAMUWA looking to impress in USA

Sri Lanka's icon on the international racing track, Dilantha Malagamuwa will be looking for his first ever world title when the veteran star tests his abilities against 65 of world's best drivers at the Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo World Championship Final, which will be held at Sebring International Raceway in Florida, USA this weekend.
The Lankan, in his second attempt to book a podium finish at the Asian series, will be looking to impress over more than six dozens of world class drivers at the World Final which is considered as the most thrilling one-make series in the world. He will test the limits of his Lamborghini on November 21 and 22 with cars totaling 66 and 100 plus drivers from all over the world are expected, setting a new grid record at the end of a motorsport season.
A special media gathering had been organized by Orient Finance to wish Malagamuwa the best of luck at the world series final and Malagamuwa was over the moon about the support he gets from fans in Sri Lanka.
"I am so blessed to be born in Sri Lanka and be loved by so many people and I am treated like a King in Sri Lanka what else do I need. Now I understand the value, with greatest difficulties in my career I carried the Sri Lanka flag on my car and in return how much they respect me. I think I am one of the happiest sportsman in the world and this you cannot buy for money. I will do my best in US and will fly Sri Lanka high again", he said.
He is determined to complete this year's World Final with a podium finish after failing disastrously last year due to technical reasons.
"Last year I couldn't complete both races due to problems that popped up in the gearbox and a tyre puncture. With the race held in Malaysia on a circuit that is familiar to me, last year would have been the ideal time to have a podium finish. But unfortunately it was not my time. With the success of this season, I'm hopeful of a positive finish," he added
The World Final will take place in North America for the first time. All three Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo Series - Europe, Asia and North America - will come to Sebring, Florida, for the final rounds. Sebring is America's oldest road racing track, with more than six decades of storied history on its 17-turn, 3.74-mile circuit. It is the home to the famed Twelve Hours of Sebring.
Over the last seven months, drivers and teams have battled for championships in each Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo series and both overall driver and team championships are still up for grabs for North America and Asia heading into the final two rounds of the 2015 season at Sebring.
The Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo World Final which will be its third edition and also the final round of the three European, North American and Asian series is Malagamuwa's second after his first attempt failed in Malaysia last year.
During the event there will be four titles up for grabs besides the Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo World Final. Other races to be held are PRO, PRO-AM, AM and Gallardo AM.
Malagamuwa's team, Dilango Racing, although running on minimum recourses, are considered to be one of the best in the fray. "We know we are small fish compared to other racing teams from around the world. But this is all about skills and determination with each and every driver in contention racing on a machine that looks and performs equally.
"Getting accustomed to the track will be a matter of time and we are confident of giving others the biggest challenge and take the checked flag first," he added.
