A Green politico recently suffered a heavy fall from power which those close to him attributed to the malefic influence of Saturn. Now they claim that Saturn has turned benefic following its recent ingress into a new sign and the man is about to get back his high office and other status he lost.

 


Those peddling this story also say that the politico will get back the prestigious finance subject as well. 


Meanwhile, a Buddhist monk residing in a temple in the outskirts of the city, a frequent visitor to a well-known party head office in Pitakotte area has reportedly told a group of Diyawanna members that no power on earth could take away what a benefic Saturn would bestow on one. 


Nevertheless, the politico continues to make offerings and conduct Poojas to propitiate the deities, they say.


The man is said to be firm in his belief that the time is not far away when he could begin shining as brightly as he did before. However, not even a faint sign of a green light to come from the palace is in sight so far, they say.
