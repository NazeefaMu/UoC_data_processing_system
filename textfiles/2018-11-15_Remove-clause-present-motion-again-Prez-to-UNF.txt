President Maithripala Sirisena has requested the United National Front (UNF) leaders to remove clause 1 of the motion which was submitted to Parliament on Wednesday and to present it again on Friday, President’s Media Division said.

The President has conveyed this when Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, MPs of parties representing the United National Front and the Tamil National Alliance met him at the Presidential Secretariat last evening.

At the meeting, the President has requested all those present to conduct the vote by name call and to show their majority in the House in a proper manner.

The discussion, that lasted for more than two hours, centred on the current political situation in the country where it was stressed by both the UNF and the TNA that they command the majority in the house and they requested the President to accept this position.

The President emphasized that he always acts according to the Constitution and to safeguard it. He urged all parties present in Parliament to maintain peace within the chamber and act according to democratic procedures and respect standing orders.
