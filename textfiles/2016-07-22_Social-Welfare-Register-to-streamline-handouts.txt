The National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry has prepared an Integrated Social Welfare Register based on the recipient’s NIC for all handouts from Ministries, Provincial Councils and Local Authorities.

Issuing a statement, the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry said the project is being carried out through the Project Management and Monitoring Department with technical assistance of ICTA

“Currently 80% of data has been uploaded to the system and further refining is in progress. Once the program is completed, it will be very useful in streamlining social welfare handouts, better targeting and reducing ‘ghost’ beneficiaries, if any,” it said.

The introduction of the Adhaar program in India, with a unique number for all social payment beneficiaries, has resulted substantial elimination of ghost beneficiaries, the ministry said.
