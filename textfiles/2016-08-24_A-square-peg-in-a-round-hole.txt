A square peg in a round hole


	

There is a top official of a certain leading political party who is not accessible even to the MPs and the Ministers of the party, they say.

 


Many politicians of the party have complained to the party leadership that this top official cannot be reached even in case of an emergency.


There are even some front-liners of the party who had never got an occasion to speak to this party high-up living in an ivory tower of power, they say.
