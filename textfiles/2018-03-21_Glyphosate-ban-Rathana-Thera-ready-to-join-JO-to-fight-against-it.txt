While claiming that the decision to topple the Government was taken by the people, Parliamentarian Athuraliye Rathana Thera said today he was ready to join, even with the Joint Opposition to fight against any moves to remove the ban of Glyphosate..

Ven. Rathana Thera told parliament that decisions on the Glyphosate should not be taken on the need of the American Company.

"Minister Navin Dissanayake submitted a Cabinet paper to remove the Glyphosate ban in Sri Lanka. And a committee comprising Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Susil Premajayantha was appointed on this. We do not know who appointed this? Where is the report of this committee?.

“A US citizen cannot decide whether to remove the ban," he said.

The matter cropped up in Parliament when Minister Eran Wickremaratne replied to a question raised by UNP MP Thushara Idunil over different views on the use of Glyphosate.

Mr. Wickremaratne said there was no scientific evidence to prove that Glyphosate led to kidney diseases according to findings of a scientist at the Peradeniya University, Buddhi Marambe.

He said the Government could not be toppled on matters like this, in reply to a claim by MP Idunil that some were planning to topple the Government over this.

Ven. Rathana Thera, who responded, said that more than 100 world-renowned scientists such as Ranil Senanayake and Priyani Paranagama had submitted a report to the President on the danger of using Glyphosate and asked is Mr. Marambe the only scientist in the country.

"Toppling of Government is decided by the people. If the JO supported me in the fight against this, I am ready to join them," he said.

JO MP Dinesh Gunawardane said the country was more important than the American Company and that they were ready to support Rathana Therain this matter. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
