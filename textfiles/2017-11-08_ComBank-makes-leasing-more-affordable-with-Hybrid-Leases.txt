ComBank makes leasing more affordable with ‘Hybrid Leases’


	

A new leasing product that makes leasing a higher value vehicle more affordable at commencement has been launched by Commercial Bank of Ceylon especially for upwardly mobile company executives and professionals.


The bank’s new ‘Hybrid Lease’ combines the features of a ‘Super Lease’ with the option of paying only a comparatively  low rental during the first six or 12 months, paying regular rentals thereafter and a lump sum at the end of the lease.


The repayment structure of the ‘Hybrid Lease’ is designed for executives and professionals earning a minimum salary of Rs.50,000 with anticipated, periodic increments. The customer begins by paying a very low rental during a specified period and a higher instalment when his or her earnings increase.
After the first six or 12 months, a fixed monthly rental can be paid until the penultimate month of the lease. Concluding the lease, a lump sum residual will be recovered as the final month’s payment.
This product will be offered for both unregistered and registered vehicles and for sale and lease-back leases, the bank said.


Commenting on the launch of this new product, Commercial Bank Deputy General Manager Personal Banking Sandra Walgama said, “The ‘Hybrid Lease’ provides an opportunity for vehicle enthusiasts to buy the automobile they aspire to own. They will now be able to purchase a higher value vehicle at an initial lower monthly rental, thanks to the novel repayment structure.” 


‘Hybrid Leases’ are expected to be most suitable for personal use vehicles from reputable brands that have a high resale value. Commercial vehicles too will be considered on a case-by-case basis, the bank said.


As an additional service to customers with excellent repayment records, the bank said it will offer an extension of up to two years on the lease tenure to repay the residual lump sum of the ‘Hybrid Lease’ granted to unregistered vehicles. This extension is subject to conditions and if offered, will be treated as a fresh lease facility.
