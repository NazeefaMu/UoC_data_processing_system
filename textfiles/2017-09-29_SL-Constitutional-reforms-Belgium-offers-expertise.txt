Belgium is ready to share experience with Sri Lanka in the ongoing constitutional reform process, Belgium Foreign Affairs Minister Didier Reynders said.

He expressed these view upon meeting Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana at the Belgium Foreign Affairs Ministry in Brussels on Wednesday.

Minister Reynders also informed that Belgium was willing to offer diplomatic training to Sri Lanka Foreign Service Officers.

In a statement, Foreign Affairs Ministry said Minister Marapana briefed his Belgium counterpart on the progress Sri Lanka has made in bringing about reconciliation, strengthening good governance practices and respecting human rights.

Minister Marapana invited Minister Reynders to visit Sri Lanka at an early opportunity. The two Ministers noted the cordial bilateral relations between the two countries.

The Ministers also discussed the opportunities to expand trade and investment in the context of the EU GSP+ facility, which was restored to Sri Lanka this year.

Mention was also made of the Belgium companies currently engaged in the infrastructure development projects in Sri Lanka and the growing number of tourists arriving from Belgium.

It was noted that a business delegation from Sri Lanka will visit Belgium early next year as a follow up to the Flanders Investment and Trade (FIT) visit a few months ago.
