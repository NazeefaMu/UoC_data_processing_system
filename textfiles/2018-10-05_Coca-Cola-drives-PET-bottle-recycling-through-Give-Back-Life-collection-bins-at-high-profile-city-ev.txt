Sustaining its momentum in driving the recycling habit amongst the general public, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. (CCBSL) recently placed its customized ‘Give Back Life’ PET plastic bottle collection bins at the Colombo Book Fair, held from 21 to 30 of September 2018 at the BMICH. Strategically located across the venue, these ‘Give Back Life’ collection bins allowed visitors to dispose of their PET plastic bottles in a responsible manner for recycling purposes. A total of 530kg or approximately 18000 bottles were collected over the duration of the book fair, which will be recycled by Eco Spindles (Pvt) Ltd.  

The initiative helped raise awareness of the need for PET bottle recycling amongst the hundreds of thousand visitors to the fair, which included school and university students. Coca-Cola’s ‘Give Back Life’ PET recycling bins were also utilized at the European Street Food Festival organised by The European Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (ECCSL) on 30th September 2018 at the Colombo Racecourse ground. Lakshan Madurasinghe - Country Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability Manager, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. commented, “Coca-Cola is committed to achieving high volumes of PET recycling in Sri Lanka by focusing on PET recovery and recycling as part of its commitment towards environmental protection and societal well-being. We are proud to partner such events through the ‘Give Back Life’ initiative which sends out a message to people not to litter but to recycle, because recycling PET plastic offers livelihoods for both communities and industries as the bottles are given back life in the form of garments, brushes and shoes.”
