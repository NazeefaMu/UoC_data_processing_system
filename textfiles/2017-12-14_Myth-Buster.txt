MYTH: Eating an egg everyday is bad for your health.  


BUSTED: “This is not true. It depends on the physiology of the person. Eggs are high quality proteins and are important in the diet. The white of the egg contains protein whereas the yolk has Vitamin A and contains a high amount of cholesterol. It is important for growing children and healthy adults. A child should have an egg a day. An adult, with high cholesterol levels in his or her blood, those with hypertension and heart patients should be careful.

They can have it once in two days or two eggs per week. If they eat only the white of the egg there should be no problem. Furthermore, eggs are also a cheap protein in comparison to meats,” explained Dr. Shanthi Gunawardana, Consultant Community Physician, Non Communicable Diseases Unit, Ministry of Health.
