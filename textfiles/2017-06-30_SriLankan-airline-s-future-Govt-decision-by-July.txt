Government will, within the next 30 days, take a final decision on the future of the country’s national carrier, Srilankan, informed sources said yesterday.

They said the government would decide whether to covert Srilankan into a public-private- partnership, a State-owned venture or to privatize it and would reveal its decisions by way of a public statement on July 30,”

The sources said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had also instructed the government to take a decision soon.

This comes amid the previous disclosure that some airlines have had informal talks with the Sri Lankan Government on partnering the national carrier. Government had also said that it was considering operating the airline on the basis of a public-private-partnership so that it would be turned into a profit-making venture. (Yohan Perera)
