Two men who had come on a motorcycle have reportedly slashed the nose of a police sergeant who was on duty at the Yakkaduwa Junction in Elpitiya causing severe injuries to his face this morning.
The pillion rider had slashed the sergeant’s nose with a sharp object and fled the scene when the police signaled to stop the motorcycle.
The injured sergeant was admitted to the Elpitiya Base Hospital and was later transferred to the Karapitiya Hospital.
The police have been on alert following a tip off that some chain snatchers were moving about in that area and had tried to stop the motorcycle since it looked suspicious.(Janath De Silva)
