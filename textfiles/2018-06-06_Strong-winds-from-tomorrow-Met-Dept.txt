The South-West monsoon will result in winds over the island and the sea with rains in North-Western parts of the country from tomorrow, the Meteorology Department said today.

It said strong winds of up to 60 to 70 kmph could be expected in the Jaffna, Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Badulla, Monaragala, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Ratnapura and Kegalle districts.

The Met Department said there would be strong winds from time to time until June 11 warned the people to remain vigilant.

It said fairly strong winds of up to 50 kmph can be expected elsewhere, particularly in South-Western parts of the island.

The duty forecaster said seas in the Bengal Bay would be rough caused by low pressure.

“There will be no direct impact on the country from the low pressure area. However those who conduct naval and fishing activities around Bengal Bay should be cautious,” the Met department said.

He said sea areas extending from Colombo to Trincomalee via Kankesanturai and sea areas extending from Hambantota to Batticaloa via Pottuvil can be rough with wind speeds increasing up to 60-70 kmph at times. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
