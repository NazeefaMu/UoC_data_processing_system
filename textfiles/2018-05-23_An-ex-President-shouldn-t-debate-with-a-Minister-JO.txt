Joint Opposition (JO) MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage today said they won’t allow former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to go for a debate with Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, but other JO MPs were ready to debate with the Minister.

Addressing a news briefing, the MP said Mr Rajapaksa was a respected country leader and therefore, he shouldn't be allowed to go for debates with Ministers.

“Mr Rajapaksa shouldn’t opt for debates with the Government about the economy, which is being handled by the likes of Arjuna Mahendran. However, we as MPs, are ready for any debate with anyone. All they have to do is make the preparations for the debate,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
