The Joint Opposition, in response to an invitation extended by SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake to join hands to contest the upcoming elections, has put forward conditions to accept it.

Forty two Joint Opposition MPs sent a written response with these conditions outlined. The resignation from the unity government with the United National Party (UNP), the containment of the rising cost of living, taking a stand against the current constitutional proposals, curbing the present crime wave involving the underworld, standing against the alienation of national assets, honouring the position taken by the Maha Sangha against the constitutional proposals are among the conditions placed by it to team up with the SLFP to contest the elections together.

Also, the Joint Opposition urged the SLFP to take action against those responsible for the Central Bank bond scam irrespective of their positions.

MPs Dulip Wijeysekara, Arundika Fernando and Priyankara Jayaratne who recently joined the Joint Opposition are also among the 42 MPs who signed this letter to be sent to Minister Dissanayake. (Kelum Bandara)
