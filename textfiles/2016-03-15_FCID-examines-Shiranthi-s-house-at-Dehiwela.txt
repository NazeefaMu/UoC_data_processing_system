FCID examines ‘Shiranthi’s house’ at Dehiwela


	

The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) today examined a two-storey house currently under construction at Mihindu Mawatha in Dehiwala with a notice at the entrance saying “Madam Shiranthi Wickramasinghe Rajapaksha”.

A source said the FCID had examined the house on a court order in connection with the ongoing investigation on CSN.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s son Yoshitha was arrested on January and remanded on charges of financial irregularities at the CSN.

However, Police spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said neither Shiranthi Rajapaksa nor her son Yoshitha had any connection to the house.  

Earlier, the FCID questioned Ms. Rajapaksa in connection with an alleged fraud at the ‘Siriliya Saviya’ Foundation.
