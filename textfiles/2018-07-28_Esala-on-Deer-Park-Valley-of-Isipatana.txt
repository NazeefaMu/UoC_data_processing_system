Countering Racial Myths Through Middle Path  

 

“Pavattite ca panabhagavatadhamma·cakke bhumma deva saddam·anussavesu<U+1E43>saddam·anussavesu<U+1E43>: ‘eta<U+1E43>abhagavata bara<U+1E47>asiya<U+1E43>isipatane miga·daye…”
The devas of the earth proclaimed, ‘The Bhagava has set in motion the supreme Wheel of Dhamma, which cannot be stopped by Sama<U+1E47>as or Brahmins, Devas, Maras, Brahma or anyone in the world.’   
 ‘Thus at that instant, the cry stretched as far as the extraterrestrial worlds, and tens of thousands fold planetary system quaked, shook, and trembled and a vast magnificent radiance emerged, outshining the divine splendor of the Devas.’   

 

Bringing the mind to the centre
His voice lingered setting forth the Dhamma Wheel through the valleys of Deer Park, in Isipatana, Baranasi; avoiding the extremes, the middle way realized by the Buddha produced knowledge and vision. This knowledge helped followers of the Buddha find tranquility and self-awakening.
We human beings, why erect walls between our neighbours and ourselves through imaginary phenomena, race, creed, caste, and class – which breed loneliness and isolation?

The Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta
The commencement of moving, Dhamsak Pevatum, Great Discourse can mean a range of effects depending on its circumstance; here, it refers to the Buddha’s teachings or ‘truth’ that guide one to freedom from suffering. Cakka can be interpreted as ‘wheel.’ “Dhamma-Wheel,” is --a Buddhist icon referring to Buddha’s teaching of corridor to enlightenment. Pavattana is ‘setting in motion,’ turning, or rolling. The enlightened one illustrates the four noble truths ariya·saccas for the first time. The two ends that are disapproved or undesirable are of commitment to self-suffering, devotion to sensual pleasure; painful and unprofitable. avoiding both of these extremes, focus on middle path as comprehended by the Buddha.   

 


An important ritual, the ‘Vas’, or the rains retreat of the monks begins on the day after the Esala Poya


 


The significance of the day
Esala symbols the announcement of the Noble Eightfold Path. It is the anniversary of the first sermon by the Enlightened One. Buddha’s preaching of Dhamma-cakka-pavattana Sutta on an Esala Poya Day in Benares at the Deer Park to the five ascetics, which could be considered the most important event in the history of Buddhism. Esala celebrates several other happenings too— the conception of the Bodhisatta in Queen Mahamaya, the arrival of the Tooth Relic in Sri Lanka, Great Renunciation by Siduhatt, performance of Miracles and preaching of the Abhidhamma by Gautama Buddha in Tavtimsa heaven to Mathu Divya [mother]. The first ordination in Sri Lankan of the nephew of the king Prince Arittha, at Anuradhapura by Arahath Mahinda; the foundation laying for the Ruwanveli Dagoba are also among them. An important ritual, the ‘Vas’, or the rains retreat of the monks begins on the day after the Esala Poya.   

 

Freedom from Sansaric bonds 
 Only in the minds which are conflict-free, one can find total freedom; it cannot be established in any political structure like democracy, communism or socialism. To be free, we have to look within our own minds and work towards freeing ourselves from the chains of unawareness, ignorance and craving. Buddha, never chose to influence political power to introduce his Dhamma, although the Blessed One closely was associated with kings, ministers and princes; nor did he allow the teachings to be misused or abused to gain undue benefits. Many politicians, of competing factions today, are dragging Gautama Buddha and his Dhamma into politics by quoting and misinterpreting the Sutras. Quite a few temples have become central propaganda offices of political interests. Recognised political organisations persuade Sangha units within the party machinery while a few saffron robed extremists’ elements have formed political units to assist politicians contest elections.   

 

Racial myths and Dhamma
When we divide and call ourselves as Sri Lankan, Sinhalese, a Muslim, a Buddhist or a Christian, or anything else, we are separating ourselves from the rest of mankind and we become violent. Why do we become violent? Because when we separate ourselves by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds hostility and aggression. A man who is seeking to comprehend violence does not fit in to any race, any country, or religion, or to any political party. Extreme nationalism is one of the fundamental reasons for war and for the awful destruction and misery of the humankind. What is the purpose of we identifying ourselves with a faction, with a particular country or group, weather socially, economically, or politically?

We are only Homo sapiens
Unlike flora and fauna, all human beings belong to one species only, the human variety/species is called Homo sapiens. Tamil, Sinhalese, English and a thousands of other nationalities and races are only labels born out of belief and having no inherent significance whatsoever.   


Check your entire body as carefully as possible. Is there any particular part in it or spot which differentiates it as a Muslim, Sinhalese or Tamil? People differ in complexion of skin such as tan, black, brown, fair..., as a result of climatic and geographical conditions. Does that colour indicate as to what nationality, race or caste a person fits in to? We are common to the human race, unfortunately, as a child grows up he or she will be deemed to belong to a particular nationality or race. The child who is incompetent in rational thinking, cannot differentiate fact from fiction and who does not have the ability to judge, compare and contrast against, believes selfishly and mistakenly the nationality, race, caste are as facts, being ignorant that it has been forced upon him or her. Having accepted it he/she gradually comes to believe that it belongs to a particular race or nationality. One becomes a Sinhalese or Tamil not because he/she had something obviously Sinhalese or Tamil, but because of the self-assurance formed and forced on the person by the ‘civilization and culture’.   


Only a mentally unsound person sees illusions or things that do not exist, but believes that they do exist. At the mental hospice there was a patient who called himself King Dutugemunu. Not only did he confidently believe that he was Dutugemunu, but in his conduct he even demonstrated a pompous royal appearance. If challenged, the unfortunate man would regard the challenger to be a lunatic.   

 

What the Awakened One said 
Gautama Buddha emphatically stated in Kalama Sutta, “Do not accept anything on the influence of tradition handed down by the older generation; anything because you think it ought to be so; anything because of its agreement with the doctrines of your books. Do not accept anything because it is rational; anything because it is logical; anything because it agrees with your own pet view; anything because it is said by an ascetic whom you are bound to honour”.   


 In realising the truth, it necessitates that we take nothing for granted; that we believe nothing on faith or conviction. Question every little thing about ourselves, practice with diligence and sincerity. Confront and challenge most basic beliefs and convictions, even those we may have about the Dhamma itself; a spirit of inquiring, a spirit of critical assessment, that is what Buddha lay emphasis on in Kalama Sutra.   


To transform the world, we must commence with ourselves; and what is noteworthy in beginning with ourselves is the purpose. The purpose must be to understand ourselves and not to assign it to others to convert themselves or to get about a personalised change through revolt. It is significant to know that this is our responsibility. Thought is so cunning, so smart, so crafty that it distorts everything for its own expediency.   


May all beings be happy!
