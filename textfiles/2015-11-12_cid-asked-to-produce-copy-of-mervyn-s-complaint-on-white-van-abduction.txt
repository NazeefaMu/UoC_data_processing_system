The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday directed the CID to produce the details on the complaint made by former minister Mervyn Silva to them in January regarding the alleged ‘white van’ abductions that took place during the time the previous government was in power.
In relation to the Habeas Corpus petitions filled against three alleged abductions reported in the Matakkuliya area in 2011, Mr. Silva was noticed to appear as a witness based on the statement he had made to the CID.
When these cases were taken up for hearing yesterday (11), Senior State Counsel Wasantha Perera, appearing for the defendants, told the Magistrate that the Mr. Silva’s statement to the CID in January will be valid only if it was directly related to these three cases. They therefore maintained that Mr Silva's complaint to the CID would be irrelevant to the case and asked court to stop it form being brought in as evidence.
However, Counsel Nuwan Gopage, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, stated that Mr. Silva was noticed to appear in court on the basis of the circumstantial evidence, which was allowed in Habeas Corpus cases.
Appearing for the former minister, Counsel Prasad Silva told the Magistrate that his client doesn’t have any direct link to these three cases, but would be willing to provide a statement with regards to the ‘White Vans’ abductions, just as he complained to the CID in January.
Thereafter, the Magistrate directed the CID and State Counsel to first provide court with a copy of the Complaint made by the former minister to the CID. Court also told the Petitioners to test out the CID complaint of Mr. Silva and directed them to request for an order to summon him if needed on the next court date, January 26, 2016.
