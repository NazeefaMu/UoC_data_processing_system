Traffic on the Colombo- Puttalam Main Road at the Galkanda Junction and the train service on the Colombo- Puttalam line at the Thelwatta Junction were blocked by fishermen and residents of Negombo protesting against the Port City Project.

The fishermen, who were joined by religious leaders, said they were opposed to the removal of sand from the Pitipana area in Negombo for land reclamation in connection with the project.

The protestors said the move would severely affect their livelihood. (Tony Karunanayake)
