A Blue party purohita from Wayamba who has also made his mark in the country’s entertainment field is holding a grudge against the Blue party seniors for their alleged underhand moves to undermine the yahapalanaya government.  

 


This purohita who had once thrown in his lot with the Green party too has confided in some of his colleagues that he was planning to launch his own political party. 


Accounting for his intention to found a new party of his own, the purohita has also told his friendly colleagues that he had to face very unpleasant situations both as a Green and a Blue due to intra-party rivalry over ‘manape’.
