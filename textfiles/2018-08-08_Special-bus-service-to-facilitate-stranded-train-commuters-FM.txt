The Finance ministry announced today that special bus services have been provided to facilitate the train commuters who were stranded due to the train strike and that private buses could operate on any route regardless of route permits.

The ministry said in a statement that the train commuters were permitted to travel on CTB buses using their train tickets or season tickets.

It said the government would repay the cost incurred by the Sri Lanka Transport Board for  providing the special bus service.

The statement added that the government requested all the trade unions to come for discussions after stopping the strike.
