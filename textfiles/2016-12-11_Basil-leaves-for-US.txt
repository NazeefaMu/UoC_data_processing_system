Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa had left for the United States yesterday for medical purposes, a Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna spokesman said today.

Last week, the Colombo High Court allowed Basil Rajapaksa to travel to the US for three months for medical purposes.

“The travel ban on the former minister was lifted after nearly two years’, the spokesman said.
