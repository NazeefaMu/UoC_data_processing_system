The Minister Counsellor (Defence) attached to the Sri Lankan High Commission in London has been suspended after a video, which showed him behaving in an offensive manner, was emerged and circulated on social media.

In a statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said today the authorities in Sri Lanka have taken serious note of videos being circulated on social and web-based media of the alleged incident involving the Minister Counsellor (Defence) behaving in an offensive manner.

“In this connection, instructions have been sent to Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner in London on Tuesday to suspend the Minister Counsellor (Defence) from work with immediate effect. Authorities in Sri Lanka including the Sri Lanka Army will initiate inquiries on the incident immediately,” it said.

The incident had occurred during a protest held by a group of LTTE supporters outside the High Commission in London on the Sri Lanka’s Independence Day.

The protesters demanded information on the missing persons, to release all ‘political prisoners’ and to close down torture camps.

A video showed Minister Counsellor (Defence) Brigadier Priyankara Fernando, who came out from the High Commission, making a ‘cut-throat’ gesture towards the protesters. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
