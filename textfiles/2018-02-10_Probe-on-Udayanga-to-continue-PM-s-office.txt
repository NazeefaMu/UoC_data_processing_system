Investigations on former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga will continue with the involvement of three ministries, a spokesman from the Prime Minister’s office said yesterday.

It said the Ministries of Law and Order, Foreign Affairs and Justice will be involved in the investigations.

However, Mr. Weeratunga had claimed that he was released by Interpol because there were no charges filed against him at an international level.

He is reported to have said he would be leaving to US shortly.  (Yohan Perera)
