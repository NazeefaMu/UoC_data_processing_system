The Joint Opposition lodged a complaint against International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama with the Bribery Commission today for allegedly misusing Mahapola funds amounting to Rs. 1 billion.

The complaint is the third in the series of Top Ten Yahapalana Mega Thieves initiative of the Joint Opposition.

Earlier, the JO lodged complaints against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on charges of financial misappropriation.

In today’s complaint, the JO alleged the Mahapola Higher Education Scholarship Trust Fund and Schools Development Fund had been invested in a private company called Asset Trust Management (Pvt.) Ltd.

Asset Trust Management is a subsidiary of SAFE Holding Company owned by Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria, the Chairman of the National Wealth Corporation (NWCL), which regulates the Mahapola Fund, JO member MP Sisira Jayakody said.

He said the appointment of Dr. Weerasooriya as NWCL Chairman was a violation of State fiscal policies.

“The funds of the Mahapola and Schools Development Fund had been invested in a second subsidiary company of SAFE Holding Company called Wealth Trust Securities Ltd. This subsidiary had recorded a profit of Rs. 1,000 million for a period of 21 months ended in October this year,” he said.   

The JO sought action against both Minister Samarawickrama and Dr. Weerasooria.

"Diabolical lies" says Dr. Weerasooria

Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria, the Chairman of the National Wealth Corporation Ltd (NWCL) vehemently rejected the allegations levelled against him by the Joint Opposition.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Weerasooria said ‘what’ have been said by the JO was a diabolical lie.

“Mahapola funds have never been used by the said two companies and no Mahapola fund had been misused or abused. Gihan Jayatilleke, the Chief Executive Officer of NWCL could corroborate on this,” he said.

He said the allegations were attempts by the JO to embarrass Minister Malik Samarawickrama and himself. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
