A buddy of this top team member in yahapalanaya wanted to secure a particular job in a key enterprise in the country. And the better half of the top team member is a top executive in this enterprise. So this job seeker sought the help of his friendly political bigwig to secure the job he wanted.

 


The political bigwig immediately wrote a letter addressed to his wife asking her to comply with his buddy’s request. “You give this letter to my wife. She will do the needful,” he assured the job-seeker.
Highly elated job-seeker armed with the powerful politico’s letter made a beeline to the office of the latter’s wife and handed the letter to her. The response he got from the lady was something he never expected. A flush of anger spread over her face as she read the letter and she tore it up and threw it into the waste paper basket by her side. “He can’t ask me to give jobs to his people. Don’t come here carrying letters addressed to me again. Now get out!” she fumed at him.


The man had met the political bigwig again and complained to him how shabbily he was treated by his wife. 


The politico had consoled him saying: “Don’t take this matter seriously. She is like that at times! Let us look for something equally good elsewhere!” He had added as an afterthought. “Don’t breathe a word about this incident to anyone else!”
