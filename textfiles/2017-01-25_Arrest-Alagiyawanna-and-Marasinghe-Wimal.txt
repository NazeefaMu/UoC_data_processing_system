Joint opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa called for the arrest of Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna and government MP Ashu Marasinghe -- whom he accused of acquiring vehicles illegally.

“I am on remand today, while those who really acquired vehicles by illegal means are free," he said in Parliament last afternoon

"Mr. Alagiyawanna and Mr. Marasinghe should be arrested at once," he added.

Mr. Alagiyawanna, who responded later, said he had acquired three vehicles legally and had documents to prove it.

“I did not distribute vehicles to my relatives," he added. (Yohan Perera)
