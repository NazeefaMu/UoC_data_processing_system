Aspirants galore though the poll is miles away!


	



 

Although the big poll is miles away, two or three aspirants are said to be already gearing up for the fray. Meanwhile, the names of two other persons had been mentioned in this connection in political circles last week.

 


One of these two hopefuls is a son of a prominent politico and the other is a governing one now in office.


The claims that the politician’s son makes have become a source of both good humour and derisive mirth for most politicos, who know him well. He claims, they say, that he was quite active in politics from his school days and what draws derisive guffaws is his claim that it was he who gave the leadership to the popular movement that brought yahapalanaya into power.   


The other aspirant, the governing one hails from a prominent political family in the South. One of his brothers is a sitting Diyawanna member. These days he is reportedly meeting friends and well-wishers informally singly and in groups, to apprise them of his plans. However, he has not announced his candidacy officially so far.


Going by the present indications, seven to eight candidates are expected to enter the fray at the coming big poll, they say.
