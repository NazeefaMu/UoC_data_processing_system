In the wake of May Day, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday proposed to the Cabinet to set up a committee made up of representatives of the unity government's two main parties to iron out differences and forge ahead.

Minister John Seneviratne is reported to have raised concerns about him being slandered by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne in public while the other ministers had also put expressed their views in this regard.

The President said he would call for a meeting of the the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to discuss ways and means of fostering unity and to work amicably without atagonising each other. (Kelum Bandara)
