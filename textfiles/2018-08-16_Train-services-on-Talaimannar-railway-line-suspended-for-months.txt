The train services between Talaimannar and Medawachchiya would be suspended for three months from tomorrow due to the replacement of bridges on the Talaimannar Railway line, Railways Additional General Manager Wijaya Samarasinghe said.

He said the bridges between Murukandi and Mannar at 305 kilometres and 307-kilometre posts would be replaced.

Speaking to Daily Mirror he said the announcement had been made for the convenience of commuters with reference to the meeting held at the Railways Department.

Accordingly, the train services between Talaimannar and Medawachchiya would be suspended from today till November 16, he said.

He said Sri Lankan Transport Board (SLTB) bus services would be made available to facilitate train commuters.

Accordingly, the trains from Colombo would end their journeys at Medawachchiya during the time the bridges are being replaced, Mr Samarasinghe said.

A joint bus service would be operational between Talaimannar and Medawachchiya parallel to the railways timetable. “Commuters can use their train season tickets on buses operating between Talaimannar and Medawachchiya during this time,” Mr Samarasinghe said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
