Harbhajan Singh stated that the current Australian cricket team are like ‘Sri Lankans playing in yellow clothing’, adding to his previous criticism of their batting line-up, the Hindustan Times reported.

He criticised the current Australia side, stating that watching Steve Smith’s team is like seeing ‘Sri Lankans playing in yellow clothing’.

“The kind of cricket Australia is playing, it appears as if Sri Lankans are playing in yellow clothing. And whatever I know of Virat (Kohli) and his team they will be looking for nothing less than 5-0,” Harbhajan recently told India Today.

Australia has already lost the series, coming out on the losing side of all three ODIs so far with the most recent defeat coming in Indore.
