Railway Guards, operating from the Mardana station have launched a trade union action from 10 am today until further notice, claiming that the authorities failed to take measures to eradicate bed bugs in their rest rooms and bungalows in the railway stations countrywide.

Railway Guards' Association Secretary P.M.P. Peiris said that they complained about the issue but the authorities still failed to give any solution for the issue.

“No trains will be operated starting from the Maradana railway station due to the strike,” he said.
