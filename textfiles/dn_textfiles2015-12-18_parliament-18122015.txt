Political hypocrisy root cause of many problems - Dilan
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera told the Parliament yesterday that political hypocrisy is a root cause of most problems prevailing in the country and it is our duty to banish the political hypocrisy and work towards the betterment of the country.
He said so joining the Committee Stage debate on Budget Proposals 2016 under the expenditure heads of the ministries referred to the Select Committee.
"The ordinary people have no communal feelings and it is the politicians who whip up racial feelings and create troubles. "This resulted in the making of ruthless terrorist leaders like Prabhakaran. Now the time has come for all to get together and find a solution to the national question.
"It was in response to such concern, that we brought new legislation, Penal Code Amendment Bill. According to this, it will not be possible to denigrate any religion, community or similar groups. All the people, specially the Tamils and Muslims who voted for this government are waiting until a solution to the national problem is found.
"They hope that this consensual government can achieve a full stop to communalism and the hypocrisy. Hereafter, the SLFP will not aligned itself with any communalist or extremist political party," Perera said.

JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday revealed in Parliament that Rs. 108.2 million had been spent for an NVQ certificate awarding ceremony organised by the National Apprenticeship and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) in 2014.

The MP said the ceremony was held to award certificates to 2,797 persons at Matara Uyanwatte Grounds on December 14, 2014 when the Presidential Election was at hand.
The MP said over Rs. one million had been spent to supply food while another Rs. 20 million was spent to purchase goods.
"Three dancing troupes had also taken part in it. When calculated, the government had spent Rs. 50,000 per person for the certificate awarding ceremony. Even the former NAITA Chairman was a coordinating secretary to former Minister Dullas Alahapperuma," he said.
At this point UPFA MP and former Youth Affairs and Skills Development Minister Dullas Alahapperuma refusing the charge, said that he had never appointed family members to any of the 18 institutions under his Ministry. "I have even not appointed a voter in Matara to any of them," he said.
MP Jayattisa said the total expenditure for a similar certificate awarding ceremony organised by the NAITA at Kurunegala Maligapitiya on August 2014 was Rs. 6.9 million. He said 500 persons working as masons participated in it.
He went on to reveal that the expenditure for a ceremony to lay the foundation stone for a NAITA Training Centre in Killinochchi on December 4, 2014 had been Rs. 4.6 million.
"Moreover, the Youth Affairs and Skills Development Ministry had spent Rs. 15.2 million for the Deyata Kirula exhibition in 2013. What was the benefit gained by the country by this spending? Parallel to this Exhibition, the ministry had distributed 500 sports kits spending Rs. 6.6 million. It had spent Rs. 2.5 million to fix a screen at the exhibition premises and another Rs. 3.1 million for a stall of the National Youth Corps," he added.
The MP said according to the audit reports, "VTA Private Holdings Limited" established under the Vocational Training Authority (VTA) during the former government contravenes the Act of 1995. He said this move had not received the Cabinet or Attorney General's approval approval. He said the salaries of the director board of this institution were decided arbitrarily by the Chairman.
Time allocation a decision of Speaker
It is useless to accuse the Opposition Leader or the Chief Opposition Whip over the matters of time allocation in Parliament as it was a decision by the Speaker, JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa said.
The MP made this observation while joining in the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2016, when the House took up the Expenditure Heads of nine ministries referred to the Select Committee.
Many government as well as Opposition MPs complained that they were not given a fair share of time to speak. As the House took up nine ministries together, the time was insufficient for members who took part in the debate as there was a lengthy list of speakers. Several in the UPFA Opposition group including MP Dullas Alahapperuma highlighted this fact demanding more time to speak.
MP Nalinda Jayatissa observing this fact noted that 65 percent of time is allocated for the government whereas the Opposition is given 35 percent of time as of a decision of the Speaker in accordance with Parliamentary traditions.
"The Opposition is consisted of TNA and JVP. If the UPFA group wants time allocated to the Opposition, they should officially declare that they will act as independent MPs in the Opposition," he stated.
MP Jayatissa commenting on the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry said all three languages - Sinhala, Tamil and English - should be treated equally as official languages. He noted Rs. 32.9 million of bills for transport, supplying food and other facilities for IIFA held in Sri Lanka in 2010 still remain unsettled.
"What is the benefit the tourism sector of the country received by holding it here? This money should be charged from the Rajapaksas," he added.
Mobile phone jamming equipment for prisons
Mobile phone jamming equipment will be installed in all prisons from next year to prevent the use of mobile phones by prisoners, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan said in parliament yesterday.
This will be a solution for inmates carrying out underworld operations using mobile phones smuggled into the prisons. The minister said that such jammers had already been installed at the Welikada Prison and the results were significant.
"The inmates at Welikada are now unable to control 'operations' outside as they did in the recent past. The successful outcome compelled the government to fix phone frequency jammers in all prisons," he said.
Responding to a question by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana, the minister said that jammers would be installed in all prisons from next year.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayuake said that there was a difficulty in making and receiving calls in the parliament building. There is no problem of the difficulty within the Chamber but connectivity should not be disturbed outside the chamber, the minister said.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said that he would bring the matter to the notice of the Speaker.

He was joining the Committee Stage debate on Budget Proposals 2016 under the expenditure heads of the ministries referred to the Select Committee.

Pension entitlement of 85 percent should cover all tri-forces personnel
The pension entitlement, upto a maximum of 85 percent, should be extended to the tri-force personnel who are not eligible for same, Parliamentary Reforms and Media Minister and Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilake said in Parliament yesterday.
The minister was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake under the Standing Order 23 (2) on December 1.
The minister observed that about 10,600 tri-forces personnel who have not completed five years' service in operational areas, are deprived of this entitlement. The pension entitlement upto a maximum of 85 percent was given after the war ended in 2009 for the tri-force personnel who retire after 22 years' service.
The minister noted that 6,975 persons in the Army, 748 in the Navy and 2,877 in the Air Force were deprived of this pension benefit.
"Some of them had not completed five years' operational service as they suffered injuries in the war. Even those who served at VIP security units, special duties, intelligence services and army medical units are deprived of this benefit.
"Those who retired before the declaration of operational areas in 1983 were also denied of it. Some who were injured during the anti-government riots in 1971 and 1988-89 are also not eligible for it. Even the tri-force personnel in supplying divisions involved in supplying food and arms, repairing machines and administrative work do not get this pension benefit as they do not have operational service experience. Those in intelligent units and army women's corp who provided yeoman service to apprehend the terrorists who were planning to attack VIPs, public and important places in the hill country, Western and Southern Provinces and other areas outside the operational areas are also denied of this benefit," he said. "The service personnel manning radar and air monitoring centres, who operated UAVs and counter-attacked the LTTE air strikes, are not entitled for this pension. Therefore it is suitable to consider extending this pension benefit even to them as they have provided yeoman and dedicated service during the war," the minister said.
