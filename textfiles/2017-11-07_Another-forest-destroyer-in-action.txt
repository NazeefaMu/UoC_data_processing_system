Another forest destroyer in action


	



A close kinsman of a leading political authority is reportedly cutting down a forest reserve and he has already put up a paving slab factory on a cleared patch which is ringed by a 15-ft high parapet wall.

A large part of the forest reserve has already been cut down and huge trees felled are seen strewn all over, they say.

Guards posted around the place do not allow any outsider to come close to the factory or the area where the forest cover is being cleared.

Police and the forest conservation authorities have so far failed to take action against the offenders, they say.
