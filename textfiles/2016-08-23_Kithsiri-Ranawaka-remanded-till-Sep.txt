Former Director of Tourism Development Authority, Kithsiri Ranawaka who was arrested by FCID over allocating Authority’s funds of Rs. 5.7 to an election promoting campaign during Uva Provincial Council Election in 2014, was today remanded till September 6 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.

The FCID alleged that the money was earlier reserved with the authorisation of the director board, in which the suspect was a member, to a project of protecting historical places in Sri Lanka in expectation of promoting tourism industry. However, the allocated money was not used to such tourism promotional project.

The prosecution said according to the statements recorded from witnesses in Authority, it had revealed that the money was used to SLFP election propaganda campaigns in Uva Province.

The prosecution charged the suspect under the public property act and penal code over committing criminal breach of trust. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
