Confidante failed to confide in him


	



 

A high political authority has reportedly developed a sudden antipathy towards a KKS whom he looked on as a close confidante for several years. 

 


The KKS who also served the political authority as a reliable informer as well, was in the habit of carrying tales about other employees to the boss.  Meanwhile, another office aide had informed the politico that his faithful KKS’ father successfully contested the recent mini-polls on the Pohottuwa ticket and the latter had expressed his surprise saying it was news to him.  The Ministry employees believe that the political authority had developed the sudden dislike to his erstwhile confidante as the latter had kept him in the dark about his father’s political connection to Pohottuwa. The KKS who is now being ignored by the political authority is about to be transferred out, say the employees.
