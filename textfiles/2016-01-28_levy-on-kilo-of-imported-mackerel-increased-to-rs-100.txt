Cabinet approval has been obtained to increase the trade levy on a kilo of Mackerel --being imported for the production of canned fish -- from Rs.50 a kilo to Rs.100 a kilo, Cabinet Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today.
The trade levy which was increased to Rs.100 a kilo in 2013 was reduced to Rs.50 last year.
However, the expected relief had not reached the consumers while the import of canned fish had increased to 40,000metric tons last year at a cost Rs.10 billion in foreign exchange.
