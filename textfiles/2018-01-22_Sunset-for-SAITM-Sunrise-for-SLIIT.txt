Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said yesterday that the government would close down the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and transfer all its students, the staff, assets and liabilities to an institution to be named ‘Sunset’.

Dr. de Silva told Daily Mirror that no more admissions would be allowed for the SAITM hereafter. Instead, he said the current students would be transferred to the new institution after all the batches transferred from SAITM pass out within a period of five years.

In addition, he said the government would establish yet another non-state, not for profit medical college affiliated to Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) next year. He said medical degrees would be offered here in conformity with standards stipulated by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).

The Deputy Minister said the government’s solution would address the two main concerns raised against SAITM. “One is with regards to the quality of the medical degree that is being offered. The other is profit making. We are now addressing both the concerns,” he said.

He said the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital would also be acquired by the government. “Its liabilities will be absorbed by the new institution. Additionally, its assets will be vested with the Health Ministry,” he said.(Kelum Bandara)
