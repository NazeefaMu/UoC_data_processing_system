The migrant workers, 100 female housemaids from Kuwait, 11 female housemaids and four men from Saudi Arabia, were living in safe houses provided by the embassies in both countries after they faced various issues at their work places.

Bureau Spokesman Madushan Kularathne said the workers had issues ranging from expired contracts, non- payment of wages and physical harassment in their place of employment.

The workers are from Gampaha, Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura and Trincomalee. (Piyumi Fonseka)
