I didn't refuse to give statement to CID: Dayasiri


	

UPFA MP Dayasiri Jayasekara today rejected allegations that he failed to report to the CID when first asked to do so.

The CID on Monday recorded a statement from the MP with regard to the allegation that he accepted money from a subsidiary of Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) owned by Arjun Aloysius. The CID also questioned him about his statement on the list of 118 members whom he alleged had received money from PTL.

“CID Director Shani Abeysekara requested me to give a statement on June 5 and I told him that I had not even received the ‘B report'. He was then agreeable to my coming on June 11," the MP said.

However, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Yasantha Kodagoda informed Court that he had not come to the CID to give a statement.

Responding to this, Mr. Jayasekara said, “The CID informed court that I promised to appear on Monday, which I did." (Darshana Sanjeewa)
