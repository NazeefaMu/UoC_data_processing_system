The water levels in the Kalu Ganga, Nilwala Ganga and Attanagalu Oya are rising as a result of the heavy rains in several parts of the country, the Disaster Management Centre said (DMC) today.

DMC spokesman Pradeep Kodippili said the water levels in the Kalu Ganga were on the verge of breaching its banks and as such those living in the vicinity were alerted to remain vigilant for any emergency situation that might arise.

The Meteorology Department said the highest rainfall of 115.3 mm was recorded from Hiniduma in the Galle District for the 24-hour period ending at 8.30 a.m.

It said heavy showers or thundershowers were reported from a few places in the Southern, Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. Fairly heavy showers or thundershowers were reported from several places in the Central Province.

Meanwhile the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) has issued a warning for the next 24 hours on the possibility of landslides, rocks falls, subsidence and cut slope failures since the bad weather conditions are expected to continue.

The NBRO had identified several administrative divisions in the districts of Kandy, Ratnapura, Nuwara-Eliya, Kegalle and Kalutra as vulnerable areas.(Chaturanga Pradeep)
