Rachel Raj Sparkles September

The Kingsbury High Tea monthly fashion show with a stunning collection by Rachel Raj was held on September 30 at The Cake. Designer Rachel Raj showcased her collection of luxe vintage and boho chic styles with luxury fabrics. The event once again received a great turnout with the some well-known movers and shakers of the Colombo social scene. The tremendous response received for this event is also due to the fantastic high tea buffet available at The Kingsbury High Tea at The Cake.
