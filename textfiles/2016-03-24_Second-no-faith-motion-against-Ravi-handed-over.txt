 The Joint Opposition today handed over the second no-confidence motion signed by 37 Parliamentarians against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.

Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane told journalists that the motion was handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.

“Parliament has lost faith in Minister Karunanayake as he had been misleading the MPs by making various statements," Mr. Gunawardane said while highlighting that there were numerous charges against the minister.

He also said a no confidence motion against Minister of Megalopolis Patali Champika Ranawaka whose vehicle had allegedly knocked a youth down in Welikada recently injuring him seriously, would be handed over soon. (Yohan Perera)
