The joint opposition has not invited the 16 SLFP ministers, who quit the government, to join its May Day rally in Galle, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.

“We did not invite them. We are not inviting any of them to join us as yet,” he said.

Mr. Rajapaksa told this to media after the commemoration ceremony for former minister T.B. Illangaratne in Colombo.
