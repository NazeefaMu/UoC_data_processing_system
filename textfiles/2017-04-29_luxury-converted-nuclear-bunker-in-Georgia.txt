Built entirely underground, it boasts three-foot-thick walls, a weapons room, a $100,000 CCTV system and even decontamination showers.


The converted bunker, situated near Savannah, Georgia, is also said to be able to survive natural disasters, civil disturbances and terrorist attacks. And, it could be yours - if you are willing to fork out a staggering $17.5million.


Built during the Cold War in 1969 by the Army Corps of Engineers, the bunker was fully renovated in 2012, bringing it up to government standards.The property last went on the market in 2015, and property records show it is still owned by the seller Bastion Holdings. It is currently the only privately-owned underground bunker of its kind in the United States, according to its listing. In addition to its ‘protection’ features - which also include air intake systems and a nurse’s room - the property contains more everyday elements. These include hot water, solar panels and humidity controls, says Bastion Holdings, which is selling the bunker. Constructed 45 feet below ground, on 32 acres of land, the home boasts two levels of living space, totaling around 14,000 square feet. Within this underground space, the second level features four luxury apartments, each approximately 600 square feet in size.


These contain their own kitchens, dining areas, two bedrooms, living rooms and bathrooms.
The first level, meanwhile, features a number of communal areas, such as a large home theater, a games room, a classroom and a workshop.It also has a separate staff quarters - should the buyer wish to employ.  Although the seller is looking for anyone who might want to a new, unique home, the bunker is also being advertised as a potential 
corporate retreat.


Alternatively, it could be used as a place to secure gold or other valuables, or as a training facility, according to its listing.


And it could even be the ultimate man cave for one lucky male.


Chris Salamone, co-owner of Bastion Holdings, a training company for government and security personnel, said: ‘We are living in an increasingly dangerous world. This property offers the ultimate safe haven for any family, business or government that wants the ultimate in security and comfort.
Martin McDermott, CEO of the company and a counter-terrorism, surveillance and communications expert, added: ‘This facility is impenetrable, while meeting the highest standards for quality, comfort and security. It is better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it.’


Bastion Holdings had previously used the property as a training facility for military and government personnel.


The firm cannot disclose the exact location of the home for safety reasons.
