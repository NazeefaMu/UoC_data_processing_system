Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said he had warned of an impending railway strike at the recent Cabinet meeting when Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera objected to the Cabinet proposal brought in to resolve the salary anomalies of the railway employees.

He told at the weekly Cabinet briefing that the Cabinet Paper to address the salary anomalies of the railway employees had been brought in long time ago but it was delayed due to the objection of the Finance Ministry. (Diana Udayangani)
