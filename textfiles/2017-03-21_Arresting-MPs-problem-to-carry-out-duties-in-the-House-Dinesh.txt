Arresting MPs; problem to carry out duties in the House: Dinesh


	

Joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane today informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that not giving bail to MPs who have been remanded has become a problem for those MPs to carry out their duties in the House.

Mr Gunawardhane actually requested the speaker to look into this matter.

He raised this matter in the House just less than 24 hours after courts decided to re-remand MP Wimal Weerawansha till April 13 this year. However Mr Gunawardhane did not name any MP when he made the request from the speaker.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who responded said he has already begun to discuss the issue with the relevant persons and assured that he will take necessary action this week. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
