Video: IUSF on protest march against privatizing free education


	

A massive protest march organised by the Inter-University Students’ Federation (IUSF) and HNDA students against the privatization of free education began from the Sri Jayewardenepura University in Nugegoda and ended outside the University Grants Commission (UGC) this evening.
Thousands of university students belonging to the IUSF joined the protest march which caused heavy traffic along the High-level Road and in Town Hall.
The protest march was not disrupted or dispersed by the police like what occurred last Thursday during the protest by HNDA students. Barricades were not seen either.
The protesting students sat on the road outside the UGC demanding for meeting with the officials. (Piyumi Fonseka and Darshana Sanjeewa)Video by Darshana Sanjeewa
