The 1864, which takes its name from the year in which four British investors set out to build the Galle Face Hotel to be the ‘finest hotel east of the Suez’, is a fine dining restaurant and wine cellar serving perfectly prepared modern European cuisine. The Sea Spray Restaurant located almost at the edge of the sea boasts stunning panoramic views of the Indian Ocean and a casual-chic setting that introduces an alfresco dining experience to Colombo, serving up traditional Sri Lankan seafood prepared in a variety of cooking styles.


Discussing the promotion Niluka Gunatilake, Head of Cards at Nations Trust Bank said,”When choosing a place to dine, the food is the most important factor but it isn’t the only one. The location is important, so is the ambiance, the service and atmosphere. Both of the restaurants featured in this offer deliver stunningly on all accounts. The food is fabulous and with the Galle Face Hotel (GFH) being a constant for over a century and a half. We’re happy to be able to provide cardmembers with this exclusive opportunity to save at both this iconic restaurants.”
