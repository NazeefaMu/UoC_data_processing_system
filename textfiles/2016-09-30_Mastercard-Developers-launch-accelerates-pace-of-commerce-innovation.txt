‘Mastercard Developers’ launch accelerates pace of commerce innovation


	

Mastercard makes it even easier for developers to create next-generation commerce solutions with the launch of Mastercard Developers.


This single gateway enables Mastercard partners to access a diverse range of application programming interfaces (APIs) across payments, data and security. The platform also includes a ‘New and Experimental’ API category that enables partners to test new technologies and applications.


The experimental APIs, developed at the company’s eight R&D Labs around the world, will help partners build, scale and enable payments on new platforms. At the same time, they will have a foundation to explore payments integration into new categories such as augmented reality, virtual reality and the Internet of Things.  


“We see Mastercard Developers as empowering our customers, partners and their developers in their efforts to innovate and grow their own businesses,” said Mastercard Senior Vice President APIs Oran Cummins. 


“The new platform will serve as a key way to integrate Mastercard technology and services into their digital solutions in an easy and cost-effective way. And, consumers will benefit from the simpler, faster and safer experiences driven by these efforts.” Partners now have access to more than 25 Mastercard APIs– including key services like Masterpass and Mastercard Digital Enablement Services– in a format they can more easily connect to and integrate with. Included in this is a new API that has been developed to maximize financial inclusion efforts. The Mastercard Aid Network helps to streamline aid distribution, even in the absence of telecommunications infrastructure, while providing more transparency to humanitarian organisations and non-profits.

 The new Mastercard Developers provides a streamlined experience and clear, developer-friendly documentation with APIs supported by software development kits (SDKs), developer tools and sample code for the top six programming languages. The platform has been growing and has seen a 400 percent increase in usage in the past year.
