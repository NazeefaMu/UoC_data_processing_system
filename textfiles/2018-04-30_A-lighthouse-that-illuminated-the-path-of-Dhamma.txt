Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde Ña<U+1E47>ananda Maha Thera

Most Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde Ña<U+1E47>ananda Maha Thera passed away in the early hours of this February 22 at the National Hospital Colombo. The prelate and his teachings – particularly his ground-breaking monograph, ‘Concept and Reality’, and the series of Nivane Nivima and Pahan Ka<U+1E47>uva Dharma Desana – hardly need any introduction. Having lived a life of study, meditation, and generous mentorship of generations of disciples in seclusion, shunning publicity, officialism and any private or public ceremonialism, it is challenging a task to talk and write about his life and passing away. 


As if words of commemoration and expressions of respect would intrude on the peace of death, paling away before the silence of cessation, Nirva<U+1E47>a, the venerable was relentlessly pointing at – papanca (prapañca) or proliferation, to borrow from one of the venerable’s favourite subjects of textual and contemplative scrutiny.   
Yet, on the occasion of Vesak, the observance of the Birth, Awakening and Parinirva<U+1E47>a of the Buddha, it feels apt to rejoice in the practice of one of his modern-day eminent disciples, the Bhikkhu Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde Ña<U+1E47>ananda.   




Bhikkhu Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde Ña<U+1E47>ananda is well-known for having broken new ground in the Sri Lankan intellectual and meditative landscape of the second half of the twentieth century into the early twenty-first century. He challenged the authoritative Ceylonese Theravada exegesis, stepping out of commentarial orthodoxy. Beyond that, although he never left the Island except for visiting India, his work has been very influential in Western Buddhist academia and among practitioners.   


Two eminent monks have accepted the invitation to recollect their Dhamma encounters with the late Maha Thera. The first voice to be heard is Ven. Uda Eriyagama Dhammajiva, the abbot and Chief Preceptor of Meetirigala Nissarana Vanaya and the second is that of a German-born bhikkhu and scholar, Ven. Analayo. Both monks have been disciples of the late Maha Thera, and have also known each other for over two decades. While today we are publishing the interview with Ven. Dhammajiva we will continue tomorrow with the one of Ven. Analayo.   


Ven.Uda Eriyagama Dhammajiva is a deeply practised meditator and meditation teacher. He ordained as a Buddhist monk thirty years ago (1998), receiving his higher ordination at the Sri Kalya<U+1E47>i Yogasrama Sa<U+1E43>stha, also known as the Galduwa Forest Tradition. Ven.Dhammajiva underwent training under the close guidance of Ven.Matara Sri Ña<U+1E47>arama Mahathera at Meetirigala Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya Forest Monastery. It was this place that saw the original delivery of the late Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde Ña<U+1E47>ananda Maha Thera’s sermons on Nibbana expounded to an audience of meditating monks intent on the attainment of awakening, in this life itself. Between 1988 and 1992 Ven. Dhammajiva’s mentor was none other than Ven.Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde Ña<U+1E47>ananda Maha Thera himself. Ven. Dhammajiva serves as the current abbot of Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya and has maintained a close relationship with the late Maha Thera up until the time of the latter’s passing away. Following are the excerpts of the interview with Ven.Uda Eriyagama Dhammajiva:-  



Q When and how did you first come into contact with the late Mahathera?


In 1987, maybe in August, soon after resigning from my job, while I was meditating in Nilambe, I came across two books, namely The Seven Stages of Purification and Freed Freedom (still unpublished at that time). Both bore the name of the most Ven. Matara Ña<U+1E47>arama Maha Thera from Meetirigala, Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya. Inspired by the pragmatic and practical way of presentation, it occurred to me to go and meet the venerable. So, together with Dr. Parakrama Fernando and Weerakoon, I visited Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya without a prior appointment. Dr. Fernando knew Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde Ña<U+1E47>ananda well. In this first meeting we had a long discussion and I came to know that both the above mentioned books are but his writings. 

 Q How would Ven. Katukurunde Ñandana relate to and teach his disciples and the younger monks at Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya? Would you perceive him mostly as a scholar-monk, as a meditating-monk, or as a monastic teacher? In which ways would the MahaaThera pass on his knowledge of Dhamma, Vinaya, meditation?


One year after I entered Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya as a lay meditator, I informed the Sa<U+1E45>gha that I felt ready for ordination and taking up a full-time meditation life. Ven. Matara Ña<U+1E47>arama sent me to Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde Ña<U+1E47>ananda as one among other candidates. He was not ready to impart teachings in a formal way. Instead, he asked that we candidates read the recommended books and allowed us to visit him for discussion once a week. We had to learn by heart some parts of the texts and he would make some occasional clarifications during these weekly discussions. The venerable Matara Ña<U+1E47>arama closely observed this process.   


He was serious about the monastic code pertaining to the novice as well as on Pali, the canonical language of the Suttas. 


He was my elder brother in my spiritual life. He readily took responsibilities regarding my life issues too. I used to tell him everything as he instructed without any reservation


 
One year and nine months later I took higher ordination and, basically, he was my mentor throughout. The procedure was rather informal as it had been earlier with my novice ordination and daily life in the monastery. Clarifications on the Vinaya – the code of rules for fully ordained monastics – were somewhat more of an intrinsic process, more aimed at examining it for the purpose of living the life of a meditating forest monk. The lived forest tradition was often emphasized as opposed to mere book knowledge.   

Q How has the late Mahaa Thera’s mentorship influenced your spiritual life?


It was all about the monk-hood and the Dhamma-Vinaya. That appeared as the only way, without an alternative, for a forest monk inclined to meditation. No one in the monastery would interfere in our relationship, and everyone instead appreciated having such a teacher. Occasionally Godwin Samararatne and others from Nilambe would pay a visit to the Maha Thera, and they would always visit me too. They expressed full appreciation of the way things were happening there. Likewise, I too took this mentorship as a blessing.   

 



Nissarana Vanaya

 

QCould you say something about the overall impact of the late MahaaThera’s presence and teachings during the years he spent at Nissarana Vanaya and afterwards? What was his relationship to the monastic institution?


He was my elder brother in my spiritual life. He readily took responsibilities regarding my life issues too. I used to tell him everything as he instructed without any reservation. My brother-in-law passed away and I immediately went to his ku<U+1E6D>i and informed him. He asked me not to start getting into the habit of visiting relatives, even in such a situation, for example. Totally agreed! He asked me to not to make myself exposed unnecessarily to worldly matters. I had no objection to his opinions. Then my mother passed away. Ven. Matara Ña<U+1E47>arama Maha Thera recommended I take part in the funeral accompanied by my mentor, Ven. Nanananda. He “conditioned” me, so to say, before visiting my village and covered me over as if guarding me all the way through till the end of the funeral, then took me back and reported the situation to Ven. Matara Ña<U+1E47>arama Maha Thera as my elder brother.   


Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde Ña<U+1E47>ananda considered the monastic life as precious. If you adhere to it there won’t be any unwanted relational or social problem. Life will be 
simple as a monk.

   Q In a nutshell, what do you see as the core legacy of the late MahaaThera for present and future generations of monastic and lay practitioners?


My understanding of the spiritual life took place and sank in quite gradually with the following key aspects: 1) meditation; 2) strict observance of the monastic rules; 3) least possible amount of worldly activities and avoidance of ceremonies and public events as much as possible; 4) the value of a simple life; 5) an immediate relationship with spiritual friends or teachers.   


During my period of association with the venerable Maha Thera, I could also see his development and improvements due to our interactions and sharing in the monastery. That can be seen when comparing the series of Pahan Ka<U+1E47>uva Desana with the Nivane Nivima Desana. When delivering the sermons on Nivane Nivima, he used to give me the gist of the upcoming sermon just before teaching, and my mind, accordingly, was already prepared for the sermon. Later, having the recordings of the talks and typing them with a typewriter gave me the opportunity of a closer relationship to him. It was a rare thing to have in a monk’s life like mine. All of these good things were received in actions in the field rather than in classroom lessons of theory. The prelate’s large array of skills were being transmitted to us in every possible way, and he considered it as a duty to the Sasana. 

 
The books, sermons and his own translations of the Pali Suttas offered abundant wide openings for the future generations, and the untiring way in which he did it was phenomenal. In addition to Pali, Sinhala and English, he was also fluent in Sanskrit and familiar with Madhyama works and Mahayana texts and doctrines elaborating on the key themes of emptiness (sunyata) and proliferation (prapañca) among others. I was lucky enough to witness all closely, even after he left Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya. Ven. Analayo and I sometimes joined in sharing the Maha Thera’s teachings deeply with the help of other available literature as Ven. Analayo was also doing his PhD.   


To conclude, the late Maha Thera’s leaving Polgasduwa Island Hermitage in 1972 opened a new chapter in the contemporary history of the Theravada tradition, and the Maha Thera’s departing from Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya in 1994 opened the accessibility of his service to the society at large, though it affected his health somewhat badly.
