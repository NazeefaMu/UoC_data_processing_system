Celebrating the true spirit of Sinhala and Tamil Aluth Avurudu, Bank of Ceylon (BOC) wishes to demonstrate its appreciation of Sri Lankan traditional customs by conducting traditional Avurudu ganu denu with all its customers on Saturday, April 15, 2017.
All BOC branches will be kept open from 8:30 a.m. till 3:00 p.m. on this day.
Whilst conducting Avurudu ganu denu with the most trusted bank in your neighbourhood, BOC invites all its customers to come with their families to join the celebration of this tradition and enjoy the Avurudu table with its traditional refreshments arranged specially for them.
Concerned with preserving national traditions, the bank wishes to encourage every Sri Lankan including the bank staff members to celebrate Sinhala and Tamil Avurudu more meaningfully with their families during the New Year auspicious times that fall on April 14.
BOC has lined up a special gift scheme for all children encouraging them to cultivate the habit of thrift during this special season where special customs, celebrations and good deeds come into the limelight. Gifts will be given for savings made into BOC Ran Kekulu Ginum accounts.  
A child below 10 years is entitled for a snakes and ladders set for deposit between Rs.1000 and Rs.4999, a block puzzle for a deposit between Rs.5000 and Rs.24,999, a building block pack for a deposit between Rs.25,000 and Rs.49,999 and a gift parcel, which includes a picture dictionary, remote controlled car and a musical doll for any deposit over Rs.50,000.
As for a child over 10 years of age, any deposit between Rs.1000 and Rs.4999 will be entitled for a Oxford mathematical instrument box, a badminton racket set for a deposit between Rs.5000 and Rs.24,999, a table tennis racket set for Rs.25,000 and Rs.49,999 and a gift pack that includes a dictionary, a calculator and table lamp for a deposit over Rs.50,000.
BOC will keep this offer open through its islandwide branch network until stocks last. Customers can enjoy this special Avurudu gifts by opening a new Ran-Kekulu account or depositing money to an existing account at any BOC branch. Saving with BOC Ran Kekulu children’s savings account does much more than bringing seasonal gift schemes. It can enrich the life of your child in a more meaningful way. For every saving that you do with a BOC Ran Kekulu account, the bank provides an additional 1 percent interest than to a normal account. 
This account is also linked with free life insurance cover for the parent or guardian to a maximum of Rs.500,000 (minimum balance of Rs.5000 to be maintained for a period of six months prior to the incident). Any parent or guardian who opens BOC Ran Kekulu accounts for more than one child will be covered up to a maximum of Rs.1.0 million. 
The child will also get a free medical insurance cover up to Rs.100,000 per-annum in case of an accident or specified 10 critical illnesses requiring hospitalization in a private hospital for more than one night or three nights in a government hospital, the child is entitled to receive Rs.600 per day up to a maximum of 30 days only.
