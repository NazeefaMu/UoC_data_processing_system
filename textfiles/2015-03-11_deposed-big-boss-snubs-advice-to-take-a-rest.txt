Deposed Big Boss snubs advice to take a rest


	


	
	A provincial council member active in Samurdhi affairs recently had a one-on-one chat with the new Big Boss.

He took advantage of this opportunity to explain to the new Big Boss how easy it would be for the Blues to win the upcoming general elections if they could enlist the support of the deposed Big Boss.
The new Big Boss looked annoyed. “You ask your former Boss to take a rest at home,” he told the provincial politico. “You also advise him to tell the country loud and clear that he has retired from politics.” His voice took a sad note as he added: “He will be in trouble if he disregards this piece of advice.”
The provincial politico dutifully conveyed this message to the deposed Big Boss. Greeting the message with a derisive laughter, the deposed Big Boss remarked: “Our party is not anybody’s heirloom. I too have as much a stake in the party as any other person. Let us wait and see how things will turn out.”
