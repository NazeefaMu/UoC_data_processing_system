HINDUSTAN TIMES, 22nd MARCH, 2018- Maldives President Abdulla Yameen on Thursday lifted a 45-day state of emergency which had outlawed protests amid political upheaval on the Muslim-majority Indian Ocean island chain.


Yameen imposed the emergency on February 5 for 15 days after a Supreme Court ruling quashed convictions against nine opposition leaders and ordered his government to free those held in prison.
He extended the state of emergency by another 30 days with parliament approval, a move challenged by the opposition.
