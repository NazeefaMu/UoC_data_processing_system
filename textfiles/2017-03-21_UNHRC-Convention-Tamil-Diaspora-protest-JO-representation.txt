The Tamil Diaspora in Switzerland has held several protests against the joint opposition (JO) delegation attending the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Convention in Geneva.

Speaking to Daily Mirror from Geneva, JO member former Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara said several persons from the Diaspora community in Switzerland scoffed at him during an event he took part in.

“They accused me of war crimes. Most of the locals living in Switzerland were disturbed to see us. They even grilled the UNHCR officials as to why we were entertained as a part of the convention,” Mr. Weerasekara said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
