The woman human resource head of a recently closed company that belonged to a leading businessman with high political connections had asked all employees to hand their resignations,  they say.

 


The lady high-up had told the employees to hand their resignation letters as the company was already closed adding that action was being taken to release their held up January pay.  All employees had reportedly demanded in one voice that they be paid compensation for loss of employment, putting foot down that they would not resign 
their jobs.


The lady high-up who was a close friend of the company owner had replied: “I am quite helpless. Bigwigs are in jail now.  I too am going from pillar to post these days in search of a job!”
