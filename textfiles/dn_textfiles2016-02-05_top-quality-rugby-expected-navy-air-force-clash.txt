Top quality rugby expected in Navy-Air Force clash

 
Some top quality rugby can be expected to be dished out by both Air Force and Navy when they lock horns in their second round Dialog inter-club 'A' division league rugby tournament match at the Air Force Sports Complex, Ratmalana at 4 pm today.
This will be the sailors' third second round game and at present they are placed behind Kandy, Havelock's and CR and FC.
Navy who suffered two shock defeats when they went down to a rejuvenated Police side by 11-16 and to high-riding CR and FC 25-27 at their own den in Welisara, came back with all guns blazing to hold the formidable Havelock's outfit to a surprising 20-all draw at Havelock Park last week.
Also, Navy who occupy fourth spot will be sans their think-tank and mentor Yoshitha Rajapaksa for this game against Air Force.
Navy captained by Danushka 'Gertha' Perera have players of the class of national caps hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe, second row Sathya Ranatunga and number eight Sajith Saranga.
Navy knows that losing another game could mean the end of the road for their league title hopes, so they will come out with their best outfit, with playmakers Chanaka Chandimal and speedy winger Heshan Maduranga returning to the side after being rested last week against the Havies.
Air Force whose only win has been against bottom ranked CH and FC lost against Army 17-26 last week after a tremendous fight back. They are packed with some outstanding players but they need to minimize their errors and get their act together if they are to pull off a victory against the formidable Navy outfit. Air Force have in their ranks some great players in the caliber of skipper cum second row Kulukulasuriya, playmaker and full back Nuwan Perera, hard running centre Chamod Fernando, fly half Iddamalgoda and number eight Jero Dananjaya in their ranks. All of them are gifted players with immense of talent.
At present Navy occupy fourth spot and Kandy SCports Club, who holds the first slot and are the reigning league champions. -WAI
