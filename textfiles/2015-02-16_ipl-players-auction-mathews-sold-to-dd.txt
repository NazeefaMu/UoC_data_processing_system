	Delhi Daredevils, who have the largest purse of Rs 39.75 crore among all the eight franchises taking part in the auction, bought Sri Lankan captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews for Indian Rs 7.5 crore, the third highest price in the first two rounds of IPL 8 players' auction.
	Flamboyant all-rounder Yuvraj Singh emerged as the costliest cricketer in the auction, bought for a record Rs 16 crore (USD 2.57 million approx) by Delhi Daredevils.
	RCB, who lost to DD in their bid to get Yuvraj and Mathews, bought wicketkeeper batsman Dinesh Karthik for Rs 10.5 crore, the second highest price, even though it was Rs 1.5 crore lower than the amount he was bought for by DD last year.
	Surprisingly, former England captain Kevin Pietersen, who was bought for Rs 9 crore last year by DD, could get just Rs 2 crore as he was sold to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the base price.
	     
	Other players sold in the auction were India Test opener Murali Vijay for Rs 3 crore (to KXIP), leg-spinner Amit Mishra (Rs 3.5 crore by DD), Aaron Finch (Rs 3.2 crore by Mumbai Indians), Eoin Morgan (Rs 1.5 crore by MI) and Kane Williamson (Rs 60 lakh by SRH).
