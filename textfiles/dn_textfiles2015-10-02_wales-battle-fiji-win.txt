Wales battle to Fiji win

Gareth Davies guided Wales to a nail-biting 23-13 victory over Fiji on Thursday to pile the pressure on Pool A rivals Australia and England.
Even though there was no bonus, the win was the third for Warren Gatland's Welsh team after having beaten Uruguay 54-9 and England 28-25. It left them on top of the "Pool of Death" on 13 points ahead of Australia (9) and England (6).
Wales will be virtually guaranteed one of the two qualifying spots for the quarter-finals along with Australia if the Wallabies beat England on Saturday.
But Fiji made it so hard for Wales at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, the home side failing to convert overwhelming first-half domination of territory and possession into points.
The Pacific islanders rallied impressively at scrum-time and in the loose, capitalising on very poor out-of-hand kicking by Wales.
But Wales captain Sam Warburton savoured the exhausting win.
"That was so tough," said Wales captain Sam Warburton. "The first half, I was knackered."
"But we have got three wins out of three. If someone had told us that at the start of the campaign we'd bite your hand off."
Wales scored two first-half tries through man of the match Davies and Scott Baldwin. Fly-half Dan Biggar kicked two conversions and three penalties.
Costly misses
Ben Volavola kicked two penalties for Fiji after Wales scrum infringements and despite losing influential scrum-half Nikola Matawalu to injury and giant goal-kicking winger Nemani Nadolo to a ban, crossed for one try through Vereniki Goneva.
There was an electric start to the game, the Welsh camping out in the Fijian 22 metre area and both sides playing harum-scarum rugby to the delight of the 71,000 crowd. AFP
