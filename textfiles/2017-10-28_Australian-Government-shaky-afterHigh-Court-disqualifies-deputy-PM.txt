Australian Government shaky afterHigh Court disqualifies deputy PM


	

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and four other federal politicians with foreign citizenship issues have been sensationally disqualified from Parliament.   


The bombshell High Court ruling has triggered a by-election in his electorate of New England after the court on Friday found his New Zealand citizenship disqualified him.   


A by-election loss would leave Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull with a minority government for the first time since 2016.   


‘The business of government goes on,’ he said.The Prime Minister is due to fly out of Australia later on Friday to attend the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Beersheba in Israel, and make a flying visit to Sri Lanka on the way back.   


He did not indicate who would be acting prime minister in his absence.   


Mr Turnbull said he was ‘obviously disappointed’ with the court’s ruling, despite his smiling expression while giving a brief statement to media.   The prime minister quickly walked away from reporters and refused to answer additional questions.   Mr Joyce’s deputy Fiona Nash, One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts and former Greens senators Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters were also ruled ineligible by the High Court after months of debate.
