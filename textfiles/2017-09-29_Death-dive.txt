An extremely lucky dolphin has been photographed miraculously surviving an attack by a killer whale. The deadly predator misses by inches when it strikes with ferocious power at the helpless dolphin - but the would-be meal instead bounces off its mouth.

The speed of the orca's strike sends the bottlenose dolphin flying high into the air, before it dives serenely back into the water.

The incredible images perfectly capture the immense power of the deadly underwater hunter, which made several unsuccessful attempts to catch the dolphin.

These remarkable pictures were taken off the coast of Baja in California. (Daily Mail)
