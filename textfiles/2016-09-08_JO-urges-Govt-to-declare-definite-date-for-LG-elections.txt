The Joint Opposition today urged the Government to declare a definite date to hold the local government election despite making contradictory statements.

Addressing a media briefing, Joint Opposition MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said President Maithripala Sirisena had once stated that the local government election would be held on January 12 even though subject Minister Faiszer Musthapha had stated that it would be held in February.

“It is evident from these contradictory statements that the Government is not keen on holding the local government election as they fear that they would be defeated in the election. The people are losing faith in the Government with these contradictory statements,” he added.

He said the Joint Opposition would declare from which party they would participate in the local government election with the public’s recommendation, once the date of the nominations is announced.

Meanwhile, he said the assault on Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner Ibrahim Ansar at Kuala Lumpur on Sunday was well calculated incident though some parties’ attempted to interpret it as an isolated incident.

He said the Joint Opposition condemned the assault on Mr. Ansar and the Sri Lankan Government should be more responsible while handling such issues in the future.

“The Government's unacceptable process which continues as the reconciliation has worsened these issues to the extent that we have lost its control,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
