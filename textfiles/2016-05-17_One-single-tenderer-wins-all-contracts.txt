One single tenderer wins all contracts


	

The authorities wanted to procure an assortment of goods for a state-run institution concerned with vocational training and invited separate competitive bids for four categories of items from prospective suppliers.




 Tenders from a number of suppliers were received, duly processed and finally – believe it or not - the contracts worth a total of Rs.386 million awarded to one and the same tenderer -- a certain firm. 
An individual who functioned as the head of a leading state-owned bank during the previous regime is said be to having close ties with this firm that successfully tendered for the lucrative supply contract and part of the earnings of this firm is reportedly being utilized to finance a political grouping led by some prominent figures of the previous regime, they say. 


Meanwhile, complaints have been made that the goods supplied by the firm are sub-standard and are not supplied on time either. The political authority handling the subject has appointed a particular secretary to inquire into these complaints despite there being clear evidence that he was the main figure behind the rigging of the tender procedure, they say.
