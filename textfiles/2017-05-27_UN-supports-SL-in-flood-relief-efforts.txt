The UN agencies including UNICEF, WHO and WFP are currently supporting Sri Lankan Government’s relief efforts in coordination and mobilizing resources, the UN Sri Lanka said today.

The UN received an initial request from the Government on Friday related to search and rescue efforts. 

Issuing a statement, it said the UNICEF will donate water containers, water purification tablets and tarpaulin sheets to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC). 

The WHO will be supporting the Ministry of Health to deploy medical teams to the affected districts. 

The WFP and UNDP are supporting the DMC with information management. 

The UN OCHA will provide additional human resources for coordination with Government and Humanitarian Partners. 

Search and Rescue efforts are on standby from neighbouring countries and can be deployed if needed.
 
Heavy rain and strong winds is forecast to continue into the first week of June, raising the risk that current conditions may worsen with land access to many affected areas restricted due to water inundation and landslides.

The UN stressed the importance of following evacuation orders to minimize loss of human life.
