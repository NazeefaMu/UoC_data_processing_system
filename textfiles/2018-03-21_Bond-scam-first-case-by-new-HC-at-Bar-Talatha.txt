Bond scam - first case by new HC-at-Bar: Talatha


	

The bond scam could be the first case to be heard by the new High Court-at-Bar which the government intends to set up, Minister of Justice Talatha Athukorala told Parliament yesterday.

“Some MPs have talked much about the bond scam and what I could say that this could be the first case which the new high courts could hear,” Ms Athukorala said.

She said the government is not prepared to follow wrong precedents created by the last regime and drag people to jail. The Minister said that this is the answer the government could give to those who question on the action it had taken to curb corruption. “We will always do things within a legal framework,” she said.

The Minister said some people are so ignorant that they think the Minister of Justice could get involved in court cases when a number of such cases are given to her. “Some MPs came up with some case numbers today and I would say that they hardly know the duties and functions of Justice Minister. Minister’s job is not getting involved in court cases and could manipulate them,” she said. (Yohan Perera)
