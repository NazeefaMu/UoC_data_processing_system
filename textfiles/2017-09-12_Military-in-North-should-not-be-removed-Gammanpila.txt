Responding to a statement made by Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran on Sunday, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila said the security forces in the North should not be removed following some logical conclusions.

Addressing a news briefing, he stated that it was too early and risky to remove military personnel from the Northern Province as it was just eight years had passed since the war was ended.

“I don’t fathom on account of which grounds the Chief Minister has made such a formidable statement which might even affect the security of the country,” he stressed.

He proceeded to say that as a country which had been embroiled in a civil war, is not ready to confront with another civil war.

"Therefore, we as PHU are opposed to remove defence personnel from the North and request the government to take prompt steps to prevent from removing military personnel from the North," he said.

Meanwhile, he asked why the President and the Prime Minister are silent on the controversial statements made by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.

“We have a reasonable suspicion that the President and the Prime Minister are deliberately neglecting to come out with any remarks on the statements made by Sarath Fonseka.We urge the President to interfere into this case and take instant actions to arrest and sack him from his ministerial portfolio as soon as possible,” Mr. Gammanpila added.
