Officers in charge of these centres said that some 130,243 families of 670 Grama Seva Divisions were badly affected by the prevailing drought.

It was revealed that more than 125,000 people had been affected in the Jaffna District, about 85,000 in the Mannar District, 80,000 in the Kilinochchi District, 75,000 in Mullaitivu District and more than 85,000 in the Vavuniya District. (By Romesh Madushanka)
