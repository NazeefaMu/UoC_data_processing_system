Parliament yet to receive judgment on Geetha


	

The judgment to annul MP Geetha Kumarasinghe's Parliamentary post had not been officially conveyed to Parliament yet, Deputy Secretary General of Parliament Neil Iddawala said yesterday.

He said they would forward the judgment to the Elections Commission once they received it and the Elections Commission would take further action.

“The Elections Commission will Gazette the person who is next on the list. Once it is Gazetted, he or she would take oath as an MP,” he said.

Mr Iddawala said they had earlier informed the Appeal Court decision on Ms Kumarasinghe’s MP post to the Elections Commission but that decision was stayed after she appealed against the verdict.

The Supreme Court yesterday upheld the decision of the Appeal Court to annul MP Geetha Kumarasinghe's Parliamentary post as she was a dual citizenship holder. (Ajith Siriwardana)
