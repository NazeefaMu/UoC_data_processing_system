The Court of Appeal today acquitted and released former UPFA Mawanella Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman K. G. Piyatissa, who was sentenced to death for committing a murder at Belimulla, Mawanella.
Former Mawanella Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman K. G. Piyatissa was found guilty of the murder of a person by shooting and was sentenced to death by Kegalle High Court in 2013.
He was indicted for having committed the murder of Kuduralage Kapila Priyantha Padmakumara, 32, on February 12, 2003 by shooting him opposite his home at Belimulla, Mawanella.
The Attorney General indicted him before the Kegalle High Court following the non-summary inquiry held at the Mawanella Magistrate’s Court.
The accused had filed a Leave to Appeal application before Court of Appeal challenging the order of the High Court to convict him for murder and imposing the death sentence.
Counsel for the Accused-Appellant challenged that prosecution had not proved the identity of the accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
They submitted that upon conclusion of the evidence in chief accused was subjected to cross examination by the prosecution after which defence counsel made an application to summon some other witnesses to testify on behalf of the defence.
They stated that this was not allowed by trial judge and matter was fixed for judgment.
The Court of Appeal having considered the submissions of the Counsel for the Accused-Appellant acquitted and released Piyatissa. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
