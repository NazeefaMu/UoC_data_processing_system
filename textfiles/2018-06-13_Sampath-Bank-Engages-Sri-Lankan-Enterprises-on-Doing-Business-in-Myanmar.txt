The event also included a panel discussion on educating and raising awareness about the market with Mr. Mariano Suariz, Mr. Nanda Fernando, members of the Bank’s corporate management team, and Mr. LakkhanaGunaratne, Manager, Myanmar Representative Office, Sampath Bank PLC as the panelists.
 
The event is part of Sampath Bank’s ongoing efforts to support Sri Lankan businesses with current or planned investments in Myanmar, a market where the Bank has been operating a representative office since October 2015. The Bank’s Foreign Currency Banking Unit (FCBU) helps facilitate finances for these business entities and also provides financial services to other local and international enterprises. In 2017, Sampath Bank concluded a loan transaction with Yangon based hotel developer Family Business Group Hotel Limited (FBGHL), creating history as the first Sri Lankan bank to have closed such a large value transaction in Myanmar.
 
Working together with the FCBU, the representative office plays an advisory role too, offering assistance with regulatory and legal clearances, from incorporation to growing the business, for existing and potential Sri Lankan investors in the market. The team also helps connect business people from both countries with the aim of facilitating mutually beneficial relationships.
