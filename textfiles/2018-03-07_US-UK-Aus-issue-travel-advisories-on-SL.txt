The United States, Britain and Australia had issued travel advisories regarding Sri Lanka, following the violence in the Kandy District and the declaration of State of Emergency for a period of one week.

The US State Department advised US citizens to monitor local media updates as further incidents could occur in the next few days.

“The Sri Lankan Government declared a State of Emergency and curfews have been imposed in some regions, including Kandy Administrative District, due to communal unrest. Further incidents possible over the next few days. Monitor local media for updates,” the US State Department tweeted.

The UK Foreign Office advised British citizens to exercise caution, avoid protests and rallies and comply with local security requirements.

“The Sri Lankan government announced a nationwide state of emergency in response to recent incidents of inter-communal violence in Ampara and Kandy. The state of emergency may include curfews in specific locations across the country. You should exercise caution, avoid protests and rallies, and comply with local security requirements,” the foreign office stated.

The Australian Foreign Ministry requested the Australian travellers to avoid protests and large public gatherings as they have the potential to turn violent and exercise normal safety precautions while in Sri Lanka.

“The Sri Lankan Government declared a nationwide State of Emergency for 10 days due to incidents of communal unrest. Avoid protests and large public gatherings as they have the potential to turn violent.

Monitor local media and follow instructions issued by local authorities. The level of our advice has not changed. Exercise normal safety precautions in Sri Lanka,” it said.
