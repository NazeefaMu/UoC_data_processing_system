Debate no-faith motion against Rajitha before Budget: JO


	

Joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane said yesterday the no-confidence motion submitted in parliament against Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne should be taken up for debate before the budget even at a special parliamentary session.

He said a no-faith motion should be given priority according to Parliament Standing Orders.

"This matter has been discussed at several meetings of party leaders and was included in the order paper as well as such it should be taken for debate before the budget, if necessary by even convening a special parliamentary session," he said.

MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said it was House Leader Lakshman Kiriella who was not allocating a date for the debate.

Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said Mr. Kiriella was delaying to fix a date for the debate saying related matters have been mentioned in several court cases.

He said it was only mentioned with regard to some details being asked for in a court case.

"It is a wrong argument. It is sufficient to submit a no-faith motion if he had neglected to submit details required in a court case," Mr. Dissanayake said and added that the no-faith motion was included in the order paper after making necessary amendments on the advice of the Attorney General.
