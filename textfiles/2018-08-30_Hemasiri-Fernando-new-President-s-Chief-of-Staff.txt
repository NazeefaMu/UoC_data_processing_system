People’s Bank Chairman Hemasiri Fernando is likely to be appointed as the new Chief of Staff of the Presidential Secretariat next week.

Sources at the Presidential Secretariat said the President will appoint Mr. Fernando as his Chief of Staff, in addition to his current post as the Chairman of the People’s Bank.

The post of the Chief of Staff of the Presidential Secretariat had fallen vacant since the arrest of I.H.A. Mahanama, who is currently in remand custody over bribery and corruption charges.
