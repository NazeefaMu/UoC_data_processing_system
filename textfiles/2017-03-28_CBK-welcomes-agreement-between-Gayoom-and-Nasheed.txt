The Full statement issued by the Office of Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga

We, in Sri Lanka, welcome the Agreement arrived at by the Political Parties of two former Presidents, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and Mohamed Nasheed and two other Opposition Parties, to work together to ensure democratic Governance and the guarantee of civil and political rights to the citizens of the Maldives, to carry on a struggle for good Governance and to build a lasting peace in the country.
 
Sri Lanka and the Maldives have enjoyed an abiding and close relationship for many centuries.
 
I believe that our countries, afflicted by conflict, need to build a united front of all Political and Civil Society groups in our struggle against poverty and ignorance and for a just and equitable society and honest and fair governance.
 
We have confidence that President Abdulla Yameen and the Government of the Republic of Maldives will extend their fullest support to the enterprise of strengthening democracy, democratic institutions and fundamental freedoms in the Maldives.
