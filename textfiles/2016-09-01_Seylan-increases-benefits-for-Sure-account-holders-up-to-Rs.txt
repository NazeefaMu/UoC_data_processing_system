In a revolutionary industry breakthrough, Seylan Bank has relaunched its popular customer loyalty scheme ‘Seylan Sure’, to deliver the highest possible benefits to its customers. Seylan bank pioneered in introducing this loyalty scheme for savings and current account holders, which has now evolved to be the benchmark of the industry. 
Seylan Sure ensures definite gifts for accountholders; it also offers the most affordable deposit slabs, yet another groundbreaking initiative by the bank. These benefits are provided in addition to the interest of your savings account. The maximum grant amount has now been increased from Rs.15,000 to Rs.200,000 for savings and current account holders, both joint and personal.
Seylan Bank further upholds its legacy of being the pioneering entity in the country’s banking industry to introduce a reward scheme to the public, as opposed to the practice that prevailed of offering gifts in a draw. The bank offers definite cash grants and gifts to mark important milestones in the lives of customers. The existing reward categories, which include marriage, childbirth, surgery and 60th birthday, have been expanded further to include customers whose children have passed the Grade Five scholarship, O/L and A/L examinations and the occasion of the 10th wedding anniversary. 
In the event of a surgery, the benefit to a customer is Rs.200,000. Catering to every stage in the customer’s life cycle, Seylan Sure is an undeniably value product for every customer. In enhanced amounts for new categories, customers’ children passing the Grade Five scholarship exams will receive Rs.50,000, as well as students who have passed their O/L with 8As and A/L with 3As. Further, a cash gift of Rs.50,000 will be awarded to customers celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary.
Commenting on the exciting new Seylan Sure scheme, Seylan Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing and Personal Banking Tilan Wijeyesekera said, “We are delighted to relaunch Seylan Sure with breakthrough benefits in the industry. By increasing the value of the cash gifts awarded to account holders from Rs.15,000 previously to Rs.200,000 today, we provide the highest value and benefits to our customers. Furthermore, we have even expanded the eligibility of the categories to enable a greater proportion of customers to enjoy these rewards. Seylan Bank has consistently devised innovative products to inculcate the savings habit amongst citizens and the new unmatched benefits offered by Seylan Sure will go a long way in rewarding our customers and meeting their aspirations.” 
The relaunch of Seylan Sure is aimed at meeting the new and evolving aspirations of customers while expanding gift eligibility categories, so that Seylan Bank customers can benefit from a loyalty scheme that offers them immense value.
