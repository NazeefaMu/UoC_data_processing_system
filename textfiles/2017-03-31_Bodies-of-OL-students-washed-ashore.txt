Tangalle police said the bodies were washed ashore 25 hours after they drowned.

They said the victims Janith Ishan Lakshitha and Muditha Dilshan had gone for a swim with another friend to celebrate their success at the GCE Ordinary Level Examination.

The remains were sent to the Judicial Medical Officer of the Hambantota hospital for further investigations.

A third child who had accompanied the unfortunate children had managed to escape the tragedy.

The relatives of the children had lodged a complaint with the police as they did not return home last afternoon. (Ariyadasa Kodithuwakku and Chandrasena Gamage)
