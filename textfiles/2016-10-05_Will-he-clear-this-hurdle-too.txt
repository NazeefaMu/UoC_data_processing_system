Will he clear this hurdle too?


	



 

The entourage that accompanied the Big Boss to the UN in the land of Uncle Sam recently included a media consultant well known for his ‘staying power’ unaffected by regime change. By the way, his name is also mentioned in connection with various business deals, they say.

 


The authorities in the highest echelons have now ordered an inquiry into a complaint that this media consultant had brought discredit to the country by moving about half-naked in the high-end hotel where the country’s delegates were accommodated. Even hotel employees had complained to a member of the country’s delegation that our man’s behaviour was unbecoming of a guest attending the UN general assembly.


The consultant is expected to face a high-level inquiry into his conduct shortly, they say.
