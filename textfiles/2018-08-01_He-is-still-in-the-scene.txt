He is still in the scene!


	

This worthy, head of an institution-related to higher education has been sent on compulsory leave following serious sleaze charges preferred against him.




However, thanks to the strong political pull he enjoys, this person continues to haunt his office to meddle with administrative matters, they say.


Taking advantage of his access to official documents, he has reportedly served back-dated transfer orders on five employees who had been instrumental in uncovering some of his frauds and corrupt deals.


One of the charges made against this institutional head says that he had awarded a janitorial services contract to a firm he himself owns without following the tender procedure.
