Back in his element, he plans to fly high again!


	

<U+200B>This one time confidant of the former royal family who by his questionable conduct contributed a generous share towards the downfall of their regime – believe it or not – has now become the blue-eyed boy of the yahapalanaya as well.
This former Diyawanna member achieved this new status by spilling the beans about the past doings of the former royal family, they say. His yahapalanaya detractors were once gunning for him giving him no quarter. But they too seem to be going soft on him these days, they say. By the way, this one time high flyer has not stopped at making his way into the good books of yahapalanaya high ups. A born gold digger, he is back in his element and is about to go into a multi-billion venture with a sibling of a powerful political authority as his partner, they say.
