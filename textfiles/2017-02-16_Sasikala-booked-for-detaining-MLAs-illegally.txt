THE HINDU, 15th FEBRUARY, 2017- The Kancheepuram police has booked AIADMK interim general secretary V.K. Sasikala and newly-elected AIADMK legislature party leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami for allegedly detaining party MLAs illegally at Golden Bay resort in Koovathur.


They have been booked under various sections of IPC including, Sections 366 (kidnapping) and 506 (1) (criminal intimidation).


The AIADMK MLAs have been lodged at the private resort on the Est Coast Road since last Tuesday after Chief Minister Panneerselvam revolted against party’s decision to elect Sasikala as the legislature party leader.


The MLAs at the resort, however, are denying that they have been detained and say they are here “on their own will.”


On Wednesday, Kanchipuram SP Mutharasi and a team of police officials visited Golden Bay resort and conducted enquiry after a complaint lodged by Madurai south MLA Saravanan.
