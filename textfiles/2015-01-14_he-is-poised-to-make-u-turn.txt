He is poised to make U-turn!


	


	This particular Diyawanna member with a name reminding one of Sri Krishna of Bhagavad-Gita fame, hailing from the upcountry is about to make news again, they say.

Receiving a brief case filled with greenbacks from Santa Claus may have been a mere dream he cherished. He, no doubt, believed that his dream was about to come true, when a broker from the rival camp unexpectedly promised to deliver exactly the same if he switched his allegiance to the Compassionate One. It was a tall order which required him to renounce his high position and the numerous perks attached to it which he had just begun enjoying. However, the offer was so alluring he took the plunge!
However, the broker broke the promise and the Diyawanna member furious over this let-down threatened the former that he would make a U-turn if they failed to deliver what he was promised within two days.
Meanwhile, the news about the disgruntled pole-vaulter reached the palace and the courtiers are said to be calling him back to the fold with an assurance of a warm welcome.
