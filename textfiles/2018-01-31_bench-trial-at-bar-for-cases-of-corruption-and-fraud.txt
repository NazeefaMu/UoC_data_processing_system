The Cabinet has approved a proposal by President Maithripala Sirisena for legislation, which if enacted, would enable the High Court to hear cases of corruption and fraud as defined under the Bribery Act and the Money Laundering Act.

Currently, such cases are heard by the Magistrate's Court. The President presented the Cabinet memorandum in the wake of his pledge to enact legislation to punish those found responsible for the Central Bank bond scam. The cases are to be heard by a three-bench trial-at-bar. The Cabinet paper was presented by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale. (Kelum Bandara)
