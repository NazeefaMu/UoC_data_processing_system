Ravi K. and Joseph Michael spat: Premier to sort out differences


	

The United National Party (UNP) will have a meeting today to discuss the spat between MP Ravi Karunanayake and former MP Joseph Michael Perera who confronted each other at a youth workshop at Weligampitiya in the Gampaha district during the weekend.

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told Daily Mirror that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would meet them at Temple Trees this evening in an effort to resolve this matter.

MP Karunanayake and Mr. Perera had a heated argument when the latter was not given an opportunity to speak at a workshop organized by the party’s youth wing Jathika Yovun Peramuna.

Mr Perera said Mr Karunanayake should not be allowed to get involved in party affairs.

“Mr Karunanayake accepted that he had done wrong. He has resigned from his ministerial post. His actions have put both the government and the party in difficulty. Why is he allowed to get involved in party matters? He is all out to field his henchmen as candidates at the next local government elections,” he said

Mr Karunanayake, howvere, denied all allegations and said he was not involved in the youth front meeting. "I was only invited for the meeting. I had nothing to with it. Mr Perera has lost his senses,” he said.

Meanwhile, MP Kavinda Jayawardene who organized the event said the programme was only a workshop organized by the National Youth Front and was not a political gathering. I, as the Chairman of National Youth Front proposed to the leader that workshops should be held for the youth prior to the local government elections. I was to invite the party leader. I finally invited Mr Karunanayake who is the Assistant Leader of the party since Mr Wickremesinghe was not available. It was decided that no organizer in the district will be asked to speak at the workshop. However I respect Mr Perera. I would have allowed him to speak had he arrived earlier. Mr Perera came to the workshop at the last moment,” he said. (Yohan Perera and Devapriya Chandrasiri)
