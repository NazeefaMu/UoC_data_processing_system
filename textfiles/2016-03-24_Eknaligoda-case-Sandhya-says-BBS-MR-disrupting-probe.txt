Sandhya Eknaligoda, wife of missing Journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, yesterday charged Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera, MP Wimal Weerawansa and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa of disrupting the investigations into her husband’s disappearance.

Addressing a news conference, she said Mr. Rajapaksa and the others frequently visit the imprisoned army personnel who were arrested in connection with the disappearance, influencing the case.

“Gnanasara Thera even threatened me on several occasions. It’s uncertain who are behind them,” she said.

She requested the President, Prime Minister, the UN and relevant authorities to intervene into the matter claiming that her life was in danger.
