'Theravada Kathikawatha Bill presented to Parliament due to Maha Sangha request'

The Government nor any political party should be blamed for presenting the Theravada Kethikawatha Bill in Parliament, since the Government had done it at the request of the Maha Sangha themselves, said several Sangha Nayaka theras who are members of the 2006 Sri Sambuddhdatva Jayanthi Committee at a press conference held in Colombo yesterday. Among those who expressed these views were Ven. Diviyagaha Yasassi Nayaka thera, Ven. Akuretiye Nanda Nayake thera, Ven. Omalpe Sobhitha Nayake thera, and Balapitiye Siri Seevali Nayake thera.
The Nayaka theras who said that the government should be commended for introducing this bill, added that it was the duty of the Mahasangha to offer their full blessings at a tune when their request was about to bear fruit.
They however said that there were certain provisions in the bill which needed amendments and noted that both President Maithripala Sirisena and Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe had invited suitable amendments to the bill from the Maha Sangha and other interested parties.
