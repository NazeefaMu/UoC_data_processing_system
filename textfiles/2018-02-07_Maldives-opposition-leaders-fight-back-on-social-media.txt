Maldives’ opposition leaders fight back on social media


	



 

As security forces surrounded his home shortly after a state of emergency had been declared in the Maldives, 80-year-old ex-president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom deftly hit social media to tell the world of his impending arrest.   The government quickly sought to control the flow of information out of the holiday islands following its declaration of emergency late Monday night.   


However, Gayoom, opposition politicians and even the Supreme Court gave a blow-by-blow account of the dramatic events via Twitter, Periscope and other social media platforms.   


Moments after posting a tweet stating that “a large number” of police had converged on his home, Gayoom calmly delivered a live video message that was aired by an opposition politician on her Periscope account.   


 “Right now, police are here to arrest me. I remain steadfast in my resolve,” Gayoom said in a 
quiet voice.   


 ” When the Maldives’ top judge was arrested on Tuesday, officials from the Supreme Court similarly fought back via social media.   


“BREAKING NEWS: THE NATIONAL DEFENSE FORCES OF THE MALDIVES HAVE BROKEN INTO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE MALDIVES,” said a post on @judiciarymv, the official account of the country’s top court.
