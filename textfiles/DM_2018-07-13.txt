A billionaire, a product of political patronage!
	

This metal quarry owned by a buddy of a high political authority is said to be one of the biggest quarries in Asia.

The owner, who started from scratch, has become a multi-billionaire within a short time which, some describe as a wonder of political patronage.
He lives in a palatial residence on a 15-acre estate with a wing housing a gym and an indoor stadium, they say.

A question never asked
	

What do we actually aspire for
	
	Why the urban middle class has no vision and no common aspiration for the future of Sri Lanka

For over a year now, the urban middle-class has been collecting many new words for daily use from Central Bank and Bond scam to Arjuna Mahendran, Arjun Aloysius, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL), Mendis & Company, Hambantota Port, Port City, Chinese Loans, Rajapaksas, Hitler, LTTE and over a week ago even Vijayakala.
They would be lost in their daily conversations without these words, for they seem to know little or nothing about other important issues to indulge in. Thus the rotten education system, the seriously ailing medical profession and health, jammed up public commuting, the ever-starving rural economy, the dislocated and dismantled law and order situation in the country among many other serious issues do not enter their dialogue and search for answers.
What is being served and savoured in these educated urban middle-class circles and in mainstream media, leaves much to be desired as to what Sri Lanka wants for her future.

One newspaper alleged that both the candidates at the 2015 January Presidential Election-Rajapaksa and Sirisena -were funded by the same Chinese Company

Media goes agog with petty stories sensationalised with voice cuts from self-appointed, foreign-funded social activists and politicians slandering each other.
Within that aimless and uprooted middle-class culture, China and loans with Rajapaksa was one time turned into a punching bag for urban recreation.
While the Port City died off early, Hambantota Port was kept alive with this Yahapalana Government also accused of meddling with the contract the wrong way up.
Then cheques from PTL or its subsidiary Mendis & Co was in vogue for city gossip.
That fizzled off with few saying they did receive cheques but that wasnt a big deal with professionals, administrators and even few journalists having accepted cheques from the same source. The Bar Association of SL that was dragged in lately, virtually said: yes, so what
Then came the explosive NYT exposure on Rajapaksas being funded by the Chinese company involved in the Hambantota Port project, for their January 2015 Presidential Election Campaign.
That hit headlines and became the main issue for Colombos anti-corruption cheerleaders and for the ever gossip ready urban middle class.
Surprisingly the key players in the Yahapalana Government did not jump on it, as they did on Viyath Maga, Gota and Hitler and thereafter on Vijayakalas preference for a return to LTTE rule for law and order in North.
All these stories have their shelf life. But with the Colombo middle class, they often get washed and cleaned for reuse or get recycled into a different format for new use, with new taglines.
NYT exposure on Rajapaksas being funded for the 2015 January elections by the Chinese Hambantota Port project fund, nevertheless lost its glamour and lustre as a carefully investigated story with another local news report in CT last Sunday alleging both candidates at the 2015 January Presidential Election, Rajapaksa and Sirisena were funded by the same Chinese company.

The ordinary American citizen may not be aware, that USD 686 mn of their tax money in 2014, again USD 655 mn dollars in 2015 and then USD 585 mn dollars in 2016 had been spent for regime changes across the globe

The news report also claimed, with that evidence surfacing, Police investigations were stalled. There were few Post-2015 anti-Rajapaksa maniacs, who believed their validity in urban middle-class projects would run dry if they did not stand by the Yahapalana rule, immediately said that CT report was a weak report with no proper sources.
It is common knowledge they lack, that in this open for the corrupt economy, the Filthy Rich with massive interests in giant projects play safe by greasing both sides of the ballot.
This became far more unbearably smelly with the US State Departments 2016 Fiscal Report surfacing once again in social media.
The fiscal report has a preface written by John Kerry as Secretary of State, who was one of the high-profile US diplomats to visit Sri Lanka in early May, after the 2015 January regime change.
He was very emphatic when he said while in Colombo In this journey to restore your democracy, the American people stand with you,
But the ordinary American citizen may not be aware, 686 million dollars of their tax money in 2014, again 655 million dollars in 2015 and then 585 million dollars in 2016 had been spent for regime changes across the globe under the article Democracy, Human Rights and Governance.
As officially stated by John Kerry in the 2016 Fiscal Report, We (US State Department with USAID) have supported important democratic gains in Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Burma.
While in US diplomatic jargon important democratic gains would mean regime change, neither the US State Department nor the present Sri Lankan Government explained what these democratic gains were and what allocations the US set aside for them were. Perhaps democracy and governance is not about transparency and accountability in regime changes.
Two things stand out quite clear with all these headlines, news stories and gossip that make city rounds with certification that they are from very reliable sources. One, the Colombo middle-class is not aware and probably not interested too in knowing how Sri Lanka should reach out to its future, as a modern pluralistic nation State. Corruption is their only big-time topic.
That for them is the most important issue in this country and they want to believe, cleaning it upsets everything else. They, therefore, do not bother to scratch the surface to find out what in effect leads to such heavy and all-encompassing corruption in every topic and issue that surface- from the Bond-scam to Hambantota Port to funding of Presidential candidates on either side.
From greasing politicians to administrators, to professionals and their associations that keep the system corrupt.
The second is the fact, proven or otherwise, in the absence of an alternate development programme that could mobilise and galvanise public support against this open for corrupt economy, mainstream political parties that are manipulated by the filthy rich, are also manipulated by big global powers for their geopolitical needs and preferences.
That is the reason for both China and the US to work towards retaining the regime and the other in changing the regime. That is also the reason why such external interventions are not seriously investigated in mainstream media.
Thus, people are dragged into elections that are only democratic procedures and are superficial, with campaigns that dont address serious socio-political issues and needs.
Recent elections are restricted and left to regime changes with offers to change personalities and not policy and programmes as preferred by the urban middle-class in tandem with the filthy rich.
This has become the practice and the political norm with the urban Sinhala middle-class. They are yet again in a hurry to fix a Sinhala Buddhist candidate of their choice, the people will be asked to vote for.
They seem to dabble with PM Wickremesinghe from the UNP, President Sirisena who successfully contested the 2015 January Presidential Election as the Common candidate with the promise it would be his first and last Presidential Election, again from the SLFP and a third, Gotabaya Rajapaksa in the absence of Mahinda Rajapaksa as possible candidates for 2020 Presidential Poll.
There are few others too who seem to want to enter the fray as independents, trying to create a demand for themselves in social media. These would be new entrants as presidential candidates, are also staking a claim in establishing a corruption free society.
But how is not the question they would answer convincingly and without rhetoric. They too dont understand that it is this free market economy that nurtures majoritarian racism and is inherently corrupt.
That during 40 years of free-market economic life in this country, the whole State machinery, the political establishment and all professions have been basically bought over by the filthy rich, who remain the only beneficiary with a growing Colombo-centred urban middle class.
These few new and independent budding Presidential Candidates from the rich urban society, also lack any interest and knowledge and thus any viable programme to resurrect the already bankrupt education, health, public transport, rural economy, urban development and to bring back sanity into law enforcement.
None, therefore, has come up with any viable socio-economic and cultural programme for the whole country. Neither from the continually failed mainstream politics who would definitely dominate whatever election that came first and nor from those who stand anew in the periphery. This goes to say, the urban Sri Lankan middle-class has no vision and no common aspiration for the future of Sri Lanka.
They are petty and selfish in that sense. And the bottom line is, in an awfully corrupt society with corrupt and inefficient systems where people cannot decide whom they should democratically and independently elect as their authentic representatives but has to select someone whos offered to them as decided by political parties run by the filthy rich and endorsed by the elites in Colombo middle class, there is no future for Sri Lanka to aspire for.
That is the space the big powers have in manipulating regime changes. That is the ugly space that China is accused of using during elections and is also the political space that the US State Department says they supported important democratic gains.
With a total absence in forging an alternative to this ever-growing, filthy rich economy, 2020 elections will not be without such external players helping us to make decisions that help them.

A symposium on law and business
	

The common Latin term in law Ignorantia juris non excusat says, ignorance of the law excuses no one. When it comes to forming a business and running it, there are a set of laws that any business must adhere to. Even though there are thousands of legal professionals to consult when a legal matter crops up, it is better to be fully aware of the laws and regulations that can affect ones business. 
With the purpose of educating corporate leaders regarding the laws that pertain to business, the Colombo Law Society (CLS) plans to host the first ever Colombo Law Biz 2018: A Symposium on Law and Business on 20th and 21st July. The two-day symposium will be held at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo. 
Given the theme of this years symposium, the purpose of the Colombo Law Society is to bring together progressive lawyers and other professionals in and around Sri Lanka, to look into the current legal issues in business. 
Along with Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, PC as the chief guest, experts from varied fields as speakers and other resource persons who are not limited to the legal profession have also been invited for the conference. 
The keynote address of the inauguration of the symposium will be delivered by Supreme Court Justice Prasanna Jayawardena regarding The impact of effective commercial litigation in an emerging economy. 
The President of the Colombo Law Society Jagath Wickramanayake said that the event with two days full of insightful panels, is an excellent way to both network with and learn from some of the best lawyers and professionals in a variety of fields. 
It is good to familiarize with all of the laws business must adhere to. While these rules can vary depending on the type of business, it is important that business owners are fully aware of them in order to follow them to protect both their business investments and their customers. The knowledge that they will collect from the Colombo Law Biz will empower them regarding issues involving the law and help them to prevent any legal problems, Jagath Wickramanayake said. 
Those who attend the symposium will be able to obtain a wide range of knowledge through speeches and panel discussions on how Investment Law, Tax Law, Company Law, Employment Law, International Law, Finance Law, Public Law and Corporates and IP & ICT Law affect business. 
The closing date for registration is July 17. Those who wish to register and obtain further information should contact the CLS Office on 0112421966 or Shevonne on 0777559710 or Jagath on 0773155155.

A vainglorious gimmick
	

This important public institution in a province was shifted to a posh new building complex and a grand ceremony was organized to mark the event, they say.

A very high political authority was the chief guest on the occasion.
The big boss of the institution keen on placing on record the ceremony as a landmark event in contemporary history has gone to a great length to make it a colourful and impressive affair with no concern about the costs involved.
He had set aside a sizable amount to hire six video cameras and a drone to cover the event when the institution has already in its possession an expensive high-quality video camera.
Employees of this institution, who, however, looked on those grand plans as a vainglorious gimmick of their boss, joked that they were going to have a coronation, not an opening ceremony.

As Trump rattles NATO, 42%  Germans  want U.S. troops out
	

(c) 2018, The Washington Post  Rick Noack  WORLD, EUROPE  Jul 12, 2018 - 5:23 PM
BERLIN - For more than half a century, the deployment of U.S. troops to Germany appeared to be a mutually beneficial relationship. Americans defended their national interests in Europe and beyond, while U.S. soldiers considered being stationed in Germany an attractive gig, with tourist capitals like Paris, London or Berlin just a few hours away.
Germans, meanwhile, benefited from the security the Americans provided and the economic boost to towns near U.S. bases. There was always some public opposition to the U.S. presence, but the open hostility that marked the 1960s and 1970s (and even a bit of the 1980s) eventually turned into the widespread indifference of recent years.
Now, in a rather stunning poll, 42 percent of Germans say they want U.S. troops out of the country, compared to 37 percent who want the approximately 35,000 U.S. military personnel to stay. In 1951, right after the end of World War II, only 21 percent of West Germans favoured a withdrawal of U.S. troops. (Back then, the number of U.S. troops in Europe was more than seven times higher.)
The most recent poll, conducted by German news agency dpa in collaboration with YouGov, did not specify why Germans think the Americans should leave.

Aspergers Syndrome Help them overcome darkness
	

Well, this is a story about totally different people. There are people in this world who are unable to interact with the society. The very first recognizable sign is avoiding eye contact. They never maintain eye contact while speaking. They talk in a robotic manner without variations in tone or sans expressions. They might obsessively talk about one or two topics of their own interest such as rocks, ocean, cars, football match statistics, financial facts and mathematics (which is the case most of the time). They dont even care whether the listener is interested in the talk or not.

They wouldnt let the listener speak, and make him or her listen even if he or she is uncomfortable with the topic. They would back away from events and parties where people gather and interact with each other. They have few or no friends. But seldom are all these symptoms present in an individual. These symptoms vary widely. They take pride in their special abilities, but get annoyed if they got to know that others think they need to be cured. 

People with Aspergers are found to be beneficial for many professions where attention to detail is needed, stable and strict decisions (not swayed by others opinion) must be taken, the employee has to work independently, when there is a need to recognize patterns unseen by others and when there is a need for people to be very original in their thinking

Does this condition sound familiar The above qualities are seen in a person with Aspergers Disease. Do you know anyone with these symptoms It may be a child, an adult or an adolescent. We decided to speak on this topic with Dr. Shavindra Dias, Consultant Psychiatrist and Senior Lecturer of the Psychiatry Department, Medical Faculty in the University of Peradeniya for the benefit of our readers.
The symptoms are recognizable in children when they reach the age of 11 or when they are in the school age. Children, young adults as well as the elderly would also have Aspergers Syndrome with the condition not being recognized. Surprisingly, this syndrome is five times more common in boys
than in girls. 

The symptoms are recognizable in children when they reach the age of 11 or when they are in the school age.

An Austrian paediatrician named Hans Asperger observed the social difficulties of four young patients in 1994, which were later published, but it gained no publicity. English Physician Lona Wing published a series of case studies of children with the same symptoms named Aspergers Disease in 1981 and it was widely popular. It is now a part of a broader category called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a high functioning type of ASD. 

Recognition is key
Family and friends would have seen and understood that the individual is quite Different from others in the society. Aspergers syndrome often remains undiagnosed until a child or adult begins to have serious difficulties in school, the workplace or in their personal lives. Adults are mostly diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome while seeking treatments for related issues such as Anxiety and Depression. The diagnosis is primarily centred around difficulties in social interactions. To the untrained observer, a child with Aspergers Disorder may just seem like a neurotypical child behaving differently.  Individuals with Aspergers Syndrome usually want to fit in and have interaction with others, but often they dont know how to.

Speech-language therapy will be used to improve communication skills including maintaining eye contact and continuing with dialogues (two  way conversations) as well as understanding social cues such as hand gestures and signals

They may be socially awkward, wont understand conventional social rules and make limited eye contact, seem unengaged in a conversation and do not understand universal nonverbal cues such as a smile, frown or the use of gestures, humour or sarcasm. Speech patterns may be unusual, lack inflection or have a rhythmic nature, or may be formal, but also being too loud or high-pitched. Those individuals would talk about themselves. Repetitive behaviour is obvious. They hate change, for instance, having the same meal for lunch every day. Theres no difficulty in language or cognitive development, but they would have a delay in motor skills  often seen in a playground. They wont be able to take a simple catch. 
Other symptoms that are not so obvious
Lack of social awareness. 
	Lacks interest in socializing, making friends and has a hard time sustaining a friendship. 
	Intent gaze or avoiding eye contact. 
	Failure to respect interpersonal boundaries 
	Sensitive to noises, touch, sound, tastes or visual stimuli. 
If you notice these signs in your child, the best step is to take him to the paediatrician, who will then refer you to a mental health expert. 
Then he will observe the individual in different situations  individuals behaviour and the way he communicates. 

To the untrained observer, a child with Aspergers Disorder may just seem like a neurotypical child behaving differently.

Treatment
The procedure for treatment will include social skills training  where the therapists will teach such individuals how to interact with the society and express themselves in more appropriate ways. Speech-language therapy will be used to improve communication skills including maintaining eye contact and continuing with dialogues (two  way conversations) as well as understanding social cues such as hand gestures and signals.
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or CBT helps to change the way of thinking, controlling emotions and repetitive behaviour.
Parents or family will also be educated and trained to help their loved ones who are patients to develop social skills at home. Through Applied Behaviour Analysis, an individual will be encouraged to practise positive social and communication skills by giving simple responsibilities, praising and appreciating him. Some medications are also given to treat related diseases as anxiety and depression. 
Do not hide - they are so common
Mental health is just like physical health and we need to take care of it. People who are suffering from mental health issues feel disturbed, hurt, and ignored. Even the family is not prepared to accept the truth that their loved one is experiencing a tough time. People believe it happens to some other people and is rare, but of course, mental health issues are so common.
Millions of people suffer from mental health issues. Many of these issues can be controlled with the understanding and support from the familyand friends. 

Benefits
People with Aspergers are found to be beneficial for many professions where attention to detail is needed, stable and strict decisions (not swayed by others opinion) must be taken, the employee has to work independently, when there is a need to recognize patterns unseen by others and when there is a need for people to be very original in their thinking.
Genius Albert Einstein, Musician Mozart, scientist Sir Isaac Newton, author Hans Christian Anderson, Steve Jobs and Bill gates are famous examples for those who suffered from Aspergers. 
Each individual took control of his or her disability and found ways to shine and express himself or herself when socialising and during other situations that led to their success in several fields.
Having Aspergers doesnt mean that a child is doomed to be disabled. Often, a bit of encouragement and parents and teachers playing to their strengths can give Aspergers children the self-esteem it takes to succeed in whatever areas thatintrigue them.
After taking treatment, the individuals are able to live normal and successful lives and there is the potential to be a genius in their chosen field.

## Title: Bed wetting. Whos at fault

Bed wetting. Whos at fault
	

Bed wetting, medically known as Nocturnal Enuresis, is a common condition in children.
It is theuncontrollable passage of urine in a child while asleep. This is experienced with children who are beyond five years of age. This condition is three times more common among boys than in girls. However, occasional bed wetting can be normal up to the age of 6 years, as long as the intervals between wet episodes are getting longer.
At the age of five, one in eight children will have this condition. This number reduces with age. At the age of seven, it is one in twenty and by nine, it is one in forty children. This condition can persist into adolescence and even into adulthood in a minority. By fourteen years of age, only one in one hundred and twenty-five willhave this condition.
We spoke to Dr. Apeksha Hewageegana, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist attached to the Teaching Hospital Anuradhapura, to enlighten our readers on the topic. 

Whatcauses it
Is it a problem of parenting Is it laziness or being defiant Parents and the sufferer are being accused regarding this condition. However, it is usually due to a number of bodily causes and may also have agenetic basis.
Our body produces a chemical called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This chemical controls the level of urine production. The secretion of this chemical varies through the day with a higher secretion towards evening. Therefore, the urine production will be low towards evening. Hence, the bladder is less likely to be full during the night. Usually, this day-night cycle of ADH matures between the ages of two and six. However, in some children this maturation may get delayed, leading to high urine production even at night.
When the bladder is full it sends messages to the brain and makes us use the washroom. This happens even during the sleep. Yet, if the child is a deep sleeper or if this messenger system is not fully matured or if the child has both those issues the child may have a problem as he will take longer to wake up.
There may be other bodily reasons such as constipation or drinking too many caffeinated drinks close to bedtime etc. Occasionally, bed-wetting may be due to sleep apnoea, diabetes or urinary tract infection.
Parents may be partly responsible for this condition by passing on the condition to next generation. Which means if you had wet the bed as a child your child has a 40 % chance of wetting the bed.
Had you not wet the bed the chances of developing this condition are fifteen percent. If both parents did have the same problem during their childhood then the chance of their child having bed wetting is 70%. Which means bed wetting is highly inheritable and 70% of children with bed wetting will have another family member who has or had bed wetting in his or her childhood. 
Sometimes, bed-wetting may be due to stress in the childs life. These may include, bullying at school, problems in the family, the death of a loved one etc. The likelihood of bed wetting may increase if the child is embarrassed by the remarks of others regarding bed wetting. 

Can they be dry for some time and start having night time accidents later on
There are two types of night time bed wetting or nocturnal enuresis. That is Primary Nocturnal Enuresis (PNE) and Secondary Nocturnal Enuresis (SNE). PNE is when the child has not still been dry at night since birth for a period more than six months. SNE is when night time accidents start to happen after a dry period of at least 6 months.

How does it affect the child and the family
Bed wetting can be hard on your child. It can be very embarrassing and stressful for the child as well as the family. It can have a negative impact on a childs self-esteem, relationships with friends, and school achievement
Children with bed wetting feel guilty and are withdrawn due to the guilt, embarrassment and low self-esteem. 
Their social skills may be poor and their school performance may be lower than others. As a result of the distress caused by bed wetting, the child may have more aggressive behaviour, issues paying attention in class and poor self-image.
Children who wet the bed are fearful that their secret may be discovered and they may be teased for that. Therefore, they avoid instances where they have to sleep away from home. For example, they may dislike family vacations and will avoid going on school excursions and camps that require an
overnight stay.
What can you do as a parent to prevent and reduce the frequency of these night time accidents
If your child has secondary nocturnal enuresis that is, starting to wet bed after a period of dryness for up to six months, it is very important that you get medical advice early. During these instances the primary issue is usually a medical condition or an emotional problem that needs to be addressed. 
It is very important to seek medical advice even in the case of primary nocturnal enuresis, to be sure that there are no medical causes. If there are no medical causes treatment begins with some strategies to be followed at home. These strategies will help to keep the child dry until the maturation process of the hormones and messenger systems are complete. However, if the child is older and or if the problems persist even after applying those strategies then starting on medication may be considered. Some of the home strategies that you can adopt are
listed below.

It is very important that you do not punish your child for wetting the bed. 
	Reassure your child that bed wetting is no ones fault.
	Let your child know that bed wetting is common and happens to a lot of kids and there may be at least one other child in their class with the same problem. If someone in the family had this condition in his or her childhood letting the child know about that also will reduce shame and guilt.
	Remind the child to drink plenty of water, but reduce the intake 2 hours before bedtime.
	Limit soft drinks. 
	Remind them to use the toilet right before going to bed. 
	Make sure that using the bathroom at night is not stressful by giving a torch to use during these visits or place a potty in the bedroom if the bathroom is far away.
	Protect the mattress with awaterproof sheet.
	Get your child involved in solving the problem by including the child in changing the wet bed sheets, or placing wet clothing in a specific place and even washing. This also teaches your child about responsibility, which can help your child feel more in control of the situation.
	Make sure the child gets a shower the following day morning toeliminate odour.
As a parent, your first step in helping your child is understanding and acknowledging what he or she is experiencing. Remember that the accidents arent the childs fault and happen when theyre sleeping. If they could they would surely control it. During most of the instances the bed wetting is not the main problem. The main problem is how the child and family react to it.

Defusing pro-LTTE mindset  Take a cue from Rathnapriya Bandu
	

The visit by Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, his Deputy, Nalin Bandara Jayamaha and Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundare to the North to defuse the Pro-LTTE mindset in the region, as reported by the Daily Mirror on Wednesday is an admission of a resurgence of such a mindset there by the Government.
In fact, there seems to be within the Tamil community a surge in incidents favourable to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the outfit that ruled the roost in the region a decade ago.
It cannot be considered that the situation is the result of the Tamil people in the north (and also in the east to some extent) having started to realise some truth they had never realized before. It is a situation where people are again giving vent to their mind that had been hard suppressed for the past several years, due to the horrific manner in which the war ended and to the frustration to some extent over the actions of the LTTE itself.
There was a time in the wake of the end of the war when northern people did not dare to utter a word that would even resemble something favourable to the LTTE or to their struggle in public.

Also with the difficulty to rebuild the lives of the former rebels as well as the ordinary people in the former war-torn areas, the frustration would automatically demand a deviation from the writ of the establishment
Venturing out to commemorate the members of the LTTE, who were killed in the war was then unimaginable. Everything, the Government, the people have so changed over the years that the Maveerar Naal (the Great Heroes Day), a day assigned by the LTTE to commemorate their dead cadres, was held for the first time in public in the north on November 27, 2016.
The commemorations by the northern Tamil people of the LTTE cadres killed in the war had until recently been camouflaged with an argument that it was their loved ones killed in the war that the people were commemorating.
Yet, they were remembered on November 27 and May 18, two days significant to the vanquished Tigers.
But for the first time after the war, the Black Tiger Day was commemorated in the north and east on July 5, this year in public.
Students of the Jaffna University and interestingly the former LTTE cadres in Vakarai, Batticaloa had two events of remembrance.
Black Tiger Day is a Day that the LTTE during its heyday commemorated its first Black Tiger Vallipuram Vasanthan alias Captain Miller who crashed an explosive-laden truck into the Nelliyadi Central College in Jaffna where a temporary army camp had been installed, in 1987.
Despite the oaths taken by the Jaffna Municipal Council members against espousing separatism, the Council last month adopted a motion to renovate two monuments dedicated to two former prominent Jaffna Commanders of the LTTE Thileepan and Kittu.

The move indicates a misconception that the Pro-LTTE mindset is a new phenomenon. This might be fodder for the attempt by the Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists to portray that the soft approach by the Government had given rise to a comeback by the dreaded Tigers

Thileepan created history in 1987 by his 12-day fast in Nallur over five demands, which culminated in his death. Sathasivam Krishnakumar alias Kittu is a one-time international spokesman of the outfit, who killed himself by exploding the ship in which he was transporting weapons near Chennai.
And finally, former Child Affairs State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran came out on July 4 shaking off all camouflages with a statement made openly and without leaving any room for ambiguities that the Tamil people were craving for a comeback of the LTTE.
It may be a slip of the tongue as later Maheshwaran said that what she meant was that the security by women and children had been assured, when the LTTE was active.
However, many Tamil leaders who came to her rescue in the light of the uproar in the south against her statement endorsed her statement apparently with a wider perspective.
Despite her regret implied during her telephone conversation with Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, posters had sprung in Jaffna glorifying her as a national leader. She seemed to draw sympathy from almost the entire Tamil community indicating a heightened existence of what the Daily Mirror news item termed the Pro-LTTE mindset.
Coupled with the recent capture of a cache of war material, while being transported in a three-wheeler on the Puthukudiyiruppu-Oddusuddan Road on June 22 this year, the Government seems to have taken the situation seriously, prompting the dispatch of the highest level fact-finding mission.

It was learnt that an LTTE operative from France named Kamalanathan Sadheeshkumar, who had arrived in India had sent a five-member cell to Trincomalee for the elimination of Traitors..

However, the move also indicates a misconception that the Pro-LTTE mindset in the north is a new phenomenon. This might be fodder for the attempt by the Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists to portray that the soft approach by the present Government had given rise to a comeback by the dreaded Tigers.
But it was not the case. Apart from politicians glorifying and venerating the Tiger leader in public during the 2013 Northern Provincial Council election, three attempts  two in 2012 and one in 2014 - to revive the LTTE had been made by former guerillas, with the financial support of the Tamil Diaspora.
The first revival attempt came to light with a killing of a member of the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) led by the then Minister Douglas Devananda on March 17, 2012, at Periyakulam in the Trincomalee District. A handwritten note saying Death to traitors and a small LTTE flag with its emblem had been placed by the side.
It was learnt that an LTTE operative from France named Kamalanathan Sadheeshkumar, who had arrived in India had sent a five-member cell to Trincomalee for the elimination of Traitors. The excessively hard crackdown by the State saw that LTTE revival project going awry.
The second revival attempt was detected in December 2012. The interrogation of an un-rehabilitated ex-LTTE cadre in Colombo in December 2012 resulted in a disturbing discovery.
Details of an organized LTTE network operating in Chennai, Tamil Nadu with funds from LTTE elements in Europe had come to light during investigations.
Sri Lankan officials conveyed this information to Indian authorities subsequent to which several arrests were made by the Tamil Nadu Q Branch Police in the State.
The third revival attempt was spearheaded by Suntharalingam Gajatheeban alias Theiveegan, Navaratnam Navaneethan alias Appan and Ponniah Selvanayagam Kajeepan alias Gobi, who were killed during a skirmish following a massive security cordon involving around 3,000 soldiers in Vedivaithakallu jungles in the Vavuniya District in April 2014.
This was the first and the last battle with Tiger remnants that had taken place after the guns were silenced in May 2009. The then government informed the details of the incident to the UNHRC as well.
The recent upsurge in Pro-LTTE mindset is not a sudden spring of events or apprehensions. Rather this indicates only a heightened point of a gradual transformation of the northern mindset. The widened democratic space brought in after the Yahapalana Government assumed office too seems to have been used for the free expression of Pro-Tiger mindset.
The LTTE had been closer to the hearts of the Tamil people than what the Government had been, before the end of the war between the Tigers and the Security forces.
Yet, people were forced to suppress their own mind for the past several years. With the gradual fading away of the horrific memories of the last days of the war, the memories of loyalty to the rebels are also proportionately emerging to the surface.
Also with the difficulty to rebuild the lives of the former rebels as well as the ordinary people in the former war torn areas, the frustration seems to automatically demand a deviation from the writ of the establishment.
The demands for the release of the detainees taken in under the PTA, lands occupied by the security forces during the war and the failure on the part of the former and present Governments to convince the people as to what happened to the people gone missing during the war keeps the frustration alive.
Meanwhile, the race among the Tamil politicians for power also pushes themselves to play the Tiger card with one attempting to outsmart the other in glorifying the LTTE.
The Pro-LTTE mindset is a complicated issue for any Government to handle. Yet, the emotional send-off recently given by Kilinochchi area residents and rehabilitated former LTTE cadres to former Civil Security Departments (CSD) Commanding Officer in Mullaithivu, Kilinochchi and Jaffna, Colonel Rathnapriya Bandu after he was transferred from Vanni speaks volumes about the modalities of defusing Pro-LTTE mindset and reconciliation.

Fashion Bug placed amongst the Great Places To Work in Sri Lanka
	
Aqeill Subian  CEO Fashion Bug
Fashion Bug, one of Sri Lankas leading fashion brands responsible for changing lifestyles for over two decades, was recognized as one of the favoured employers in the country at the latest survey conducted by Great Place To Work Sri Lanka.
Pre-defining what it makes an organization a great place to work, Fashion Bug pays attention to building an efficient and compatible team from the very onset of the process by paying attention to a prospective team members attitude and commitment at the recruitment stage. The understanding that the workplace is where most of an average day is spent leads to creating a culture that is inclusive and accepts diversity. As an equal opportunity employment provider, the organization is gender balanced as well as ethnically and culturally diverse, where diversity is regarded as an asset. Empowerment is given utmost importance as every member of the Fashion Bug team is encouraged to contribute to every aspect of the business and grow in their career leading to not only the growth of employees but also of the organization.
Creating an employee centered and growth conducive working environment is built in the DNA of Fashion Bug. Therefore the placement in this listing is more of a reassurance to us that we are on the right path. It validates our strategic policies that are put into place to make all employees feel belonged, stated Shabier Subian, CEO of Fashion Bug.
Shabier Subian  CEO Fashion Bug
The culture at Fashion Bug is one of openness with unity and meaningful work as philosophies that govern management policies. We have instilled open and transparent communication networks with our open door policy to build trust at all levels. As a family based business, we also extend the sense of family to the totality of the enterprise. Therefore each member of the Fashion Bug staff is made to feel at home in a fun atmosphere, continued Shabier.
As a retail business in a competitive industry, working hours and commitments are not regular. However, work-life balance is encouraged within the company through flexible regulations. Efficiency and time management is encouraged in order to enable employees spend an equal amount of time with their families whilst flexible working hours, working from home and such measures are allowed at times that are necessary.
Referring to the achievement, Joint CEO of Fashion Bug Aqeill Subian said, This is a big win for Fashion Bug and our staff  from the front liners all the way up to the senior management. It means an overall moral boost as they are proud team members of an organization that is an employer of choice and nationally recognized as one of the great places to work, which gives credit to their career as well.
Dinesh Ekanayake  Asst. General Manager, AqeilSubian  Director, Brian Emmanuel - Marketing Director LMD, Oman Athukorala - HR Manager and Vindya Jayasinghe - Learning & Development Manager
The survey also draws attention to areas of improvement, which will be considered as priority in order to take the organization a step further in making it a better place to work.
Discussing the involvement of the senior management in a family based business Shabier responded, The fact that it is a family based enterprise is not a hindrance but an added advantage because we channel every contribution in an effective manner. The Heads of Departments play an active role in boardroom decisions and represent their teams at policy level decisions. As the ones with first-hand experience in operations, their ideas and suggestions are given due consideration. The senior management makes it a point to visit all the operational areas regularly to look into the needs and wants of the employees. Our transparent and straightforward relationship with all levels of staff helps us build a good rapport.
Furthermore, all employees at Fashion Bug receive opportunities to contribute to the growth of the business. The team is encouraged to drop in their comments/suggestions and ideas at each of the companys operating locations. These suggestions are taken in monthly and looked at by the senior management. Emphasizing further Aqeill continued, Some ideas that came through these channels have even contributed to changes in the way we operate today. This is mainly because we practice an open-door policy. Though decision making is predominantly done with our senior management team, we encourage our junior teams to challenge some of the ideas to continuously improve the way we work. This together with an open/transparent decision making system enable us to fine-tune our decision making, recognise employees for their valuable contribution and provide sustainable decisions to the team.

In conclusion Shabier summarized the experience of taking part in the GPTW survey, It was a welcoming experience, as it was quite insightful. It was like a review of ourselves. It enabled us to take a step back and look at what we have done right as well as recognize the areas we need to develop. It does not end with the survey and recognition. It is a continuous process of rebuilding our vision, honing our policies and putting them into effective practice.

## Title: Imran Khanss ex-wife spins it all

Imran Khanss ex-wife spins it all
	
Two weeks before a make-or-break election for Imran Khan, his ex-wife Reham Khans autobiography portrays the former cricketing superstar and prime ministerial hopeful as a man who led a bizarre life of sex, drugs and rock n roll, the Indian Express reported.
Reham Khan, as the e-book released on Amazon Thursday is called, also claims that the 65-year-old cannot read the Quran, believes in black magic, and had confessed that he has some illegitimate Indian children.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi finds a tangential reference in the book, which is mostly a damaging portrayal of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader, who believes he is on course to forming the government after the July 25 election.
How this book will affect Imrans prospects is not clear. But for the Pakistan Muslim League (N), which is reeling under the conviction and sentencing of its leader Nawaz Sharif, and his daughter and political heir Maryam Nawaz  both reach Lahore from London Friday  the book must be music to the ears.
Why Imran Khans former wife Rehams unreleased book is making him nervous
More so, as it includes a brief description of Nawazs brother Shahbaz, who has taken over the party, as a no-nonsense and professional leader. She also describes Nawazs daughter as a brave woman politician, with none of the airs of a political dynast, who gets up to open the door herself to those waiting outside her room.
From Imrans eating habits to his purported sexuality, the self-published book stops at nothing. There has been no reaction yet from Imran Khan or any of his rivals to the book, although the contents are enjoying an outing in all Pakistani media. It was Imrans dogged pursuit of the Panama Papers leak that led to Nawazs disqualification and conviction.
In an election that has seen much drama but very little campaigning, Rehams book has thrown another spicy if salacious variable to the mix of hyperactive chief justice, farishtey (angels) and khalai makhlooq (extra terrestrials)  terms used by Nawaz Sharif to obliquely allege meddling by the military and intelligence services in this election  and jihadis.
The former journalist, who was married once to a UK-based doctor, but walked out of what she calls a violent and abusive marriage, met Imran when she arrived in Pakistan to take up a job with a TV station after a stint with the BBC in the UK. She says she fell for his persistent and convincing courtship.
After they were married secretly six months before a publicly announced wedding in 2015, Reham claims, Imran told her that he had 5 in total illegitimate children, and that some were Indians and the eldest of them was 34 years old.
According to Reham, he told her that apart from her, the only other person who knew this was his first wife Jemima Goldsmith.
Reham writes that he also told her about a liasion with a Bollywood star of the 1970s, and claimed that she became very clingy. But according to Reham, she made enquiries and found it was the other way round. The Bollywood star, who is not named in the book, but described as the sexiest star of that decade and a bombshell, had apparently dismissed her experience with Khan as naam baray or darshan chotay.
The book describes in detail how Imran rubbed black dal all over his body because he had been advised to do that by a pir, and how the drawers in his Bani Gala residence in Islamabad were full of amulets and other voodoo stuff.
It also says that Imran the politician was a creation of the late Lt Gen Hamid Gul, the former ISI chief and Islamist who created the Taliban, and was rabidly anti-India and anti-West. But it also refers to his ties with Israel and Jewish lobbies through his marriage to Jemima, and alleges that he is controlled by shady purse-strings in London.
The book gives Gul a role in the break-up of their short marriage. Reham, who is also a British citizen, describes a meeting between her and Gul in which he told her she was not a suitable wife for Imran because of her foreign connections. She writes that she was not the one in the marriage with foreign connections. Imran showed her a text from Gul that said Abort the marriage, but laughed it off.
In the book, Reham also writes that she warned Imran: (You) do realise that you will be used and discarded like toilet paper Nawaz will be controlled, and so will you.
When it was clear to Imran that he was not going to dislodge Nawaz Sharif through street protests, Reham writes: I would gently and repeatedly give the example of Modi, the Indian Prime Minister, who was chief minister of Gujarat State for a decade and then elected to the top job, because of his seemingly strong governance record, despite all the negative baggage.

In the name of capital punishment
	
Sri Lanka seems to be a very unsafe country at present given that killings are taking place rampantly. Just a few days ago Independent Group Colombo Municipal Councillor Krishnapillai Thirubanandan was shot by unidentified gunmen in Pettah. He became the fifth victim to be killed in a shooting incident in the recent past. Later it was revealed that Thirubanandan had a history associated with drug dealings.
A good number of these shooting incidents are related to the drug trade. As a follow-up to these incidents President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed Prisons Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorala to prepare a draft bill to implement the death penalty. The decision to be bring back the death penalty received Cabinet approval. Some sections of the media reported that this decision to send wrong doers to the gallows had received the approval of the Maha Sangha.
The drug trade in Sri Lanka has a long history, but none of the previous Governments did anything significant to eradicate this menace. We have from time to time heard of powerful ministers having a hand in this illegal trade. Given this past its commendable that this unity Government has been bold to slap drug dealers with the death penalty in the near future.
Drugs, the underworld and contract killings are interwoven. The ministerial hands in this equation made the eradicating of this culture impossible. Many believe that the death penalty should also be the punishment for rape and domestic violence that leads to killings.
Just a few days ago we heard of the killing of songstress Priyani Jayasinghe. It is alleged that she was stabbed to death by her husband, who is now in custody.
Sri Lanka harps on being a Buddhist country. But all these unsavory incidents make the outside world think whether the islands citizens have understood the fundamentals of Buddhism. Despite media reports stating that some members of the Buddhist clergy had supported the bringing back of the death penalty, it is interesting to see what the powerful Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters have to say about this. It goes without saying that the Buddhist clergy of this country have a huge say in implementing such a law which in a way goes against Gautama Buddhas teachings and the practice of ahimsa-non-violence.
But the patience of right thinking people of this country are running thin. Theyve seen and heard of enough killings and shootings and are concerned whether the next generation would be safe living in these conditions. The majority of the citizens are most likely say yes to the death penalty, which should not be restricted to drug dealings, but must be extended to killings that occur as a result of domestic violence.
The death penalty was abolished by the former Premier SWRD Bandaranaike in 1956. But it was reintroduced in 1959 following his assassination. The United National Party modified the use of the death penalty in 1978. Since then any execution to be carried out needed the approval of the President. The last execution in Sri Lanka took place in 1976.
In this context it is important to note that former President Chandrika Kumaratunga had wanted to start the old practice of sending wrong doers to the gallows in 2004. What really prompted the then Kumaratunga Government to habour such thoughts was the killing of High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya. President Kumaratunga failed to bring in the use of the gallows because of public dissent. The death sentence was never removed from the Statute Books and any death sentence handed since 1976 has been converted to a lifetime sentences in prison.
The period after 18th May 2009 has been dotted with violence, murder and an increase in drug related incidents. We even heard of a monk being shot and injured in the holy city of Kataragama.
Its high time that the authorities of this country establish a culture where human beings respect others of their kind.

Knuckles range- Projects in conservation area withdrawn: SPC
	
The State Plantations Corporation (SPC) yesterday said it had withdrawn some projects attached to the Knuckles mountain range after finding that the lands given to those projects belonged to the Knuckles conservation area.
SPC Chairman Thilak Mahanama told a news conference that no land belonging to the Knuckles Conservation Forest had been given to investors to carry out projects and added that they had withdrawn said projects followed by a ministerial direction.
He also said 95 per cent of land attached to the Knuckles Conservation Forest belonging to the SPC and vowed that they would protect the Knuckles Mountain Range which was a world heritage recognized by the UNESCO.
We have not committed any fault in this Knuckles Mountain Ranges issue. The issue is in the side of institutes relating to the forest conservation. They have not given us a clear knowledge on the boundary of the Knuckles Conservation Forest. There is buffer zone of 500m attached to the forest. It is also confusing, he said.
The SPC has agreed to give land for a certain project in Midlands Estate of Knuckles Mountain Range and later we got to know that said land belonged to the Knuckles conservative area. We have withdrawn the agreement right after it, he added.
He said another proposal for a dairy farm which was to be carried out in Hare Park Estate was withdrawn after revelations that those lands belonged to Knuckles conservative area.
He also said no land in the Knuckles Conservation Forest had been given to any party to carry out any sort of project proposal accordingly. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
Marking of boundaries yet to be completed
A Deputy Conservator to the Forest Conservation Department said the marking of boundaries attached to the Knuckles Conservation Forest was yet to be completed and added that however it was largely completed as of now.
He said they had completed measuring the boundary of Knuckles Conservation Forest, 45 km from Kandy and 110 km from Matale; The buffer zone which was established by the UNESCO does not fall under any legislation in the country, he added.
However, lawyer and environmental protection activist Jagath Gunawardena also stressed the necessity to establish more strong legal background for the buffer zone attached to the Knuckles Conservation Forest which was declared by the UNESCO.

Lethal side of snoring How to fight back
	

In last weeks article, we talked about how snoring could affect your life, from it interfering with the spouses sleep to being a condition which is called Obstructive Sleep Apnoea; which causes serious consequences to your health. As we continue with the interview with Dr Bodhika Samarasekera, Consultant Respiratory Physician, District General Hospital Hambantota, and Joint Secretary, Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists, we will talk about when you should see a doctor and what the treatment options are. We have also provided you with an internationally standardized questionnaire where you can self assess how sleepy you are feeling on average and decide for yourself if you need
medical attention. 

Seeking medical help
Many people may not consider snoring to be a sign of something potentially serious. Even though everyone who snores doesnt have obstructive sleep apnoea, you may need to talk with your doctor if you have loud snoring that disturbs your sleep or that of others and especially if this condition is present when sleeping during the daytime, advises Dr. Samarasekera. 
An example for excessive daytime sleepiness is when you fall asleep in the middle of an important meeting, when watching TV or sometimes even when you are driving. Daytime drowsiness may also be due to several other reasons such as low thyroxin hormone levels in your blood (Hypothyroidism) and a condition called narcolepsy. Hence it is very important to see your doctor if you have these symptoms. 

At the doctors
When you visit a doctor and present with these symptoms he will ask you a set of questions and calculate the severity by giving marks to each question. Then he will calculate your body mass index (BMI) by measuring your height and weight. Furthermore your collar size and the blood pressure will be measured. In addition, the back of the throat, mouth and nose will be examined for extra tissues or any abnormality.  There are several questionnaires that doctors can use as initial assessment tools to screen these patients. Epworth sleepiness scale is one of the commonly used tools (set of questions) by doctors and we have provided you with the questionnaire to self asses and get some idea of your sleeping problem. 
After the initial screening, if you have symptoms suggestive of sleep apnea your doctor will refer you to a sleep specialist for further evaluation and a sleep study. This sleep evaluation may involve overnight monitoring of your breathing, oxygen level, snoring intensity and several other functions while you sleep. 
A full sleep study is called polysomnography. During this study you will be attached to an instrument that monitors your breathing pattern, blood oxygen level and arm and leg movements while you sleep. In addition your heart, lung and brain activity will also be assessed during sleep. You also will be video monitored. This full sleep study can diagnose Obstructive Sleep Apnoea and can also exclude other sleep disorders. These studies can be done currently at National Hospital for Respiratory Diseases Welisara, Central Chest Clinic Colombo, National Hospital Sri Lanka, Teaching Hospital Kandy and a few other centres in Sri Lanka.  However, now there are some limited sleep studies which can be arranged at your home. These studies will measure your airflow, breathing and blood oxygen levels. This test is usually enough to diagnose obstructive sleep apnoea. These limited sleep studies are now available at many respiratory units and clinics in Sri Lanka including District General Hospital Hambantota. 

Treatment
The process of treatment depends on the severity of the disease. Usually, lifestyle changes alone will be helpful in managing a minor degree of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea. 
First and foremost, you need to lose your weight through proper dietary control and regular exercise. Hence you may be referred to a clinical nutritionist for a better lifestyle management plan. Alcohol intake should be reduced and you may also have to quit smoking. In addition, you may have to use nasal decongestions and anti allergic medications if you have symptoms of allergic rhinitis, where you get a blocked nose due to allergens like pollen or dust in the air. 
If you have OSA, it is very important to avoid sleeping on your back, since this can cause the tongue and the soft palate to rest against the back of your throat and block the air way. Therefore it is always advisable to sleep on your side or on the abdomen than your back.
In western countries, doctors advice patients to keep a tennis ball on the back of their pajama top to prevent them from sleeping on their backs. 
If these measures fail to improve symptoms or if you have moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea you will be referred for advanced management. Most patients with moderate to severe Obstructive Sleep Apnoea are on a device called the CPAP machine which delivers positive air pressure through kind of a mask that fits over your nose and mouth or over your nose while sleeping. You have to wear this mask overnight and the positive airway pressure, which is delivered by the machine, will reduce the airway from narrowing and the number of respiratory events
as you sleep.
Hence it will reduce daytime sleepiness and improve the quality of life.  If these measures also fail or in the case of any obvious upper airway obstruction you may be referred to ENT surgeons or OMF surgeons for surgical management. 

Word of advice
Snoring may be normal in most people. However if you have day time sleepiness, morning headaches, or complications that were previously mentioned, get medical advice. This will go a long way towards improving the quality of your life, is Dr. Samarasekeras final advice to our readers.

Life imprisonment for reckless driving: Minister
	
Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva opined that the life imprisonment sentence should be brought in to punish reckless drivers in the same way that President Maithripala Sirisena had proposed the re-introduction of capital punishment for drug traffickers.
The minister made this observation when he declared open a new computer-based driving license examination centre at Werahera yesterday. He said the time had come to implement harsh punishments for reckless drivers.
There are situations which we cannot prevent vehicle accidents. But driving in an irresponsible manner cannot be considered normal, he said. Referring to a head-on collision involving a bus at Gokarella recently, Minister De Silva said more than 60 passengers were injured and it was a clear act of negligence that caused it.
In these circumstances there is no need to charge those drivers under the Motor Traffic Act for negligence. They should be charged under the penal code for homicide," he said.
Therefore, I request the law enforcement authorities to submit a comprehensive report which would enable the reckless drivers to undergo severe punishments. They should be charged for a non-bailable offence, he said, adding that a procedure should be formulated to punish these offenders after considering the seriousness of the accident.

## Title: New traffic offences are debatable
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 13 July 2018 01:49 am
New traffic offences are debatable
	

For example, if one were to carry two bags of cement in the boot of a car, would that be personal luggage
	
	Fining those amateurs who instruct along major highways is acceptable
	
	Our legislators should study more up to date examples of the kind before passing draconian laws
Laws need to be reasonable, or people will come to despise them and those who carry them out. The idea is to respect the law, not to fear or despise. According to a news item, 10 new traffic offences have been added to the current list, making a total of 33 offences which can be fined. 
One new offence is carrying goods other than personal luggage in motor cars or private coaches, followed by carriage of persons or passengers in excess. 
How does one define personal luggage No clear definition is available and this will guarantee arbitrary police persecution and high handedness. For example, if one were to carry two bags of cement in the boot of a car, would that be personal luggage Or if one carried a load of books in the boot, does that amount to an offence If not, if one carried a friends collection of books, surely that too, would not be an offence even if the books belonged to someone else other than the owner of the car.


Unreasonable fines
A car is authorized to carry four people. Sometimes, one sees five adult passengers, or four adults with two or more children. This is because those people have only one car, unlike those who pass these idiotic laws. With people getting more and more squeezed financially day by day (Inland Revenue now believes that owning a vehicle, no matter what, if you earn more than Rs. 50,000 a month is a valid reason for paying income tax), this is a fantastic time to start fining people for not being better off. The same goes for overcrowding in buses and trains. This law is not the way to improve the quality of public transport. Shouldnt the CGR, too, be fined for overcrowded trains 
Exceeding the number of persons being carried in a lorry, this too, happens, for reasons of economy. One can see whole families travelling in the back of trucks and lorries when they move house. It would be inhuman to fine such people. Vesak is a time when such vehicles are used to transport people to see festive activities. Or should one refrain from imposing a fine because the whole purpose is holy This is a lopsided law because the police would be lenient when they see fit, and fine when they dont. Its a law with holes as big as the craters of the moon. 
Instructing without a driving instructors license now carries a fine of Rs. 2000. This law concerns more those who train a family member using the family car, rather than moonlighting non-professional instructors (if such people exist, they should fined, and more heavily). 
People train their sons, daughters or wives for two reasons; economy, and also because training schools give insufficient instruction time to learners. They are already overcrowded; learners often stand an hour or more along public roads awaiting their turn. Many instructors are overworked, underpaid, and bad tempered. 
Fining those amateurs who instruct along major highways is acceptable. But in most such cases, they use back roads or open spaces with little or no traffic. 


Call them draconian
There are more laws in this new set which need further scrutiny, but the above examples are enough to be called draconian. They will definitely be unpopular and can only lead to more corruption by the police. 
In a related issue, the Cabinet has decided to implement the Capital Punishment against convicted drug traffickers. The public is bound to approve this move, though what percentage, only a reliable poll can reveal. But these facts should be considered, too. According to Harm Reduction International (HRI), a drug-focused NGO, 32 countries plus Gaza have the death penalty for this offense. All but four (America, Cuba, Sudan and South Sudan) are in Asia or the Middle East. Fourteen, including America and Cuba, have the death penalty on the books for this offense, but do not carry it out. Only in six countries  China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore  are drug traffickers routinely executed. 
Do we want to join that list It has never been proven that executions can stop or even deter the international drug trade, which flourishes everywhere due to a complex web or corruption which includes politics, law enforcement and customs. In many countries, including Latin American ones, small-time couriers and offenders are now given community service instead of jail time. Our legislators should study more up to date examples of the kind before passing draconian laws. 
Thirty-two countries, plus Gaza, impose the death penalty regarding drug smuggling, according to Harm Reduction International (HRI), a drug-focused NGO. All but four (America, Cuba, Sudan and South Sudan) are in Asia or the Middle East. But in most of these countries executions are extremely rare. Fourteen, including America and Cuba, have the death penalty on the books for drug traffickers, but do not apply it in practice. Only in six countriesChina, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singaporeare drug offenders known to be routinely executed, according to HRIs most recent analysis. (Indonesia will soon join this list, following its recent executions.) In Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, South Sudan and Syria the data are murky.

Novichok saga, civilian deaths, and Naseby revelations
	
Britain and its Western allies have accused Russia of ordering the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a deadly nerve agent known as Novichok.

Britain has to date, failed to provide conclusive evidence of Russian culpability
	
	The HC has taken the moral high ground over the Skripals incident and the recently deceased woman on British soil
	
	Would the contents prove PoE Report to be disinformation
	
	Novichok was initially manufactured by Russia

British High Commissioner James Dauris (HC), in his rebuttal dated July 10, 2018 of the Daily Mirror Editorial of July 09, 2018 has claimed, readers expect better of your newspaper than to publish as its own views Russian State disinformation about the use of deadly nerve agents on the streets of United Kingdom. 
He was referring to Britains accusation of Russia attempting to assassinate ex-Soviet era double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter now settled in the UK, in March 2018 and the death of another woman, supposedly a drug user resulting from the exposure to the Russian nerve agent Novichok.
Britain has to date, failed to provide conclusive evidence of Russian culpability. 
The DM Editorial raised two very valid points, i.e., Novichok was initially manufactured by Russia, but since available in NATO countries does not make Russia guilty of the crimes and the logic behind Russia embarking on such projects three months before the FIFA World Cup tournament in Russia and during the event. The HC has taken the moral high ground over the Skripals incident and the recently deceased woman on British soil. 
Nevertheless, does not the whole Novichok saga fade into insignificance in comparison to the deaths in Iraq since the unilateral invasion by the US and Britain coalition in March 2003 without UN sanction 
The American news and opinion website Huffington Post, in December 2017, reported of research carried out by university researchers in the United States, Canada and Baghdad inco-operation with the Iraqi Ministry of Health which estimated deaths over 500,000 covering not only violent deaths, but other avoidable deaths linked to the invasion, insurgencies and subsequent social breakdown.
That toll is far higher than the nearly 115,000 violent civilian deaths reported by the British based group Iraq Body Count, which bases its tally on media reports, hospital and morguerecords, and official and non-governmental accounts.
British Prime Minister Tony Blairs Government produced a dossier to justify Britains role in the invasion. It claimed Saddam Hussains regime had the capability of launching Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) within 45 minutes. 15 years on and half a million Iraqi deaths, WMDs used to justify the invasion are yet to be found.
Why has the Skripal incident accusing Russia ended in a vote in the OPCW, but the invasion of Iraq without UN sanction not been investigated and perpetrators, both nations and its leaders brought to justice Why are half a million dead Iraqis being trivialized The HC dismisses contents of the DM editorial as Russian State Disinformation.
Britain, together with the USA were the chief architects of UNHRC Resolution 30/1 against Sri Lanka. Key elements in the Resolution were civilian deaths of 40,000 during the final stages of the Vanni campaign and war crimes committed by SLA forces based on a report by the Panel of Experts (PoE) prepared for the UN Secretary-General. 
British peer Lord Naseby, in late 2017, addressing the House of Lords disputed the PoE civilian death count and the accusation of SLA forces deliberately firing on civilians based in 39 pages of highly redacted dispatches from wartime British Defense Attach in Colombo, Lt. Col. Anton Gash. Naseby received the dispatches through the assistance of the Information Commissioner after three years of resistance from British Foreign & Commonwealth Office.
What were Britains reasons for not making wartime dispatches from its representatives in Colombo available to PoE members for their deliberations
Would the contents prove PoE Report to be disinformation
What is preventing Britain from publishing the 39 pages in an unredacted state 
Damaging relations by publishing the confidential dispatches holds no water unless the documents contain proof of Britain acting against the interests of Sri Lanka.
It is hoped, HC Dauris will provide clarity on issues raised for the benefit of DM readers.

On urban centres and  suburban peripheries
	

Worldview and outlook are informed by a mindset which is as hegemonic and as imposing as the worldview and outlook they condemn
	
	The NGO intelligentsia bloomed after the Premadasa presidency. They had their moment during the Chandrika Bandaranaike days
	
	The fight against racism need not be opposed to the resolution of economic issues

Certain intellectuals love to wax eloquent on alternative narratives and not always for innocent reasons. In Sri Lanka, for these ladies and gentlemen, the prevailing narrative is informed by a Sinhala Buddhist mindset. An alternative to this narrative would be one, I suppose, informed by a non Sinhala Buddhist mindset. Or a mindset which somehow brings together Sinhala Buddhists and non Sinhala Buddhists. I wouldnt know. They havent done a good job identifying and explaining this to us so far. And insofar as the people of this country, with fuel prices, inflation, rising costs of living, and prospects of unemployment lying just around the corner, are concerned, I wouldnt care and neither would you.
The dominant discourse is that Sinhala Buddhists are hegemonic monsters who like to summon Hitler in order to solve the countrys problems. The dominant discourse is that when it comes to sharing power between the centre and the periphery, the Sinhala Buddhists have resisted compromise and resolution at every step of the way. The dominant discourse is that the countrys problems, throughout much of history, can be traced to the same people who happen to form the numerical majority in the population. Be it in politics and even in the arts, the role of civil society is therefore to take us away from this Sinhala and Buddhist centric perspective, as a means of emancipating the nation. 
Those who project and perpetuate this discourse are professionals at inferring problems, but weak on extracting conclusions. But I presume thats to be expected, given that the problems themselves are couched in terms which go directly into their way of thinking and looking at the world. That worldview and outlook are informed by a mindset which is as hegemonic and as imposing as the worldview and outlook they condemn. No, this is not to belittle their concerns, much of which do certainly ring alarm bells, rather to point out that intellectuals who keep on talking about narratives and hegemonies have failed so far to reconcile the ideological, the abstract, with the material, the concrete. They talk of democracy, of fairness, of the need to do away with structures of power and force, yet they do not talk about or even dwell on the economic imperatives needed to facilitate such concepts. They talk of equity from one side of the room, forgetting that on the other side we are being squeezed by the IMF (in the name of growth) to revise price structures which happen to be felt most acutely by the poor. 
Combating hegemonic structures, I have always felt, boils down to perspective. What hegemony Sinhala Buddhist Eelamist At one point the latter was more powerful than the former and yet those same intellectuals talked about bringing both to the negotiating table. If that was their logic then, isnt it strange, now that Eelamism on no longer the dominant discourse it was, that they are asking for the annihilation of the Sinhala Buddhist hegemony If they asked for a round table before, why are they asking for a square one now 
By concentrating on the ideological and the abstract, the intellectuals have succeeded in alienating a vast majority of people whose knowledge of democracy, hegemony, and all those other suffixed concepts and abstractions is next to zero, not because they arent aware of them but because diminishing economic prospects have compelled them to forget them. We happen to be living in a world where the West talks about democracy and economic restructuring at the same time. Its Orwells double-think, though in a more insidious form. People are being preached about equity and justice one week and the following week, they see their belts being tightened and squeezed beyond endurance. Neither the government nor civil society has done a good job of reconciling these two ends of the same stick. 
The NGO intelligentsia bloomed after the Premadasa presidency. They had their moment during the Chandrika Bandaranaike days and they flirted with politicians who readily gave into and perpetuated their myths. Some of those politicians have found their place in the sun in the present government and this intelligentsia is having a field day all over again. That is why they continue to sustain, unwittingly, a rift between what they preach and what the rest of the political and economic centre practise. The concrete realities that we encounter day in and day out are as far away from all those ideological alternative narratives as they were before. Im willing to wager that with what we are facing today (mounting debt, never-ending price hikes, unemployment, strikes that attest to policy anomalies in the public sector), this rift is even bigger than what it used to be once. 
Such a rift is counterproductive to both the country and those inadvertently sustaining that rift. The biggest failing of civil society has been its lack of contact with the grassroots. The image of civil society as being housed by English-speaking writers and academics residing in comfortable air-conditioned houses is largely a myth borne out of the popular culture (Sarath Weerasekaras film Gamini perpetuated this myth). While the federalist discourse traces its origins to an English speaking intelligentsia, the descendants of this intelligentsia have tended to come from a largely bilingual or monolingual (mainly Sinhala) backdrop. They have succeeded in translating the sacred abstractions to their tongue. But even these translations have not had an impact on the majority. While clearly reflected and refracted through Sinhala, they have not swept into the Sinhala heartland. They remain limited to the urban centre and suburban periphery. 
Here lies the main flaw at the heart of the NGO intelligentsia: they continue to be led by foreign experts and ideologues who themselves are losing ground in a West where right-wing oppositions and governments have made a mockery of those structures of good governance and democracy and decency which continue to be venerated here by these very same experts and ideologues. How can the NGO intelligentsia ever curry favour with the population 
I firmly believe that the fight against racism need not be opposed to the resolution of economic issues. Anti-racism need not be anti-Sinhala Buddhist or, worse, Eelamist, and the same room can hold devolutionists and nationalists and this to the exclusion of those who are baying for blood over their demands for complete, unconditional federalism and separatism. (To a considerable extent, this is true of the Podujana Peramuna, which houses both Dinesh Gunawardena and Vasudeva Nanayakkara.
That, however, is a fragile marriage of convenience, a momentary political truce in fact, and should the SLPP win in 2020, it may well crack up thanks to those inevitable ideological disputes which led to the Samasamajists to divide during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.) I also firmly believe that much of the history that paints the Sinhala Buddhists as demons and fascists, which has been roundly proven to be biased (though I cannot claim to be a scholar the way the writers of these anti-Sinhala Buddhists histories are, I believe I and other non-historians have succeeded in calling them out for the hollowness of their writings), can be discarded in favour of a history that is more sympathetic, more inclusive, more comprehensive, with respect to all ethnicities. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the real alternative narrative we should look at. Not the one weve been forced to concede ground to.

Over 100 Killed in blast at election rally in Pakistan
	
The death toll in a suicide bombing in southwestern Pakistan Friday jumped to 128, an official said, the deadliest in a string of attacks on political rallies that have raised security fears ahead of nationwide polls.
"Seventy bodies are in six different hospitals and there are more than 120 wounded. Between 15 and 20 are in critical condition," Balochistan health minister Faiz Kakar told AFP.
The blast in the town of Mastung, near the Balochistan provincial capital Quetta, came hours after another bomb killed at least four people at a campaign rally in Bannu in the country's northwest.
The ISIS group claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at the political rally, according to the group's Amaq propaganda agency.

The Keepers of Magic
	

When you give someone a book or make one available to him or her, you are gifting that person a whole world
	
	Literature and morals cannot be separated no matter how iconoclastic the work may be, from each ones perspective

Extracts from the Keynote Address by Madhubhashini Disanayaka Ratnayake, Senior Lecturer, Department of English Language Teaching, University of Sri Jayewardenepura at the National Conference on Library and Information Science held on 28 June 2018.

The Vitality of Imagination
Thank you for giving me a chance today to address you  the Keepers of Magic. Keepers of Magic. Why do I call librarians that 
Because I believe that by being the keepers and guardians of books, you actually are the protectors of one of the best kinds of power  the power of knowledge and literature. In short, the power of books.When you give someone a book or make one available to him or her, you are gifting that person a whole world. Especially when that someone is a child  when there is time to impact his or her personality, to affect what the man or woman the child would become one day. When you give a child a book, or when you teach a child to read and appreciate a book, you are giving him or her the key to a whole new universe. There can be no greater gift than that, except perhaps, love. 
Lets see why this is so. People, we tend to forget, are animals just like all other life on this planet. We eat, sleep, defecate, reproduce and die, more or less in the same trajectory as all other beings. But what makes us different What made us build civilizations, invent machines to make life easy, have a way of life probably not dreamt of by any other animal Perhaps because we have one thing that they dont: imagination. 
It was imagination that made the first human visualize that things could be different  that made him or her create the wheel. It is imagination first, that made the brain know what to engage itself on. It was imagination that made it possible to have a world in which humans became far superior to the rest of the beings on earth, at least in comfort levels and manipulation of the earths resources. 
So should we stop now Should we sit on our laurels and think we have put men on the moon, we have instant communication with probably more than half the population of the planet through the internet, we have unprecedented levels of life expectancy and luxury. Is imagination necessary anymore 
I say, yes. Imagination is needed now more than ever. We need imagination to see what we are doing to the earth whose resources we have so excellently and efficiently harvested. We need imagination to see how the people on whom the searchlight of mass media does not shine, live - to imagine the gigantic proportions of poverty, crimes of war, sorrow and sickness that exist but we are not allowed to see most of the time, so that the powers that be, can continue to be in power. That is, a few can be in comfort using most of the worlds resources, at the expense of billions of others, while the rest of the world  that is us - is blinded by the lack of imagination and do nothing. 


The Danger of Books
We need to be more knowledgeable as to what is happening. What helps us know The mass media is tightly controlled by the corporations that own it; education is controlled by the governments that have a very clear political agenda it needs the young generation to follow if those governments are to survive; social media  as exemplified by the recent debacle of Facebook and its getting-increasingly-wealthy millionaire CEO, is a machine that controls the way people think. 
Where do we turn Where would an alternate discourse be found 
The answer is  books. Literature, specifically. For the issue is, at heart, morals. And literature and morals cannot be separated no matter how iconoclastic the work may be, from each ones perspective. Martha Nussbaum says in her essay, Literature and Ethical Theory: Allies or Adversaries that novels of the type she analyses should be a big part of the education of citizens and public servants: for they both represent and cultivate moral activities of high value, activities that are too often simplified or debased by the pressures of a type of formal theorizing in economics or social policy . They preserve a sense of the humane spaciousness of the ethical life, and the plurality of the distinct ends it contains. Such ideas are fragile, in a time when the lure of sciences and pseudo-sciences makes ever more of our gifted young citizens turn towards theories that, while elegant, simplify and reduce human life. (14) 
Of course, this also makes the printed word dangerous. Its danger was clearly perceived right at the dawn of printing, when the printing presses were invented in the fifteenth century and the first Bibles began to be printed. The bible getting into the hands of the common people  when it had so far been interpreted by the clergy  was the death knell of the absolute power of the Church and it heralded the end of the Dark Ages. The first interpreters of the Bible into English were burnt at stake for blasphemy. They had to die for the cost of getting books that anyone could read to the hands of common people. Such are the danger and power of books. 
Because, even though books too cannot escape the clutches of Capitalism in the sense that the major book publishers are corporations for profit, there is still a chance for a small press to publish writers who resist dominant discourses. Chomsky, the most scathing critic of American foreign policy, is still published in the West, and his books are available for sale and widely read, even though he may not be promoted in the media. Arundathi Roy, who does the same for India as well as the USA, is still available in print. Writers can also self-publish if they wish. They can upload whole books on the web without much financial cost, as a final resort. No matter what the form  they are still books. 
As an aside, I must say that, sometimes, of course, as in the case of Salman Rushdie and The Satanic Verses, there is a definite price to be paid when you write against powerful discourses, but the role of writers is not my subject here today. My focus is on what content of value to leave with those who collect books and make it available to the public, free of charge. 
What I want you to understand, therefore, is that books are about the only thing is existence right now that can come to us unmediated by the ideology of those in power who would do anything to hang on to that power. You are guardians of such precious things, as librarians. It should not be a job - it should be a calling. There is sacredness in it. Remember that. 

Distancing Reading from Life  A Safety Measure
There is a deep sadness I feel when I realize how much our education system  be it primary, secondary or tertiary  has disassociated books and the love of reading from learning. Yes, there are text books  but that is only to get students gather facts and know enough to pass exams. And yes, thats important too  as any medical, engineering or law student will tell you. My appeal is to reading books beyond the syllabus  for the joy of the pursuit of knowledge. Reading because you have to read and reading because you want to read are not the same action  in that difference is a crucial factor that links to the personality of the reader, decides the power that he or she would eventually wield. 
And this power is not insignificant. I sometimes wonder if that it is exactly why all governments across the world, do not seem to worry about people moving away from reading  that together with mass media, they are actually encouraging people to not think, not be critically aware, which is part and parcel of them not reading. Because reading is  and always has been  a dangerous activity if you need a society that listens to you and obeys without protest. 
Perhaps there is a reason that the world is being lulled into complacency by the entertainment of mass media, which are finally controlled by governments and private companies that depend very much on the obedience of the masses to survive. Complacency is a dangerous emotion  it makes you believe that there is nothing that needs to get done to make the world better  that God is in Heaven and/ All is right with the world. To show why is this so, let me quote Carol Becker from the introduction to her book The Subversive Imagination: Artists, Society and Responsibility: 
But why would art need to present reality as a problem Lukacs speculates that art becomes problematic precisely because reality has become non-problematic. The more that is hidden and suppressed, the more simplistic the representation of daily life, the more one dimensional and caught in the dominant ideology the society is, the more art must reveal. (xiii) 
In writing books that defy conformity and in fact, in even choosing such books that stand for integrity and truth  in whatever way the writer and the selector see it  you stand opposed to power and you might likely
encounter anger and even persecution. I mention that here because I believe that it is better that you know that and do it consciously. Again, to quote Becker: 
Art refuses to be easy. But as it posits the often contradictory nature of what exists around us, it appears less and less familiar to those untrained to read the complexity they in fact live in. Art may be focussed directly on the issues of daily life, but, because it seeks to reveal contradictions and not obfuscate them, art works which should spark a shock of recognition and effect catharsis actually appears alien and deliberately difficult. Art easily becomes the object of rage and confrontation. (xiii) 
However, it is important, I believe, whatever the repercussions, that you, as librarians, select books that do not always confirm to the official ideologies given to you to follow. You are within a system, true, but you are dealing with things that are known for questioning any system  so do make a case for selecting books with different ideologies and viewpoints on the basis of improving the critical faculty of readers. Whatever your own personal beliefs may be, choose books that might question all given sanctioned knowledge and belief systems. Our country has seen and suffered the results of not questioning orthodoxy. 
Orthodoxy is politics and politics has always had a role to play in literature. I discussed earlier that literature is at heart, moral. How did politics get in there Nadine Gordimer, Nobel Prize-winning writer calls the inclusion of politics in literature along with morals  a kinky cultural affair, in her essay, Three in a Bed: Fiction, Morals and Politics. Her metaphor to illustrate this is so flawlessly and insightfully written that I will give it in full here: 
Morals are the husband/wife of fiction. And politics Politics somehow followed morals in, picking the lock and immobilizing the alarm system. At first it was in the dark, perhaps, and fiction thought that the embrace of politics was that of morals, didnt know the difference. . . And this is understandable. Morals and politics have a family connection. Politics ancestry is morality  way back, and generally accepted as forgotten. The resemblance is faded. In the light of morning, if fiction accepts the third presence within the sheets it is soon in full cognisance of who and what politics is. . . From this kinky situation came two offspring, Conformity and Commitment. And you will know who fathered whom. (4  5) 
We need to do our part in developing commitment to a just cause and questioning conformity, for conformity can and does excuse appalling injustice should it suit the powers that put this particular offspring in a place of unquestioned authority in the first place. We can play a role in getting at least the younger generation more critically engaged in questioning all systems of knowledge. This is best done through books and reading, especially reading outside the prescribed texts. 
That is why I think we need to distinguish between people who read because they have to and those who read because they want to. The power to change the world for the better lies with the second category  and as librarians I think it is your job to help society move towards being the second kind of reader. In that way, you can be the most important change makers we need today.

Trump stokes Britains Brexit turmoil at start of visit
	

Donald Trump began a protest-laden trip to Britain Thursday by questioning whether Prime Minister Theresa May will deliver on UK voters intentions when they decided to quit the European Union. 
Ignoring all diplomatic niceties, the convention-shredding US president set up the four-day visit with a rebuke of his beleaguered host as she battles to stop her government falling apart over Brexit. 
Shrugging off the plans for mass protests, which on Friday will include a giant baby-shaped blimp bearing Trumps features, he said in Brussels: They like me a lot in the UK. I think they agree with me on immigration. 
He said Britain was a pretty hot spot right now with a lot of resignations. 
The US President arrives after giving NATO leaders a tongue-lashing in Brussels over defence spending and controversial comments about Britain being in turmoil. 
He said he got along with Theresa May very well, but suggested he might make time during his UK visit to speak with his friend Boris Johnson, who has just rocked her Government by resigning as foreign secretary.  It was up to the people whether or not they want Mrs May to stay as Prime Minister, he added. 
Yesterday Buckingham Palace announced details of the Presidents meeting with Her Majesty. The monarch will meet the American leader and Melania in the Quadrangle of the historic Berkshire royal residence on Friday afternoon.  Afterwards Mr and Mrs Trump will join the Queen for tea at the Castle in her private apartments.

## Title: War agenda behind Trumps demands to NATO

War agenda behind Trumps demands to NATO
	
United States President Donald Trump is a liability to the transatlantic defence cooperation that started with the US entry into World War 1 and evolved into a formal treaty after World War II. The US entry was the decisive factor in the victory of the allies.
Since the end of World War II and throughout the Cold War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has been at the pivot of Europes defence to protect itself from the now defunct Soviet Union, though, at the same time, the alliance effectively served the US interest in containing the spread of Communism in Europe.
The organisation came into force in 1949 at a time when European nations were struggling to rebuild their economies and militaries. The end of World War II signalled the beginning of the Cold War, with the Soviet Union occupying much of Eastern Europe. The prevention of Soviet expansion into Europe and elsewhere was the main issue US policy makers confronted. If the economies of these war-ravaged European nations crumbled further, the US feared that the people would embrace communism.
To overcome the issue that was threatening the post-war US hegemony, the then US Secretary of State George Marshall proposed that the US offer billions in aid to Europe. Western European countries accepted the US aid and went on to record a remarkable economic recovery. In the meantime, a series of Soviet-led moves unsettled the US. The key among them was the blockade the Soviets imposed on West Berlin. Amidst fears of a major conflict, the US and its allies organised a massive airlift of supplies to Berlin. After 318 days, during which allied planes carried out 275,000 missions to transport 1.5 million tons of supplies, the Soviets relented and ended the siege, though Germany remained divided till October 1990. This was largely the backdrop that led to the formation of NATO.
Now for the first time in the seven decades since its formation, the alliance faces a threat from within. In what is seen as yet another point of contention between allies, Trump is asking NATO members to pay more for the protection that the US gives them through NATO.
Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has irritated US allies, first by withdrawing from the Paris climate deal and then Iran nuclear pact, then by starting a tariff war with allies including Canada and European Union nations, then by scuttling the G7 meeting in Canada and now by undermining the importance of NATO, a defence alliance which has served the US interest more than the interest of its other members.
But judging from Trumps statements and tweets, it appears that he believes NATO largely serves Europes defence interests. He also believes that the US should stop looking at Russia as a foe. During the presidential campaign, he had said he would be able to get along with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Trumps dismal view of the 29-member NATO probably brings out the business animal in him. He is looking at the alliance in terms of profits and losses. One who benefits more should pay more. This appears to be the logic. He said the alliance was obsolete and costing the US too much money.
NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. Were not a rich country anymore. Were borrowing, were borrowing all of this money...NATO is costing us a fortune and yes, were protecting Europe with NATO but were spending a lot of money. Number one, I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved, candidate Trump said in 2016, drawing much applause from his America first supporters.
In deference to Trumps stance, NATO members, especially Germany, France, Spain and even Belgium, have agreed to increase their defence expenditure to 2 percent of the GDP by 2024. But Trump on Wednesday told the NATO summit in Brussels that Canada and European NATO members -- which last year spent 0.55 to 2.6 percent of their GDPs -- should increase the defence budget to 4 percent of the GDP  a 650 percent increase in the case of Luxemberg. This is while the US spends only 3.5 percent of its GDP on defence.
He is in Britain today amidst huge public protests before he will travel to Finland for a meeting on Monday with Putin, with whom Trumps chemistry is bubblier than his chemistry with his European allies such as Germanys Angela Merkel. He berated Germany, saying it was totally controlled by Russia and added in a tweet on Thursday saying, On top of it all, Germany just started paying Russia, the country they want protection from, Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia. Not acceptable! All NATO Nations must meet their 2% commitment, and that must ultimately go to 4%!
Increasing the military expenditure is certainly a crime in a socio-economic sense. If this additional 2 percent Trump is seeking is spent on agriculture research aimed at increasing the world food supplies, health, education and eliminating poverty, the world will be certainly a better place to live in. But the Trump strategy is aimed at boosting the US arms industry. Additional money for defence means, more weapons purchases from US companies and more wars.
In this context, it is in the interest of world peace, we say that NATO should be disbanded now. It should have been dissolved when the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact were disbanded. The organisation has, since the collapse of the Cold War, intervened in many conflicts: the Balkan conflict that erupted with the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the 1991 Gulf War, the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and the 2011 Libyan war, to name a few.
During the last months of President Barack Obama, NATO undertook a massive military buildup in Russias neighbourhood. The move exacerbated Russia-NATO relations that had already been strained by Russias wars in Georgia and Ukraine, its annexation of Crimea, the US threats to set up missile defence shields in Eastern Europe and NATOs eastward expansion.
Against the backdrop of policy differences between the US and Europe, moves towards forming an exclusive European defence alliance have gained momentum in recent years. In the past, Germany and France had pushed for an EU defence arrangement but had abandoned their efforts following US objections.
With Trump flirting with Russia, which is said to have helped him to win the presidential election, an EU defence arrangement is in order. Last year, the EU nations formed the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) aimed at close defence cooperation through joint projects.
