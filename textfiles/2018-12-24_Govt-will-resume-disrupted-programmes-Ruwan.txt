The government programmes which came to a standstill during the past 52 days will be resumed to ensure the country's national security, State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardene said when he assumed his duties at the ministry. 

He also gave thanks to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for having faith in him and giving him the same ministerial portfolio he held before.

“I have given priority to the national security during the past three years and worked for the benefit of the tri-forces personnel. I hope to continue my duty with the blessings, guidance and leadership of the President and the Prime Minister,” he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
