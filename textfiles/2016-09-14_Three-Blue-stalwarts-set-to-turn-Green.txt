Three Blue stalwarts set to turn Green


	



 

There had been hush-hush behind the scene at the Kurunegala Blue party conference that three Betel Leaf heavyweights were sending feelers to the Green leadership.

 


This piece of news had first come up during an informal discussion held by three to four Blue purohitas on the sidelines of the party convention, they say.


One of the threesome set to do the pole-vault to the Green camp is said to be a politico from the Kurunegala area who made several foreign trips with Green party stalwarts in the recent past. The fact that there is a sizable support base for the former strongman in his electorate has led this character to seriously consider teaming up with the Greens for the sake of his political future. 


Another Betel leaf heavyweight set to take political refuge in the Green party is a talkative one from the hills. This one lost at the last polls but was lucky enough to enter the council through the charity list.  The third one is from the Colombo district. The party has placed him in charge of an important electorate. He suffered a big blow to his political ambitions when he was defeated at the last polls. Of late he has been seen moving closely with the Green party leaders, they say.


a certain white collar bigwig as the de facto evil force behind the coal tender issue.
