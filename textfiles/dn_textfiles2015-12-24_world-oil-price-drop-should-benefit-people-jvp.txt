World oil price drop should benefit people - JVP

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday urged the government to pass the benefit of fuel price reduction in the world market to the people.
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said the government can provide a litre of petrol and diesel at Rs. 59.39 and Rs. 79 respectively even after adding taxes.
The crude oil prices have come down drastically in the world market but the government has failed to pass the benefits on the public, he said.
Herath said that people will receive relief with the reduction of oil prices. "The production cost and transport fare will reduce," he said. The JVP MP asked the government as to why it delays the introduction of price formula for the fuel prices.
Herath also said that his party opposes the decision to increase the allowance of Parliamentarians participating in parliament sessions to Rs.20,000.
"It is an additional burden on the people," he said. Herath said the government did not respond postively towards the farmers' demands. "Farmers demanded the restoration of their rights. The Prime Minister who is claiming that he is following the precepts of Lichachi evaded the meeting with farmers," he said
