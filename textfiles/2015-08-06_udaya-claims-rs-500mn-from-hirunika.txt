	UPFA Colombo District candidate and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila sent a letter of demand to UNP Colombo district candidate Hirunika Premachandra demanding Rs. 500 million as damages for allegedly making defamatory remarks on him.
	Mr. Gammanpila today said he would take legal action against Ms. Premachandra if she failed to pay the amount within two weeks.
	“In a television programme telecast on July 2, Hirunika alleged that a police complaint had been lodged against me for not marrying a girl after making a promise to do so. However, she failed to even produce credible documents to prove the charge. She also alleged I was engaged in a scrap iron theft,” he said.
	He said Ms. Premachandra had further charged that the budget report he presented on the expenditures of the election campaign for previous provincial council, was a fabrication.
	Denying all the charges as fabrications and baseless, he said he sympathised for Ms. Premachandra as she had been played by a candidate who also had just joined the UNP to contest from Colombo.
	Commenting on his campaign expenditure, Mr. Gammanpila said asking for Rs. 100 from people seemed not practical at this juncture and said he was managing the funds as he received them. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
