No one should interfere with the judiciary: BBS


	

The Judiciary and the Attorney General's Department should be independent and should be allowed to function as such without interference from anyone, the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) group claimed today.

Addressing the media at the BBS Headquarters in Rajagiriya, Sinhala Ravaya General Secretary Magalkande Sudaththa Thera said no Parliamentarian should be allowed to interfere in cases filed at the Attorney General’s Department or with the Judiciary.

“The President, the Prime Minister, ministers and MPs are known to interfere in the justice system,” he pointed out, adding “No one has the authority to delay or hasten court cases. Justice should be meted out in an impartial manner,” Ven. Sudaththa Thera said.

“Even in Parliament ministers are known to issue challenges to the Attorney General’s Department, Judges and the Judiciary, which has left the public disillusioned with the Judiciary,” he said.

“Therefore, the President and the Prime Minister should act immediately to bring disobedient ministers to book inside and outside Parliament,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
