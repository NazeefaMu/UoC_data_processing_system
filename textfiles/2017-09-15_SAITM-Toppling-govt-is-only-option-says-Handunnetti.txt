SAITM: Toppling govt. is only option says Handunnetti


	

If the government is not ready to close down SAITM we are ready to close down the government with the people's power, Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti said today.

He said there were no multiple solutions to resolve the controversy and the only solution was to topple the government.

“If the Government does not accept the defeat tomorrow and close down the SAITM, the JVP will use its full force to send the government home,” he said addressing the anti-SAITM parade in Colombo today.

Mr. Handunnetti also stressed that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Social Empowerment Minister S. B. Dissanayake had been blacklisted and were removed unconditionally from the people's hearts.

He further said that it was true that people, pedestrians and patients were inconvenienced by trade union actions but the country's state of medical education, especially the education of the poor parents' children would be ruined if the struggle failed.

"We should not be concerned about temporary inconveniences caused during the trade union actions if we are truly concerned about free education in the country. This struggle is to safeguard the education right of even your unborn child," he said. (Thilanka Kankarathna)
