Colossal dinosaur cast goes on display in NY

US: A cast and fossils from a brand new species of titanosaur, one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered, went on display on Thursday in New York for the first time.
It comes from a species so newly discovered that its scientific name has not yet been formally released, say the paleontologists who made the extraordinary find in 2014, in Argentina's Patagonia region.
The remains of the giant herbivore, which would have lived 100 million years ago, were excavated in the desert near La Flecha, 135 miles (216 kilometres) west of Trelew, by the Argentinian team.
The colossal exhibit unveiled at the American Museum of Natural History is 122 feet (37.2 metres) long. It is so enormous that its head and neck extend out of the room into a lobby near the elevators.
The animal was a young adult of unknown sex, that would have weighed 70 tons or as much as 10 African elephants, the museum said.
Paleontologist Diego Pol, who helped lead the excavations, told AFP that the discovery was a "once in a lifetime" moment.
