A rope attached to the world's largest aircraft hit a power line before it crashed, its manufacturer has said. Airlander 10, which is part plane, part airship, came into contact with the line as it nosedived at Cardington Airfield, Bedfordshire, on Wednesday morning. The crash occurred when the 'big ass' aircraft, which is the length of a football pitch and the height of six double decker buses, was nearing the end of its second test flight.
