Politicians wearing mantles of Saints?. Ain’t it quaint?


	

We live in a country where people have short memories, this includes politicians who often suffer from selective amnesia as well

Within the UNP too, those who were once photographed kneeling at the feet of the former ruler

Several promises which were given have been honoured, and in addition we have the Ambulance service which was Minister Harsha de Silva’s brainchild, a gift from the government of India

It is unfortunate that some sections of the electronic and print media choose not to mention the tributes but persist in giving maximum publicity to criticism of the PM

There have been a spate of politicians recently marching in as Saints, trying to cover their past sins with a saintly cover, going so far as to court ethnic minority communities who were harassed by them, even in their time of prayer, during their tenure of office. State sponsored violence was the trademark of that time.We live in a country where people have short memories, this includes politicians who often suffer from selective amnesia as well! There were several statements recently which displayed this mentality. Those who were famed for violence in various forms now parade as saints, pointing fingers at the government in power forgetting their own murky pasts, when they were leading segments within the powers that were. Their own record, academic and otherwise, are proof that they know little or nothing of the economy, rule of law or good governance. Then we have the former ruler, shedding crocodile tears about recent murders. How many innocent people were murdered and protestors shot at during his time. He seems to have forgotten the Rathupaswella, Chilaw and Katunayake incidents where people lost their lives after they were shot at by Defence forces, the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge and the disappearance of Pradeep Eknaligoda, whose weeping wife kept going and still goes from pillar to post desperately 



trying to get to the bottom of this tragedy. No heed at all was paid to public outrage, or ending the violence which continued unleashed with perpetrators unapprehended. Journalists, rugger 

players, so many other innocent people were killed during the past regime. He even refuses to debate with Minister Mangala Samaraweera, one recalls his reluctance to debate when he was invited to do so at the height of his power by Ranil Wickremesinghe. One of the sons, announces that the former ruler as the man responsible for winning the war, will not deign to face a debate. He also chooses to forget the way Sarath Fonseka, once hailed as the best of the best by them, was treated in an inhumane fashion, and thrown into jail. I think his refusal stems from the fact that he is well aware that the two people who challenged him to debate, can outtalk and outwit him, unlike some people who continue to be fooled by him. It is as strange a phenomenon that when some are caught out, in one way or another, their signature tune seems to be. I don’t know, I can’t remember’. We have another famed political jumper who has jumped several times, who did this recently.


Within the UNP too, those who were once photographed kneeling at the feet of the former ruler, when they did a political jump, are now wanting a change in Leadership of the party. They have no right whatsoever to make this demand.They were not with the party during tough times, but only came back when they sensed that the party was on a winning streak, just before the Presidential election. They were not harassed, intimidated nor were they victims of violence as many UNPers, including MP’s and Ministers who stuck with the party through thick and thin were, during those years. They should instead go to their electorates, tell the people what this government has achieved and prove their worth. Several promises which were given have been honoured, and in addition we have the Ambulance service which was Minister Harsha de Silva’s brainchild, a gift from the government of India. This has saved many lives and been a great boon to people in several areas. We also have freedom of speech to write or say what we want, without fear of white vans, a symbol of the former rule. Of course the government still has much more to do and achieve, promises to keep and more than ever, to bring to book perpetrators of crime and corruption of the previous regime. This has to be given priority. The appointment of Harin Fernando as spokesman and as Head of the publicity machine of the party is a good move as this has clearly been the weakest arm of the party. Harin must get this moving on the road as soon as possible as time is short and memories even shorter!

The Mahanayake of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Chapter The Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammavansa Thera recently commended the PM’s patience, intelligence and appropriate stance. It is unfortunate that some sections of the electronic and print media choose not to mention the tributes but persist in giving maximum publicity to criticism of the PM. This is hardly unbiased journalism! The PM’s example in not raving and ranting against the constant character assassination thrown at him, has always been his forte. He takes all this with the cool, patrician composure that he was born with and turns the other cheek. He has never been in a hurry to gain power, has never tried to throw out leaders by force or undemocratic means and got the leadership of the party at his own pace, in his own time. He was loyal to all previous Leaders. He always did his duty by the party and its previous Leaders with infectious zeal and probing intellect. But the time that we live in today, demands that he has to be tougher, instill more discipline, act decisively and move swiftly against the culprits of the former regime.Inaction on this front is the main criticism thrown at the government.

 He is a devout Buddhist and perhaps the words of the Buddha on compassion towards enemies, stressing that ignorance was the cause of human frailties and faults have undoubtedly inspired this attitude. As a Christian, I am also reminded of the words of Jesus Christ on the cross, ‘Father forgive them, they know not what they do’!
