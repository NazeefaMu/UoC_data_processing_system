Embattled CR out to turn tables on Kandy

Red hot CR and FC will battle it out with favourites Kandy SC in their inter-club 'A' division Dialog rugby league tournament match at Race course grounds today at 4:00pm.
CR is a dejected lot without several of their key players unavailable - fly half Tharinda Ratwatte (illness), national under 19 players Supun Warnakulasuriya (knee injury), flanker Tariq Saleh (with Junior rugby team in Singapore), winger Anuradha Herath (injury) and hooker Malith Hettiarachchi (injured).
Fly half Ashan de Costa, prop Nipuna Devinda, forward Kokila Hiran, ex-Trinity and Upcountry Lions winger Sashan Mohamad and ex-Royal and Havelocks hooker Lahiru Pavithra will replace them for today's game.
Also ex-Dharmaraja College skipper cum full back Rochana Hettiarachchi will play in the pivotal position of full back.
Going by the team cards Kandy is having a huge advantage over the inexperienced young CR and FC side, but they are going into this game as the underdogs. Hence on their day CR will play a different brand of rugby to topple any side by creating a shock victory.
Last season CR lost the away game 19-13 against Kandy but unexpectedly held them to a 27-all draw at Longden Place.
Teams:
CR & FC (probable XV): Shane Sambandapperuma, Lahiru Pavithra, Nipuna Devinda, Ishan Noor (captain), Dilanka Perera, Sasanka Ariyaratna, Arun Kumar, Kavindu de Costa and Ashan de Costa, Sashan Mohamad, Kanchana Ramanayaka, Amila Bandara, Kavindu Perera, Rochana Hettiarachchi
Kandy SC (probable XV): Piyumal Manchanayaka, Damith Disanayaka, Kishore Jehan, Gayan Ratnayaka, Shehan Dimithri, Heshan Kalhara, Soyuru Anthony, Buwanka Udangamuwa, Roshan Weeraratna and Fazil Marija (captain), Dansha Dayan, Roshan Weeraratna, Arshad Jamaldeen, Richard Dharmapala, Nigel Ratwatte
