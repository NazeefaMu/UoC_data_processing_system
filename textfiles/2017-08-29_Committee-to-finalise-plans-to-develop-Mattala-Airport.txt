Committee to finalise plans to develop Mattala Airport


	

In the wake of the policy decision to lease the Mattala airport to an Indian company, the government is in contact with India to work out modalities on how best to develop it.

A Cabinet source told Daily Mirror that a subcommittee was appointed for this purpose and that though there were various proposals, no final agreement had been reached up to now.

The establishment of a flying school integrated with the airport or an aircraft maintenance plant is among the proposals.

The source said, the government was considering the possibility of for other purposes rather than restricting its use for commercial flight operations.

The former government built this airport with financial assistance from China with the current government deciding to develop it in partnership with a foreign investor. (Kelum Bandara)
