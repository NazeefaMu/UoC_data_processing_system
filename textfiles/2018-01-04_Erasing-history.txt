Erasing history


	



 

On a recent night a lorry had suddenly appeared on the Galle Face Green. Several persons who got out of the vehicle had made a beeline to the place where the foundation stone for the port city was laid at a historic ceremony. 

 


The ‘night riders’ had soon rushed back carrying a granite slab, got into the vehicle which immediately sped away. By the way, someone, in fact, who had videoed this scene had posted it on Facebook.


The stone slab that the ‘night riders’ carried away had reportedly found a new ‘home’ later in the Indian ocean. By the way, it had carried an inscription that said that the former big boss in association with his counterpart from the land of the dragon laid the foundation stone of the port city.
