This individual, an additional secretary to a key Ministry has been batting in the present post for the past 15 years at a stretch, they say.

 


A political appointee well versed in the art of bending over backwards to please his masters, this worthy continues to enjoy perks of his office thanks to his close connection to a powerful politico, they say. 


All powers and functions relating to 14 institutions of the 32 institutions coming under the purview of the Ministry have been delegated to this additional secretary while those of the remaining 18 institutions have been distributed among another six additional secretaries. 


Important files in respect of the 14 institutions which are the charge of this additional secretary often gather dust at the Ministry while the man is spending most of his time running about on his political master’s errands or his own private missions, employees say.
