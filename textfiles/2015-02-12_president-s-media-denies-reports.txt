The President’s Media Division today said that there was no basis in social media claims that Zackey Ahmed was currently not in control of President’s accounts.
“As of today, the President or Presidential Secretariat has not appointed any individual to operate President Maithripala Sirisena’s official (www.president.gov.lk) or personal website (www.maithripala.com / lk) or any of the social media accounts - (facebook.com/maithripalas, twitter.com/MaithreepalaS) as claimed by some social media posts and websites,” it said.
The Media Unit said the team, who were authorised to manage these accounts during the Presidential election were still in control of these accounts and sites.
