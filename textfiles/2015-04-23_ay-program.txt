US Secretary of State John Kerry was amazed after seeing the work done by Sri Lanka during the 100-day programme, claiming that even a US President could not fulfil such a large number of promises in such a short period, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
“Mr. Kerry expressed these views after meeting our foreign minister a few weeks ago. When he (Kerry) requested a work report from their embassy in Sri Lanka, he had expected a single page report but was astonished to receive a three page report,” the minister said.
