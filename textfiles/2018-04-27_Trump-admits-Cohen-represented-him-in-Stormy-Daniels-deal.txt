US, Daily Mail), 26 April, 2018 -   President Trump admitted Thursday his personal attorney Michael Cohen represented him ‘with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal’ but distanced himself from the lawyer who is now pleading the Fifth Amendment.  


Trump spoke by phone ‘Fox & Friends’ in an extraordinary half-hour appearance and said Cohen was one of his ‘many attorneys,’ adding: ‘He represents me like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal’.  
‘From what I see, he did absolutely nothing wrong. There were no campaign funds going in.’ The telephone connection seemed to cut out for a few seconds after Trump mentioned Daniels.  


The president has previously said he had no knowledge of the $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actress Daniels in exchange for her silence just before the election about her claims of sex with Trump.  


Trump told the Fox News morning show: ‘This has nothing to do with me. I’ve been told I’m not involved.’  


Instead he claimed that Cohen - whom he called a ‘good guy’ - was being investigated over his own business dealings.
