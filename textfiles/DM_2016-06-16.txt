Countrywide bus strike from July 4 if bus fares not revised
	
The All Ceylon Private Bus Association (ACPBA) threatened to stop operating buses in case the bus fares were not increased from July 1 in keeping with the agreement with the National Transport Commission (NTC).
The ACPBA Secretary Anjana Priyanjith said they were calling for the minimum bus fares to be increased by Rs.2 while the other fares to be increased by 15 per cent.
We do not anticipate any bus fare revision during this year because of the inefficiency of the NTC and the Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, he said. "We have been unable to meet the minister yet to discuss this matter and as such we are left with no other option but to launch a countrywide bus strike from the midnight of July 4."
Mr. Priyanjith said the government had more than 14 days to decide and added that the recent increase in VAT had a serious impact on the bus industry because of the price increases in spare parts.
Southern Province Private Bus Owner's Association (SPPBOA) Chairman Chandana Soysa said the 15 per cent bus fare revision should also be applicable to the expressway bus fares.
"If the bus fares are not increased by July 1, all bus operations in the Southern Province including the Southern Expressway bus service will come to a standstill. We will not allow any buses to operate on the Southern Expressway during the strike, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Filipino Prez-elect to replace ministers luxury cars with Toyota Avanzas
	
As part of his austere style of governance, incoming Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte plans to replace luxury sedans with cheaper cars for cabinet members.
According to the INQUIRER, Duterte identified the Toyota Avanza MPV as the official vehicle that will transport most senior members of his administration.
Speaking at a forum with media members on Tuesday, designated House Speaker, Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez, said Duterte wants the Avanza, as it was the cheapest.
Alvarez, a long time friend of Duterte, drew laughter from the editors and journalists present when he said: When someone asked me what I will do, I said I will invoke separation of powers.
Alvarez said he would use a pickup truck when Duterte takes office, adding he was accustomed to driving around in such vehicles.
After proclaiming his landslide victory in the May 9 elections, Duterte told a meeting of his Cabinet members that he was gearing up for a frugal administration. The austere move included the relinquishment of some perks, including business class flights, the use of public funds for junkets, and expensive cars.
Duterte, who is expected to be sworn in as president on June 30, has also vowed to make these new ground rules effective on the day he takes office.
Less than a week after his election victory, the Davao city mayor announced plans to sell off the presidential yacht and wanted all aircraft assigned to the Presidential Airlift Wing to be converted to air ambulances.
The aircraft to be converted into the ambulances include the Fokker F-28, Fokker F-27 Friendships, S-70 Blackhawks, S-76s, SA-330 Pumas, and Bell 412s used to ferry the president, dignitaries, and VIPs.

Indonesia to allow SL asylum seekers temporarily disembark in Aceh
	
Indonesia will allow 44 Australian-bound asylum seekers from Sri Lanka to temporarily disembark in Aceh Besar district, Aceh, Thursday morning (16/06) for food and boat repair after they were stranded for five days at the waters off Lhoknga coast.
Aceh provincial administration spokesman Fran Dellian said the asylum seekers were allowed to come ashore after Vice President Jusuf Kalla sent a memo on Wednesday afternoon instructing Aceh Governor Zaini Abdullah to temporarily host the asylum seekers.
In the memo, Kalla instructed the Aceh government to provide food to the 44 asylum seekers, which include a pregnant woman and nine children. The memo also said Aceh must help to repair the boat and provide fuel before they are released back to international waters.
However, none of asylum seekers are allowed to land their feet in Aceh soil, Fran said.
Indonesian authorities normally place asylum seekers intercepted in Indonesian waters to detention centers, where their asylum status is then processed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and International Organization for Migration (IOM).
There are currently more than 13,000 refugees and asylum-seekers registered with the UNHCR in the archipelago, while detention centers in Indonesia are overcapacity.
Josef Benedict, Amnesty Internationals director of campaigns for Southeast Asia and Pacific, has called on the Indonesian government to allow the asylum seekers to disembark and meet UNHCR officials for interviews.
We are calling on the Indonesian authorities to adopt a consistent approach in these cases. Last year Indonesia won much acclaim for providing refugees and migrants with much-needed assistance during the Andaman Sea boat crisis. It will be a grave injustice if people seeking international protection had their right to seek asylum ignored in Indonesia, Benedict said in a statement on Wednesday.
Refugees and asylum-seekers frequently travel without identity documents, as often these documents are either difficult to obtain or get lost during the journey. This has no consequence on these peoples right to seek asylum. UNHCR should be allowed to register them immediately, he added.
The group  comprising of Sri Lankas Tamil minority  had traveled for more than 20 days heading to Australia on a boat bearing an Indian flag. Despite many recent improvements, there are still concerns about discriminatory practices against Tamils by law enforcement officials in Sri Lanka. (Jakarta Globe)

Mahendran spent 140 days abroad and only 180 days here: D.E.W
	
Former chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) D. E. W. Gunasekera yesterday pointed out that Central Bank (CB) Governor Arjuna Mahendran had spent 140 days abroad and only 180 days in Sri Lanka since his appointment to the top post in the Central Bank one and a half years ago.
Addressing the weekly news conference of the joint opposition, the former MP said he was aware of many things about the governor but will not reveal them because of the issue of parliamentary privileges.
A majority of the ministers within the government also do not like him. Heads of private sector entities, the public, economists and academics have said they were disappointed in the Central Bank Governor's performance so far. As a result there is absolutely no reason to protect him, he said.
He said Parliament was dissolved before the report of the COPE could be published, but even after 11 months, no action has been taken. A promise was made to probe the Central Bank Bond Sale scam under a new government and a new COPE, but nothing has come of that either," he said.
Mr. Gunasekera said when he was in Parliament recently, a request had been sent out to the members of COPE to participate in a debate. Attempts are being made to prevent the governor from being summoned to Parliament. Why is this he questioned.
Meanwhile, joint opposition leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane requested President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint an honest and credible official to the post of governor instead of re-appointing Arjuna Mahendran. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Mechanism to regulate electronic media
	
A permanent regulatory mechanism will be set up to monitor the Electronic Media soon after the Right to Information Bill is passed in Parliament, Deputy Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana said yesterday.
He told the weekly news briefing that though there was a number of monitoring bodies and self censorship for the print media, the electronic media did not have such a mechanism and that the electronic media functions amid several complaints.
Admitting that media culture, ethics and discipline is at the lowest level in respect of TV stations and FM radio, the minister said guidelines for the electronic media were long overdue.
Responding to a journalist he said, FM radio listeners and TV viewers are frustrated when tele-dramas telecast during the prime time runs for less than 12 minutes while rest of the time is occupied by advertisements. The FM radio stations violate the rights of respected and popular singers by airing extremely low quality re-mix programmes contributing to the degeneration and erosion of Sinhala music, lyrics and songs.
The Right to Information Bill is expected to be presented for the second and third reading next Thursday and is likely to be passed unanimously.
The enactment of the Right to Information Bill is a victory for the Unity Government. The 2002 - 2004 UNP government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe attempted to introduce a RTI but failed and then Speaker Karu Jayasuriya presented it as a Private members Bill and failed. President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the Right to Information Bill was unnecessary and that he was there to provide any information, the deputy minister said.
He said the Center for Law and Democracy in Canada had highly commended the government for the introduction of the Right to Information Bill and described it as the 7th best Bill in the world to protect media freedom, right to information and democracy. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

MR urges more development projects with Japan
	
Amid a proliferation of development deals in Sri Lanka, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa says his country and Japan could work on more projects together, including hospitals and highways.
I believe that the infrastructure projects are very important for Sri Lanka after the war, Rajapaksa said during an interview with The Japan Times on Wednesday in Tokyo.
Everybody started giving to us. So we took it. But Japan also helped us a lot.
Japan and China are locked in head-to-head competition in Sri Lanka, a strategically important country that sits near a key Indian Ocean sea lane.
Under Rajapaksa, who is credited with ending a more than two-decades war against the separatist Tamil Tigers, the Sri Lankan economy grew rapidly. He also awarded a slew of lucrative development projects to China  projects his critics say became a hotbed of corruption. He lost an election last year after being accused of nepotism and corruption.
According to the Sri Lankan foreign ministry, China now has the most ODA (Official Development Assistance) projects in Sri Lanka. Yet under the standard set by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Japan is the largest ODA sponsor in Sri Lanka.
China is not a member of the OECD.
As Rajapaksa was seen as being too pro-China, his successor, President Maithripala Sirisena, has been trying to recalibrate the nations policy and has put up for review all ODA projects that were started during Rajapaksas tenure.
Some of the Chinese ODA deals have been canceled or put under review. But the $1.4 billion Colombo Port City project with China  the largest in Sri Lankas history  has been restarted, a testament to the strategically important role Beijing plays in the country.
As for Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also pledged an up to 13 billion loan to Sri Lanka to digitalize terrestrial television broadcasting when he met with Rajapaksa in 2014, but that project was also reviewed.
Still, Abe pledged a further 38 billion loan during a bilateral talk with Sirisena after the Group of Seven summit in Mie Prefecture last month.
Abe also promised to provide two patrol ships to the island nation, which is considered part of Chinas string of pearls strategy to expand its naval presence in the Indian Ocean.
In 2014, a Chinese submarine docked in Sri Lanka, an action that angered India.
Rajapaksa also said that Japan could provide ships and personnel training for sea-lane patrols.(The Japan Times)

No dual citizenship for SL refugees in India; official
	
Sri Lankan refugees living in India cannot be given dual citizenship as demanded by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa because India does not recognize dual citizenship, an Indian official told the Indian Express on Wednesday.
The official was responding to the demand for the grant of dual citizenship made by the TN Chief Minister when she met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Tuesday.
India does not recognize dual citizenship. It has a category called the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) which is meant for people of Indian Origin living in various countries as citizens of those countries. But to be an OCI, a person has to show documentary proof of his or her Indian origin. Sri Lankan Tamil refugees are not people of Indian origin, the official said. 
In other words, the TN Chief Ministers demand can be considered only after India changes its citizenship law to recognize dual citizenship, and that is a far cry.
Asked to comment on the Chief Ministers demand, S. C. Chandrahasan, head of the Chennai-based Organization for Eelam Refugee Rehabilitation (OfERR), said that to claim dual nationality, the refugees must first of all have Sri Lankan nationality. But many of them have no documents to prove that they are Lankan nationals, having lost them when they fled the country during the 30 year conflict. Therefore the first step should be to give them Lankan citizenship, he said.
There were 24,000 Lankan refugee children born in India, who did not have any documents. Due to the efforts of OfERR, the Tamil Nadu government, and the Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai, mobile registration units toured the refugee camps and got many registered for securing Lankan citizenship papers. 8,000 of the 24,000 kids without papers got registered.
But Tamil extremist groups attacked the mobile registration units at Erode in 2013 and Salem in 2015, and stalled the entire process of registration. The government gave threat to law and order as the reason for the stoppage of the process forgetting that it was the refugees fundamental right to apply for citizenship of their country, Chandrahasan said.
OfERR is basically opposed to Lankan Tamil refugees continually living in India because they have to return to their homeland to claim their lost rights to lands and livelihood. Along with the Lankan Minster of Resettlement, D. M. Swaminathan, OfERR is arranging for land titles to be given to the returning refugees.

Sri Lanka is keen to attract investments from Delhi for its ports and civil aviation sector much on the lines that Beijing has invested in these key sectors in the country, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva has said. 
"Sri Lanka is redefining its identity -- as an Indian Ocean Region country besides being South Asian nation. Lanka is located in the pathways between Africa and Australia. It wants to leverage its relation with both India and China. We are keen on Indian investments in both ports and aviation sector," Minister De Silva told the Economic Times in an interview.
He was one the key speakers at the inaugural of Gateway of India dialogue (geo-economics dialogue) organised by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs and Mumbai based think tank Gateway House.
Allaying India's fears about Chinese footprints in Sri Lanka, the deputy minister claimed that Delhi's security concerns from Beijing's presence in Sri Lanka have been addressed.

They agreed to pay the salary anomalies within two weeks, to follow a uniform method with regards to recruitment as well as resolve issues related to overtime payments, Mr. Bandara said.
He however warned that if the promises were not kept and favourable solutions were not given to these problems, it would precipitate yet another strike action, which would be launched from midnight on July 4. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Sri Lanka Cricket which is pressing for disciplinary action against Kithuruwan Vithanage and Ramith Rambukwella over their late night brawl with a group of people at a hotel in Battaramulla has received strong resistance from a group people within the cricket executive committee. 
Vithanage and Rambukwella were both named in the Sri Lanka A squad for the forthcoming series against England but SLC wanted both to be withdrawn on disciplinary grounds after their recent off-field frolics. SLC sources said they would be withdrawn from the tour. 
However, an administrator with a strong connection to one of the players and also a member of the national selection committee have vehemently opposed the SLC decision to withdraw both from the tour. These people certainly have vested interests and wants these two in the team. But theres a serious case of misconduct and we need to deal it before its too late, SLC sources said.
SLC disciplinary committee which met on Tuesday night issued a show cause letter to Vithanage who was present at the inquiry but his partner in crime Rambukwella had not been present saying he had not received a letter. 
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday denied rumours that skipper Angelo Mathews engaged in a heated argument with chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya and Coach Graham Ford over the axing of all-rounder Milinda Siriwardane from the limited over side to face Ireland and England. Siriwardane was sent back home at the conclusion of the three match Test series against England despite a decent record in limited over cricket. Sources say Mathews was unhappy with selectors decision to axe him and had confronted the chief selector at the dressing room at the end of the Lords match.

Sustainable Development and Wild Life Conservation Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said he would order an inquiry into the statements made by the Warden of the Yala National Park during an interview with Daily Mirror.
He said the interview had embarrassed the ministry and tarnished the image of the government.
The minister denied the allegations made by Yala Warden Suranga Ratnayake that he had asked him to apologize to Minister Sajith Premadasa.
I was not allowed to do my duty by Minister Premadasa. He kept visiting the Yala Park as he wished without following Wild Life Department regulations. One day, I spoke directly to the minister about it.
In response Minister Premadasa said he had a habit of visiting the park and that just because I had been appointed as the new park warden, such habits could not be changed. Minister Jayawickrama asked me to apologize to Minister Premadasa over this incident. But, I didnt do so, because I had done no wrong, the warden is quoted as saying.
However, the minister said Mr. Suranga had uttered lies and that he had no right to make such statement to the media.
We will wait till situation settles down. He has made serious damage to the government. Minister Premadasa is an animal lover and a senior minister. His habit of visiting the Yala is not an offence at all. He was the one who phoned me and informed me that he heard some gun shots within the Yala sanctuary on the day the raid was carried out by the WLCD officials. I had instructed Suranga to make a complaint to the police before the suspected poachers are produced in Court. He did not do so, the minister said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
