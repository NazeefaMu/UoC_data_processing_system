He will also meet several leaders for discussions on bilateral relations and international issues.

President Sirisena will also interact with global leaders at the reception host by US President Barak Obama and at the reception and luncheon host by UNSG Ban Ki-moon.   

The UNO and surrounding areas are under a heavy security blanket after the explosion that took place within hours of the arrival of advance delegations. (Kesara Abeywardena)
