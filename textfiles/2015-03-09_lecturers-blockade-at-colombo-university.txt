Academics of the Colombo University have occupied the Vice Chancellor's office in protest over their call for him to resign.
Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) spokesperson Dr. Nirmal Dewasiri told Daily Mirror that they initiated their protest about an hour ago and added they are planning to continue occupying the VC office until the authorities respond to their call.
"We called for the VC's resignation about a month and a half ago. However he hasn't responded to our demand. Therefore we occupied his office and even though he is absent we are hoping the relevant authorities would respond promptly, "he added.
Dr. Dewasiri said that they have informed the Cabinet minister for higher education concerning their course of action. (Lakna Paranamanna)
