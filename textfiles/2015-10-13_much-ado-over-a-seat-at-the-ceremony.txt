Much ado over a seat at the ceremony!


	


Many politicos from all levels of the polity were present at the national food drive launched by the new Big Boss in Kilinochchi recently. A ministerial one tasked with overseeing the Northern affairs from Colombo was among the participants. He had thrown a tantrum when he was directed on arrival to a seat at the far end of the front row at the ceremony.
He summoned the officials responsible for organizing the event and gave them a tongue-lashing for the slight done to him. “Do you expect me to sit at that far away corner?  I am leaving…” he railed at them. 
The officials tendered their humble apologies and immediately arranged a seat for him close to the one reserved for the Big Boss. 
The change made in seating had somewhat pacified the Ministerial one and he sat through the proceedings until the conclusion of the ceremony, they say.
