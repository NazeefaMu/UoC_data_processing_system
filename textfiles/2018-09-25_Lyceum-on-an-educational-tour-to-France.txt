Sri Lanka in its pursuit to provide international exposure to its students sent a group of 55 students and eight teachers of French Language on an educational tour to France from August 18 to 29, 2018.


The educational tour was organised in collaboration with Education & Beyond Pvt. Ltd., a New Delhi based company specialising in educational tours to France.
This is the third tour to France organised by Lyceum Nugegoda.


However, the particularity of this tour is that this time, three other Lyceum Schools, i.e. Lyceum Wattala, Gampaha and Panadura, also participated in the tour.
The collaboration intends to bring the brothers and sisters of the school network closer together as well.


The tour was under the able guidance of the Coordinating Principal Mrs Kumari Grero, and the French Faculty, headed by Ms Udeshika Perera
The students attended French lessons in prestigious language schools in Paris as a part of the tour.


The students and the teachers stayed with host families carefully chosen by E&B so that the group may have a complete French experience.
Teachers and cultural guides accompanied the students to sustain the academic outlook of the programme.


The visits included, among many others, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, the Notre Dame Cathedral, the Fontainebleau Castle, the Sacré Cœur Basilica, the Asterix Park, the Versailles Palace, the Luxembourg Gardens and a cruise on the river Seine.


The students also met the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to France Buddhi K. Athauda during a visit to the Sri Lankan Embassy in Paris.


Upon their return, the students are engaged in project presentations partly in French, partly in English, which is also an important part of the project.
