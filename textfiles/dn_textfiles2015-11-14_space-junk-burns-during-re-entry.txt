Space junk burns off during re-entry

The space junk designated as 'WT1190F' exploded when it entered the Earth's atmosphere yesterday, Arthur C Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies (ACCIMT) Deputy Director (Media) Chinthana Wijayawardana said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the scientists aboard the special aircraft Gulfstream 450 had observed the object in the sky, and said it exploded about 100 km above sea level. He noted the falling space debris, which blasted during reentry, had burned off and no piece of it had splashed into the sea. He said those in ground stations had not been able to observe the reentry or the blast.
"We organised an observation camp in Tangalle and a large number of people and students took part in it.
A group from the Planetarium and several foreigners also joined the camp. Another observation camp had been organized at the Ruhuna University. A No Fly-Zone was also declared between 11am and 1 pm and the Navy was on alert. Fishermen were advised not to go to sea," he explained.

A US research group had been aboard the UAE's private jet which observed the space debris. The group was led by Peter Jenkins of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). The flight had touched down at the Katunayake International Airport last noon before its return.
The space junk thought to be a component from a spacecraft bound for the Moon was expected to fall into the the Indian Ocean, about 65 Kms south of Sri Lanka around 11.48 am yesterday. The object had had a speed of about 7-10 km per second, and it's diameter before breaking into pieces was said
to be about two metres.
