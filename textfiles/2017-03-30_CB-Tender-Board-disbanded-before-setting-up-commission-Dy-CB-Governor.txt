Giving evidence before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate the Central Bank Bond Issue, the Deputy Governor of Central Bank P. Samarasiri said yesterday all of them were removed from the Tender Board even before the setting up of this Commission in view of the good governance.

He further said he was displeased with the appointment of Ms. Senevirathna to the Public Debt Department considering her limited knowledge on Public Finance and her lack of competence to administer the Public Debt Department.

Evidence was led before the Commission comprising Supreme Court Judges K. T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Jayawardena and former Auditor General Veluppillai Kandasamy. (Manopriya Gunasekera and Ranjan Katugampola)
