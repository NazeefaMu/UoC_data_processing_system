Study finds toxic chemical in Kelani River


	

Studies conducted by the Centre for Environment and Nature Studies (CENS) have found high levels of toxic chemical Arsenic - nearly 0.004 kg / m3 (4.00 milligrams) per litre - in several areas in the Kelani River which is main source of drinking water for Colombo and its suburbs.
Environmentalist and Researcher Ravindra Kariyawasam of the CENS yesterday told the Daily Mirror that the highest level of arsenic was found in water samples obtained near the Ambatale Pumping Station.
He said the arsenic contamination of the Kelani River was caused due to the release of chemicals and effluent substances by over 150 industries located in the Biyagama Industrial Zone.
According to him, it takes about 20 years for even an atom of arsenic to get decomposed and the duration for the decomposition of nearly 0.004 kg / m3 arsenic found in Kelani River waters will take decades.
Due to the arsenic contagion, the natural water purifying process in the Kelani River had come to a standstill after micro species and trees which contributed in natural water purifying had been harmed continuously, Environmentalist Kariyawasam said.
He also said as far as he was concerned, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board was not having a method to chlorinate water contaminated by arsenic adding the situation might cause dangerous health problems for the consumers.
It is known that consuming high levels of arsenic could lead to serious medical complications such as skin, lungs, bladder and kidney cancers and other toxic health effects, including cardiovascular disease, neurological problems and developmental disorders.
He said that a series of studies was being carried out by the CENS since 2013 on the Kelani River, Po River in Italy and Satluj River in India.
The studies are being conducted by several qualified persons including Prof. Rajesh Goyal from Desh Bhagat University, India, Prof. D.F.Gerewal from India, German Scientist Freeza Michelle and Italian Scientist Ayarin Giagomppi. The CENS is a registered non-profitable institution run by private funds of the contributors, Mr. Kariyawasam said.
The full report of the findings of their studies will be handed over to the Environment Ministry and President Maithripala Sirisena with the completion of the studies in December, 2016.
He also said it was they who conducted the studies on the Rathupaswala water issue by taking water samples from the area. He said they did not get approval from any government authorities before they conducted studies since they already knew that they would not be allowed to carry out the studies.
