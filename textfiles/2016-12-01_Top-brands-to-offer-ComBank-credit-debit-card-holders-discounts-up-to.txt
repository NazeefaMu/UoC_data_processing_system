More than 100 leading brands have signed on to offer whopping discounts to Commercial Bank’s credit and debit cardholders this festive season, taking the bank’s ‘Max Loyalty Rewards’ programme to new heights.
On since mid-November, these offers are valid on specific days throughout December 2016, at the country’s most popular clothing, shoes, jewellery, accessories, cosmetics, perfume, sportswear and bed linen outlets, the 
bank said.
Discounts on payment by Commercial Bank credit cards range from 15 percent to 50 percent and from 10 percent to 50 percent on debit cards, with some outlets offering discounts on two days and others for periods of up to 15 days.
Commercial Bank is the first bank to offer loyalty rewards for both credit and debit card holders under its Max Loyalty Rewards scheme. The bank was also a pioneer in extending promotional discount offers, which were traditionally only offered for credit cards to its debit cards.
