A fully equipped Media Centre would be established in Parliament complex to facilitate journalists who report Parliamentary proceedings, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.

He said United States Agency for International Development (USAID) would provide funds for the project and added that he expected the support from the Government and Parliament to make it a success.

Mr. Jayasuriya expressed these views at a workshop held at Heritance Hotel in Negombo for Lobby Journalists to develop their capacity.

He requested journalists to submit their suggestions to implement the project successfully. (Ajith Siriwardana)
