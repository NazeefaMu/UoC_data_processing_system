Fishing in troubled waters


	

Several purohitas had pressed the authorities in the highest echelons to take stern action against parties responsible for getting a young boy to shout anti-government slogans at the paadayathra. 


Accordingly, the authority handling child care has been directed to take action against the politicos responsible for grooming the boy for the role he played. Action is also being taken to file a court case for abusing a minor for a political purpose. 


Meanwhile, a secret plan is underway to use the legal action in this case as a lever to hook one or two members from the JO camp, they say.
