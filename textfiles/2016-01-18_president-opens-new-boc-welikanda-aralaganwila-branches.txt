Bank of Ceylon (BOC) opened its 626th newest branch in Welikanda and relocated its Aralaganwila branch recently. 
The fully-fledged branch was opened by President Maithripala Sirisena at the invitation of BOC Chairman President’s Counsel Ronald C. Perera at a ceremony held at the branch premises.     
“With the opening of the Welikanda branch and relocation of Aralaganwila branch to a spacious and convenient location, we ensure that our customers in those areas can get the best banking solutions with utmost convenience. With special reference to Welikanda opening, we look beyond providing banking solutions - that is to empower the residents of this area by getting involved with agricultural development projects through our small and medium enterprise (SME) and microfinance schemes and livelihood development. We also look forward to gradually enhancing the financial literacy of these people,” stated Perera.
The two branches comprise an ATM facility that enables 24-hour banking access to customers. Being part of the bank’s wide branch network of 625, these branches enable their customers to connect with any other branch spread across the country. The customers can also enjoy all the other retail banking facilities available in any other BOC branch, including the bank’s online banking facility and its newest ‘Smartgen’ product.
