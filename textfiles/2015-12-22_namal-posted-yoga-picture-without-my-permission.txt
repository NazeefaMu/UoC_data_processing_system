	Former president and Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said his son Namal had published his photograph doing Yoga without his permission in the Facebook.
	He said this to a journalist when he visited the Prison Hospital in Welikada to meet the five army personnel arrested on charges of being involved in the abduction and disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda.
	“I have been doing Yoga for some time now but it had been exposed in the media only when I visited this school with Namal,” Mr. Rajapaksa said.
	It is my Yoga practice that has helped me to be in shape.
	The photograph posted on MP Namal Rajapaksa’s Facebook account on Sunday shows former Mr. Rajapaksa in a Yoga posture on the day after he celebrated his 70th birthday. Yoga instructor Nanda Siriwardena is seated beside him.
	Mr. Rajapaksa wished Mr. Siriwardena a happy birthday and wished him long life. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
