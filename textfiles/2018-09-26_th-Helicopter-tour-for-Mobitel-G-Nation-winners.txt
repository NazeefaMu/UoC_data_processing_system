Sri Lanka’s National Mobile Services Provider, recently hosted loyal customers to an unforgettable experience in the skies via a Helicopter ride for the 05th time. The aim of this initiative was to showcase the wide-spread 4G coverage and expansion drive of the Company. 

Take –off was in Negombo and winners of the 4G Nation Campaign were treated to this once-in –a-lifetime experience that allowed them to see the steps taken by Mobitel to set up more towers for easy accessibility in rural areas. Past tours included sight-seeing of Galle, Ampara, Anuradhapura and Trincomalee as a part of this island-wide campaign that is now on its 05th leg. Mobitel constantly lives up to its “We Care. Always' brand promise, and the roll-out of 4G LTE is testament to its promise to create equal access to the internet throughout the country at affordable rates. Here, the winners of Mobitel 4G Nation Campaign pose for photographs with the helicopter before taking to the skies.
