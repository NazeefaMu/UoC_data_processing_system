Just deserts for those behind the misleading gazette


	



 

A highly controversial gazette notification has now turned the T-bond issue into a tangle within a tangle.

 


A media communique issued purportedly by the secretary to the Ministry handling the public purse to clarify matters created ripples in official circles as it appeared to be an indirect attempt at justifying the gazette notification, they say.


Inquiries instituted later had revealed that the Ministry secretary had nothing to do with the media communique and the purohita involved in the issue was behind its issuance using his personal secretary as a cat’s paw. 


A full report on the fiasco has been submitted to Number One and the first head to roll is that of the personal secretary who carried out the political authority’s order, they say.
