Another drama by Ranjan


	

Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday played another drama by getting his uncle Prof. Carlo Fonseka to mention that the latter had given him money for his election campaign.

“ Ranjan is my sister’s grandson. Therefore I always come for his help whenever he falls in trouble or whenever he is facing a court case. He belongs to a political party and I belong to another political party. However I am happy about the stand he took with regard to the Bond scam and on the SAITM issue,” Prof. Fonseka said.

“Uncle please tell the media that you have given money for my campaign,” Mr. Ramanayake told Prof. Fonseka.

“ That is just a small sum of money,” Prof. Fonseka answered. (Yohan Perera)
