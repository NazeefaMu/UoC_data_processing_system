UNP attempting to destroy SLFP: MR


	

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today UNP was attempting to destroy the SLFP completely and that President Maithripala Sirisena as the SLFP chairman had not acted to look after the party rank and file, uphold party policies and protect the identity of the SLFP as expected.


“There clearly is a concerted effort on the part of the UNP to destroy the SLFP completely. When President Maithripala Sirisena took over the position of SLFP chairman, it was expected that he would look after the party rank and file, uphold party policies and protect the identity of the SLFP even though he was elected President on UNP votes. Regrettably, that has not happened,” he said.


Ex-President Rajapaksa said SLFP members in the government should decide which was more important to them, the UNP led government or the SLFP through which they were elected last August to represent the people on an anti-UNP, anti-government platform.
