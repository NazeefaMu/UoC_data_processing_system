The engine drivers, of the Rajarata Rajini Express train and that of Train No: 872, managed to stop their trains at a distance of five metres from each other at Gintota this morning.
The express train was travelling from Matara to Colombo and the other from Kandy to Matara. The trains were on the same rail track and moving towards each other when they were stopped in the nick of time.   Pix by Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk
