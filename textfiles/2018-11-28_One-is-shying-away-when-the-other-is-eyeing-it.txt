The green party is gearing up the party machinery for a general poll these days.

 


Some party seniors and a sizable segment of the rank and file are looking up to Deputy Saji to provide the leadership to the party’s election campaign. But he is shying away from this responsibility, they say.


However, there is a sibling of a former party heavyweight quite eager to play the lead role in the party and a group of green backbenchers is already giving him a push.


Meanwhile, some party sources close to this ambitious sibling say his dream is to secure the more powerful Number Two position conceding the Number One place to Deputy Saji.
