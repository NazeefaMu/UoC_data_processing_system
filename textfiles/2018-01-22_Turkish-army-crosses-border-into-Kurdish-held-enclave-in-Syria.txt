DPA, 21st JANUARY, 2018-Turkish ground forces have crossed the Syrian border into the Kurdish-held enclave of Afrin, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported Sunday.


The Turkish army was reportedly accompanied by Ankara-allied Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters.
Turkey launched its “Olive Branch” military operation with an air campaign on Saturday after eight days of cross-border artillery shelling by Turkish soldiers.


Afrin is controlled by US-backed Kurdish militias that Turkey describes as “terrorists.”
