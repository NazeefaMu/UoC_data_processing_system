The Ministry of Science, Technology and Research announced yesterday that the planetarium would be kept open on Sundays starting from tomorrow (4) in a move to popularize the subject of astronomy among the public and schoolchildren in particular.

The Ministry’s Media Secretary Mahesh Samarasekara in a statement said the decision to extend the opening hours of this popular attraction could be considered as the initial step to popularize astronomy and increase its interest among the public.

Accordingly, he said a special public lecture on astronomy and the planetarium show would be held tomorrow at 10.00 am, where the lecture would be conducted by Prof. Chandana Jayaratne. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
