The Defence Ministry today assured that security forces and all intelligence agencies were on full alert on the possibility of any groups having links with the ISIS making their appearance in Sri Lanka.
 
A statement issued by the ministry said some media reports had mentioned the presence of ISIS terrorists in the country or that groups having links to the ISIS were emerging in Sri Lanka.
“Security forces wish to give categorical assurance that they are on full alert to the possibilities of any links or emergence of IS groups in Sri Lanka round the clock as it is the prime responsibility of the Security Forces and National Intelligence,” it said.
The ministry said it was also noteworthy to remind that revelations in media reports, some with vital and sensitive information, often tend to become counterproductive and could jeopardize the efforts to identify such elements.
“However, the situation is in no way a cause for alarm or panic, and any information to that effect as of now cannot be divulged to the Media since such intelligence is yet to be analyzed, evaluated and properly established,” the ministry said.
