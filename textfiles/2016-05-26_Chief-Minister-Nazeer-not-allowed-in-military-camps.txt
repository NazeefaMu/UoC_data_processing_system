Eastern Province Chief Minister Nazeer Ahamed would not be allowed to enter military camps and the three forces would not participate in functions attended by the Chief Minister, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) said.

Defense Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said the decision was taken after considering a request by the security forces to do so.

He said the security forces have been perturbed following the recent incident where Chief Minister Ahamed rebuked a naval officer during an event held at the Sampur Maha Vidyalaya.
