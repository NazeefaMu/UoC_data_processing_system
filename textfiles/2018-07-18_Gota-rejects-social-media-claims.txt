Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa today rejected reports circulating in the social media purported to be from the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, claiming to have appointed him as the Presidential Candidate for 2020.

“I wish to inform that a fake media release circulating in social media, purported to be from the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, claiming to have appointed me as the Presidential Candidate for 2020, is totally inaccurate and is an attempt by certain parties to mislead and confuse the people and political stakeholders,” the former Defence Secretary said in a Facebook message.
