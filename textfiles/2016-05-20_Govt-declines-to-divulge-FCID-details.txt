Govt. declines to divulge FCID details


	

The government yesterday declined to divulge details such as names, professional and educational qualifications and experience of police officers serving in the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) to Parliament because of an ongoing court case.

Joint Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila had placed a question on the Order Paper seeking such details. Yet, Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunatilake said it would be subjudice to answer it because of the court case.

Mr. Gammanpila disputed it and said only the legality of the FCID had been challenged, but there was no case against those serving there. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
