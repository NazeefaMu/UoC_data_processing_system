The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) said today the Mattala International Airport warehouse complex would be released soon because tenders were being called from rice millers countrywide for the sale of paddy stocks including those at Mattala.
PMB Chairman M.B. Dissanayake told Daily Mirror online that the paddy stocks currently in government storage facilities including warehouse complex of the Mattala International Airport would be sold to private rice mills through tenders.
Protests were held after the government decided to store paddy from the Hambantota District in the MIA warehouse complex.
Mr. Dissanayake had told the media that the MIAwarehouses were being used to store paddy because they were not being made use of. (Piyumi Fonseka)
