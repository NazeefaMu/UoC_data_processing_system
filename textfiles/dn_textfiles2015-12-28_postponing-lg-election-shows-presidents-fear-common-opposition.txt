'Postponing LG election shows President's fear for common opposition'

Postponing the local government election shows that the President fears the Common Opposition, UPFA Parliamentarin Vasudeva Nanayakkara said.
He said that there is no need to postpone the local government election by six months. "It is true that it needs some time to hold the election. But only one month is enough for that," he said. Nanayakkara also said that people's confidence on the President has been weakened.
He said the statement made by a government minister claiming that a team of opposition MPs would join the government is false. "I have no idea about the discussions that are being held to offer ministerial portfolios to the opposition MPs but the opposition MPs do not want to jump into the fire," he said.
