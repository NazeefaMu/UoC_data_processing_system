Passing Away of Most Ven. Habarakada Indrarathana Thera

It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing away of Chief Adhikarana Sangha Nayake, Keerthi Shri Paryapthi Visharada, Most Ven. Habarakada Indrarathana Thera, on October 1, 2017.  

The Most Ven. Thera was born in Thawalama, Habarakada on October 16, 1937 and received his primary education at the Thawalama Habarakada Government School. On December 5, 1951, he was ordained as a Samanera Bhikku under the tutelage of Ven. Mavanane Sri Sonuththara Mahanayake Thera, Chief Incumbent of the historic Rotumba Budugala Rajamaha Viharaya and Ven.



Mawanane Keerthi Sri Premanandhabidana Thera, Adhikarana Sangha Nayaka of Galle and Matara. He received his higher ordination at the historic Seemamalaka of Mahawatte Mahavihara and succeeded in earning a Bachelor’s Honours Degree, a Master’s Degree and Diploma in Education from the Vidyodaya University.  


The Ven. Thera leaves behind a generation of young Buddhist monks he raised, who are today leading efforts to preserve and promote Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka


Though he was born in a very remote village, Most Ven. Habarakada Indrarathana Thera rose to greater heights as an erudite scholar. While his career in teaching spanned 33 years, he will be remembered especially for the outstanding service he rendered while teaching at Ananda College, Colombo where the Most Ven. Thera actively promoted his ideals for a society of Buddhist values and morals, together with Ven. Diviyagaha Yasassi Thera.  

In his endeavours to propagate the Dhamma, Most Ven. Habarakada Indrarathana Thera served as the Assistant Secretary of the Sri Lanka Buddhist Congress and Chief Patron of the past pupils’ association of the Vidyodaya Pirivena, and the Old Anandians’ Buddhist Association. He authored the books – “Atalodahamen Kampa Noveema” and “Podina Pilivetha” – that have been widely read by Buddhists all over the island, while his efforts to propagate the Dhamma took him to countries far and wide.  

Most Ven. Habarakada Indrarathana Thera rendered an unparalleled service to anyone in need without prejudice, and helped those affected by the 2004 Tsunami and the more recent natural disasters such as floods and landslides. The Ven. Thera leaves behind a generation of young Buddhist monks he raised, who are today leading efforts to preserve and promote Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka and around the world.  

The remains of Most Ven. Habarakada Indrarathana Thera lie at the Hiniduma Habarakada Sri Wijayananda Piriven Viharaya. The last rites will be conducted in this evening (4) at the Thawalama Vidyaraja School Grounds.  

May Most Ven. Habarakada Indrarathana Thera attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!
