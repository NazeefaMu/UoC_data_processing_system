The team of counsel of the Attorney General’s Department, who were led by Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera today in an uncharacteristic manner said that they have no questions to ask from the three witnesses (Minister Kabir Hashim, Minister Malik Samarawickrama and former EPF dealer Saman Kumara) when the Commission invited to question them if necessary.

The Commission stated that Minister Minister of Public Enterprises development Kabir Hashim and Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama had been summoned by them and were not listed by the Attorney General’s Department.

After the conclusion of the Commission’s questioning, the Commission asked the Counsel of the Attorney General’s Department whether they have any questions to ask from the two ministers.

However, Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera said: “We have no questions to ask”.

In the absence of Aloysius’ personal assistant Steve Samuel, former EPF dealer Saman Kumara was then called to give evidence. This witness was one of the witnesses that the Counsel of the Attorney General’s Department had earlier suggested to be summoned.

However, after the Conclusion of the Commission’s questioning the Counsel of the Attorney General’s Department again did not question Saman Kumara as well. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
