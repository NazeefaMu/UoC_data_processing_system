Government MP Hirunika Premachandra dropped a bombshell in Parliament today by claiming that there was a Mafia in the Prison and influential inmates were given all facilities.

Speaking during the Committee Stage debate on the Budget, the MP said influential prisoners were given all facilities, while the poor prisoners were neglected.

She said former Minister Duminda Silva was given all facilities following a medical report.

"Mr. Silva's medical report says he is suffering from a chronic headache, loss of consciousness, loss of memory and dizziness but all his relatives visited him at the Prisons hospital for his birthday on December 3 and threw a party," the MP said.

"Duminda Silva killed my father but I am not angry with him but I have to say what is going on inside prison," she added. (Yohan Perera)
