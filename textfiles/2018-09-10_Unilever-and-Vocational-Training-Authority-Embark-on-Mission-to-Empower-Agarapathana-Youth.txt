The Vocational Training Center launched by Unilever Sri Lanka and the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTA)in Agarapathana

Unilever Sri Lanka and the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTA) unveiled a vocational training center in the town of Agarapathana recently. The launch ceremony was attended by over 150 people including VTA Chairman Ravi Jayawardana, Ceytea factory manageress Anusha Kotelawala and the first batch of students and their families.The center, located near Unilever’s Ceytea factory, is a part of the company’s Project Arunella that was launched earlier this year under the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan.

To ensure the long term success of the vocational training center as well as those who attend it, Unilever and the VTA thoroughly analyzed the needs of the community in terms of skill levels and available employment opportunities. Following this analysis it was decided to offer four courses to train people to become beauticians, hair stylists, ICT technicians, and electricians. These professions were deemed to offer people in the area the best opportunity at long term employment.
Each course will last six months and the center will have two intakes of 60 students each year.

The inaugural intake received an overwhelming response receiving over 150 applications, mainly from family members of Ceytea factory employees, for the programs of whom 60 students have been enrolled.

Commenting on the launch Mr. Ravi Jayawardana, Chairman – Vocational Training Authourity, said, “At the Vocational Training Authority we are dedicated to making the youth of Sri Lanka more skilled and employable by making vocational training more accessible across the country. This is why we are proud to be launching this vocational training center with Unilever. This center will impart the students of this community with invaluable skills that will help them build a career and enjoy economic prosperity. Hence, projects like this help empower communities and strengthen the national economy.”
