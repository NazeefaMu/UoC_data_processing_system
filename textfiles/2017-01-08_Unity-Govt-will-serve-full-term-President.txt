President Maitripala Sirisena, in his second year anniversary speech, asserted that the current national unity government would serve its full term, and said anyone interested in nation building should join hands with it.

He said some politicians who had been rejected by the people were talking about elections, but the elections would only be conducted in another four years' time. Therefore, he said there should not be any doubts about the government.

Addressing the ‘National Convention’ held this afternoon at the BMICH to mark the completion of two years since his victory at the Presidential Election, President Sirisena said the Presidential election was held in 2015 as the Mahinda Rajapaksa government could not face the aggressive attitude of the international community towards it and the impending economic crisis.
