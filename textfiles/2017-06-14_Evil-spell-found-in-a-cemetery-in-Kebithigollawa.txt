A copper plate with the names of President Maithripala Sirisena, and three brothers of Minister Duminda Dissanayake inscribed on them suspected as an evil spell had been found in a cemetery in Ussagalla Kebithigollawa by two youths.

The names of President Maithripala Sirisena, former NCP Minister Hethuhamige Nandasena, NCP Minister Susil Gunerathne, his son Thusitha Gunerathne and names of the three brothers of Minister Duminda Dissanayake, Kavin, Amila and Ravindra had been inscribed on this copper plate with their faces also drawn.

The charmer who had done this spell had drawn the faces of six persons and drawn a picture purported to be that of the President and written his name on either side.

The two youths who had been engaged in some construction work in the cemetery had found this spell, along with broken egg shells, Joss Sticks, Red Flowers, Coconut oil and some oil lamps. As the spell had the names of the President the youths had handed over it to a reputed person in Kebithigollawa.

Presently a rumor is spreading in Kebithigollawa town that this spell is the work of a former minister. (Upali ananda)
