High drama was witnessed during protest by state’s fishermen pressing a-three-point-charter of demands against the Sri Lankan government on Monday at Nungambakkam after two participants attempted self-immolation.

Fishermen from Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Pudukottai, and Thoothukudi, participated in the demonstration.

Following the protest by fisherfolk, the neighbouring island government ordered the release of 27 Indian fishermen languishing in its prisons with immediate effect.

The protesters who gathered at Valluvar Kottam marched towards the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission at Nungambakkam. Security was in place to prevent  them from going beyond Tank Bund Road.

The firsherfolk objected to the barricading and attempted to go towards the diplomatic mission.  Policemen convinced them to get into the vehicles kept to ferry them to shelters in police custody.

As policemen were engrossed in removing the protesters from the spot, two  participants – Felix Mary and Muniyasamy from Ramanathapuram district, doused themselves with kerosene. The police removed the duo to safety.

The protesters were lodged in community and marriage halls at Nungambakkam, Thousand Lights and Choolaimedu. Those arrested were released in the evening. (deccan chronicle)
