 Elon Musk has likened future versions of Tesla’s Model 3 production line to an ‘alien dreadnaught’ - and now, the first pictures of that vision have emerged.


A Reddit user claiming to work for robot making company Kuka posted the images of what he says are 467 robots being delivered to the car-making firm’s California HQ. 


 SoutheastTraders forum user Mac11FA, via the Tesla subreddit, said he is a Field Service Engineer for Kuka Robotics.


The robots captured in the photos appear to be largely manufactured by Augsburg, Germany-based Kuka robotics, according to Teslarati. The robots, each costing anywhere between $50k to as much as $500k can manage multiple tasks by switching adapters and moving across multiple axes. 
‘Kuka is the world’s leading provider of production systems in the automotive industry,’ the firm boasts on its website.


‘With years of experience, we are the master in the design of flexible and efficient production processes.’


Mac11FA claims he is onsite at the Tesla factory for the next 7 weeks to ‘help set up and commission 467 robots and 21 KL slides’. 


Tesla owners that were touring the factory over the past week have reported seeing the robots .
According to Teslarati, one owner from the Tesla Motors Club (Engle) said, ‘You can’t take photographs, but I can tell everyone that there is an enormous area of the factory where the Model 3 assembly line is being built.  ‘There are Kuka robots all over the place waiting to be installed. It’s a beautiful thing.’


Elon Musk has boasted the firm’s production facility for its much anticipated Model 3 will look like an ‘alien dreadnought’. Musk has said the facility, which is separate from the firm’s ‘Gigafactory’, will be ‘the machine that makes the machine,’ and told analysts it will stun people. However, there will  still be people working in the factory, though, mostly overseeing the robots and making sure everything is running at peak efficiency. 


Most automakers test a new model’s production line by building vehicles with relatively cheap, prototype tools designed to be scrapped once they deliver doors that fit, body panels with the right shape and dashboards that don’t have gaps or seams.tennis player Timo Boll for a recent TV spot.
