Let’s take a closer look at



 

If you feel uncomfortable in crowds the reason might be one of these!
	This will help you figure out whether the complaint made by your loved one is just a normal fear or a phobia...


Agoraphobia and Social Phobia (social anxiety disorder) are two different psychological disorders, which are closely related, but having a thin line differentiating the two. This makes it quite difficult to distinguish one from the other.We are all shy and fear certain moments. At times we feel uncomfortable when moving with a crowd. But some people experience these feelings in a profound manner. Such feelings affect the quality of their lives.   
Today we are going to talk about Agoraphobia and Social Phobia. This will help you figure out whether the complaint made by your loved one is just a normal fear or a phobia.  

 

What is Agoraphobia?

Agoraphobia means that an individual has a fear of leaving home (home-bound). People with such a condition fear being in places or situations from which the escape would be hard or embarrassing in case of a panic attack or medical emergency.  

 

What is Social Phobia?

Social phobia, which is the fear of facing the society, is characterized by undue shyness and showing anxiety when in unfamiliar social gatherings. People with such a condition avoid interaction. For an example, these people will not fear to jog alone on the beach as long as there are no people watching. But they get restless when walking in to a crowded cocktail-party.   

 



If a person experiences symptoms of anxiety and avoidance only during social performance, it is highly likely to be Social phobia. However, if the individual tends to experience the same panic symptoms anywhere outside his familiar comfortable zone the diagnosis will be more 
towards Agoraphobia.   

 

 

How to differentiate the two

The nature of fearful feelings that makes them avoid crowds is categorized in to two types. This makes the clinical diagnosis easier.


The main difference between these two conditions has been identified as the nature of fearful feelings. These feelings make the individual avoid certain types of situations.   


People with Agoraphobia, often avoid public or open places full of people. Such people avoid trains, buses, fairs, carnivals etc. They would prefer staying at home alone or in the company of a trusted companion. They differ from people with Social Phobia who will move in society, but try their best to avoid interaction with others. People who prefer less interactions fancy engaging in things alone. By doing so they can talk less and be less friendlier. They might also want to avoid being in the presence of close companions as well. They also have a feeling that others will notice their trembling and sweaty hands or shaky voice while having conversations. Because of these dislikes they get distressed. Some even experience disturbances in the gastrointestinal system.   


 In contrast to that, Agoraphobic people dislike taking the chance of walking alone anywhere. This is because they have the fear of being helpless in case they experience a panic attack.   

 


Agoraphobia means that an individual has a fear of leaving home (home-bound).

Social phobia, which is the fear of facing the society, is characterized by undue shyness and showing anxiety when in unfamiliar social gatherings. 


 

Behavior patterns 

Real life applications can describe these two conditions so well.


A long hall with less walls, rows of people, driving alone, being far away from home or a restroom or even standing outside their own home are definite nightmares for Agoraphobic people. They will never want to walk in to places like that since they an unfamiliar territories for them.   


Once they return to their normal and familiar places, it will be so relaxing for them that they feel relieved. Social phobic people don’t demarcate places they visit. The only thing they worry about is, being criticized or rejected. They have these scary and insecure feelings in their mind that people will make fun of them, will watch how they behave and observe what they are doing. Because of these reasons they will even avoid speaking, writing, eating, using wash rooms in public, making eye contact with people around them, acting friendly, look up and will ultimately walk away if possible.   
On the other hand, the symptoms of anxiety, dizziness, sweating, tachycardia and palpitation developing in Agoraphobic people are usually unrelated to what they are doing. But, there is a possibility of these people developing fearful thoughts of being scrutinized by others in case they develop panic symptoms, in public.

When psychiatrists work on trying to establish a diagnosis of the condition, a detailed history of the patient is crucial. Information obtained from the patient as well as from a close friend or a family member will be helpful, in some circumstances. This is in order to arrive at an exact conclusion.   

If a person experiences symptoms of anxiety and avoidance only during social performance, it is highly likely to be Social phobia. However, if the individual tends to experience the same panic symptoms anywhere outside his familiar comfortable zone the diagnosis will be more 
towards Agoraphobia.  

 
Take home message

However, in both disorders, individuals will experience similar symptoms associated with anxiety and panic. They will follow a behavioral pattern of avoidance and most importantly will try their level best to create safe zones, based on the nature of fears experienced.   


After all these steps will make them less worried, relaxed, calm and comfortable. As far as the method of treatment for both disorders is considered, different and personalized courses of cognitive behavioral therapy will definitely do miracles.
