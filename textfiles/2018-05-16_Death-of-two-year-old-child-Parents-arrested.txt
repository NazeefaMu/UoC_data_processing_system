The parents of a two-year-old child, who was found dead in a housing complex at Maligawatte, were arrested last night, Police said.

The Maligawatte police launched a probe after they were informed that the boy had died under suspicious circumstances and that his parents had arranged his funeral for Monday without having a postmortem examination.

Police personnel who were sent to the scene on receipt of the information had been told by the child's parents that he had died after suffering from high sugar levels.

The Police said when they examined the child's body they found a burnt injury on the left leg.

Thereafter, they had informed the Hulftsdorp Magistrate about the suspicious circumstances surrounding the boy's death. (Darshan Sanjeewa)
