BCCI unlikely to get govt nod to play in SL
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is unlikely to get a formal clearance from the Union government to play Pakistan in a limited-overs series in Sri Lanka next month, NDTV Sports reported.
Government is likely to turn down BCCI's request for the clearance of the series because it feels the atmosphere is not conducive to restore cricketing ties.
The Pakistan government had given its approval to its cricket Board on Thursday to play India in 'neutral' Sri Lanka. Reportedly, India and Pakistan were scheduled to play three ODIs and two Twenty20 internationals from December 15.
In recent weeks, India and Pakistan had differed over the venue of the series. While Pakistan were adamant that India should play at their adopted 'home', United Arab Emirates, BCCI wanted Pakistan to visit India.
According to the ICC Future Tours Programme, the original schedule involved two Tests, five ODIs and two Twenty20 internationals.
As per a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the two countries in 2014, India and Pakistan are scheduled to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023, with four series to be hosted by Pakistan. Of course, all cricket series between the neighbours need approvals from their respective governments.
Meanwhile, BCCI sources blame ex-Board president N. Srinavasan for signing the MoU to gain Pakistan's support to become ICC chairman.
Pakistan and India last clashed in the ICC World Cup Down Under earlier this year. However, Pakistan toured India in 2012-13 for three ODIs and two Twenty20 internationals. While Pakistan won the ODIs 2-1, honours were shared in the Twenty20s. If India do not honour the MoU, Pakistan could go to an international court for justice.

Indian army chief to visit SL to discuss defense ties
	
Army chief General Dalbir Singh kicks off on Sunday a five-day visit to Sri Lanka where he could discuss upgrading the island nations ageing warplanes, tanks and air defence guns as part of New Delhis efforts to curb Chinas growing influence over Sri Lanka.
If Colombos request to upgrade and overhaul its defence equipment goes through, it would mark a sharp turnaround in Indias policy to not supply lethal military hardware to its southern neighbour because of domestic political compulsions. Broadening military cooperation is under active consideration, a defence ministry source said.
Indias traditional reluctance to meet Sri Lankas military requirements due to Tamil Nadu politics has forced the neighbour to turn to China and Pakistan, causing a sense of discomfort in New Delhi. That could change as PM Narendra Modis party has a majority in the lower House of Parliament. Singh is expected to hold talks with President Maithripala Sirisena, who holds the defence portfolio, and the top military leadership.
The visit will take the army chief back to his first battlefield as the Indian Peace Keeping Force operation was one of the most defining moments of his career. Singhs unit was one of the first to be inducted in Sri Lanka in 1987 but suffered more than 20 casualties, including the commanding officer and a company commander.
Though posted at the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun as an instructor at the time, Singh volunteered to join his unit and was in Jaffna within 24 hours of the tragedy hitting his unit. Over the next two years, he saw action in Trincomalee, Vavuniya, Batticaloa and Valvettithurai where LTTE chief V Prabhakaran was born. He is expected to visit the IPKF war memorial at Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte.
Colombo has in the past sought from India unmanned aerial vehicles, deep penetration bombs, rockets, night vision goggles and spares for its fighters. But India did not oblige. India was too slow to even respond to a Sri Lankan request for six horses in 2012, while Pakistan almost immediately dispatched the animals to Colombo.(Hindustan Times)

Re-think on certain tax proposals
	
In the wake of widespread protests over some of the budgetary proposals such as the increase in the fees for vehicle emission tests, the government is contemplating amending the charges during the Budget debate, Daily Mirror learns.
The Budget proposed to increase the charge for the vehicle emission test to Rs. 5000. As a result of protests from several quarters the government is now planning to introduce a congestion charge' from motorists.
Professionals have also protested against proposal to do away with vehicle permits granted to them and according to government sources, attention is now being paid to reconsider this proposal. Amendments are also being considered for the proposed tax hike on electric cars and the introduction of the Nation Building Tax.
In the Prime Ministers policy statement to Parliament, he had proposed to increase the proportion of direct taxes in comparison to indirect taxes. It means the contribution to government revenue from income and corporate taxes. But, this policy is not reflected in the budgetary proposals, a source said.
The budget debate is currently underway in Parliament. It will end on December 19. Meanwhile, paddy cultivators are protesting over the Budget proposal to restrict the fertilizer subsidy. (Kelum Bandara)

SLAS wants vehicle permits restored
	
Perturbed over the withdrawl of concessionary vehicle permits, senior public servants have written to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe urging that the circular prohibiting such vehicle permits be withdrawn and the status quo restored.
The privilege to purchase an imported or locally manufactured vehicle on a concessionary rate had been withdrawn in the 2016 Budget and a circular issued to this effect.
Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association (SLASA) Secretary Chandraratne Pallegama in a letter said the SLASA had also asked the government to ensure pensions benefits to public servants recruited after 2016 and the allowances to be included in the basic salary.
The government has meted out a huge injustice to public servants by depriving their privileges despite assuming office pledging to give them more benefits.
The Budget 2016 has failed to grant either a pay hike or an allowance. The government promised to add the allowances to the basic salary before the Budget but instead had deprived them many privileges enjoyed by them up to now. This Budget will go into history as the first and only budget that failed to give a single benefit to the public servants, the letter stated.
The SLASA while condemning the withdrawal of concessionary vehicle permits given once in five years said it was extremely unfair and had indiscriminated public servants who hoped to obtain a concessionary vehicle permit after serving 25 to 30 years in the public service. It said it was prepared to take severe trade union action against the governments decision to withdraw concessionary vehicle permits to senior public servants.
Meanwhile, Daily Mirror learns that though the Finance Ministry took immediate steps to withdraw vehicle permits to public servants soon after the budget speech, it had failed to issue a circular withdrawing concessionary vehicle permits to law makers though this was also a Budget proposal.
The scheme had benefited at least 2,000 senior public servants annually since 2010 and nearly 10,000 duty-free vehicle permits had been issued to public servants since then.
Parliamentarians are also entitled to a concessionary permit after five years for a higher foreign currency price. However, it is an open secret that MPs and Ministers sell their permits for a higher price. Cabinet Ministers use their official vehicles.
An MP is also entitled to a loan facility of up to US$50,000 or Rs.5.8 million from any bank to open a Letter of Credit if he or she wishes to import the vehicle.
The Finance Ministry announced that vehicle permits under the concessionary terms will be suspended from November 21, 2015.
"Those who have permits and have not yet opened letters of credit for the import of vehicles and those permit holders who intend to purchase locally-assembled vehicles, should enter into an agreement before December 31 2015," the ministry said.
The concessionary terms for issuing vehicle permits has become highly politicized and have been misused, resulting in the government incurring an annual loss of Rs.40 billion, as stated by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake during his Budget speech.(Sandun A Jayasekera)
