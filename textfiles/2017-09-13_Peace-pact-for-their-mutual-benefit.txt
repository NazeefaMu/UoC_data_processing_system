Peace pact for their mutual benefit?


	



 

Two politicos in a certain area embroiled in a protracted rivalry had suddenly entered into a peace pact, they say.  

 


The twosome, a JO Diyawanna member and a provincial council member who met by chance at a funeral on their home turf the other day were the focus of the attention of the people at the funeral house for the bad blood between them was an open secret.


The JO Diyawanna member is a well-known racketeer engaged in activities such as illicit sand and gravel mining. The PC member, a typical opportunist, is an influential figure backing yahapalanaya.    
The people closely following the movements of the two politicos had expected them to avoid even eye contact with each other. However, to their surprise, the duo had greeted each other like long lost friends and were later seen engaged in an intimate conversation. 


The pro-yahapalanaya PC member had during the conversation told the Diyawanna member: “You carry on your business… There’s no reason to worry…”


Two or three people who had overheard this remark made by the PC member had immediately put two and two together and decided it was an assurance given to the Diyawanna member that he could go ahead with his illicit sand and gravel mining activities without the fear of being troubled by the law enforcing authorities.
