Former Major General Palitha Fernando, the third suspect for the inquiry conducted by the Bribery Commission regarding allegations of corruption connected to Avant Garde Maritime Services, was permitted to travel abroad by Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya today.

The suspect was permitted to travel to Doha, Qatar from October 24 to November 4 to attend an athletic seminar. The ban was lifted on two additional surety bails of Rs. 5 million each.

The suspect together with Avant Garde Maritime Services Chairman, Nissanka Senadipathi, had another travel ban imposed on them for accepting a bribe of Rs. 35.5 million.

Additionally, the former Defence Secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa and seven others, including the suspect were charged by the bribery commission for permitting Avant Garde Maritime Services to operate a floating armory and supporting the company to earn Rs. 11.4 billion, a loss to the government.

However, the seven suspects were released on bail when they appeared in court. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
