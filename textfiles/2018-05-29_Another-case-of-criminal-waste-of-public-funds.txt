Another case of criminal waste of public funds


	

It has come to light that a former purohita, a typical political turncoat from the upcountry, had spent some Rs.20 million on converting to his Ministry office a three-storey building taken on rent.




What is worse is the payment for making the necessary structural changes to the building, which incidentally had cost a monthly rental of Rs. 1.2 million, had been made to the purohita’s wife who appears to have handled the job herself. 


However, this building had not been put to any productive use and the errant purohita’s successor has already brought this colossal waste of public funds to the notice of those in the highest echelons in yahapalanaya, they say.
