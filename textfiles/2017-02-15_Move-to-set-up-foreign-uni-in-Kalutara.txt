In a move to set up another non-State degree-awarding institution, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday submitted a Cabinet paper seeking to set up a branch campus of India’s Manipal University in the Kalutara district.

The investment involved is said to be US$75 million and would offer degrees in Information Technology, Engineering and Management.

However, President Maitripala Sirisena has sought more time to study the paper and make his observations.

The campus is to be set up on a 100-acre block of land with the university authorities paying for the land according to government valuation.

The minister had earlier said the government would invite private investors in the higher education sector of the country. (Kelum Bandara)
