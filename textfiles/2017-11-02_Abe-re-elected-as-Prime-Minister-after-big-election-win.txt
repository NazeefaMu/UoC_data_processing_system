THE HINDU, 01st NOVEMBER, 2017- Japan’s Shinzo Abe was re-elected Prime Minister on Wednesday after his ruling bloc’s big election win last month and days ahead of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump that is expected to be dominated by concerns over a volatile North Korea.


Mr. Abe, 63, took office in December 2012, promising to reboot the stale economy and bolster defence. His Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition retained its two-thirds “super majority” in parliament’s lower house in the October 22 election, reenergising his push to revise the post-war, pacifist constitution.


Mr. Abe was expected to reappoint current cabinet ministers and tell them to compile an extra budget for the year to March 31, 2018 focusing on child care and boosting productivity.
