Thunderstorms would develop over most Provinces till Monday, April 16, the Meteorology Department warned today.

Duty Meteorologist (Forecasting) Kasun Pasquel said they expect thundershowers mostly after 2 p.m. on these days as a result of Inter-Monsoon Conditions over the island.

He said heavy falls about 100mm could be expected at some places, particularly in mountainous regions like the Sabaragamuwa, Central, Western, North Western, and the Uva Provinces and in the Galle and Matara Districts.

“Severe lightning and temporarily strong gusty winds up to 70 to 80 kmph are also possible during thundershowers,” the Department said.   

Meanwhile, the Department warned the public to seek shelter, preferably indoors and covered vehicles.

“Never seek shelter under trees during a thunderstorm. Never go in the open areas like paddy fields, tea plantations and open water bodies,” it said.

The Department also warned the general public of using wired telephones and connected electric appliances during thunderstorms.

It also warned people not to travel in open vehicles, such as bicycles, tractors and boats.
It advised the public to be vigilant of fallen trees and power lines and requested the public to contact the local disaster management authorities in case of emergency. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
