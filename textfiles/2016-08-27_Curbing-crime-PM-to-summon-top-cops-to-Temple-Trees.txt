In the wake of the latest abduction and murder of a Colombo businessman, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will summon senior police officers to Temple Trees next week to brief them on steps to be taken to curb crimes and drug trafficking.

According to informed sources the Prime Minister has told this to several ministers including Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake yesterday morning.

He had also told Minister Ratnayake and other ministers that there was no point marking police day if the police were unable to nab those who commit crimes. “ The prime responsibility of the police is to look after the security of the people. There is no point in holding a police day if this cannot be executed in aproper manner," he had told the ministers.(Yohan Perera)
