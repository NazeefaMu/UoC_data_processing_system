American Celebrity Chef and restaurateur Guy Fieri has been helping the people of California recover from the worst wildfire in the sunshine state’s history. Fieri, a resident of California himself didn’t choose to make his good work public. But the Butte County Sheriff was full of praise for the chef. “Guy Fieri made a surprise visit to serve dinner to everyone at the law enforcement staging area at Butte College. Thank you so much Guy for filling our bellies and lifting our spirits,” the Sheriff tweeted. 


Fieri and his team were quick to set up a makeshift kitchen at the Veterans Memorial Building to start cooking meals including a good old barbeque, for thousands of evacuees devastated by the fire.  Speaking to a local tv station Fieri said “I’m not promoting anything. I’m just here cooking. This is feeding people. People need help, and I’m here to help. That’s it.”
