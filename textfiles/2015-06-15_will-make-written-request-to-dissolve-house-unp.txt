	The United National Party (UNP) would make a written request to President Maithripala Sirisena to dissolve Parliament, a Deputy Minister said today.
	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Ajith P. Perera told a media briefing that the UNP had decided to make a written request for the dissolution of Parliament in accordance with the resolution passed by the party’s working committee recently.
	Mr. Perera said the UNP would also remind the President in writing that he would have to honour the pledge made during the Presidential Election that Parliament would be dissolved after hundred days.
	“This government has the mandate to rule this country only for 100 days and therefore it is not correct to go on for two hundred days,” he said. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)
