On Saturday, August 4, kindhearted Sulochana Sandipani, with the help a small group of friends and family, visited Parama Dharmawardanaramaya Temple in Raththanapitiya to give alms consisting of 2000 vegan cupcakes.  Co-sponsored by her home business, The Vegan Kitchen as well as through private contributions, the baking took two days to complete before the cupcakes were frosted and delivered to the Bellanvilla Raja Maha Viharaya’s Deva Dutha Perahera which passed through the village of Raththanapitiya.
