Arresting me would be wild goose chase: John


	

Replying to a query from the media regarding the statements of a group of individuals that Minister John Amaratunga was responsible for the demolition of the Wattala jogging track and that he should be arrested, he said that it would be wild goose chase that would never materialize.

He said the land belonged to a private company and that they had obtained permission to construct a road. He said he was not aware who demolished the jogging track but the company was reconstructing it.

When the journalists mentioned about the statement of a group of parliamentarians that he should be arrested in connection with the incident he gave a sarcastic reply that it would be wild goose chase and that their foolhardiness should be ignored. (Kanchna Kumara Ariyadasa)
