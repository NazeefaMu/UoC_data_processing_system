The water level of the Kalu Ganga rising had put the Ratnapura and  Millakanda areas in danger following heavy showers experienced in the catchment areas, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said.

Quoting the Irrigation Department, DMC Deputy Director Pradeep Kodippili warned the public living downstream of the Kalu Ganga to keep an eye on the rising water levels and move to safer locations if the need arises.

Meanwhile, he requested the public to call the DMC hot-line number 117 for support and more information, if needed.  (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
