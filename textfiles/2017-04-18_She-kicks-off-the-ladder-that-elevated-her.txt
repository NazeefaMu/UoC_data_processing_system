A female white collar high-up of an authority handling air traffic had quit her job to join a foreign air service kicking off the ladder that elevated her to a great height in her career, they say.

 


This female white collar one who had joined the authority as a clerk had risen to the position of a deputy thanks to the patronage of the head of the authority and she had been offered a record 34 foreign training stints which had cost this state-owned body some Rs. 10 million in foreign exchange. 
Employees say that it is a very ungrateful gesture on the part of the female high-up to quit the job to serve a foreign company using the skills she had acquired at a huge cost to the authority.
