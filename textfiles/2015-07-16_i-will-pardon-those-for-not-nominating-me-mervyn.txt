	Former Minister Mervyn Silva resigned from his Kelaniya electoral organiser post recently, sources said.

In his resignation letter, he said he was denied nomination as a part of a conspiracy by the ‘Rajapaksas’.
Stressing that only President Maithripala Sirisena and party people could save the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), he said he would serve the party once again after it was resurrected from the Rajapaksas.
He said he saluted people of Gampaha and Hambantota districts for placing him in higher echelons of politics.
“I will pardon those for not nominating me. But, god will teach them a lesson,” he said. 
Yesterday, four new chief electoral organisers have been appointed for the SLFP by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The appointments have been made as follows - Nirupama Rajapaksa as Chief SLFP Organiser of the Mulkirigala electorate, Victor Anthony Perera as Chief SLFP Organiser for the Puttalam electorate, Thilak Waragoda as Chief SLFP Organiser for the Kelaniya electorate and R.P. Thusitha Kularatne as Chief SLFP Organiser for Bulathsinhala electorate.
They received their appointment letters yesterday (15) morning at the Presidential Secretariat, sources said. (Ranjan Kasturi & Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)
