Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the government would rescue the country from the debt trap without leaving the challenge of resolving it to the future generations.

“We will not leave the challenge of resolving the issue of debt to the future generations. We will resolve it in this generation,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.

Speaking at the UNP’s 70th anniversary celebrations today, he apologized to the nation for whatever wrong his party had done to the nation in the past.

“I am proud as a UNPer for the lot of good things the party had done to the nation. But as a party, we have taken wrong decisions as well. I apologize for all the wrong things the UNP has done,” he said.

“This is not the time to talk about the past as the county should go forward steadily. It should go forward to fulfill the aspirations of the people, to rescue the country from the debt trap,” he said. (Yohan perera)
