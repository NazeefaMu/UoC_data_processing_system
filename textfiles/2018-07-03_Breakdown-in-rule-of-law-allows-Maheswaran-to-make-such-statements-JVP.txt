Breakdown in rule of law allows Maheswaran to make such statements: JVP


	

The government has created an environment, which is used by people to make various statements similar to the one made by State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran, who had called for the re-organization of the LTTE, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.

JVP MP and Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath told a media conference today that the breaking down of the rule of law had left room for Ms. Maheswaran to make such a statement and for some others to call for a Hitler-like administrator.

He said it was the government which was responsible for the breakdown of rule of law. “The Government has to take the responsibility for the statement made by Ms. Maheswaran as it is the government which had allowed the rule of law to breakdown,” the MP said.

He said Ms. Maheswaran should be asked to apologise to the nation. “Because her statement is against the State,” he said.

The MP said the statement was made at a State function in the presence of two ministers -- the two in charge of external and internal affairs and therefore the government should make an official statement on this matter.

He said Ms. Maheswaran’s claim that the abduction of children and killings never took place during the LTTE era cannot be accepted as former combatants Karuna Amman and Pillayan had also harassed children during the war by forcibly engaging them in hostilities.

The MP said these two people were given government posts some years ago. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
