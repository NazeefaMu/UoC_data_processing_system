Karapitiya CTU doctors’ TU action temporarily suspended

Trade Union action taken by specialist doctors attached to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital’s Cardio Thoracic Unit (CTU) has been temporarily suspended, Hospital sources said.
Meanwhile, Health Services Director General Dr. Palitha Mahipala said in a statement work at the unit had commenced on October 2. A committee of two senior health officials from the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine visited the Karapitiya hospital and held discussions with the relevant parties and came to an agreement.
According to Dr. Mahipala, the Cardio Thoracic Unit (CTU) of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital is to be further developed with ministry funds.
Another building complex will be constructed to ease the congestion of the unit. Planning of the project is in progress. Minor development activities in the unit will commence next week.
“In addition, another senior health official had been appointed to look into the matter and formulate a report on the matter in order to find a permanent solution,” he added.
