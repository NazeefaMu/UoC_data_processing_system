Mahesh Weerasena - CEO LAUGFS Petroleum, Charaka Perera – General Manager LAUGFS Petroleum, Lakshan Madurasinghe – Country Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability Manager Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd., Priyantha Ranasinghe – Country Human Resources Manager Coca-Cola and their colleagues at the ‘Give Back Life’ PET plastic collection and recycling project launch at LAUGFS Petroleum Koswatte

Further expanding the scope of its ‘Give Back Life’ PET plastic collection and recycling campaign, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd, with its recycling partner Eco Spindles joined hands with LAUGFS Petroleum, to place ‘Give Back Life’ PET plastic collection bins at the Koswatte service station to enable customers to dispose their PET plastic bottles responsibly when visiting the area.  Management from Coca-Cola and LAUGFS Petroleum gathered together with volunteers to educate customers as they drove through the service station during the launch. 

Customers entering the service station will be prompted by the educational signage to bring in their PET plastic bottles to be disposed appropriately for recycling purposes. All collected PET plastic bottles will be given new life by being converted into brushes, brooms, shoes and clothing. The symbol "1" inside a triangle in a plastic bottle indicates PET which is Polyethylene Terephthalate. This symbol is normally found in packaging containing soft drinks, juices, cooking oil, water, personal care and cosmetic products.

LAUGFS Koswatte has one of the highest footfalls of 6,000 – 7,000 vehicles per day. At the launch, the management teams and volunteers distributed educational leaflets to customers whilst giving them awareness on how the simple action of choosing to dispose of their PET plastics in a Give Back Life bin could translate to many long-term benefits.Coca-Cola conducted training programmes for the two staff shifts which operate the station throughout the week whom wholeheartedly endorsed the campaign to spread this valuable message to recycle PET plastic bottles and thereby not only provide alternative livelihoods to people but improve the beautiful environment in Sri Lanka.  



Commenting on the occasion Mahesh Weerasena – CEO, LAUGFS Petroleum said,                             “We are delighted to partner with Coca-Cola’s ‘Give Back Life’ PET plastic collection and recycling program which is very much in line with our company values. This is why we chose to initiate this initiative at the Koswatte service station, which witnesses 12,000 – 14,000 visitors per day due to the multiple services available. The Koswatte station has LAUGFS Gas, LAUGFS Hybrid Center, LAUGFS Eco-Sri, LAUGFS Car Care Service Centre amongst its services to customers. As a company that is mindful of its responsibility to the future generation, we are looking to see how we can collaborate further on this great initiative, especially with our recently launched model solar powered fuel station in Pepiliyana. 

Adding further, Lakshan Madurasinghe - Country Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability Manager, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. said, “We are increasing the number of locations where our ‘Give Back Life’ collection bins are located for the convenience of the public to dispose post-consumed PET plastic. In turn, increasing the motivation to hold onto PET plastic bottles until it can be disposed appropriately. We are working towards achieving this behavioural shift for all Sri Lankans to no longer litter the country but do their part in preserving our unique environment and facilitating a better and cleaner society for everyone. This initiative forms part of The Coca-Cola Company’s commitment towards help creating a “World Without Waste”. World Without Waste is the Coca-Cola Company’s global goal to help collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging by 2030”. 

Coca-Cola in Sri Lanka is committed to achieving high volumes of PET plastic recycling in Sri Lanka through waste management solutions for PET plastic both at national and local levels, such as the recently launched Colombo-Katunayake Expressway project partnering with the Road Development Authority.
