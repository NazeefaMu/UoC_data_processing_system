Don't amend Penal Code: BBS


	


	The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) today objected to the amending of the Criminal Justice Procedure Code and the Penal Code.
	BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera said it would be bad for the country and the people if that were to happen.
	“These Acts if amended can be used as weapons to suppress people, politicians and national organisations in the country,” he said. “These two amendments have been published in the Gazette notification on November 6. We have the right to stand against the move to amend the acts and we will not allow them to be passed in Parliament.”
	The government seeks to amendment the first schedule of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Section 291 C of the Penal Code to make provisions to punish those who use words or use signs or visible representation with the intention of causing, instigate or attempt to instigate acts of violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony or feelings of ill will or hostility between communities or among different classes of persons.
	Those found guilty to be sentenced to two years imprisonment.
	“If the Acts were amended every coconut tree could be used as gallows and every government school and institutions would turn into prisons,” the Thera said. “We are urging the government to pass an Act to stop religious conversion, but little or nothing has been done in that direction.” (Chaturanga Pradeep)
