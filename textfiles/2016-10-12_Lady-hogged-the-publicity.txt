Lady hogged the publicity


	



 

Posters advertising the much-talked about JO’s October 8 rally in Ratnapura had come up all over the district by the latter part of the last week.

 


However, the talkative lady who took over the task of organizing the big event had monopolized the entire face of the large poster with her mug shot making no reference even in small lettering to the other two JO stalwarts from the district Vasu and Ranji and the latter had complained to the former strongman about this discriminatory treatment to them. 


The angry duo had also queried from their Boss whether there was a move to appoint the lady from Ratnapura as the general secretary of the proposed new political party he was to lead.
