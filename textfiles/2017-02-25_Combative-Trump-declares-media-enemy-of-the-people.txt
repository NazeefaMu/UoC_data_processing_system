Combative Trump declares media enemy of the people


	

OXON HILL AFP Feb24, 2017- US President Donald Trump rallied his loyal supporters with a stridently populist and security-dominated message Friday, declaring the start of a new political era of action.  He was met by euphoric chants of “USA, USA.” Trump also renewed his evisceration of the “fake” media -- at length.   


 “They are the enemy of the people, because they have no sources. They just make ‘em up when there are none,” he said.   


With his Republican administration mired by multiple missteps and strong disapproval ratings, Trump tried to go on the offensive.   


He vowed to keep “radical Islamic terrorists... the hell out of our country,” again citing the examples of Sweden, Germany and France as places where immigration has led to crime, including the terror attacks in Paris and Nice. A combative Trump deployed tough rhetoric on immigrants, crime and the media, as he wooed once-skeptical conservatives at their annual meeting.
