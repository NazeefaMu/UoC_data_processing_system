The agreement will also allow both the institute and university to invite resource personnel from each body to engage in activities such seminars and workshops, while CA Sri Lanka in its capacity as the national body of accountants will assist the undergraduates of the Accountancy Department to obtain practical training opportunities in business organisations, audit firms and state corporations.

The agreement will also allow the Accountancy Department students’ association, CA Student’s Society and CA School of Accounting and Business student association to jointly organise research conferences, accounting forums, workshops for students thereby helping them enhance their knowledge on pertinent topics, which will be of relevance to them as future accounting professionals.  
Speaking at the event, Wickremasinghe emphasized that as a leading professional accounting body, CA Sri Lanka has always remained proactive in ensuring the accounting standards practiced in Sri Lanka were second to none in a global context. 
“We adhere to the latest internationally recognized standards and every effort is taken to ensure our members are relevant and stand shoulder to shoulder with their global counterparts. In such a scenario, it is important to nurture our future generation of accounting professionals because we firmly believe it is the quality that matters and not quantity. Therefore, our MoU with the Wayamba University is an important initiative in ensuring Sri Lanka continues to produce exceptionally talented chartered accountants even in the future,” he added. 
CA Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Aruna Alwis said that it is increasingly important for both professional bodies and academic bodies to come together to enhance the accounting profession further.
