Judging character by the position, length and shape of fingers- (II)


	

Last week we discussed the significations of each finger based on their length and position in relation to other fingers.


Today, we propose to discuss the significations of each finger based its shape.


Two distinct features have to be taken into account in the study of the shape of fingers. They are:
(1) The shape of the Tip of the first or the nailed phalanx,
(2) Presence or absence of knots at the joints of phalanges.
It is the forepart rather than the hind part that gives a distinct shape to a finger. Now let us examine the significations of each finger in relation to its shape.

First finger
Pointed: The subject is intuitive and idealistic in his religious beliefs.
Conical: Has a sharp perception and great love for reading.
Square: A lover of truth.
Spatulate: Overenthusiastic about going into action.

Second finger
Pointed: Morbid fear of the supernatural.
Conical: Rational in religious beliefs.
Square: Sagacious.
Spatulate: Very active.

Third finger

Conical: Artistic bent in thinking.
Square: Keen on revealing reality through arts.
Spatulate: Loves performing arts (Dancing, acting).

Fourth finger
Pointed: A pronounced bent for acquiring scientific knowledge.
