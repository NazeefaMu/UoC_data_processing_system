The Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association president Gemunu Wijeratne said yesterday that they would not support the countrywide bus strike, as President Maithripala Sirisena had assured them that he would take action to withdraw the Rs.25,000 fine for speeding and overtaking on the left.

During a meeting held at the parliamentary complex, Deputy Transport Minister Ashok Abeysinghe said the decision would be made public by issuing a statement as soon as possible.

“We informed the president that there were several issues at bus halts because of three-wheelers. However, as the president of the Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association, I request all bus owners to call off the bus strike and give their cooperation to President Sirisena,” said Wijeratne.

“I did not intend to call a strike, but the bus drivers had been misled by a poster campaign saying that a fine of Rs.25,000 would be imposed for traffic offences. It was an unfortunate situation. Misleading employees is a big problem for us. That is why we told the minister to issue a statement to explain the situation,” he said.

“We bus owners are ready to operate our buses as usual,” he said.

“I cannot say anything about the Inter Provincial bus strike because no one was present at the discussion with the president. Mr. Ashok Abeysinghe informed me that they were having a discussion with the president yesterday evening. Five persons from the Railway Trade union were also invited to attend the discussion,” he said

Four or five persons had been invited from the Inter Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) however they had not being present at the discussion. the deputy minister had informed the president of their absence. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
