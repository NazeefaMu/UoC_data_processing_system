A peaceful protest by members of the Kashmir Study Forum and the Pakistani and Sri Lankan communities was held today outside the United Nation Office at Bauddhaloka Mawatha in Colombo to mark the Kashmir Black Day.
"The UN Secretary General is urged to encourage, facilitate and support efforts leading to a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolutions. He should exercise the mandate entrusted to him by the UN Charter and the relevant international instruments to forthwith ensure the fundamental rights and freedoms of the oppressed Kashmiri people in particular their right to self-determination," the Pakistan High Commission said in a statement.
Similar peaceful assemblies appealing the world community to prevent human rights violations in the Indian-held Kashmir and holding of a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir under the UN auspices were also held in other parts of the country including Ampara, Batticaloa and Puttalam.
The statement stated that the protesters expressed their grave concern about the ongoing killings of civilians in the towns and villages of Kashmir.
A memorandum with thousands of signatures urging UN to play its role to resolve the oldest unresolved dispute on the UN agenda since 1947 was also handed over to the UN office.
A signature campaign was also launched to raise awareness, encourage advocacy and to emphasize the centrality of the resolution of Kashmir Issue to the lasting peace and prosperity of South Asia across the Sri Lanka.
