Tiran won’t be arrested till July 6: AG


	

The Attorney General (AG) today undertook not to arrest former MP Tiran Alles until July 6 in connection with an alleged fraud at the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) when the matter was taken up in the Supreme Court.
The Chief Justice was scheduled to sit on the bench when the matter was taken up today. However, it was taken up before Judges Rohini Marasinghe, Sisira de Abrew and Upali Aberatne instead.
Therefore, the matter is due to be taken up before the CJ on July 6. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
