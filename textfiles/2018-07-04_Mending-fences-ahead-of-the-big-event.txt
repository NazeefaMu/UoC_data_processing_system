The Pohottuwa stalwart from the Gampaha political family, known to be an active member of the B-faction of the party had a one-on-one closed-door meeting with the sibling G of the R-family, they say.

 


During this discussion, the Gampaha stalwart had offered an explanation for making certain public statements regarding the party candidate at the upcoming big poll adding that he had now decided to extend his unstinted support to whomever the former strongman would nominate.


He had also given an undertaking not to make any public statement hereafter about the party candidate which could lead to any controversy in the party.  The meeting had ended on this cordial note, they say.
