Selathurai Gnanasegaram Blessings for a spiritual guru reaching 100


	

It’s with profound love of my father Selathurai Gnanasegaram of Kokuvil East, Kokuvil, that I share his contribution to spiritual development on his up-coming 100th birth day. Arrangements have been made for a grand celebration at Sai Illam Thavaddy, Jaffna.   


Blessed by Kadayappa Swami’s piece of meat given to M Selathurai who was childless, Gnanasegaram was born on the 1st of June 1918. His childhood was spent at Nallur Temple with his uncle Sabaratnam Mudaliyar. This led to the continuous worship and service to Lord Murugan of Nallur throughout his life. He completed his studies in Jaffna Hindu College. He joined the Fiscals Office at the age of eighteen and later served the Forest Department.   

 


Gnanasegaram cultivated spirituality through reading the divine history of the great saints and by visiting them. He was fortunate to be blessed by the great sage Siva Yoga Swamy of Columbuturai, Markandu Swamy and kudaichami and the great avathar of Kali Yuga Bagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba


 


Six feet tall, lean, fair, pleasant and handsome Gnanasegaram was the attraction of many. As an admirer of Lord Siva he went to India to learn Bharathaatiyam under Naatya Kalakesari Vazhuvoor Ramaiah Pillai. Gnanasegaram trained students of Jaffna Hindu College, Jaffna Hindu Ladies College and Kokuvil Hindu College. 


He considered music and dance as the modes to feel, see and surrender to Lord Shiva.   
 Gnanasegaram married Rajaluxmy of Vannarpannai. They raised six children.   


 Gnanasegaram cultivated spirituality through reading the divine history of the great saints and by visiting them. He was fortunate to be blessed by the great sage Siva Yoga Swamy of Columbuturai, Markandu Swamy and kudaichami and the great avathar of Kali Yuga Bagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.   
Siva Yoga Swamigal often blessed him and one day in front of many disciples named him Nalla Segaram.   


Gnanasegaram was called Iyah by many who associated with him in search of fulfilling their spiritual thirst. He translated Baja Govindam and Sai Literature and wrote five books as the essence of Truth. 
A cluster of followers from Thavaddy Jaffna who identified Iyah and his mission have established Sai Illam.


The Sai Illam has now grown as a big banyan tree.    


 Let us worship Iyah and follow his spiritual path as a real celebration of his hundredth birthday on this precious earth.
