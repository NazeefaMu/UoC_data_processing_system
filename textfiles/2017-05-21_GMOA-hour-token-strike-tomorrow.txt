The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) announced an Islandwide 24 hour token strike starting from 8 a.m. tomorrow, following an ExCo decision made a short while ago.

Informing the decision made at a press briefing, GMOA officials said the Government had failed to provide a positive response on the SAITM issue.

They also said investigations had not been done over the recent attack that taken place at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and on the University students.

However, the GMOA said emergency services, maternity hospitals, children hospitals, cancer hospitals, tri forces hospitals and the renal treatment units would be free from the strike.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)
