A leading Diyawanna politico has earned the nickname ‘Unanduwaa’ and he is often being referred to by this new name; some of his colleagues even call him ‘Unanduwaa Sir’, they say.

 


This politico has come to be referred to by this sobriquet following a certain pollster-agency placing him at the top of the list of political buffs in Diyawanna.


Some council backbenchers have made it a habit to make fun by hailing this politico with the greeting, “How are you, Unanduwaa Sir!”
