Priority bus lanes will be in force in Galle Road and Battaramulla from Tuesday (15), Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said today.

According to the programme the priority bus lanes would be adopted along the Galle Road from Moratuwa junction to Fort and the road between Battaramulla to Fort.

The minister said the programme will initially be implemented for traffic coming into Colombo with outbound traffic roped into equation soon after.

“With the progress we saw during the pilot study we believe this would be successful in reducing traffic congestion by at least 50 percent and allow a faster traffic flow within the city,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
