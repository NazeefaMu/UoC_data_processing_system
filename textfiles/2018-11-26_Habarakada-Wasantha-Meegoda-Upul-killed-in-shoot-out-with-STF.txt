Two underworld figures, 'Habarakada Wasantha’ and ‘Meegoda Upul’, were killed in a shoot-out with police at Rukmalgama, Kottawa, this evening.

Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the shooting occurred when Special Task Force (STF) officers visited the Rukmalgama area to gather information on organised crime in the area.

“Some individuals opened fire at an STF officer, and after an exchange of fire, two people were found dead. They were admitted to the Homagama Hospital. They were dead at the time of admission,” SP Gunasekara said.

The police identified the deceased as Habarakada Wasantha, who was the main suspect in the recent robbery at a Matara jewellery shop in which a policeman was killed, and the other as Meegoda Upul.

Following investigations, one micro-type machine gun and one sub-machine gun (SMG), which were used against the police were taken into custody. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
