Govt. shouldn’t ban Prabhakaran commemoration: Vickramabahu


	

New Left Front leader Vickramabahu Karunaratne said today that if Rohana Wijeweera could be commemorated, the same privilege should be given to commemorate slain LTTE Leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.
Speaking at a news conference, Dr. Karunaratne said the law should be applied equally to all communities without discrimination.
“If the Sinhalese can commemorate their slain people, why cannot the Tamils do it? Just because you commemorate someone, it doesn’t mean that you are following their ideology,” he said.
He said the government’s attempts to suppress the commemoration ceremony for the slain LTTE cadres would only encourage the concerned people to move towards terrorism. (Indika Sri Aravinda)
