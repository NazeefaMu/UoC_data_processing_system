375th Anniversary of Christian Reformed Church Years of Reformed Faith


	

The anniversary is a testament to the faith of generations of ministers, ministry workers, evangelists and the community of believers in Sri Lanka,



The members of the Christian Reformed Church in Sri Lanka, formerly known as the Dutch Reformed Church, joined in a trilingual service of thanksgiving on October 5 at the historical and culturally significant Dutch Reformed Church in Galle to mark its 375th anniversary.   
The anniversary is a testament to the faith of generations of ministers, ministry workers, evangelists and the community of believers in Sri Lanka, who stayed true to the teachings of Reformed Faith, continuing to teach Biblically sound doctrines and espousing the catechism of faith.   
The history of the Christian Reformed Church is intrinsically linked to the period of Dutch Colonisation in the country. The official ministry of the Dutch Reformed Church began on 1642 October 6, at the Fort of Galle and the Reformed Faith of the Dutch Colonists was established as the official religion of the colony.   
The Church worked amongst the poor and the needy in the country, establishing orphanages, schools and the country’s first leprosy asylum in Wattala among other social projects and acts of service.
Renamed as the Christian Reformed Church in October 2007, the church continues to Minister through 18 Churches and three mission stations across the island.   
Around 35 Ministers, pastors and full-time ministry and operational workers continue to serve the church today carrying out missionary and evangelistic activities, serving the community through social programmes and responding to the needs of the communities they serve.
