NDB Investment Bank (NDBIB) recently launched the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Ooredoo Maldives PLC (Ooredoo Maldives) on the Maldives Stock Exchange acting as the lead financial advisor and manager to the IPO. 
The mandate from Ooredoo Maldives, a subsidiary of Ooredoo Group, a global telecommunications service provider based in Qatar, signifies NDBIB’s pioneering efforts as Sri Lanka’s first investment bank to handle an IPO outside Sri Lanka. 
The IPO was launched in the Maldives with a gala ceremony on the 18th of April 2017 whilst the offer was opened for subscription on April 30th and is expected to close on 28th May. 
The initial offer size is set at approximately US$ 43 million with a commitment from the shareholders to go up to US$ 115 million in the event of an oversubscription in line with the telecommunications licensing requirements in the Maldives. 
Commenting on this landmark transaction, Vajira Kulatilaka, Director of NDBIB and CEO of NDB Capital Holdings Limited, stated, “We are proud to be associated with Ooredoo Group in our maiden entry in managing regional IPOs. Our vision was to make NDBIB a regional player in both debt and equity capital markets, and I am delighted to see NDBIB achieve that feat with the Ooredoo Maldives IPO.” Ooredoo Group is one of the fastest growing telecommunications service providersin the world with a customer base in excess of 138 million and operations in over 10 markets. The Group recorded revenue of approximately US$ 9 billion for the financial year 2016 andis backed by the Qatar Investment Authority, its major shareholder.Ooredoo Group focuses on data leadership in all its markets by striving to provide the best data experience to its customers.
Darshan Perera, CEO of NDBIB, commenting on the IPO said, “NDBIB was awarded this transaction via a competitive bidding process followed by a comprehensive evaluation of technical and commercial proposals. The bidding process attracted participation from many prominent investment banks in the region and we are honoured to have been selected to handle this landmark IPO in the Maldives”.

Nilendra Weerasinghe, Vice President and Head-Corporate Advisory said, “Conducting an IPO in a foreign jurisdiction involved many challenges. We deployed a relatively large transaction team to work on different aspects of the IPO including familiarising ourselves with the regulatory regime, carrying out business due diligence and valuations, and devising a placement strategy considering the needs of the company and the nascent stage of the capital market.”
Ooredoo Maldives has taken a keen interest to broad base the ownership of the company with local roadshows covering all densely populated areas in the archipelago. The company has also been working in close collaboration with the Capital Market Development Authority of Maldives and the Maldives Stock Exchange to maximize retail investor participation for the IPO. NDBIB has worked closely with the Company to create an all-encompassing distribution and marketing strategy targeting both retail and institutional investors to achieve the company’s objectives.
