There is a key institution which is instrumental in bringing precious forex to the country. It is headed by a person who played an active role in bringing yahapalanaya to power. This institution comes under the purview of a Green party purohita. 

 


The head of this institution and the purohita are at loggerheads and the latter decided to have the defiant one replaced by a political buddy of his before their strained relations took a turn for the worse. The best way to get rid of him, he thought, was offering him an attractive alternative office like an ambassadorial post. 


Later the purohita presented his proposition to both Number One and Number Two in yahapalanaya. Having obtained their approval, he conveyed it to the head of the institution through a third party. 
However, the institution head had turned down the idea straightaway, they say. And the purohita now back at zero one is said to be contemplating his next move.
