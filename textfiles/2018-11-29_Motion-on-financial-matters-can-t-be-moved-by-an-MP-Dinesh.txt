Minister and Leader of the House Dinesh Gunawardane said today a motion on financial matters should be approved by the cabinet before presenting it in parliament according to section (152) of the constitution and said such a motion should be presented in the House only by a minister.

He told a news conference held at the parliament complex that there were no provisions for an opposition MP to present a motion to curtail expenditure of the Prime Minister in the house.

He said there was a case being heard in courts against the Prime minister and the government and thus there were no provisions to debate a motion being heard in courts either.

He said the Speaker had violated decisions of his Predecessor that matters being heard in courts could not be taken up for debate in the House.

Minister Gunawardane said the Speaker had violated the Constitution and Standing Orders by including a matter being taken up in courts in the order book for debate.

He said convening of Parliament yesterday was illegal and unconstitutional and added that they requested the Speaker to act according to the Constitution and Standing Orders.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
