The National Lotteries Board (NLB) had printed and distributed a ‘Govisetha’ lottery ticket at two different prices to be drawn on the same day, the Joint Opposition said today.

MP Bandula Gunawardane pointed out that "Govi Setha" lottery tickets for draw no 1419 on February 4 had been sold at Rs. 20 and also Rs. 30 per ticket. “Another lottery with no price tag had also been sold,” he told a news conference displaying the three different lottery tickets.

“These questionable tickets had been sold in several areas of the country including Vavuniya, Atakalampanna, Anamaduwa, Kokkadicholai and Norochcholai. How can people know the validity of the ticket they purchase when the prices of these tickets vary?” he asked.

He said the actions of the Finance Ministry had damaged the utmost faith the people have in government institutions. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
