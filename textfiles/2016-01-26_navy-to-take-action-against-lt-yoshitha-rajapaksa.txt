The Navy will take action against Lieutenant Yoshitha Rajapaksa based on the advise of the President's office in the wake of the recommendations made by the tripartite committee, Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatilleke told Parliament today.
He said this while responding to a question asked by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa who said the report of the investigation committee had been forwarded to President Maithripala Sirisena.
Mr. Karunatilleke said Lieutenant Rajapaksa had fulfilled his basic qualification of obtaining six credits in GCE O/L exam in the second sitting. He had obtained A/L qualification as well and had obtained Defence Ministry approval for his entry into the Navy.
It was also revealed that some Rs.16 million was spent by the state for his training in Britain and Ukraine.
The reasons given for his recruitment was that he was the son of the former president and to encourage the youth to join the army during war time. (Yohan Perera)
