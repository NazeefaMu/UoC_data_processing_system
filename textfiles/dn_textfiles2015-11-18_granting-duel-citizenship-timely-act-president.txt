Granting duel citizenship, a timely act - President

Granting dual citizenship to Sri Lankan expatriates is a timely decision taken by the government as the country is now set on a rapid development path and this decision will help to strengthen international relations, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He made this observation at a ceremony at Temple Trees to award dual citizenship to 2,000 expatriates yesterday.
“Dual citizenship was among the key issues highlighted by Sri Lankan expatriates during my tours abroad,” the President said.
“The highest proportion of Sri Lankans expatriates left Sri Lanka due to political reasons and also due to the war. But now they need to come back as Sri Lanka is a peaceful country which treats all nationals equally,” he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the support of Sri Lankan expatriates is very important to fulfill the government’s objective in winning the international support in bringing reconciliation, attracting foreign investors and for the development of the country.
He also invited the expatriates who couldn't obtain dual citizenship to support the country’s development as a Diaspora.
With the Amendment of Act No. 45 of 1987, the granting of Dual Citizenship provisions which had been suspended by the previous regime since September 2011 was reintroduced.
The provision of dual citizenship was restored on March 28, 2015. Since 1987, dual citizenship was granted to 40,000 expatriates.
Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S.B.Nawinna, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Tourism Minister John Amaratunga, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga and Immigration and Immigration Controller M.N. Ranasinghe were present.
