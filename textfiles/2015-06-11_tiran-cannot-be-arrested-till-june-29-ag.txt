The Attorney General today undertook not to arrest MP Tiran Alles until June 29 in connection with an alleged fraud at the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) when the matter was taken up before a three judge bench of the Supreme Court.
The matter is to be forwarded to the original bench which heard the case earlier. Therefore, the case was fixed for June 29. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
