Hatton National Bank (HNB) Islamic Banking has opened its second Unit at Pettah, as a key step in a rapid expansion drive of its Islamic banking operations.
The new unit was ceremonially declared open in the presence of the Chief Guest HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles, members of corporate management and special invitees. Addressing the gathering, HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles spoke about the significance of the new unit.

“The establishment of this unit in Pettah is extremely important to us. As it is situated on the bustling Main Street, it will cater to the financial needs of thousands of customers who visit the area for business and shopping purposes daily. Through this new unit we will also be able to offer an alternative to the conventional banking which has been available to Pettah customers for over 40 years, and to provide a privileged service to  the proprietors and partners of businesses”.


The new unit reinforces HNB’s standing as an inclusive bank which touches the lives of all communities, and will cater to the entire retail, SME and corporate customer segments of HNB. Islamic Banking under the Al Najah brand is an alternative banking system which is available to all customers, irrespective of their faith and religious beliefs. 


Alles went on to speak about Al Najah, the Islamic banking brand of HNB.
“Al Najah has grown exponentially over the past four years, as we have aggressively targeted this segment and pursued transactions. During 2016 we hope to expand in to at least another two regions. This will take Sharia compliant banking services to customers’ doorsteps and open up many exciting possibilities for Al Najah. Apart from this, we have taken other steps to develop the brand. While carrying out many transactions locally, last year for the first time we backed a project overseas which was 100% Islamic.  Currently, we are also looking at funding structures from some of our development finance or banking partners overseas as well. All this will augment growth under the Al Najah Islamic banking vertical”. 


HNB Al Najah was established in February 2012 with a view to elevating Islamic banking in Sri Lanka to new heights.
