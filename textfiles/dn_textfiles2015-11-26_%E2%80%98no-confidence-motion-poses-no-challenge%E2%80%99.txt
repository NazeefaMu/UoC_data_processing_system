Rumours of tariff increases baseless
‘No-confidence motion poses no challenge’

Rumours of an impending increase in water, electricity and telephone bills due to 2016 budget proposals are without any basis, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister assured that the government would never heap unnecessary burden on the people.
Minster Karunanayake stated this at a foundation laying ceremony yesterday at Bodhi Samudrarama Vihara, Mutwal.
Responding to queries of journalists, the minister said that the no-confidence to be moved against him allegedly by some opposition MPs would not pose any threat to him.
The minister said, “Through this budget we restored many privileges that have been denied to the people during the past 11 years. It is said that this no-confidence motion is to be moved by a group who lined their pockets with public funds. Since they are no longer able to abuse public funds, they have resorted to these methods.
I don’t consider this as a challenge in any way,” Karunanayake said.
“Some say that the budget has given nothing to the people. Still some others claim a no-confidence motion would be moved. However, from the very next day of the budget, the people have felt the relief given through the budget.
Investments have been increased. Small and medium scale enterprises have been rejuvenated,” the minister said. The minister also donated Rs. 50,000 to the chief incumbent of the temple, Ven. Thumbe Upananda thera for the ongoing development activities of the Temple.
Meanwhile, the Minister also visited the Sri Bodhirajaramaya Temple, Thotalanga yesterday and donated Rs. 50,000 to the chief incumbent, Ven. Nivitigala Gnaninda thera for the proposed new building of the temple.
Colombo Municipal Councilors Tharanga Athuraliya, Roy Bogahawatta, Aluthgedara Chaminda and Sunil Vithanage and a large number of residents were present.
