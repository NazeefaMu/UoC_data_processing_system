Formation of new political party is likely - Dilum

There is an increased possibility of the formation of a new political party or front resulting from the crisis situation in the SLFP, said Kandy District UPFA Parliamentarian Dilum Amunugama.
He said there is a clarion call by SLFP grass roots supporters for the formation a separate party saying that they would never vote for the SLFP again even if its campaign was led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He said Rajapaksa should provide the leadership to the new political party or front formed at the request of the people.
