Copies of agreements on the Hambantota Port and the industry zone will be presented to Parliament soon, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinge said today.

The Prime Minister who was speaking during the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Rigid Tyre factory in Horana last afternoon said minister of Development Policies and International trade Malik Samarawickrama would present copies of all agreements in Hambantota after making a statement in the House soon.

“No private lands will be taken over for the Hambantota industrial zones as only government land will be allocated for it," he said adding that “government lands are given only to set up industries that would create employment opportunities.”

Coming up with future plans he said an authority would be set up to find land and manage industrial zones similar to ones in India and Thailand. (Yohan Perera)
