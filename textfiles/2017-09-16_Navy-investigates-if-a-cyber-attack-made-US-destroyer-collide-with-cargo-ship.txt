US, (Daily Mail), 15 September 2017 -  The United States military is investigating whether hackers may have caused a Navy destroyer to go off course and crash into a merchant vessel on August 21 in the waters off Singapore, it was learned on Thursday.  


Ten sailors were killed after the warship John S. McCain collided with a merchant vessel last month.   The guided-missile destroyer collided with the Alnic MC east of Singapore while approaching the city state on a routine port visit.   Vice Admiral Jan Tighe, the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare, said the military is looking into whether the McCain’s computer systems were compromised, Foreign Policy reported.The military is adamant, however, that there was no hack of the systems aboard the USS Fitzgerald.
