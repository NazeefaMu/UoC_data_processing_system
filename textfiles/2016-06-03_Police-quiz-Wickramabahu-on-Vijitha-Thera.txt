Nava Sama Samaja Party Leader Wickramabahu Karunaratne was today questioned by the Police on a complaint made by the Bodu Bala Sena to the Kirulapone Police.

Mr. Karunaratne was asked about a function he participated a few years ago where Ven. Watereka Vijitha Thera had called for the tearing of the Lion flag.

The Thera had also stated that he hated the Lion flag because it separated ethnic groups in Sri Lanka through its coloured stripes. (Indika Sri Aravinda)
