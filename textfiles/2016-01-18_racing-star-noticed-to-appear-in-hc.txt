Racing star noticed to appear in HC


	

The Colombo High Court today noticed Sri Lanka’s only motor racing star Dilantha Malagamuwa and two others to appear in Court on March 23 to face charges against them for allegedly defrauding US $ 600,000 from a Japanese national.
High Court Judge Kusala Sarojini Weerawardena issued this notice on the accused to appear in Court, when she found that the accused were not present in court today when the case was called for hearing even after summons were issued on the suspects.
The Attorney-General had filed indictments against the three accused for cheating a Japanese national, Yoshuki Nayashi, by promising to construct a luxury apartment in 2008.
It was alleged that the accused had promised the Japanese a higher return within a few months and they had failed to do so. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
