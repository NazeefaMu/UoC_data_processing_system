The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) yesterday assured motorists that the filling stations countrywide have been provided with sufficient stocks of fuel.

CPC Managing Director Neil Jayasekara said all fuel station owners had been instructed to release the quantity of fuel as requested by motorists.

“If any filling station refuses to pump fuel, consumers can complain to the CPC on No: 011-545 5130 which functions for 24 hours a day,” he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
