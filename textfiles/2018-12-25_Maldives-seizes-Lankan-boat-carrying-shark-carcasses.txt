A Sri Lankan vessel carrying mostly shark carcasses had been seized by the Maldives for fishing illegally in its waters, the Maldivian media reported today.

According to Avas and Raajje News, the boat named ‘Oshadi 1’ which is registered in Sri Lanka was caught operating in Maldives’ special economic zone outside of Gaafu Dhaal atoll last Wednesday.

Members of the crew were apprehended 42 nautical miles off of Gadhdhoo island and were handed over to the Maldives Police Service.

The Maldives National Defence Force has said a number of shark carcasses were discovered from the vessel.

Brigadier General Ali Zuhair said that the vessel appeared to have been fishing and most of the crew’s one-ton yield was shark.

He also said there was nothing to indicate that the vessel had entered Maldivian waters for any purpose other than fishing adding that there had not been resistance from the crew when the coastguard had seized the boat.

“We found fishing equipment and around a tonne of fish on board the vessel. So we have no reason to believe that the boat had entered Maldivian waters for any purpose other than fishing,” Zuhair said.
