Deported Lankan returns to Switzerland
	
	A Tamil asylum seeker who was sent back to his home country in 2013 and subsequently arrested has been allowed to return to Switzerland.
	The man, who was applying for asylum in Switzerland, was sent back to the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo two years ago after the State Secretariat for Migration concluded he would not be in danger if he went back home. However, he was arrested immediately on arrival at the airport in Colombo and was abused during his incarceration, according to his lawyer.
	The man was released from a detention centre in Sri Lanka a few weeks ago. Because Swiss authorities were not prepared to allow him to return to Switzerland immediately, his lawyer filed a formal complaint against the secretariat director Mario Gattiker.
	The secretariat had said that before a decision was taken on his return to Switzerland, the man needed to be questioned at the Swiss embassy in Colombo regarding his affiliation with the Tamil Tiger rebel group.
	The mans return to Switzerland on April 25 was organised by a group of NGOs. His wife and children, who were repatriated with him in 2013, had since been allowed to return to Switzerland and he was reunited with them. An investigation by the Swiss Centre of Expertise in Human Rights and the United Nations Refugee Agency found that the assessment of the mans asylum application had not been thorough enough. As a result, the secretariat issued a ban on repatriations to Sri Lanka in September 2013.
	In May 2014, a more detailed report was released that said a series of blunders resulting from systemic conditions had led to the wrong decision being made in the mans asylum case. Subsequently, the secretariat said it had reformed its practices and the ban on repatriations to Sri Lanka was lifted. Migration authorities now consider repatriations to Sri Lanka as generally allowed.
	Some 250 Sri Lankans were sent back to their homeland by Switzerland between 2001 and September 2013. (swissinfo)

Video: Dont bypass historic opportunity: President on 19A
	
	In his address to Parliament prior to the debate on the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, President Maithripala Sirisena said he was the only President who had been so flexible and committed to reducing or curtailing the absolute powers of the executive presidency.
	He said several of his predecessors had promised to do so but unfortunately they failed to fulfil their promise and pointed out that appearances did not matter when electing a President but what mattered was a persons character and his or her commitment to selflessly serve the country and the people instead of themselves.
	Sri Lanka has no international enemies now because of our successful approach towards the international community. The new government and its commitment to enact the 19th Amendment has received immense support from the international community, the President said.
	Urging all MPs to support the 19th Amendment, President Sirirsena told them not to discard this historical opportunity for the much-despised powers of the executive presidency to be pruned.
	This is what the people have been waiting to happen for the past 38 years. So let us not disappoint them, he said.(Piyumi Fonseka)

Earthquake due to mankinds destructive nature: Patali
	
Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka today said the Nepal earthquake was not an isolated incident but a result of destructive nature of mankind.
Addressing the Workshop on Downstream Petroleum Industry, he said that developed countries were mostly responsible for the environmental consequences.
However, it is interesting to note that the developed world had no regard for the environmental consequences when they were developing since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Only now they have realised the gravity of the problem and are trying to limit the environmental consequences, he said.
He said the Kathmandu disaster has happened near two converging plates, that is Eurasian and the Indian plates.
Therefore, the gradual change and readjustment in these tectonic plates will change the gravity of the whole region resulting many environmental consequences, the minister said.

Full-face helmets: stay order on ban extended
	
The Court of Appeal today extended the operation of the police advisory banning the use of face-covered helmets until May 19.
Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda (President) gave this ruling sequent to two writ petitions filed by a Chartered Accountant and a Retired Army Major who sought an order prohibiting the authorities from taking any action on banning the use of such helmets. The two writ petitions have been postponed for May 18.
Petitioner Rtd. Major Nalaka Indrajith also sought an interim order to suspend the operation of the gazette notification No. 644/20 dated 11/1/1991.
The other petitioner Chanaka Dassanayake of Pita Kotte, a Chartered Accountant by profession, had also sought similar relief in his application.
The petitioners said the petitions were filed as Sri Lankan citizens and in the public interest.
The Police Chief, the Minister of Public Order, the Minister of Internal Transport and the Attorney General were named as respondents. 
Mr. Dassanayake said according to statistics available at the Department of Motor Traffic, as at July 2013 more than 2,642,000 motorcycles had been registered with an average of 100,000 new motorcycles registered annually since 2004.
He said more than 16,000 accidents involving motorcycles had taken place in 2012 and in view of the increasing number of such injuries; the Sri Lanka Standards Institute in 1981 drafted a comprehensive Sri Lankan Standard for the importation and use of helmets by motorcyclists. This was revised in 1994 and 2007. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)Related newsCA suspends full face helmet ban

Indian fishermen engage in illegal acts in SL waters: India
	
	
In a stand that may not go down well in Tamil Nadu, Indian Coast Guard (ICG) on Monday told the Madras High Court that Indian fishermen allegedly indulge in various illegal acts such as smuggling and trawling in Sri Lankan waters resulting in action by the island nation's navy.
The ICG submitted that it cannot take responsibility for the security of the fishermen if they entered Sri Lankan waters and there was confrontation between them and the Lankan Navy, the Daily News and Analysis news agency reported.
A counter-affidavit to this effect was filed by ICG Deputy Director General, K.R. Nautial on a contempt petition against officials for not "obeying" the earlier court orders on providing security for fishermen.
The stand may not go down well in the state where Sri Lanka comes under flak from politicians and government for mid-sea 'attacks' and arrests of the state's fishermen.
The affidavit said the Indian fishermen had never been attacked in Indian waters and that neither the Coast Guard nor Navy permitted any of the Sri Lankan vessels to come to Indian territory.
"After the culmination of civil war (in Sri Lanka in 2009), it is reported that Indian fishermen are resorting to smuggling contraband including drugs due to the developing relationship with their counterparts in Sri Lanka and better monetary returns for such practices," the affidavit said.
"They were also using banned methods of fishing, using high power motors, causing damage to Sri Lankan fishing gear and caught in the act of smuggling contraband and other unlawful activities like mid-sea attack between Indian fishermen and their counterparts," the coast guard said.
Besides, they (Indian fishermen) crossed International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) and entered Sri Lankan waters for better catch as fisheries resources depleted in India.
This led to action by the Sri Lankan naval men. During 2014 and up to March, 2015, a total of 185 boats had been impounded and action taken against 937 crew, it said. Similarly, the Sri Lankan Navy had reported to the Indian High Commission 36,865 instances of Indian fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters.
The ICG had provided 280 distress alert transmitters besides giving emergency numbers to the fishermen, it said adding, however, they did not call the Coast Guard or navy in distress. Petitioner S. M. Ananthamurugan sought contempt action against the Union Cabinet Secretary and others for not obeying earlier court orders in providing security for the fishermen.
