The GMOA said today it had no faith in the presidential committee appointed to resolve the SAITM issue and as such the government would have to face severe consequences soon.

GMOA executive committee member Prasad Kolambage told a news briefing that the association has lost confidence in the committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena because it consists of pro-SAITM individuals.

“The committee which included the Attorney General (AG), University Grants Commission Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva, Health Ministry Secretary and the Higher Education Ministry Secretary have spoken in favour of SATIM on earlier occasions. We do not count on these individuals to provide an impartial solution to the matter,” he said.

Dr. Kolambage said Chairman of the committee, Deputy Minister Harsha De Silva’s stance on this matter was not clear and as such his decision was uncertain.

He said the fact that the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) or the GMOA was not represented in the committee and this would result in a decision favourable to SAITM.

Dr. Kolambage said the GMOA was tricked and mislead on several occasions and would not let it to happen again and proceed with its trade union action.

“We will remain quiet until the committee submits its report. If the solutions are pro-SAITM, the government will have to suffer the consequences,” he said.

Meanwhile, the GMOA said the post of SLMC Chairman has been vacant for two months and the relevant authorities including Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne failed to make an appointment for the only institution that could ensure the country’s medical education quality.
