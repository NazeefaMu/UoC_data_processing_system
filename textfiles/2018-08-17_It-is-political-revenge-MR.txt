It is political revenge: MR


	

Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa today claimed that the government was using journalist Keith Noyahr’s abduction and assault to achieve its political ends and described it as yet another case of political revenge.

He told the media who had gathered outside his residence that five CID detectives had questioned him for about three hours in connection with this incident.

“The CID must have been instigated by government leaders to record my statement. They asked me whether Karu Jayasuriya had telephoned me and whether Keith Noyahr was released after Mr. Jayasuriya had telephoned me. I cannot remember whether he telephoned me or not. So many people telephone me,” Mr. Rajapaksa said.

He said he asked the CID officers whether it was wrong to release Mr. Noyahr and added that they were used to this kind of political vengeance.

“The government is doing various things to achieve its political ends. This is one such incident. This shows the government’s vindictive actions. They must be thinking that this sort of things will not happen to them,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
