Union Bank (UBC) has been recognised by Microsoft Sri Lanka as the first bank in the country to move into Microsoft’s Office 365 (O 365) Cloud Technology, further enhancing the bank’s operational excellence. 
Microsoft Cloud is an outsourced hosting platform that provides an array of features with greater security and convenience for real-time connectivity across Union Bank.
The shift to Microsoft Cloud will provide UBC, uninterrupted availability of email and office applications enabling greater efficiencies in the bank’s operations. Further, it leverages on the shared infrastructure to support the innovation and introduction of new initiatives, adding value to the bank’s premise to deliver unparalleled service to customers.
Commenting on the deployment of Microsoft Cloud, Union Bank Vice President Information Technology Rajeev Munasinghe stated, “This is yet another milestone in the bank’s IT initiatives. We are the first bank to move into ‘O 365’ cloud technology which further exemplifies Union Bank’s continued efforts to use its IT interventions to grow its business more emphatically.” 
“The deployment of the Cloud Technology at Union Bank will result in greater operational efficiencies that result in enhanced service standards to its customers. This platform will reduce costs and increase the speed of delivery of IT services. With the new technology our employees will be able to serve our customers more efficiently and effectively in a confidential and secure manner,” states Munasinghe. 
The Union Bank team will work with Microsoft Sri Lanka in driving this IT strategy forward. 
Microsoft Sri Lanka and Maldives Country Manager Imran Vilcassim stated, “The partnership between Union Bank and Microsoft makes UBC the first major commercial bank in Sri Lanka to move to Cloud Technology with Microsoft. With many initiatives taken in counteracting cyber security along with Digital Crimes Unit, Microsoft continues to thrive in the security platform to enable the valued customers in banking sector. We are looking forward to contributing towards shaping the technology landscape in the financial industry in enhancing end user experience for both internal and external customers in order for organisations to achieve operational effectiveness. 
‘‘Our initiative on driving Cloud Technology in the banking sector had created the momentum as Microsoft had adhered to Central Bank policies in outsourcing guidelines. Moving forward, we are hopeful that the trend Union Bank had set in the banking sector will be a great example for financial institutes in Sri Lanka to adapt cloud-based technologies.”
