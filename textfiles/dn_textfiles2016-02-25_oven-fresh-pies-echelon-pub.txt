There will also be an a-la-carte menu consisting the classic range Beef & Guinness Pie, Shepherd's Pie and Chicken & Leek Pie.
In addition to the savouries the sweetest of them all is the Sweet Board which offers three different sweet pies: Bitter Sweet (dark chocolate fudge and Pecan nut in short crust pastry), Coconutty (Thick coconut custard and toasted coconut pie) and Banoffee (Fresh banana and dulce de leche in biscuit crust).
