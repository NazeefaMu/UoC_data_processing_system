DC report to be gazetted in April

The detailed report from the Delimitation Committee (DC) will be gazetted in April. Measures will be taken to hold the local government elections before June this year, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha said. Addressing the media at the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry, Mustapha stressed that the elections will not be held under the old electoral system. He said he has directed Delimitation Committee chairman Asoka Peiris to complete the report by April. The delimitation is carried out district wise and nearly 1,000 appeals have been received so far, he added.
Mustapha noted that the new system has 30 percent of the proportional electoral system and 70 percent of the ward system and the proposal of 25 percent of female representation will also be taken into consideration to increase women participation.
He added that the pledges made by the President and the Prime Minister to amend the electoral system will be fulfilled.
