Made to kneel as punishment


	

Two top female high-ups of the Ministry concerned have been assigned to inquire into a complaint that several girls including a granddaughter of a dead senior politico were made to stand on their knees by a teacher of an international school in an area north of Colombo, they say.

 


These girls had been ordered to go down on their knees for several minutes for failing to bring their text books despite repeated advice to them, a school source said.


They say that according to the normal practice, a zonal authority would look into an incident of this nature, but in this case two high-ups from the Ministry itself had been asked to conduct an inquiry into it due to the influence used by the family of the dead senior politico.
