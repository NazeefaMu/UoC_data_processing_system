Sri Lanka fast bowler Shaminda Eranga has been reported with a suspect bowling action during the second Test against England, which the host won at Chester-le-Street on Monday, the ICC said today.

According to an article published on the ICC website, the match officials’ report which was handed over to the Sri Lanka team management cited concerns about the legality of the 29-year-old’s bowling action.

Eranga’s bowling action will now be scrutinised further under the ICC process relating to suspected illegal bowling actions reported in Tests, ODIs and T20Is.

He is required to undergo testing within 14 days, and, during this period, Eranga is permitted to continue bowling in international cricket until the results of the testing are known.
