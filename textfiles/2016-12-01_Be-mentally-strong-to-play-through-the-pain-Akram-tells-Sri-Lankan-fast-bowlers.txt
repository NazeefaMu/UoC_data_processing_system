Bowling legend Wasim Akram who was in Sri Lanka for a short training session called for mental toughness to see through constant pain barriers the fast bowlers go through, if they are to be successful in fast bowling.

“Fast bowler, doesn’t matter how old is he, 17, 19, 24 and 35+, you will have niggles, sore backs, hamstring injuries, sore shoulders,” Akram said addressing the media in Colombo. “So a little bit pain, little bit headache or fever and suddenly say I’m not playing the test match. I said, I’m going to play the game, after one session, everything is back to normal. Now a days what’s happening is a little niggle they say I am not playing,” he added.

Akram, 50, conducted a day-long coaching clinic in Colombo on Thursday, in what would be the first of a series of programmes involving foreign experts. He is expected to visit Sri Lanka at least twice a year to conduct such coaching sessions as Sri Lanka Cricket looks to foreign experts to help the local talent.
