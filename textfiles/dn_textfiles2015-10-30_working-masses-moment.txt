Working Masses' moment

There are several ways to contain the import bill in line with export earnings. Socialists or those who want state intervention in the economy will suggest direct control of import and exports. On the other hand, those who believe in open economy will claim it is by strengthening the productive sectors of the economy, both industrial and agricultural, that one could avoid a crisis. But all these are easier said than done. However in Lanka today there is no need of foreign advisers for a serious economic analysis of the present structure of the economy, because our economists are fully capable of such work. Under the power of the Democratic revolution pressure must come for the right direction.
There are several sectors that need equally rigorous attention: they are education, research and development and human resource planning in relation to food production, paddy, vegetables, fruits, milk, and spices. We already have a market oriented management structure in relation to industries; but plantations are lagging behind; both large and small. But there is almost anarchy in the areas mentioned above in relation to food production. Most labour and other resources are wasted by this anarchic situation. It is a tragedy because still majority of producers are involved in the anarchic sector.
Democratic revolution
In other words, what is urgent is inter-sectoral planning to give the attention for most needed. Those who were in the think tank of the Democratic revolution proposed a high level national planning body. The Draft 19th Amendment to the Constitution had a National Planning Commission in the list of Independent Commissions to be appointed but this had been dropped in the amendment finally passed by the Parliament. That shows the inability of the petty bourgeois intellectuals that conducted the discussion. However this can still be done, if the committees of the revolutionary movement such as Samagi Balaya appoint an Interim Council to pressurize the Ministry of Planning. Given the highly significant nature of national planning problem, this cannot be postponed any further. It is true that such a measure is not going to bring quick results due to the long-term nature of national planning but we cannot ignore the fundamental change we are proposing that will influence long-term policy development. As is well known, whether it is Cuba or "successful" East Asian countries, it took two to three decades to steer their economies on an independent path of sustained development to achieve real development of human living conditions.
This has not been possible in Lanka partly due to the corrupt fascistic nature of Mahinda regime which failed to absorb the appropriate technology and partly due to the chauvinist mismanagement of Tamil national question that created the misery of war. As is well known, we were pushed into a river of blood and tears with sky-rocketing of defence expenditure, at the expense of vital social sectors such as education, health, public transport and Rural Development. When a country is confronted by an economic crisis, it is natural for those who are responsible to look into the basic problems of economic management to concentrate on fundamental solutions.
US Government leaders
The economic crisis that the United States faced in 2008-2009 no doubt consumed a major part of the time, money and energy of all concerned to look deep it the mechanism of economy. In fact triumphantly, the Marxists pointed out that the rule of deprecation of rate of profit has made profit come to near zero, with the development of electronic technology. However the US Government leaders were equally keen to find out what went wrong and answered that the fall of rate of profit was due to de-industrialization, among other things. It was identified as a major issue and many initiatives were launched to deal with it.
It is clear as an under developed country we are not affected by the problem of de-industrialization, less by that. Our problem is acceptance of inappropriate technologies due to excessive corruption and bribery. We are told that while the country has no capacity to make many large-scale public investments due to already-accumulated public debts and serious budgetary constraints, it is private investment, in particular foreign investment, that can be the main catalyst in the process of much needed economic diversification. Then they logically conclude it is also necessary to create a conducive environment to attract and retain foreign investment and human resources. That means we have to cut our consumption and create cheap labour climate for the investors. This IMF advice has not worked and it only created a situation for rebellion and terror. We have to look into a different direction. While brain drain has to be stemmed, an effort should also be made to attract skilled Lankans based in other countries through attractive incentive schemes.
Scientific institutions and research centres
We need urgent education reforms to make education democratically accessible to every body. While an emphasis on scientific literacy, computer literacy, critical thinking, logical reasoning, are very important artistic abilities and sensual communication should be extended in all directions. Comprehension, language skills, communication skills, problem-solving ideological thinking should be improved with the practice of empirical methods.
It is necessary to give importance to scientific institutions and research centres that can facilitate innovations and product developments in diverse fields. In other words, facing the development challenge a multi-pronged approach, a well-constituted, multi-disciplinary forum at the highest level of Government is critically important to plan the way forward.
Democracy must make this programme their campaign document while exerting pressure on the government. We have to mobilize trade unions, civil societies that participated in the anti fascistic struggle to mobilize masses. Mere demand of salary increases and economic benefits are not sufficient. It should be a political campaign where working people play the leading role.
