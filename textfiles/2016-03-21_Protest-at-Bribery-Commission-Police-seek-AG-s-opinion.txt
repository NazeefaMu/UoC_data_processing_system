The inquiry against 27 individuals including some UPFA MPs over the Contempt of Court by staging a protest outside the Bribery Commission violating a court order in April last year, was postponed for June 27, seeking Attorney General’s opinion on the matter, by the Colombo Chief Magistrate today.

The Cinnamon Garden Police told Court that they seek Attorney General’s opinion regarding this.
Earlier, the Magistrate ordered the other suspects to appear before Court only when they were noticed, but the suspect UPFA Western Provincial Councillor Upali Kodikara was ordered to be present in Court today because he had breached bail conditions.

Several Buddhist monks including Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera, Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera, Ven. Medagoda Abhayathissa Thera and Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera, Dullas Alahapperuma, Bandula Gunawardena, Janaka Bandara, Roshan Ranasinghe, Sarath Weerasekara, Udith Lokubandara, Jayantha Ketagoda, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Gamini Lokuge, S.M. Chandrasena, Prasanna Ranatunga, Western Provincial Councilors Udaya Gammanpila and Roger Seneviratne were among the suspects.

The protest was held on April 23 near the Bribery Commission against the decision by the Commission to summon former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
