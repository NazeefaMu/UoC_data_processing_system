MUMBAI Daily Mail, Sept 29, 2017 -  At least 21 people have been crushed to death and 30 more are injured after a stampede at a packed railway station in Mumbai.  


Panicked commuters surged forward over a foot bridge at the Indian city’s Elphinstone Road station at about 10.45am amid rumours the structure was collapsing.   


Horrific footage shows chaotic scenes as people tried desperately to flee. Victims of the crush could be seen lying motionless on the steps leading up to the overpass.  


Earlier, railway spokesman Anil Saxena had revealed that huge crowds sheltering from heavy rain had tried to leave the station at the same time.The station is normally packed during rush hour periods with large numbers of commuters making their way to offices in the area.  


Tanaji Kamble, a spokesman for Mumbai’s disaster management cell, warned that the death toll ‘is likely to go up’. It was the peak hour rush but the stampede has been brought under control,’ Kamble told AFP.  


Television footage showed commuters trying to revive the injured by pumping their chests and also carrying some down stairs to street level.  Local trains are the lifeline for the 20 million people of Mumbai.  


Deadly stampedes are fairly common during Indian religious festivals, where large crowds gather in small areas with few safety or crowd control measures.
