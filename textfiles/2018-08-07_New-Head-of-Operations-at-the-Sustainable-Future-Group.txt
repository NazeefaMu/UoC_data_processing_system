Dhishna Bastiansz-Head of Operations at the Sustainable Future Group 

Sri Lanka’s leading environmental certification organization The Sustainable Future Groupnamed its new Head of Operations recently.  Dhishna Bastiansz brings an admirable track record of achievement in market research, marketing and advertising communications fields. With approximately 10 years of Account Management experience in international adverting agencies, DDB,O&M and JWT, she joined local firm Q&E as its Director Account Management, before moving on to the position of General Manager of Quantum Strategic Services, a leading player in the local market research industry. After a brief stint with The Nielson Company, she spent over 6 years as Head, Qualitative Research Business for Lanka Market Research Bureau. Prior to taking on her role at The Sustainable Future Group - she was the Director Research & Strategic Planning at Bates Strategic Alliance. 

Commenting on the new appointment, FarisFausz - Executive Director of SFG said “Dhishna brings a wealth of industrial and marketing experience with her, which will no doubt help SFG to work closely with our industrial and corporate clients and to better focus and shape our service offering, so that we can remain relevant and viable, but while retaining our core proposition of trust and integrity in the work we do. The certification and brand marks that have been developed and offered by SFG are founded on the principles of mitigating environmental impact and are structured to mirror the most globally accepted protocols in each instance. We have worked to better understand the complexities at hand faced by local business and are on a continual journey to better the country’s environmental situation through active engagement with the private sector. With synergies now being achieved between national ideological and political views, the private sector will have an increasingly important role to play in facilitating the country’s transition toward a more environmentally friendly nation. We see SFG as having a strong role to play in ensuring the transparency, accuracy and integrity of the environmental claims made by industry and I believe Dhishna’s appointment will give added impetus toward the achievement of our shared vision.” 

The Sustainable Future Group (SFG) was created to provide the missing link for private sector organizations in the Asia Pacific region with a verification, validation & assurance body that exists to enlighten, engage and empower organizations by ensuring that sustainability is placed at the forefront of their businesses. 

SFG was one of the first in the region to be awarded ISO 14064 accreditation from the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) – the global governing body for accreditation of inspection, verification, testing and certification companies, through its local representative, the Sri Lanka Accreditation Board (SLAB). This enables SFG to provide verification and certification services for ISO 14064 - 1 & 2: Principles and Requirements at Organization and Project Levels for Quantification and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions and Removals.
