The election to decide the next President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has been postponed until further notice, Association Secretary Amal Randeniya said.

The election was scheduled to be held tomorrow.

However, it has been postponed owing to a dispute with the Judicial Services Association regarding the controversial appointment of High Court Judge Ramanathan Kannan.  

The dispute arose after a decision taken by the Judicial Service Association (SLJSA) to refrain from acting as the Presiding Officers.  T. Farook Thajudeen
