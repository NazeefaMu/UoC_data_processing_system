The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today warned that it would resort to an island-wide work stoppage without prior notice after January 22, if the authorities fail to fulfill its demands within this week.

Addressing a press briefing, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the decision was unanimously taken at the executive meeting held this morning.

Also the GMOA had informed the President and the health authorities about its scheduled stern trade union action and said yet it had not received a satisfactory response from concerned authorities. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
