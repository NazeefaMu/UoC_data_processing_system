The Minister of Primary Industries Daya Gamage said he personally believed it was appropriate for Minister Ravi Karunanayake to quit his portfolio until his innocence was proved in the allegations against him over obtaining a penthouse from the controversial Central Bank bond dealer Arjun Aloysius.

“Such a decision on the part of the Minister will be good for the party Minister Karunanayake and I represent as well as for the Government,” he said.

When asked about his stance about the No-Confidence Motion against Minister Ravi Karunanayake he said the leader of the party would decide on the matter.(Dayaseeli Liyanage)
