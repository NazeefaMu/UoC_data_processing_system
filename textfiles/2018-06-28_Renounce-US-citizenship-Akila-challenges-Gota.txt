UNP General Secretary and Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam today challenged former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa to renounce the US citizenship irrespective of his decision to contest the forthcoming presidential election.

Addressing a news briefing, he said if Gotabaya had so much of fervent passion to Sri Lanka, he should prove it by relinquishing the US citizenship and embracing Sri Lankan citizenship.

“This is a drama that Gotabaya is performing in order to get the attention of the people by showing a fake patriotism. If he had genuine passion towards Sri Lanka, he should have not obtained the US citizenship. Therefore, Gotabaya is just flattering about his patriotism,” the Minister said.(Sheain Fernandopulle)
