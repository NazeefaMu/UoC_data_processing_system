Cameron looks forward to working with SL govt
	
British Prime Minister David Cameron said he looks forward to working with the Sri Lankan government and expressed hope that this Sinhala and Tamil New Year will bring communities closer together in helping to heal the wounds of the past.
Sending his best wishes to everyone in Britain and Sri Lanka celebrating Aluth Avurudda and to all Tamil communities celebrating Puthandu Cameron said that Britain's Tamil and Sinhalese communities are huge success stories and doing great things for his nation.
The Prime Minister said:
I would like to send my best wishes to everyone in Britain and Sri Lanka celebrating Aluth Avurudda and to all Tamil communities celebrating Puthandu today.
I know this is an incredibly important time when millions of people will be coming together with families, friends and neighbours to celebrate their new year.
But it is also a time to remember that Britain's Tamil and Sinhalese communities are huge success stories and doing great things for our nation. I see this contribution every day. I see how Tamil and Sinhalese businessmen and women are boosting the economy by creating jobs and opportunities. I see how you contribute to our public services, as teachers in our schools, doctors in our hospitals. I see what you do in building strong communities. You play an immensely positive role.
When I met with President Sirisena in Malta last year, I announced a significant increase in UK support for reconciliation and human rights, recognising the considerable progress Sri Lanka has made and helping to ensure that President Sirisena can advance the important reform work he has already begun.
I look forward to working with the Sri Lankan government and I hope that this New Year will bring communities closer together in helping to heal the wounds of the past.
To everyone celebrating Puthandu and Aluth Avurudda, I wish you a very happy and prosperous new year.

Dhaka objects to SL continental shelf claim
	
Bangladesh has objected to Sri Lanka's claim of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from its coast baseline.
Sri Lanka has made a submission of its claim before the United Nations for determining the limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.
A senior official of the foreign ministry said the government analysed the Lankan submission and it appeared that they also claimed some portion of the Bangladesh continental shelf, which was objected.
It also appears that Sri Lanka has claimed an outer continental shelf entitlement in an area that is 350 nautical miles more from the baseline from which the breadth of its territorial sea is measured and more than 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metres isobaths, and thus beyond the constraints line established by Article 76(5) of the convention, the objection note said.
The government in due course of time will continue to block the Sri Lankan claim to protect Bangladeshs interest, he added.
He said according to the UN laws, a country can have the continental shelf rights upto 350 nautical miles or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metres depth, which one is higher.
But, Sri Lanka from its baseline claimed about 1,000 nautical miles, which is India and Bangladesh's continental shelf territory, the official said.
He said the Lankan government tried to negotiate with the Bangladesh government but it did not agree.
Sri Lanka also claimed a portion of Indian continental shelf and they should complete negation with them first, he said.
According to the United Nations CLCS website, India and the Maldives also objected to the Sri Lanka's claim.
Bangladesh also objected to the continental shelf claims of India and Myanmar.(Dhaka Tribune)

SriLankan flight returned to Singapore due to security reasons
	
SriLankan Airlines flight UL 309 was instructed to return to Changi International Airport by the Singapore authorities due to security reasons soon after it was airborne to Colombo on April 14.
The flight later arrived in Colombo at 0042 hrs on April 15, 2016 with a total delay of 3 hours.
Issuing a statement, the SriLankan said that upon its return to Singapore, the airport division of the Singapore Police Force requested that all check-in luggage was screened once more and also interviewed a few passengers. Accordingly, all baggage was offloaded and sent for security screening. Further, the Airport Police requested SriLankan Airlines to offload 3 additional passengers for further questioning. This was in addition to 5 passengers who were initially detained for interrogation before the flight departed.
In order to avoid further delays SriLankan decided to offload the family members of the two passengers offloaded for interviewing and baggage identification by the Airport Police. SriLankan provided accommodation for all these passengers, who later flew to Colombo on UL 307 of April 15, 2016.
It also said that the five passengers, originally offloaded are still being detained by the Airport Police division.
Passengers on board the aircraft were kept informed of the situation and were cared for by the SriLankan staff.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore is yet to disclose the reasons that led to the recall of flight UL 309. However, SriLankan Airlines is in the process of requesting for a comprehensive report, as ideally all necessary inspections should be completed by airport authorities prior to releasing an aircraft for departure.

The airline commends its team in Singapore and the crew of UL 309 for handling the situation in a professional manner.

SriLankan wishes to reiterate that this incident was beyond the control of the Airline and that SriLankan always maintains the highest safety standards. The Airline considers the safety and security of customers its foremost priority, under no circumstances will this be compromised, the statement added.
