Prisons Officials Collective want SLAS official as chief

The Prisons Officials Collective requested Law and Order and Prisons Reforms Minister Tilak Marapana to appoint only a Sri Lanka Administrative Service official for the post of Prisons Commissioner General.
In a letter addressed to Marapana, the Prisons Officials Collective said: "We as a union are aware that there is no single official within the department with academic and other qualifications necessary to hold the position of Commissioner General of Prisons.
We are also aware of the fact that had any of the commissioners in the fray for the position secures it, that officer would not continue any of the development programmes continued hitherto and spend his time taking political revenge on others who could not help him in his campaign. There would be suspensions and interdiction of service of many officers and transferring them in and out of prisons throughout the country."
A spokesman for the Collective said around 90 percent of union members have expressed their solidarity in requesting for the appointment of only a senior SLAS official to the post of Commissioner General of Prisons.
