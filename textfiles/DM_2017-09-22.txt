A healthy life through physiotherapy
	
Despite the beliefs of many, medicine isnt all about drugs and surgeries. The subject of physiotherapy is one specialised area in medicine where medical miracles are performed using a minimum of invasive technologies. But the topic still remains obscure to many people. Is physiotherapy all about rehabilitation Not so, according to the book Suwabara diwiyai Bhauthachikithsawai (Physiotherapy for a healthy life), by Dr. Sujeewa Weerasinghe, an acclaimed physiotherapist with close to 20 years of experience in the field. The book is edited by Lankadeepa journalist Gayan Sooriyaarachchi, who is also a frequent contributor to the Dailymirror Health Capsule.

This book deals with the day-to-day application of physiotherapy in a myriad of topics ranging from headache and back pain to heat stroke and anti-ageing. This book, according to Dr. Weerasinghe, caters to all groups in the society, from children to the elderly, who are interested in physiotherapy as a form of treatment. The author, through the book, intends to offer guidance to those who wish to step in to this field and to those who have already qualified themselves in the subject of physiotherapy. 
Headache, especially tension headache, is a very frequent complaint amongst adults who are leading a busy life. Dr. Weerasinghe pioneered in finding a new physiotherapy technique to relieve people of tension headaches. He had taken 12 years to perfect this technique, which has been approved by the World Physiotherapy Association. The book also contains details about pathophysiology as well as the treatment for tension headache. 
Pregnancy puts a womans body under great strain. This book explains how a woman can maintain a shapely and a healthy body despite going through the pregnancy period. 
How heavy is your childs school bag According to Dr. Weerasinghe, it should be less than 10% of the weight of the child.The book also describes the short and long term complications associated with carrying a heavy school bag. 
Did you know that maintaining an incorrect posture can give rise to a whole range of problems including chronic back pain and sexual dysfunction More importantly, did you know that sitting in the correct posture for too long can result in impotence in men 
Dr. Weerasinghe is a qualified physiotherapist and is a visiting instructor at the University of Colombo. He is a past president as well as the national organizer of the Sri Lankan Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and the founder and owner of the first private Sri Lankan physiotherapy centre, Physio Life Care.

## Title: A story of a youth who finds himself during a rebellion

A story of a youth who finds himself during a rebellion
	
A Novel byMrs. Jayani Pinnawala- Translated byEdmund Jayasuriya 
Originality is independence, not rebellion; it is sincerity, not antagonism
-George Henry Lewes
The background to Jayani Pinnawalas novel Samukka is the 198789 insurrection. The book touches on the islandwide uprising and focuses on a section of the youth in Thunkama, the area under reference in this novel. Frustration in these youth forced them to take up arms.
They then engaged in sporadic fights against the authorities, who to these youth were inimical to them and the society. They desired changes to society. The novel focuses on the role of a young boy, Wickrama, who hails from an aristocratic and well to do middle class family. He is the only child of Tittawellas. The protagonist Wickrama is described as different from the rest of the members of other wealthy families he is related to. He detested the cravings of these wealthy persons.
The discussions at home, especially when Wickramas mother initiated conversations, were aimed at sustaining the affluent position of the clan. From his childhood Wickrama lived a calm and quiet life. Whenever he managed to get out of home he enjoyed himself with poor youth. Some of his close associates were Cyril and Swarna (Cyrils sister) who lived in the neighborhood. He was an avid reader, convinced and determined to achieve what he believed in.
He always questioned events which took place around him. In the chapters that take a peep in to his inquisitive mind it is revealed that he wished to forge a close relationship with his teacher. He believed that the teacher shared the same philosophy as he and was frustrated with the decadent society and the plight of the downtrodden masses. 
Wickrama was also a youth who viewed the society giving more value to the feelings of people. He often lamented over the degeneration of the upper class which was caused by its life style. The upper class looked down upon the rest of society and regarded them as non entities. These things contributed towards these youth becoming frustrated. Wickramas family considered others to undesirables and never permitting him to mingle with them. However, Wickrama on other hand desired to be with them and endured their friendship. In fact he was in love with Swarna, who was one of them. 
In the face of ongoing rebellious activities, which featured insurgent groups, the author outlines how circumstances drive this youth out of his home. Feelings of frustration drive him to detach himself from his parents and set in to the world outside, despite he not receiving permission nor the blessings of his parents. Wickrama is determined to serve a cause for the betterment of youth and society. Initially he wants to see reality and understand this struggle. He believes he can obtain a hands-on experience about life through his choice. Stepping in to society he learns about several issues plagues the society, like caste differences. He also learns about conflicts, limited opportunities that exist for education and issues connected with unemployment. These issues highlight that a working class exists.  The novel also focuses on events which highlight the attacks carried out on state property and armed forces by unemployed youth, living in rural areas. The book highlights the close study the author has done on the negative environment that existed during these times. That environment made the frustrated youth rebel against society.
Wickrama understood the prevailing situation because he was a studious lad. Since he was well-read he was always articulate during conversations and arguments. The author describes him as a down to earth person. The social set-up and the events during this time lead him to fully embrace socialism. He offers his support to a group which the Government doesnt wish to see exist. His wealthy parents are initially worried and suspicious of their sons behavior. They make plans to protect him from being murdered by the armed forces. In their attempt to save their son, the parents sacrifice their health, wealth and titles. 
Samukka is aSarasavi publication and is available in leading book stores in both Sinhala and English Languages
Using their lofty social status Wickramas parents bring him home and send him abroad for higher studies. This severed the contacts Wickrama had with all his neighbour friends. The Government sent the rebels who surrendered and those who were captured to rehabilitation camps. 
Besides Wickrama, the author gives accounts of other courageous and brave young characters like Cyril and Swarna. They all leave their relatively peaceful lives to join the revolution for the establishment of a socialist society. But Wickramas character is very powerful. He is the only son of wealthy parents, who own a lot of property. Yet he disowns his father, drops a comfortable lifestyle and opts to become a social activist. The authors depiction of this character is strong enough to make the reader fall in love with him.  After completing his studies in India, Wickrama returns home and learns that his friend was murdered in a rehabilitation camp and that Swarna has left home without leaving a trace. Although he has become a successful musician and a writer he realizes that his dreams have been shattered. This situation brings great sorrow to him. 
Wickrama is presented with an award for the book he has written, based on his own experiences during the revolutionary years. The book helps him unite with Swarna, his love. 
Samukka is a masterpiece by Mrs. Jayani Pinnawala in which she depicts a heartwarming story of a revolutionary teenager who wants to establish in society the equal rights of the people. In this novel we can understand the bitter truth associated with the society and the never ending conflict between the suppressors and the suppressed. 
Though Wickrama rose from the dumps during the insurrection, his friend Cyril ended up dead in a camp. Events like this happen even everyday in our society. The story is an incredible eye-opener for the present generation about real life. It mirrors Government changes, abuse of wealth and power, limitless love and the affection of parents. 
Mrs. Pinnawala writes about what happens to families; especially the young and what realities they experience during times of revolution. She shows us how people like Wickrama overcome obstacles, and the manner in which they grow in the face of challenges. People like Wickrama have had to usually put up a fight to become someone and find their place in the society. In this society, one is either born in a castle or in to family stricken with poverty. It is a fight-or-die world. The strongest and the wealthiest always survive while the weak usually perish, unless a strong one takes them under his wing. 
This story sends a very important message to the reader. It tells us all to look in to the past and learn from it instead of repeating it. This is because if we keep going down the path our youth twice went on, we would end up obtaining the same results again. 
Samukka is a Sarasavi publication and is available in leading book stores in both Sinhala and English Languages.

## Title: Attention deficit hyperactivity  disorder  in adolescence

Attention deficit hyperactivity  disorder  in adolescence
	


While Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD is relatively well recognized in children, when it comes to older age groups it is in a way more difficult to recognize. Many adolescents struggle with this issue and are likely to benefit from some form of help. Not identifying their difficulties often leads to people labeling them as lazy. Individuals with this condition also dont perform up to expectations.

The difficulties in identifying this condition are many fold. Firstly, for a diagnosis of ADHD to be made, symptoms must have been present prior to age 12. This may be difficult to recall for the teenager as well as the parents. Secondly, obtaining reliable information for third parties will be difficult as teenagers spend their day with a variety of teachers and other adults with little time and direct contact with only a few people, mostly their peers. Parents too may also not have the opportunity to spend a lot of time with them, other than during day-to-day tasks. The third issue is that symptoms can be varied and greatly influenced by contextual factors, requiring a careful unraveling of them. 

For a diagnosis of ADHD to be made, symptoms must have been present prior to age 12. This may be difficult to recall for the teenager as well as the parents

In adolescence this may show a trajectory towards more severe and even antisocial activities towards adolescents. It is described that treating ADHD in these adolescents can go a long way in ameliorating these behaviours as well

While the hyperactivity component is marked in most children with ADHD, adolescents with this issue rather than being hyperactive tend to be very impulsive and inattentive. The main reason for this change in presentation is the trajectory of the disorder itself. It is well described that the hyperactivity component of children with this issue declines with age, towards adolescents. This overt hyperactivity in some changed in to a internal sense of restlessness. They are left with attention regulation and impulsivity regulation issues, which tend to decline at a much slower rate with age. To confuse matters even more, adolescences itself is a period of heightened difficulties with emotions and impulses. 
Again issues with attention are likely to crop up at times of heightened demand for attention ( e.g in close proximity to exams, when there are many things to concentrate on at the same time). Adolescents are also likely to have built up their own ways of coping with difficulties. It is when all of these cannot compensate that their difficulties with attention begin to show. 
Another factor that contributes to the difficulties that adolescents have with ADHD is related to the finding that around 70% of those with this issue also have difficulties with what are called executive functions. These are the higher or skills such as planning impulse control, working memory ect.These functions become more needed as children grow older. The education system in its current form also puts a severe strain on these functions, so that some adolescents find that their coping strategies are inadequate. These deficits also become more prominent in adolescence. When they were children their parents may have compensated for these issues by helping them (e.g constant reminders, packing their bags, planning activities and helping in academic tasks). However, as they grow older, they will be expected to perform more and more independent tasks which require these executive functions. 
One of the main secondary issues for adolescents with ADHD is depression. With failing grades, and impulsivity getting in the way of relationships, they are vulnerable to develop depression. The entity we describe as hyperkinetic conduct disorder, more commonly described in adolescence can also be an issue. These children are more likely to violate age appropriate norms and engage in activities such as stealing lying, hurting other etc In adolescence this may show a trajectory towards more severe and even antisocial activities towards adolescents. It is described that treating ADHD in these adolescents can go a long way in ameliorating these behaviours as well. 
While currently ADHD is considered a disorder that can persist into adulthood causing the same kind of issues described above, but in different contexts (E.g in work rather than in academic work.), diagnosing ADHD in adolescents and even adulthood isnt an easy task. Many other conditions and circumstances have to be carefully considered before hand. As such these kind of diagnoses are best made by professions with training and experience in these areas. 
However that being said correct diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adolescents as in children can make a significant positive difference to their lives.

Cricketers ask SLC to probe Pramodyas allegations
	
The national cricketers including 40 contracted players have called for an immediate inquiry intosome shocking allegations made by former Sri Lankan cricketer and selector Pramodya Wickremasinghe about unnatural and mysterious match patterns, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said today.
It said in a statement that the cricketers, in a petition signed by the cricketers including both captains Dinesh Chandimal and Upul Tharanga and sent to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), have drawn attention to what they say was shockingly disparaging and hurtful statements by Wickremasinghe to a private television station that tend to give the general public a suspicious impression about them.
The players have drawn exception to Wickremasinghes serious allegations highlighting nine issues that unnatural and mysterious match patterns had occurred and rejected the allegations as totally baseless and untruthful, it said.
As such the cricketers have urged the SLC to initiate an immediate inquiry by summoning Wickremasinghe in fairness to their good names that have been slandered by such diabolic allegations and have further challenged Wickremasinghe to prove his allegations.

Customs nab young couple with Rs.88M in local, foreign currency at BIA
	
A young couple bound for Dubai, who tried to smuggle out local and foreign currency amounting to Rs.88 million, making it the largest ever detection of local currency, were stopped by officials of the Customs Narcotics Control Unit at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) last night.
The couple was searched by the officials on suspicion when they tried to leave the airport through the 'Silk Route' private lounge with their baggage, Customs Spokesman Deputy Director Sunil Jayaratne said.
A 24-year-old man and his lady partner aged 22 were to leave for Dubai on Srilankan Airlines flight UL225, which was scheduled to depart at 6.25pm yesterday.
The couple who claimed to be business people had told Customs officials that they were from Dematagoda.
Customs Deputy Director at the BIA Parakrama Basnayake told the Daily Mirror that they had stopped the couple when they were waiting at the paid private lounge 'Silk Route'.
He said the couple was suspected to have used the services of the private lounge which is similar to that of a VIP lounge to attract less suspicion to their actions by the airport authorities.
The currency included a large amount of wads of Rs.1, 000 notes amounting to Rs.44 million, US Dollars 45,000, Euros 35,000, Omani Riyals 4,000, Bahrain Dinar 2,685, Saudi Riyals 599,500 and UAE Dirhams 72, 000.
Mr. Basnayake said the Customs authorities at the BIA had thwarted 17 attempts to smuggle out Rs.320 million worth of currency this year to date and this detection including Sri Lankan Rupees amounting to 44 million is considered to be the biggest stash of local currency ever detected while attempting to smuggle it out of the country in Customs history.
The currency was found neatly packed in black polythene bags in the check-in baggage of the suspects.
Customs suspects that the young couple might have been used as pawns by a third party to courier the currencies from Sri Lanka to Dubai.
The detection was made by Assistant Superintendents Nuwan Abeynayake, Rasika Samanjith and Srilal Ananda. Investigations are underway under the direction of Superintendent Nissanka Rathnayake on the instructions of Director Parakrama Basnayake and Deputy Directors Darshana Silva and Hapugaskumbura.

Do not forget, when they forget
	


Pics of Lorraine by Kushan Pathiraja
Forgetfulness is a sign of old age. This could be associated with conditions such as dementia in the latter stages. One of the causes of dementia is Alzheimers disease which is described as a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts mildly, but worsens with time. The World Alzheimers Day falls on September 21. In 2012, September was declared as the World Alzheimers Month in an attempt to raise awareness regarding the challenges dementia patients face and the stigma that surrounds those with this illness. 

Identifying Alzheimers disease
About 70% of the risk of developing Alzheimers is associated with genetic factors, but other reasons would include head injuries, depression or hypertension. A probable diagnosis is based on the history of illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for those of normal ageing. Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing a burden on the caregiver; the pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. The course of the disease is divided into three stages with a progressive pattern of cognitive and functional impairment: 
Early stage
In the early stage of Alzheimers, a person may function independently. He or she may still drive, work and be part of social activities. 

Middle Stage
The middle stage or Moderate Alzheimers is typically the longest stage and can last for many years. As the disease progresses, the person with Alzheimers will require a greater level of care. 
At this point, symptoms will be noticeable to others and may include: 
 Forgetfulness of events or about ones own personal history 
 Feeling moody or withdrawn, especially in socially or mentally challenging situations 
 Being unable to recall their own address or telephone number or the high school or college from
which they graduated 
 Confusion about where they are or what day it is 
 The need for help to choose proper clothing for the occasion 
 Trouble controlling bladder and bowels in some individuals 
 Changes in sleep patterns, such as sleeping during the day and becoming restless at night 
 An increased risk of wandering and becoming lost 
 Personality and behavioral changes, including being suspicious and delusions or compulsive, repetitive behavior like hand-wringing or tissue shredding 

Late stage
This stage is where a person may develop severe Alzheimers. At this stage of this disease, individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, to carry on a conversation and, eventually, to control movement. They may still say words or phrases, but communicating pain becomes difficult.

Symptoms include : 
 Need round-the-clock assistance with daily activities and personal care 
 Lose awareness of recent experiences as well as of their surroundings 
 Experience changes in physical abilities, including the ability to walk, sit and, eventually, swallow 
 Have increasing difficulty communicating 
 Become vulnerable to infections, especially pneumonia

Lanka Alzheimers Foundation
The Lanka Al zheimers Foundation (LAF) is an approved charity incorporated in 2001 and registered with the Ministry of Social Services. LAF is the <U+FB01>rst non-statutory organization dedicated to advocating and addressing the needs of those diagnosed with cognitive impairment and dementia. LAF is a member of the world body Alzheimers Disease International (ADI), which represents 79 countries  new members continue to join ADIs membership annually, re-enforcing the growing importance of addressing dementia care issues across the globe. 
The Daily Mirror spoke to its Founding Director and President, Lorraine Yu to find out what services it offer to the clients as described by Lorraine herself. We dont call them patients but they are our clients. The idea of commencing this foundation initiated back in 1999 and itsa huge challenge to incorporate it. We had a vision to build a centre, so that it could be sustainable. Of course it was a dream to build a centre because it wasnt easy to find the funds. When people walk in through the gates, they think we are a rich organization and that we are funded by international donor agencies. But this centre was put up by funds raised laboriously and many people in the community contributed in some way. From then to now we have come a long way and Im happy to see where we are today. This centre was initiated on World Alzheimers Day which falls on September 21 and each of us celebrates birthdays on this day. The services are absolutely free and we have dedicated volunteers who make things possible. Sometimes our clients have accidents and we have a professional caretaker who attends to those matters. We cook them in-house meals and its served in buffet style. Likewise we try to give them the necessary care because they are helpless. People arent aware of dementia and Alzheimers and when they come to us we give them our fullest support,said Yu.
Some of its services are as follows : 

Providing a hypo-allergenic, water and sweat resistant identification bracelet for clients who are at risk of wandering and getting lost. This supple device has round edges to protect sensitive skin and is personalized with contact details of the family carer. 
	A full cognitive assessment of memory and reasoning skills for any member of the community on a regular basis as part of its dynamic programme of activities. This assessment is conducted free-of-charge and its recommended for anybody. 
	The LAF Activity Centre is set in a warm, welcoming and tranquil environment giving true specialised care to people with dementia. The focus of the centre is to provide an environment where people with dementia feel comfortable. 
	The Foundations volunteers provide free confidential counselling for persons with dementia and their families. The counselling extends to the provision of helpful information on understanding dementia, the progression of the disease and information on successful, stress free caregiving. 


The progression of Alzheimers is irreversible : Prof. Chandrika Jayasinghe
Keeping this in mind, the Daily Mirror spoke to Professor Chandrika Jayasinghe, Professor in Medicine, University of Peradeniya who has done extensive research on ageing. According to her, Alzheimers disease occurs after 60-65 years of age. They have a problem with registration of information and therefore dont remember events of the recent past. Hence they tend to forget peoples names and this could get worse with time as they find it difficult to perform complex tasks.
They may find it difficult to identify space. At home they might probably remember where to go, but if they visit somewhere they may find it difficult to get their way about. Several other symptoms such as difficulty in sleep and speech would occur at the latter stages. Alzheimers is one cause of dementia and it cant be prevented. Many Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes and hypertension would give rise to Vascular Dementia if the vessels that supply blood to the brain are blocked or narrowed. Vascular dementia could be prevented or delayed by controlling diabetes and other conditions leading up to it. But this is not the case in Alzheimers. Its progression cant be reversed, but in rare instances, symptoms could improve if they follow their medication and get proper treatments. 
Speaking further Prof. Jayasinghe said that since Sri Lanka has an increasing elderly population Alzheimers would be a big social issue in future. We need trained people to take care of them. There are instances when parents are left alone and children have migrated. Sri Lanka has a dearth of trained dementia caregivers and thats not a good sign. Most people who care for these patients are their relatives and they dont have any kind of training. We dont have trained nurses in geriatric medicine. 
As mentioned earlier, Sri Lanka has one of the worlds fastest ageing populations and Alzheimers and other age-related diseases would be on the rise. According to statistics collected by the Lanka Alzheimers Foundation, Sri Lanka would have approximately 463,000 people with Alzheimers by 2050. Statistics also show that the annual mortality rate per 100,000 people from Alzheimers and other dementias in Sri Lanka has increased by 87.9% since 1990, an average of 3.8% a year.

Does your breath smell bad 
	


Everyone has some time or other wondered if they have bad breath, maybe even let out a breath into their palm to get a quick whiff of it. There are many reasons as to why people have bad breath, which is medically known as halitosis. This condition occurs due to bad oral hygiene and can even be a sign or symptom of another health problem. To enlighten us on this matter the Health Capsule spoke to Dr. Pravna Dunuwille, Dental Surgeon, who spoke about the causes of bad breath and how to prevent and manage it. 

Causes
Dr. Dunuwille explained that there are a variety of causes for bad breath or halitosis such as oral, respiratory psychiatric and other factors. The first one is the oral causes which are related to the mouth. This includes poor oral hygiene, which is improper brushing and flossing of teeth and infections in the oral cavity. Dental caries or gum diseases can also cause halitosis. Another oral cause is dry mouth, which is caused by salivary glands, said Dr. Dunuwille.
Speaking of the respiratory and other deeper causes for bad breath she said, Respiratory causes such as throat infections, viruses, lung infection or bronchitis can cause bad breath. Then there are other illnesses, including gastric problems such as gastric reflux, gastric cancers, liver diseases and kidney diseases, which can also cause halitosis or bad breath. 
She further went on to explain the exterior and psychological causes of bad breath. There are exterior causes such as what you eat and drink like garlic, coffee and onions. Even smoking can cause bad breath. There are even cases where people think that they have bad breath when they really dont have it which is called pseudo halitosis which comes under the psychological causes for it,she explained.

What you eat can affect your breath
Speaking of how the bad breath originates due to the oral causes Dr. Dunuwille said, When someone maintains poor oral hygiene, it leads to gum diseases and due to the gum diseases this bad breath occurs. The microorganism which causes gum diseases is called anaerobic bacteria which are organisms that dont need oxygen for respiration,said Dr. Dunuwille.
She further said, When there is poor oral hygiene and people dont brush or floss properly, what happens is that food gets accumulated between the gum and the teeth. When this happens the gum gets inflamed and because of this pockets are formed. And since there is no oxygen inside the pockets it is a suitable environment for these anaerobic bacteria to form and they keep growing there. When this bacteria grows in between the teeth and the gum it causes gum disease, which is also called gingivitis, which in turn causes bad breath. Sometimes when the halitosis becomes severe due to the worsening of gum disease there is a pus discharge called pyorrhoea,she explained.
Furthermore, she said, When it comes to exterior causes such as garlic and coffee the substances inside such items cause it. Furthermore, some such items can release gases when digested, which causes the bad breath,said Dr. Dunuwille.

Prevention and management
Speaking on how to prevent and manage bad breath, Dr. Dunuwille said, To manage bad breath orally you have to clean up the tongue, use mouthwashes such as chlorhexidine, floss and brush regularly, go for regular clean ups, gum massages and basically maintain good oral hygiene.You can even be given antibiotics such as the topical application of metrogyl. Vitamin C can even be used in order to increase the healing of the gums. Some people think that just because the gum is bleeding they should not brush it, but even if it is bleeding you have to brush it and keep it clean,she affirmed.
She further said, For the other diseases you have to treat the underlying cause for the disease to manage the bad breath. And for the psychiatric illness you will have to go for counseling. Giving up smoking can also help with treating bad breath because smoking stains the teeth and can cause plaque build up which can worsen bad breath. 

Who treats bad breath
Speaking of who treats bad breath she said, For the oral causes you have to go to the dentist and they will manage it as said before. First of all, if it is poor oral hygiene, then they should be advised on what they should do and a clean up should be done. And if it is due to dental caries then they will have to fill the cavities. Due to the dental caries there can be food stagnation, so again there you can get bad breath.
Dr.Dunuwille further said that if all oral causes are ruled out then the patient should refer to other specialists to find out the underlying cause.

EC should announce its stance: JO
	
The Elections Commission (EC) should announce it stance in relevance with the governments move to delay the Provincial Council Elections and the PC Election Amendment Bill which was passed on Wednesday with the two third majority in parliament, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Leader Prof. G. L. Peiris said yesterday.
Addressing a news conference, he said that it was questionable as to why the PC was still reluctant to come out with a specific clarification over the incidents occurring which were applicable to EC.
It is obvious that the main reason as to why the government tends to postpone the elections is they know exactly that they would definitely defeat at the PC polls. Therefore, they have no intention of accelerating the process to hold the elections and at the end of the day it is the franchise of the people which is being deprived, Prof. Peiris stressed.
Meanwhile, leader of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Prof. Tissa Vitharana said that the way the incumbent government was moving signified that it was heading towards dictatorship.
This corrupt government has not practised democracy right throughout their governance but has shown predetermines that it would be sailing towards a despotic system of government, he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

## Title: Hyperlipidemia - The Lipid Factor

Hyperlipidemia - The Lipid Factor
	


Hyperlipidemia is the medical complication where there is an increase in lipid levels of the blood,-Prof. Arjuna De Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama

Lipids come in various forms. Each lipid component can trigger a medical condition if found in excess levels in the blood. High cholesterol leads to hypercholesterolemia, high levels of triglycerides lead to hypertriglyceridemia, other excessive lipid components lead to other such issues. But all of these conditions fall under hyperlipidemia. Hyperlipidemia is a very common condition. Prof. Arjuna De Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama, addressed the formalities of the medical malady, hyperlipidemia. 

Definition
Hyperlipidemia is the medical complication where there is an increase in lipid levels in the blood, said Prof. De Silva. Lipids collectively comprise a group of naturally occurring molecules. This includes fats, waxes, sterols, fat soluble vitamins, monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides and phospholipids amongst others. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia are two common conditions that occur under hyperlipidemia. Hypercholesterolemia occurs when there is an increase in cholesterol levels in the blood whereas hypertriglyceridemia is triggered by an upsurge in the levels of triglycerides in the blood. Cholesterol is mainly classified as High Density Lipoproteins (HDL) and Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL). HDLs are known as good cholesterol and LDLs are blamed as bad cholesterol, he stated. 

Causes
There are two main factors that contribute to hyperlipidemia in general. According to Prof. De Silva, one is family history and genetics. The other is a persons diet and amount of lipid intake. The former cause leads to the congenital condition of the disease. The dietary intake of excess lipids can lead to a case of hyperlipidemia later on in life, most commonly seen in middle-aged people. 

Symptoms
Prof. De Silva stated that generally symptoms related to hyperlipidemia are non-specific. The congenital conditions of the disease may exhibit symptoms such as tendon xanthomas and corneal arcus. Tendon xanthoma is where lipids get accumulated and deposited within the tendons. This is also seen in patients below 40 years of age. Corneal arcus (also known as Arcus senilis) is a condition where there are greyish or yellowish opaque rings or arcs in the outer parts of the cornea of the eye. The corneal arcus ring consists of lipid and cholesterol. This symptom is rarely seen in patients. 

Diagnosis
Hyperlipidemia is diagnosed using the usual methods such as screening, blood tests after fasting, etc. By obtaining a lipid profile, it is possible to check the levels of lipid components in the blood, explained the professor. 

Treatment and management
Prof. De Silva accentuated that hyperlipidemic patients have to keep their blood lipid levels under control by way of medicinal drugs. In order to manage the blood lipid levels at healthy set-levels, patients suffering from hyperlipidemia have to strictly adhere to a healthy diet reducing their lipid intake. Exercise is also recommended to maintain a healthy blood circulation. Exercise helps avoid the deposition of lipids and excess fats in the body. Managing hyperlipidemia is important to prevent other conditions such as heart diseases. While hypercholesterolemia can lead to other serious medical conditions like heart diseases, hypertriglyceridemia wont give way to heart conditions as it is less severe. 

Prevention
Preventive methods that have to be followed in order to reduce the risk of falling victim to hyperlipidemia revolve around the usually advised methods. These include a balanced diet with a carefully monitored lipid level and regular exercise which contributes immensely to lead an active lifestyle. This ensures a lowering in the risk of falling under the category of a hyperlipidemic patient. But if a patient has a family history of hyperlipidemia, the person will succumb to the malady as a congenital condition. Since the patient inherits hyperlipidemia genetically, it cant be prevented and the patient will definitely have to resort to medicinal drugs to keep the lipid levels under control. Intake of fish oil is advised for hypertriglyceridemia, explicated Prof. De Silva. 

Age groups at risk
Usually people in their middle ages fall susceptible to various forms of hyperlipidemia. The congenital condition of hyperlipidemia is generally higher in countries located in South Asia compared to the west, according to Prof. De Silva.

JVP supporting mainly to abolish executive presidency: Anura
	
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday they would support the Constitution-making process based on several facts including the abolishing of the executive presidency and changing of the electoral system.
The JVP MP told Parliament that the constitution was meant to protect the social and economic policy of the country and added that they were against that policy and the constitution in general.
He said however they would support the constitution making process on the aspect of making democratic reforms.
He said they were of the opinion that a new constitution should be introduced as the present constitution had been amended 19 times mainly to ensure the power of the government in office.
We will participate in the constitution making solely to abolish the executive presidency which was detrimental to the country. The democracy could not be upheld while maintaining the executive presidency and it should be abolished to protect the peoples' rights and uphold democracy, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the electoral system also should be changed and added that if parliamentary electoral system was to be changed, it should be done within the constitution not by amending it.
He said the constitution should ensure equal rights of all communities and added that no faction should participate in the constitution making with racial ideology. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Kaul to attend SOS Childrens Regional  Directors Meeting in Sri Lanka
	
SOS Childrens Villages International President Siddhartha Kaul is expected to arrive in Sri Lanka on September 23 to head the Annual Regional Directors Meeting to be held on September 24 at the National Training Centre in Piliyandala. 
The Regional Directors Meeting in the past was held annually in Austria at the SOS International office. However, for the first time, the meeting is scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka to strategize and discuss the current status, the way forward and the initiation of the SOS Care Guarantee, for children and young adults. The regional meeting will further elaborate on living an independent life, the importance of education, employability, preparation for living and after care, which focuses on specific areas of need. Following these key fundamentals, there will be discussions on gradually decreasing support whilst enabling and maintaining life-long ties with SOS families currently occupying the SOS Villages across 134 countries. 
Commenting on Kauls visit, Divakar Ratnadurai, Deputy National Director, SOS Childrens Villages, Sri Lanka said, It is our privilege and joy to welcome back our President Sidhartha Kaul to his second home, the SOS Childrens Village in Piliyandala. President Kaul built this village in 1979 as a young man and to date, we celebrate the efforts and time he invested to make SOS Childrens Villages in Sri Lanka a reality and a success. 
Coinciding with the SOS Childrens Regional Meeting will be the launch of the Pragna Education Fund on September 27 with the support of Hatton National Bank. Funded and driven by the HNB for the benefit of children in the care of SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka, under the slogan Education makes the Difference, the fund is open to the general public to partner and support the educational needs of children. The fund will be used to support the education of children who are cared for through the family based care and family strengthening programmes. The beneficiary category will range from children who attend kindergarten, right up to undergraduate, graduate and professional qualifications. 
Siddhartha Kaul was recently bestowed with the prestigious Sri Lanka Ranjana award for a decade of untiring efforts in to creating A Loving Home for Every Child in Sri Lanka. 
No child should grow up alone and the success and impact of our work is and shall be reflected in what the young people in our programmes achieve
Kaul was elected President of SOS Childrens Villages International in June 2012, and re-elected for a second four-year term in June 2016. His association with the organisation dates back to his childhood in India where, in 1964, his father became the Founder and Director of the first SOS Childrens Village in India after meeting Founder Hermann Gmeiner. Following Kauls established SOS Childrens Village in Sri Lanka, he led the rebuilding of the organisation in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia after the conflicts in these countries. He was also in charge of SOS Childrens Villages Internationals biggest emergency relief programme to date after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.  Siddhartha Kaul, President, SOS Childrens Villages International stresses that No child should grow up alone and the success and impact of our work is and shall be reflected in what the young people in our programmes achieve.

## Title: Lets see whether you really need  a stent for CAD!
## Section: Medicine

Lets see whether you really need  a stent for CAD!
	

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is very prevalent in
Sri Lanka. Doctors have four means to treat patients with this condition.

1. Lifestyle counselling (smoking
cessation, exercise and diet)
2. Effective medications
(anti-anginals, cholesterol lowering statins, blood thinners etc.) 
3. Stents to unblock coronary blockages 
4. Bypass Surgery 

There are several investigations carried out to diagnose the presence and extent of CAD. The type of investigation a doctor may choose for this purpose depends on the patient.There are guidelines which help cardiologists make the correct decision. I have summarized a few important ones below. 

Exercise testing recommendations for screening
Exercise testing is used to identify whether a patient with cardiac symptoms has an insufficient blood supply to the heart on exertion. A positive test indicates that the patient may need either medication and/or further tests such as a coronary angiogram for the diagnosis and treatment of CAD. In general, exercise testing isnt recommended for the routine screening of asymptomatic (free of any symptoms of coronary heart disease) men or women. 

Recommendations for coronary angiography
Patients who are asymptomatic (free of any symptoms of coronary heart disease) and who have normal exercise tests dont need coronary angiography. 
So if you find yourself on the procedure table about to have a coronary angiogram, given that you have good exercise capacity and no symptoms of coronary heart disease (angina or breathlessness), you are probably in the wrong place! 

Angioplasty/Stent
Coronary angioplasty or stenting, also called percutaneous coronary intervention, is a procedure used to open blocked heart arteries. Angioplasty involves temporarily inserting and inflating a tiny balloon to where your artery is blocked to help widen the artery. 
Angioplasty is often combined with the permanent placement of a small wire mesh tube called a stent to help prop the artery open and decrease its chance of narrowing again. Some stents are coated with medication to help keep your artery open (drug-eluting stents), while others arernt (bare-metal stents). 
An important study published in the New England Journal of Medicine a few years ago revealed that patients with stable heart disease, who had angioplastystent procedures and took drugs to treat their coronary artery disease, had the same risk of future cardiovascular events as the patients who only took the drugs. 

In the right setting an angioplasty-stent procedure can be effective in treating symptoms like angina and improving a patients quality of life. However, in many cases the risk and cost associated with the angioplasty-stent procedure isnt worth the potential reward. Making lifestyle changes with attention to a good diet and regular exercise along with good drug therapy (anti-anginals, cholesterol lowering statins, aspirin) can improve cardiac health and is the cornerstone of good cardiac care. 
In general, stents dont prevent heart attacks or prolong life. However, if someone is in the middle of having a heart attack due to the sudden blockage of a heart artery, urgently opening the artery with a stent would prevent a small heart attack from becoming a severe heart attack and can prolong survival.
This type of emergency treatment isnt available at all hospitals and in this situation the rapid administration of blood clot dissolving drugs is required. So if a person suddenly develops pain across the chest with radiation to the throat and arms, sometimes accompanied by sweating, the patient should call an ambulance if possible or go to a hospital quickly for an ECG to check whether their are signs of a heart attack. 
I see many patients with no angina symptoms or breathlessness who are being stented just because they have a blocked artery. Clearly, from the scientific evidence, such stenting is not warranted and carries a risk. 
So if you are getting a stent for CAD, when you have no symptoms such as angina or breathlessness, you are getting a very costly treatment with potential risks which will give you no benefit whatsoever!

Maximum devolution in one undivided and indivisible country: Interim report
	
The interim report of the steering committee set up under the Constitutional Assembly was presented by its Chairman Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday stressing that Sri Lanka should remain one undivided and indivisible country where maximum devolution should be granted. It states that there shall be specific provisions included in the Constitution to prevent secession (division of the country).
The report has proposed provincial councils would be the primary unit of devolution while local bodies have been named as the implementing agency of both the central government and the provincial councils.
Under the heading Division of Powers between the several tiers of government to be clear and unambiguous the report states:
4.1 There is general consensus, including among the Chief Ministers who made submissions before the Steering Committee, that powers must be clearly and unambiguously divided and that the present Concurrent List should be abolished. This was also suggested in the Report of the ad hoc Sub-Committee on the relationship between Parliament and Provincial Councils.
4.2 The Public Representations Committee for Constitutional Reforms recommends the introduction of two lists, (i.e. a National List and a Provincial Lists) and also a Local Government List.
The Steering Committee is of the view that there should be a National List (Reserved List) and a Provincial List It was also decided to consider retaining a Concurrent List specifying subject areas which are necessary to be retained in a concurrent list.
National List will include subjects which are necessary to ensure Sovereignty, Territorial Integrity, Defense/National Security and Economic Unity of Sri Lanka.
4.3 Parliament may by law provide for the implementation of functions on selected Subjects in the National List by the Provinces.
4.4 Parliament or Provincial Councils may by law/statute provide for the implementation of specified functions within their purview, to be carried out by the Local Authorities.
The report had stated that further discussion is needed to decide on provisions provided in the present constitution for two or more provinces to merge stating that there are different opinions on the matter.
The following options have been discussed:
 The existing provisions of the Constitution [Article.154A(3)] relating to the possibility of two or more Provinces forming a single unit, should be retained, with the additional requirement that a referendum of the people of each of the Provinces concerned should also be required.
 The Constitution should not provide for merger.
 The Constitution recognizes the Northern and Eastern Provinces as a single Province.
Also provincial public service commissions are also recommended.
On article 1 and 2 of the constitution the following has been stated in the report:
The President whilst speaking on the Resolution to set up the Constitutional Assembly, stated that whilst people in the south were fearful of the word federal, people in the north were fearful of the word unitary. A constitution is not a document that people should fear.
The classical definition of the English term unitary state has undergone change. In the United Kingdom, it is now possible for Northern Ireland and Scotland to move away from the union. Therefore, the English term Unitary State will not be appropriate for Sri Lanka.
The Sinhala term aekiya raajyaya best describes an undivided and indivisible country. The Tamil language equivalent of this is orumiththa nadu.
In these circumstances, the following formulation may be considered:
Sri Lanka (Ceylon) is a free, sovereign and independent Republic which is an aekiya rajyaya / orumiththa nadu, consisting of the institutions of the Centre and of the Provinces which shall exercise power as laid down in the Constitution.
In this Article aekiya rajyaya /orumiththa nadu means a State which is undivided and indivisible, and in which the power to amend the Constitution, or to repeal and replace the Constitution, shall remain with the Parliament and the People of Sri Lanka as provided in this Constitution
On Article 9 of the constitution the report states:
The following formulations may be considered:
 Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by article 10 and 14(1)(e).
OR
 Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while treating all religions and beliefs with honour and dignity, and without discrimination, and guaranteeing to all persons the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Other proposals include increasing the number of seats in Parliament to 233 and a mixed electoral system and ensuring a certain percentage of woman members which is to be decided later and the establishment of a constitutional court. The 233 parliament seats are to be distributed thus: 140 (60%) on the basis of First Past the Post (FPP) and 93 (40%) as compensatory seats required to ensure that the final result reflects proportionality.
On the establishment of a Second Chamber the report states:
1. There is general consensus that a Second Chamber should be established, which is largely representative of the Provinces.
2. It is suggested that the Second Chamber should consist of 55 Members, 45 drawn from the Provincial Councils (each PC nominating 5 Members of such PC on the basis of a Single Transferable vote), and 10 Members elected by Parliament on the basis of a Single Transferable Vote. Such 10 Members should be persons of eminence and integrity who have distinguished themselves in public or professional life.
3. The Second Chamber shall not have the power to veto ordinary legislation, but may refer ordinary legislation back to Parliament for reconsideration. After Bills are placed on the Order Paper of Parliament, they shall be referred to the Second Chamber to obtain its views, if any, prior to the Second Reading.
4. In addition to the legislative powers set out below, the Second Chamber shall also exercise such oversight and other functions as may be prescribed by the Constitution or law.
5. No Constitutional Amendment shall be enacted into law unless passed by both Parliament and the Second Chamber, with special (2/3) majorities.
If the Referendum requirement is triggered, the Amendment shall not be enacted into law unless also approved by the People at a Referendum.
The report had not made any suggestions on the executive presidency but has stated that proposals made by different parties should be considered. It has proposed that alternatives on how a prime minister should be appointed should be considered. The alternatives listed out include selecting according to a Westminster system, directly elected by the people or pre commit support of candidates contesting the parliamentary elections. A significant proposal with regard to the Prime Minister is that a no confidence motion could be brought against him or her only after he or she completes two years of office.
Under the heading Capital Territory the report states: The National Capital and the Seat of the Government of Sri Lanka shall be the City of Colombo within the Capital Territory. The Capital Territory of Sri Lanka shall consist of such area within the Western Province.
Several political parties including some of the government allies have made certain observation on various aspects of the constitution. The Joint opposition, government alley JHU had opposed the devolution to provincial council system and the setting up of a second chamber. TNA has suggested that Sri Lanka should be a united, indivisible federal state. SLFP has proposed that three members of the second chamber be appointed to the cabinet while the cabinet should be confined to 30 ministers while deputy ministers should be a maximum of 30. Also SLFP has suggested that subjects of the ministries should be spelt out in the constitution. Several parties have suggested that executive presidency should be remained. EPDP led by MP Douglas Devananda has suggested that there should be only a two types of local bodies namely pradeshiya Sabhas and Municipal Councils. All Ceylon Makal Cachi (ACMC) has opposed the mixed electoral system for Parliament and had proposed appointment of deputy presidents based on the clauses set out in the draft constitution of 2000. The JVP has suggested the abolition of executive presidency, setting up of a special constitutional court and has stressed that there should be a single police service.
Constitutional Assembly is expected to debate the interim report next month (October). (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Mexico earthquake: Race to save children trapped  under school building
	

At least 248 people have been killed since the catastrophe struck on Tuesday - with safety experts fearing the number could climb up to 1,000.Rescuers have battled for 15 hours to save one girl, known only as Frida Sofia, who they found alive after she poked her fingers through the rubble. She also said there were five other children under the rubble with her. 
As her chances of survival diminish with each passing hour, officials vowed to continue with search-and-rescue efforts. 
Rescuers had earlier seen her hand protruding from the debris and the girl wiggled her fingers when asked if she was still alive. 
Theres a girl alive in there, were pretty sure of that, but we still dont know how to get to her, Admiral Jose Luis Vergara told Televisa.More than 50 survivors have been plucked from several disaster sites in Mexico City since Tuesday afternoons 7.1-magnitude quake, leading to impassioned choruses of Yes we can! from the first responders. 
Eleven other children were rescued from the Enrique Rebsamen School, where students are aged roughly six to 15. Twenty-one children and four adults there were killed. Meanwhile Popocatpetl volcano, to the southeast of the capital, has erupted - possibly as a consequence of the earthquake. 
A church collapsed at the foot of the volcano, according to Forbes magazine, killing at least 15 worshipers.

Ministry wants restrictions on soft liquor removed
	
The Ministry of Tourism and Christian Affairs has proposed the removal of restrictions imposed on soft liquor sales in the 2018 Budget, Minister John Amaratunga informed Parliament today.
Responding to a question asked by UNP MP Budddika Pathirana the minister said his ministry had requested the Minister of Finance to ease laws pertaining to soft liquor such as beer and wine so that these types of alcoholic beverages would be freely available.
Availability of soft liquor is essential for the tourism industry. Soft liquor is available in almost all shops in other countries which focus on the tourism industry whereas it is the opposite in Sri Lanka. Therefore we have requested for the restrictions imposed on soft liquor sales be removed, he said.
The MP who asked the question said several beer manufacturing companies in the country are carrying out a massive production drive having got to know the government's plan to remove sales restrictions on soft liquor.
Meanwhile, the minister said the government was also focussing on imposing a tax on apps and on online hotel booking services and highlighted that fact that these ventures earned large revenue while the government and the country lost at the end of the day. (Yohan Perera)

Miscarriage: The devastating  end to pregnancy
	


Pregnancy is the next most awaited news after marriage. From the moment that the pregnancy test showes a positive result, newly expectant parents will plan out their entire pregnancy, leading up to the delivery and beyond. But unfortunately, things dont always go as planned.
However, the news that she has lost the baby in the womb can be devastating to a mom-to-be. Statistics show that about 15% to 20% known pregnancies end up in miscarriage. But the actual figures are much higher since many miscarriages occur so early after conception that the woman doesnt even know that she was pregnant before the miscarriage happened. 
Today, the Health Capsule decided to Consult Dr. U.D.P Rathnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, Castle Street Hospital on the topic of miscarriage, why and how it occurs, the availability of treatment options for the future and most importantly how to avoid certain miscarriages, on behalf of our readers. 
Miscarriage is the term used for a pregnancy that ends on its own, within 20 weeks of conception. Ultra Sound Scanning is the main tool of clinical diagnosis of a miscarriage. Talking about miscarriages, it can be categorized in to various groups, according to which the method of management is determined, states Dr. Rathnasiri. According to him, miscarriages fall in to four main categories. 
Threatened miscarriage: Here, the mother is presented with bleeding from the vagina, but the fetus is still alive and the neck of the womb is closed. The focus of management is to stop the fetus from miscarrying. The mother is kept under observation and bed rest may be recommended until the threat of miscarriage has disappeared. 
Missed miscarriage: Here the fetus isnt alive, but the products of conception arent expelled from the body. 
Incomplete miscarriage: This is similar to missed miscarriage, but only a portion of the products of conception have come out. In both these cases the main aim is to take the remaining fetal parts out of the womb, preventing the chance of infection in mother. This condition could lead to severe consequences with regard to the mother. This could be done either through oral medication or through surgically. 
Complete miscarriage: In this case the fetus is dead and no parts are remaining in the womb. Main management is the reassuring of the mother and counseling her. 
In addition to the treatment of the present condition, the patient will be counseled on re-conception. She is advised to ideally wait 3-4 months before planning to get pregnant again. This is the advice doctors give healthy mothers before they plan their next pregnancy. Advice differs when mothers have had a long term medical condition in which case she is referred to a physician to get the disease under control. If she is having a history of repeated miscarriages, investigations are done to identify the causes and to rectify them before the next pregnancy. In rare cases, mothers who go through the ordeal of a miscarriage may need psychiatric counseling, continues Dr. Rathnasiri. 
What causes the body to miscarry a fetus According to Dr. Rathnasiri, the majority of the miscarriages are due to genetic causes, meaning that there is an abnormality in the genes passing down from the mother and the father, resulting in an embryo that isnt properly formed and isnt viable. In some cases where the mother has uncontrolled disease conditions like Thyroid disorders or Diabetes, there is a higher probability of a miscarriage when compared to a young, healthy mother. Being obese and old are conditions which expose a pregnant mother to the risk of having a miscarriage. In addition, there are special circumstances that put the mother in danger of having a miscarriage like when the situation of the neck of the womb is too low. 
Now, to the most important question of all. Can we prevent a miscarriage from happening Unfortunately, theres nothing we can do if the fetus has a genetic problem that causes severe defects and the body decides that it cant be carried to term, but there are measures that we can take, in some, according to Dr. Rathnasiri. In the case where the mother is having chronic disease, its crucial to consult your physician before getting pregnant. Keeping the symptoms of the disease under control will help you have an uncomplicated pregnancy, resulting in better outcomes to both mother and baby. Its ideal for women, who fall under the obese category, to bring their BMI under control. Abstaining from bad habits like smoking, alcohol and drugs is also very important to carry a healthy baby to term, according to Dr. Rathnasiri. 
When should a pregnant women seek medical advice, with regards to miscarriage. Seek immediate medical advice if you have per vaginal bleeding and cramping type abdominal pain, the sooner the better, he recommends. 
A miscarriage will have a big impact on a couples lives. In an event like this, the support of the family and friends is crucial. Understanding the medical aspects of a miscarriage, realizing that it wasnt your fault and coming to terms with it can go a long way towards healing the mental wound. Talking with the healthcare provider, whether its the doctor or a midwife, and clearing any doubts is also important. The most vital thing is to follow medical advice and to prepare early for the subsequent pregnancy, which will result in a much happier outcome the next time around.

BUSTED: When it comes to birth control pills, there are pills which have less amounts of estrogen. They have less effect on the body weight as well as on the lining of the womb. Birth control pills actually improve the shedding of the endometrium every month, so it doesnt increase cancer risk of the womb. But there are some people who have found that it might increase chances of breast cancer, but that is in women who have a high risk for cancer and not in the average women. But there are pills that have less effect on weight gain, said Dr. U.D.Prathnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, Castle Street Hospital.

NCPA launches probe into students carrying Osari Pota
	
The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) today launched an investigation into the incident at Gannoruwa in Kandy on Thursday where 250 female students of a primary school were used to carry Osari pota (Saree bridal veil) of a bride.
The 3,200 meter-long piece of bridal clothing was created by a beautician, who is hopeful of setting a Guinness World Record for her work as the worlds longest Saree.
The students of Alwathugoda Sarath Ekanayake Primary School were seen lined up along the GannoruwaKandy Road displaying the Osari Pota to the Guinness officials.
NCPA Chairperson Marini De Livera said the act was not only a clear violation of child rights, but also degrading.
These children should stay at school and not carry a saree out in the sun during school hours. We dont even know how many students fainted. This is an ill-treatment of the students, she told the Daily Mirror.
She said once the students were handed over to the school, their protection and responsibility was with the Principal as they are under his custody.
The Principal cant send students to wedding functions. I have instructed the NCPA Police team to obtain a report from the area Police Station so we can continue with an investigation immediately, she said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Not against devolution of power in new Constitution: SLFP
	
Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said yesterday the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was not against the devolution of power in the new Constitution.
He told parliament that they had put forward several proposals to the Constitution while they were of the opinion that the unitary state should be in tact in the new Constitution.
"We agreed to form a national government to achieve several objectives including the introduction of new electoral system. We all supported the 19th Amendment. We also came to an agreement to pass the 20th Amendment but we could not do it", he said.
He said the SLFP held the fact that electorate system should be introduced to the parliamentary election just as it was done to the Local Government and Provincial Councils.
He said the SLFP had proposed that the ministries and deputy ministers should be restricted to 30 in the new Constitution.
He said they also proposed that the new Constitution should have provisions so that subject of ministries could not be changed.
He said their proposals also included to repeal the executive powers of the President to some extent while to appoint a President elected by the votes of all the communities to uphold the position of unitary state of the country.
Mr. De Silva said the Prime Minister should be appointed through the Westminster system. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Numbers that shape your destiny  from 41 to 50
	

We are discussing the significance of numbers based on the numerical and vibrational value of a persons name or date of birth or on the aggregate value of both. We have already discussed the significance of such numbers from 11 to 40 in previous articles. We are examining the significance of numbers from 41 to 50 in this article.
Number 41: This number signifies worldly success. The success is assured especially when the subject is working as `a team member of a large group. The subject is endowed with the ability to make sound judgments. Therefore, he would do well when he acts on his own judgment.
Number 42: This too is a favourable number. Persons holding high office help the subject achieve success. The members of the opposite sex would augment his fortune through love and affection.
Number 43: This number indicates hardships, obstacles, and upheavals in life. Efforts to meet the persistent challenges would end in failure.
Number 44: This number predicts losses due to speculation and in games of chance. The subject would suffer due to not being discerning and discriminating in choosing associates and business partners. There would be no happiness in marriage as the subject would fail to win the love and respect of the partner.
Number 45: This number signifies drive and action. The subject would achieve high office thanks to his skills.
Number 46: This number holds out much potential for positive action. However, success comes mainly due to help from friends and the members of the opposite sex.
Number 47: This number indicates loss of wealth due to unforeseen contingencies and unreliable employees and business partners. The subject would fall victim to wiles of the opposite sex.
Number 48: This number represents abstraction rather than pragmatism. The subject is one who builds castles in the air. He makes many plans, but they are never implemented. He is more a visionary than a practical person.
Number 49: The subject is apathetic and laggard in every activity. He is not a good mixer either. Therefore, he remains isolated from others. However, he would do well if he becomes energetic and proactive.
Number 50: This number represents success. The subject is endowed with good judgment and resolution. He would play a key role in a large organization. He would do well if he is guided by his own intuition and good sense.

Opening zoo at night may risk animals' lives: JVP
	
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake asked yesterday whether a scientific study had been carried out to assess the impact on animals due to the opening of the Dehiwala Zoo at night.
He told Parliament that animals need rest at night and added that keeping the zoo open at night may risk the lives of the animals.
"This is a serious matter. The animals may die,he said.
Mr. Ratnayake speaking at the debate on Sri Lanka's sustainable Development Bill said a zoo which was kept open at nights in England was renting it for late night parties to raise income.
He added that the Dehiwala Zoo also may have to be rented out to cover the extra expenses.
He said the impact report on animals should be presented in Parliament.
Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said he had the experts' reports on the matter and added that they had revealed that there would be no impact on the animals by keeping the zoo open at night. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Rupee gains as exporters sell dollars
	

REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee ended firmer yesterday as dollar selling by exporters surpassed mild demand for the greenback from importers, dealers said.
The spot rupee ended at 152.65/75 per dollar, compared with Wednesdays close of 152.70/85.
There was some exporter (dollar) selling and importer demand was not there, said a currency dealer requesting anonymity.
The rupee has been under pressure since January after the Central Bank stopped defending the currency and started buying dollars to build up the countrys depleted foreign currency reserves.
The island nation saw Rs.17.7 billion of net inflows into equities up to Wednesdays close, and Rs.9.4 billion worth inflows into government securities as of September 13, official data showed.

SL among nations to retaliate against HR defenders: UN
	
UN Human Rights office revealed on Wednesday that Sri Lanka is among the 29 countries that have retaliated in the past year against human rights defenders who cooperate with the United Nations.
The report by the UN Secretary-General says individuals and groups have suffered reprisals and intimidation ranging from travel bans and asset-freezing to detention and torture.
It is frankly nothing short of abhorrent that, year after year, we are compelled to present cases of intimidation and reprisals carried out against people whose crime  in the eyes of their Governments  was to cooperate with UN institutions and mechanisms, said UN Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Andrew Gilmour, the senior UN official designated by the Secretary General to address the issue.
We should see these individuals as the 'canary in the coal mine', bravely singing until they are silenced by this toxic backlash against people, rights and dignity  as a dark warning to us all, Gilmour said, as he presented the report to the Human Rights Council in Geneva.
All the cases highlighted in the report occurred from June 2016 to May 2017 and involved individuals and groups which have cooperated with UN human rights mechanisms, used UN procedures, submitted communications under procedures established by human rights instruments, or provided legal or other assistance to other people. It also covers families or supporters of victims.
Gilmour told the Human Rights Council that the report was by no means exhaustive and the problem was much more widespread.
Since this report is limited to reprisals against people cooperating with the UN, the cases covered in it represent only a small portion of a far more generalized backlash against civil society and others challenging State authorities, especially human rights defenders, Gilmour said.
The report urges all States to stop reprisals, investigate existing allegations, provide effective remedies and adopt and implement measures to prevent recurrence. It says governments which have been challenged about the cases either did not reply or failed to address the concerns in the responses they provided.
Countries named in the report are Algeria, Bahrain, Burundi, China, Cuba, Egypt, Eritrea, Honduras, India, Iran, Israel, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Venezuela.

Parliament sources told the Daily Mirror that the Speaker placed his signature to give effect to the Bill at around 9 pm.
The Bill was passed in Parliament on Wednesday night with a two thirds majority.
It was passed after some anxious moments during which a successful attempt was made by the government to muster the required number of votes to get it approved.
Well informed sources said Deputy Minister Wasantha Senanayake was taking a shower when he was asked to rush to Parliament to vote in favour of the Bill by some MPs while Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara who was undergoing treatment for an illness also had to come although three months leave was approved for him recently. It was also reported that MP Hirunika Premachnadra had to rush in with her new born infant.
The Bill paves the way for the postponement of elections for Sabaragamuwa, North Central and Eastern provincial councils as it provides for holding of elections for provincial council under the new mixed electoral system. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Subject sans Heart line is selfish and cold-blooded
## Section: Jyotisha News

Subject sans Heart line is selfish and cold-blooded
	
Human Hand  Trailblazer of Human Civilization  Part 26

The Heart line originates in most cases from the Mount of Jupiter or the Mount of Saturn and runs across the palm under the Mounts of Apollo and Mercury to terminate on the percussion.
This line is found in most hands. Occasionally, only one line crossing the upper portion of the hand under the Mounts and terminating on the percussion is seen, making it difficult to say whether it is the Heart line or the Head line. However, palmists treat this one line as the Head line and consider in such a case, the Heart line is missing.
The lines on the palm are controlled by the brain which is linked to the Head line. Therefore, the Head line should necessarily appear on the palm.

Cold-blooded and Selfish
The absence of the Heart line indicates that the owner is cold-blooded and selfish. He would seek success at the expense of grievous injury or death of another. If the Heart line is missing from both hands, the subject could be a big bully or a bluffer.
If the Heart line is clear, distinct, faultless, and pink or reddish, the subject would achieve success in life, gaining fame and respect of the society.
There are three established readings relating to the rising point of the Heart line, but they are subject to modifications depending on variations of the line.
The three readings are:
(1) The line rising from the Mount of Jupiter: The subject is kind and affectionate. His love is genuine.
(2) The line rising from between the Mounts of Jupiter and Saturn: The subject is endowed with common sense and is practical in regard to love and affections. He is not carried away by sentiment. He is capable of coming to terms with reality. He would not seek a love unattainable nor would pine away over its loss.
(3) The line rising from the Mount of Saturn: The subject is a seeker after sensual pleasures. His love for a member of the opposite sex is more physical than spiritual. If his Mount of Venus is large and red or pink in colour, his passion for sex is unusually strong and if his line of Mars is strong, it indicates he would succeed in fulfilling his desires using even his physical strength.
A clear Heart line and a strong thumb are necessary to prevent the Heart ruling the Head which could lead to failure in life.
The Heart line leaning towards Head line at its start signifies that the subject is ruled by his head rather than by the heart.
Should the Heart line originate from the Head line, the subject would be fully controlled by the head or by reason.
The Heart line terminating after running a short distance indicates a serious difficulty at the date the line stops despite all other lines running their course. The sudden ending of the Heart line far short of the percussion, would mean either the heart would cease to function or the subject is too self-centered to have any consideration for others.
The length of the Heart line is important. The line is normal when it runs across the palm to terminate on the percussion. In certain cases, the line starting under the Mount of Jupiter ends under the Mount of Saturn. Such a line indicates short life.
The Heart line terminating on the Mount of Apollo says that that the subject is a great lover of art and beauty.
The Heart line terminating under the Mount of Mercury indicates that the subject attaches more importance to money or wealth than to love. The line ending on the upper Mars signifies that the subject is attracted to Martian qualities like aggressiveness, dynamism and fighting spirit.
If the Heart line makes a sudden deflection towards the Mount of Moon, the subject would be a jealous person. He would be very pessimistic in outlook.
The character of the Heart line is vital for making a reading. For the Heart line to be perfect or near perfect, it should be uniformly distinct and unmarred by breaks, islands or other defects throughout its course. Such a good line signifies strong love affairs, consistency in love, good blood circulation and good physical condition of the heart.
A thin Heart line indicates selfishness and little care for others.

Often fall in love and fall out of love
The broad and shallow line indicates a measure of physical weakness of the heart. Such subjects are not consistent in love. They often fall in love and fall out of it. If all other lines are also defective, the subject is not at all reliable.
The chained formation of the Heart line is also not favourable. The chained Heart line with a large Amount of Venus signifies the subject is a flirt. Remember that the Heart, Head and Life lines indicate the age of the subject and the age can be determined by the measurement of the line.
The qualities of this line as in the case of other lines are applicable only to the period for which it is chained, thick, thin broad or shallow.

Islands, an indication of a weak heart
The islands on the Heart line are a defect which indicates the weak physical condition of the heart.
Cross-bars cutting the Heart line show either heart trouble or worries caused by affections.
Dots on the line point to defects in health.
Stars on the line too indicate illness or sorrows caused by unrequited love or separation of loved ones. A star on the line below the Mount of Saturn indicates Rheumatism. A well-formed large star at the centre of the line indicates a sudden heart attack at the age to be determined through the measurement of the line.

## Title: The court:  Our children  as our priority

The court:  Our children  as our priority
	
Broadly speaking, children can encounter the law in three ways: as criminals, as perpetrators, and as witnesses. That there are problems in our justice system stems partly from the fact that we refuse to accommodate those children as children with respect to these categories. Even though we do treat them differently, at the end of the day they tend to find our courts and processes difficult and overwhelming. 
Our collective refusal to identify and treat children for who they are is reflected in the almost contradictory attitude the law has taken towards them. Consider how, for instance, their age limits are set when they are tried as perpetrators. A person is said to be criminally responsible only if he or she has attained or passed the age of 8 (as set out by the Penal Code of 1883). A judge has the discretion to try a person as a criminal if he or she is between the ages of 8 and 12, if that judge can ascertain whether he or she has attained a sufficient level of maturity and understanding as to the consequences of a particular course of conduct. Those between 12 and 16 can be held as criminally accountable even if it, that point, is not conclusively ascertained, while those between 16 and 18 are regarded as adults. (However, no one below the age of 18 can be sentenced to death.) Not exactly helpful or consistent, is it 
And if this wasnt confusing enough, there was another attempt at a classification made, this time by the Children and Young Persons Ordinance (or CYPO) which stated that children were individuals below the age of 14, and young persons were those between the ages of 14 and 16. In 1998 a study by the Lawyers for Human Rights and Development (LHRD) concluded that this double classification could in the long run explain the confused state of our juvenile justice system. Taken in itself, the argument is tenable; if we cant set down the age limits of a child in legal terms, how are we to determine if a child is a child and, in individual circumstances, how he or she should be treated, whether as criminals or victims or even witnesses 
The Child Protection Force has as its main objective the implementation of a system of child friendly Legal Aid. Makes sense. A perusal of the very many instances of injustice and disproportionate punishment meted out to our children
The problems are there for all to see, clearly. So what are the solutions If at all, is there one particular way through which the shortcomings of the law with respect to juveniles can be ameliorated, if not done away with completely The Child Protection Force, which I dwelt on at some length in last weeks column, seeks to combat all those problems, all those shortcomings, by resorting to a juvenile justice system that lives up to its name. A key component of such a system, which by the way is already there in Sri Lanka, is the establishment of juvenile courts. That there already are such courts in this country is certainly welcome. That they are considered to be inadequate and inappropriate, however, indicates that weve become complacent over them. 
The Child Protection Force has as its main objective the implementation of a system of child friendly Legal Aid. Makes sense. A perusal of the very many instances of injustice and disproportionate punishment meted out to our children, of whom some involve such unspeakably horrifying crimes as genital mutilation, would convince anyone that, as the president himself noted two years ago, the entire nation must bear the overall unconditional responsibility for their protection. Heres what the CPF souvenir I got, on that Sunday two weeks ago, has to say about the matter: 
... the victimised child or the actor is forced to reckon with the various actors in the criminal justice and public juvenile care system due to being the victim of a crime or carrying out the offence himself/herself. Decisions are made... by different persons who are stakeholders in the system, be the decisions appropriate or not for the circumstance of the individual child. The child is then at the mercy of the actors within the system, until a decision is made regarding his/her fate.
The tagline, so to speak, of the CPF is spot on in this regard: To Expedite and Educate. Expedite, because most court cases involving children (as with most court cases, period) are delayed to such an extent that they become harrowing, turning those children into adults before their time; and Educate, because those actors within our system are unaware of how to make that system more amenable to them. I believe that the latter can come about through a cohesive regime of legal aid, in turn predicated on a cohesive juvenile justice system. Thats where juvenile courts come into play. 
But first: what are juvenile courts A good starting point would be the socially conscious novels of Charles Dickens, which depicted the horrifying, sometimes gruesome, conditions of labour and life that awaited the wretched and the helpless. From those novels to the establishment of a first Childrens Courts (as they were referred to back then), a key motif that runs through the debate Dickens raised is that theres a rift between retributive and restorative justice. The latter is aimed at salvaging the criminal, the former at punishing him or her. Of the two retributive is more suited for adults, so once you inflict it on children, not only are you violating Aristotles take on equality (comparing like with like, never with unlike), you are also increasing the chances of them relapsing to their earlier habits once retribution has been meted out to them. Theres a term for this, by the way: recidivism. 
Its not really a coincidence that the worlds first Juvenile Court was established, exactly one year before the dawn of the 20th century, in a country that was seeing industrialisation on a scale unparalleled in any other part of the world: the United States, more specifically Illinois. The 18th and 19th had been the centuries of progress and growth, that is, progress and growth at the exorbitant cost of human development. They were predicated on the sustained denigration of the lower orders, of which children figured in significantly: long before the West became liberal champions of juvenile justice in other countries, it procrastinated on its own processes of ensuring the safety and welfare of its own children, its own women.

While the first few decades of the new century saw no real difference between Juvenile and normal Courts, nevertheless the former congealed into a class of their own, guided by one stark principle: for children to be guaranteed justice, either as offenders or as victims, there must not only be the exclusion of features all too common in other Courts (such as the bespectacled, old, and strict judge thrashing his gavel on the table, giving a final determination), but also the inclusion of features that would directly appeal to a child, such as (inter alia) play areas and counsellors. The problem in Sri Lanka, then, is that because of our muddled up definitions of children and their legal parameters, Juvenile Courts were destined to be muddled up as well.

To be sure, this country doesnt lack statutory provisions when it comes to juvenile justice. The Children and Young Persons Act was enforced around half a century after the enforcement of the Penal Code. It was the CYPA that created Juvenile Courts, with a caveat: unlike most other countries where such Courts exist independently, here they were created within our Magistrates Courts. In other words, as per Sections 2 and 3 of the CYPA, Magistrates would be empowered as judges of Juvenile Courts, with the Act defining such judges and their scope of authority and jurisdiction. Obviously, this was hardly adequate, as can be inferred from the fact that, until about five or six years ago, of the more than 70 MCs situated around the country only one, in Bambalapitiya, could be considered as a Childrens Court. The problems that flowed from this were inevitable and deplorable, including inordinate delays. 
In 2010, in reaction to calls made by certain concerned authorities, both civil and even within the government, the first JC was established in Battaramulla. Barely a year later, another such Court was built in Jaffna. The importance of these two cant be discounted. At all. They were needed, not only to try out child offences, but also to ensure that cases involving children were concluded quickly. However certain imperatives for improvement remained: the fact that most cases involving children are never referred to these courts, the fact that the process of hearing cases, no matter how amicable it may be to the child, is preceded by a harrowing, and often unfriendly, process of making complaints and having police officers and other wielders of the law take them down: all too often, the social stigma attached to this is so overwhelming that children sometimes do not report any offence committed against them at all. 
Its not really a coincidence that the worlds first Juvenile Court was established, exactly one year before the dawn of the 20th century, in a country that was seeing industrialisation on a scale unparalleled in any other part of
the world
In the final reckoning, then, why does all this matter Last week I contended that if we continue with a culture whereby children are made to conflate unconditional deference for authority, we will succeed in creating two kinds of individuals: those who wield the baton and those who resist it. Well, that argument is compounded by another: if we continue with a muddled up legal system based on even more muddled up legal definitions of children, and their age parameters, we will end up contributing to that culture. By neglecting that issue, hence, we will be neglecting our own children. 
Thats why I think and believe that the Child Protection Force is doing a commendable job. Legal aid is a veritable method of combating the apathy adults in the legal system exhibit towards those children. As Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, at that forum two Sundays back, contended, however, it is not enough. It must be followed by collective action. By everyone. By you and me.

The three Provincial Councils of Sabaragamuwa, North Central and Eastern will be brought under the administration of the governors of the respective provinces once the terms of office expire on September 26 until such time the elections are held for the three provinces, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha said yesterday.
Minister Musthapha said that elections for the three PCs could not be held until the delimitation process was over and expressed hopes that the government would be in a position to finish the job by March 2018 making way for the elections commission to conduct polls for the three PCs in March.
Now that the Provincial Councils (Electoral) Amendment Bill has been passed in Parliament by more than a two thirds majority on Wednesday, the Elections Commissions is not obliged to announce nominations for the three PCs after the expiry of the term of office of the three PCs.
Minister Musthapha addressing a news briefing at his ministry last afternoon said if there were any impediments - legal or technical- to delay the passing legislation on delimitation, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will appoint a five member committee to address them and pass the bill before March 2018.

Undergrads develop  shoes with sensors for patients
	
A research group from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Moratuwa developed a novel biomedical system for the benefit of patients suffering from diabetics, high blood pressure, neurological diseases and Parkinsons disease with remote monitoring of their walking patterns and activities in real time. Cutting-edge technologies such as Internet of Things and 3D printing were adopted to their system development.


This project was a final year undergraduate project done by Peshan Sampat
h, Eranga De Silva and Lakshitha Sameera of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa. The programme was carried out under the supervision of Senior Lecturer and in-charge of Mechatronic Engineering Stream Dr. Ranjith Amarasinghe. 
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people and having the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. 3D printing also expands new paths in the field of manufacturing engineering with its additive manufacturing techniques. 
First, we designed a pair of shoes and 3D printable shoe insoles to incorporate force sensors and aligned them to vital points in the foot. A microcontroller development board fixed inside the heel of the shoe is used to capture force sensor outputs of those vital pressure points at heels.Then the system is developed so that it captures useful data to transmit to the main controller of the system located on a waist belt of the patient via Bluetooth. Further, we used GSM to transmit useful information to the IoT server for further processing and decision making, is how the research group explained their technical description of the system. 
Dr. Ranjith Amarasinghe
Their developed system, a combination of a pair of shoes and a waist belt transmitting information to IoT server, is further processed so that in real-time it could identify the activity of the patient who wears the system, remotely. Also, the Android application, specially developed for this system, allows the same to remotely identify activities carried out by the patient remotely. As an example the user is able to maintain an activity record of day-to-day activities such as walking, running, standing, sitting, sleeping and much more among the recognizable activities in the IoT cloud. A patient, who is recovering after a surgery, can be remotely monitored by physicians with this system. It is capable of generating a report with regard to activities carried out by the patient. It lets the physicians to remotely access information regarding the recovery stage of the patient. This developed system is also capable of sending notification to an assigned person in an emergency with the location identified using GPS, via SMS where urgent attention is needed. Due to this capability, our research can be incorporated as a remote caring platform for elderly persons to avoid any danger that a person can face, the researchers said. 
Eranga De Silva
The research team was able to exhibit their research findings atThe 5th IEEE Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE 2016) held at Kyoto, Japan. 
The research team extended its profuse gratitude to the Senate Research Committee (SRC) of the University of Moratuwa, Salith Ranasinghe and ChathuraJeewantha of Mechatronics Systems Laboratory of Mechanical Engineering Department for the support extended to them. Further, they thank every person who helped them in carrying out this research.

Unitary State of  Sri Lanka and 13A
	
The book titled Unitary State of Sri Lanka and the 13th Amendment was launched at Sri Sambuddhatwa Jayanthi Mandiraya in Colombo last Monday. The book is a compilation of the 13th Amendment and various court rulings given on it. It was compiled by Desarasa Lanka Foundation.
The launch was attended by a number of distinguished persons including Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera, MP Dinesh Gunawardena, Prof. Nalin de Silva, Manohara de Silva PC and AttorneyCanishka Vitharana.
They criticised the attempts of the government to introduce a new constitution which they stated was detrimental to the country. They said constitutional reforms were not a requirement of Sri Lankans but offoreign elements.

India demanded 13A:MP Dinesh Gunawardena
The 1987 constitutional reforms and SC ruling have been included in this book. Not many people know these facts. International and domestic forces continued to influence successive governments to divide the country. When S.J.V. Chelvanayakam formed the Federal Party (Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi), the US Ambassador extended his countrys greetings and said they were keen on helping Chelvanayakam. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution was a demand of India. India is a subcontinent whereas we are a small country. From the 13A, India has granted us some powers more than what were given to its states just because we are a weak and lenient country. This status has not been changed even today. Our government co-sponsored to bring in a UN resolution which includes proposals to amend the constitution and take action against war heroes. Through the resolution, we have accepted that the war victory was wrong and soldiers could be produced in a war crimes court. Meanwhile, a war crimes petition was brought in against Ambassador Jagath Jayasuriya for giving orders to end the war. Supporting the UN resolution was a grave betrayal.
We will not allow the government to change the unitary character of Sri Lanka.
When the 13A was tabled, MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena voted against it, thereby becoming one of the only two Government MPs to not extend their support. This is a good example as to how MPs can vote in parliament against detrimental Bills. We will not allow the government to change the unitary character of Sri Lanka.

Westerners may not accept our interpretation, but at least we can:Prof. Nalin De Silva
No definite interpretation has been given on what Ekiya and Federal are. This book is a guide compiling all court rulings. This should be immediately translated into Sinhala because we will soon become a confederation. In 1987, four SC judges said the 13A did not consist of Federal features. Four others said the unitary character and the peoples sovereign rights would be lost if the said Amendment was effective. However, Judge Palinda Ranasinghe established that according to articles 154 G 2 and 3, a referendum was required to enact the 13A. Ultimately, five out of nine judges underscored the need for a referendum.
Yet, late President J.R. Jayewardene overlooked the ruling. So, is 13A really legal Though I am not a lawyer by profession, I do believe that it is illegal. Hence, what we have today is an illegally-amended constitution. I do not think we could go to court over this issue in this backdrop.
On the other hand, the 20th Amendment to the Constitution is to be brought in to postpone PC polls. One PC said it was against this and that the parliament needed a two-thirds majority to proceed. The parliament does not have full constitutional powers. Is this a feature of a unitary structure Legal experts might have said many things about the interpretation of the word unitary.
If the Northern and Eastern provinces do something against my mandate, dont I have a right to comment on it My sovereign right is not limited to the Western Province. As far as I am aware, sovereign rights apply to the entire country
We are in the habit of reiterating what a foreigner has said. Western countries do not know what unitary is. Can we not come up with our own interpretation Westerners may not accept our interpretation, but at least we can. I say unitary is having only one entity for the constitutional, judicial and executive sectors. Only one parliament to make legislation.
If the Northern and Eastern provinces do something against my mandate, dont I have a right to comment on it My sovereign right is not limited to the Western Province. As far as I am aware, sovereign rights apply to the entire country. The 13A was imposed by Indians. Even today, the government is doing what India wants. To some extent, we have become a colony of India and the Western countries. The US and UK strive to devise a constitution for Sri Lanka. Lal Wijenayake did nothing constructive. He cannot draft constitutions. He is simply attempting to give us a constitution drafted by India and the Western countries.
Neither President Maithripala Sirisena nor Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe knows how a government functions. The President is updated about developments after they appear in newspapers. Elections will be postponed indefinitely. 

Govt. henchmen preach Baila Bana:Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera
I never wanted to enter politics, but decided to do so when a need arose. I feel this was the last chance. I wonder what rights people of this country have today. Do we even have the rights of a citizen The only right we have is the 6-feet right when we go to the cemetery. I believe that a new constitution has already been made. The government now knows who will rise against these constitutional reforms. That was why they brought Bhikkhu Kathikawatha; to silence us. Due to strong objections, the Kathikawatha was put on hold. Afterwards, an Act on racism and extremism was brought following constitutional reforms. When people started objecting these reforms, measures were taken to weaken the Sanghas power by defamation. This robe had given shade and protection to the people. As long as the Arahat Dhajaya (Robe) prevails, no one will be allowed to harm the country. This is a country offered to the Sangha. Today, the government has appointed people to tell the Sangha how to preach and behave. These people have never set their foot to a temple. Who are they to insult us The government even attempted to keep its hands on the tills of the temples. Even Prabhakaran said they could not achieve anything as long as there were yellow robe bearers. Government henchmen preach Baila Bana to us today.
We should behave as the owners of the country, not as boarders. We have a deed which is 2,500 years old and it was renewed with the sacrifices made by 25,00030,000 war heroes.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was made by the Pancha Maha Balavegaya. This is a party which respected the robe. If you are an SLFPer, you should stand against constitutional reforms like MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. It doesnt matter whether you belong to the Maithripala faction or Mahinda faction. They are both from the same house and should stand in unison.
When 13A was brought in, resignations were obtained from MPs. They were taken hostage in hotels and dragged to parliament by force. As other speakers said, this is illegal.
If you vote in favour, you may not be welcomed at your constituent. An international conspiracy is brewing in the country to divide it. Let us unite against this conspiracy regardless of our
party differences.

13A introduced amid severe objections:Attorney Ctanishka Vitharana
A common feature of the present and past Sri Lanka is international influence. With international backing, the LTTE tried to divide the country by taking arms against the government. The government became a victim and weak in front of these international forces. Then and now, people give no mandate to the government to go for constitutional changes. The 13A was introduced amid severe objections of the people. Even today, constitutional reforms are being introduced without a mandate.

In the past, there was no legal precedent on the structure of the State. People took to the streets. But today, we have a legal example to follow as far as constitutional reforms are concerned. Our senior judges, after listening to arguments, gave a 5-4 divided ruling in the past. This reflects our Federal-like state structure within a unitary framework. I believe the 13A has taken us to the edge of Federalism.
After the LTTE was banned, a lawyer appealed to the European Union to remove the ban imposed on it for collecting funds. The lawyer said the LTTE focused on achieving its objectives solely by political means henceforth. Though the terrorist organisation was defeated in 2009, its objective remained unchanged. The military war defeated by arms has changed its face today and taken a constitutional facade. We can defeat this war by using knowledge. One weapon in this war isthis book.
Today, there is no proper mechanism to directly gather the peoples opinions when drafting a constitution. At least 70 per cent of the population knows not of a process of devising a new constitution. Only 2,500 people had submitted direct information, and the number could increase to around 4,500 with all faxes and emails received. This is not only illegal but is also a failure. A constitution cannot be made for the entire country in this manner. From the six subcommittees appointed to steer the process of constitutional reforms, the one on Centre-Periphery Relations Report mentions about the structure of the State.
This subcommittee, without comparatively evaluating the features of Unitary and Federal systems, surmises that the unitary state is a failure. This is biased towards the
Federal structure.
The committee report suggests that maximum power be given to the periphery and the centre should be left with least authority.
This suggestion has been based on the principle of Subsidiarity, meaning whatever the lowest level of governing institution can handle should be left with that body and the rest should go to the next tier and so forth. 
At least 70 per cent of the population knows not of a process of devising a new constitution. Only 2,500 people had submitted direct information, and the number could increase to around 4,500 with all faxes and emails received
The new constitution is being drafted to introduce that kind ofa constitution.
We should observe whether the government successfully faces international influence in reforming the constitution or bows down to these forces. This book will be helpful when countering attempts made to introduce a constitution sans a given mandate.

Strong opposition to change unitary structure to Federal:Manohara Silva PC
The proposed constitution will be revealed immediately after an interim report from the Constitutional Steering Committee is prepared. In the present constitution, Article 2 says Sri Lanka is a Unitary State (Ekiya). The word Unitary has been accepted by all legal experts worldwide as having one meaning and one interpretation. Today, there is a strong opposition to change Sri Lankas unitary structure to Federal. If the government holds a referendum, it knows the people and the Sangha would not allow it. Therefore, the government decided to remove Unitary in the English version of the proposed constitution and termed it Ekiya similar to the Sinhala version. This is a ploy to alter the interpretation of the word Ekiya by deviating frominternational laws.
If there were a future court case over the term Ekiya, the government can always say, Nay! Ekiya does not have the same interpretation as the universally-accepted term unitary.
In the proposed constitution, Ekiya has been termed as undivided. However, not divided doesnt necessarily mean it is not Federal. Federal ruling too is a State structure that does not divide a country. A country with Federal ruling is a country with several governments. A unitary state has only one Constitution whereas a Federal country has many. If the unitary character of the State were to continue, the centre should hold police powers. We lost this authority because of the 13A in 1987. Allowing police powers to PCs will result in different policies governed by different Chief Ministers (CMs). The Yahapalanaya readily criticised the powers vested with the president and therefore appointed various commissions including the Police and Elections Commission by reducing executive powers. However, the irony is that no one finds a CM appointing a Police Chief as wrong.
If something happened to one of us in Anuradhapura or Jaffna, it is a Police Chief appointed by the CM who investigates the incident. No former President entertained police officers to practise this because they knew the country would be destroyed if they did so. We doubt if the current leadership would do the same.
PCs can implement laws. However, this has not been practised because of the presence of the Governor -- the provincial representative of the president. Therefore, PCs want to get all obstacles in their way to fully implement the 13A. This could be done by the new constitution. We should equally oppose the 13As land and police powers and the proposed constitution.
The government says the Enforced Disappearance Bill, once effective, will have no retrospective effect. This too is a lie. We speak of our soldiers. If the CM of the North or East makes a tribunal or similar mechanism, everyone including the soldiers in the province will be subjected to that tribunal.
We should unite to save the unitary character of the country. The proposed constitution should be rejected. We should ask the MPs not to allow the full implementation of the 13A or enactment of the new constitution. We should tell them that if they vote for these detrimental legislatures, we would not vote for them anymore.
This book is a timely requirement in the crusade against the 13A and the new constitution to make the people aware of theimpending danger.

US Federal Reserve keeps interest rates unchanged
	
AFP: The US Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged this week and announced the gradual end to a crisis-era stimulus programme in a sign the economy is on sound footing.
The Fed statement following its two-day policy meeting noted that the devastation caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria are inflicting severe hardship on communities.
However, the central bank said the economic impact of the storm is likely to be felt only in the near term.
It cited past experience which has shown that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.
Higher prices for gasoline and some other items in the aftermath of the hurricanes will likely boost inflation temporarily.
However, 12-month inflation is still expected to remain below the Feds two percent goal in the near term, stabilizing at the target rate only in the medium term.
The Fed gave few hints on the likelihood of a third rate increase this year, as the statement was little changed from the prior versions, so analysts will have to watch for Fed Chair Janet Yellens post-meeting press conference for further indications.
The committee did say that despite the hurricane impact, the Fed continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and the labor market will strengthen somewhat further.
But that language too was nearly identical to the prior statements.
Despite nearly seven years of uninterrupted job creation and a very low unemployment rate of 4.3 percent, inflationary pressures and wage gains have been tepid at best, something that has baffled economists given the strong labor market.
But with inflation finally showing signs of life in August, more analysts now see an increased chance of a rate increase in December.
The central bank also confirmed that it will end an unprecedented stimulus programme launched at the height of the financial crisis, when the Fed had cut rates to zero and had no ammunition left to help support the economy.
The plan starting next month will gradually reduce the size of the Feds US $ 4.5 trillion in investment holdings, which were built up during the financial crisis.

Why wasnt I prescribed with any antibiotic
	


At least once during a lifetime, every human being goes through an episode of infection. This experience makes you meet a doctor and receive treatment, unless you yourself is a health care professional in which case you yourself can prescribe the medication. Sometimes returning home after receiving treatment, you might wonder why you were asked to take anti-fungals, without being given antibiotics. If that is the case, you have probably been diagnosed with a fungal infection, not something bacterial, because antibiotics treat only bacterial infections. 
In the clinical aspect, most health care professionals can differentiate fungal infections from bacterial. In this article we are going to discuss what fungi and bacteria are and how they differ from each other in affecting people and their main differences. 

What is a bacterial infection
Bacteria are a living group of organism which dont necessarily need to invade host cells in order to replicate. They choose tissues which they like to live in, similar to virus, and absorb nutrients from the host tissue, secrete toxins which kill the host cells or replicate inside the host cells resulting in various infections in the affected individual. 
The commonest example for a bacterial infection which invades human cells, in a spur of a second includes E.coli O157:H7, a specific strain of E.coli which gives rise to food poisoning. Some E.coli do not cause any harm to humans, but this particular strain secretes a powerful toxin, leading to vomiting and diarrhea which can be fatal if left untreated. 
Bacteria can enter the skin through openings. Also, diminished circulation which reduces the bodys ability to maintain its defense mechanisms to fight against an infection, can also increase the risk of getting such. This is why bacterial infections are commoner in patients with diabetics, chronic smokers and the elderly. Furthermore, a poor immunity which can also occur due to the above reasons can increase the chances of getting infections. 
E.g. HIV-AIDS patient and patients on cortico-steroidal drugs 

Treatment
Antibiotics like Penicillin, Local wound care and proper maintenance of a good hygiene and surgery in severe cases (bone and joint infections) are the main modalities of treatments for those who have been affected by Bacterial infections. 

What is fungal infection
A fungus can be considered as a primitive organism which grows up in air, in soil and in water. Few examples for fungi are mushrooms and mildew. There are some fungi which live in the human body among which few of them arent harmful to the body at all. They mainly reproduce through the spores in the air and when they land on a person or else enters into the body through inhalation they would start multiplying either on skin or in lungs. 
The ability of becoming prone to fungal infection is high when a person is having a weak immune system or on antibiotics. 
It isnt easy to kill fungi, since they are highly resistant to most of the chemicals. Fungal infections of the skin are usually treated topically with cream, powder, spray, oils, ointment and oral drugs can be used for areas where the drugs find it difficult-to-penetrate e.g. nails or when the condition doesnt respond to oral treatments. 

What is the difference between bacterial infection and fungal infection
Bacteria consists of two major types as Eubacteria and Archaeabacteria whereas Fungi exist as a single species known as parasitic eukaryotes. Most of the fungi are either unicellular yeasts or filamentous molds. 
More importantly, neither Antibiotics which are used to treat bacterial infections work against fungal infections nor anti-fungal medications used against Fungi work against bacteria. 
Bacterial diseases - Tetanus, Botulism, and Gastroenteritis.

Fungal infections - Candidiasis, Ringworm infections and Jock itch 

-The writer is a Medical Student

Take home message:
It is always encouraged to seek proper medical advice without self-diagnosing and self-prescribing antibiotics for each and every infection-like symptoms you get. Because the ultimate result of misdiagnosis and wrong treatment would be really frustrating. This is particularly true when fungal or viral infections are treated with antibiotics, paving the way for human friendly bacteria to turn into harmful pathogens and increase the population of antibiotic resistant bacteria.
