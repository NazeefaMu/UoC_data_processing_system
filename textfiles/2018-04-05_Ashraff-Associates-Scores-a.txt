The 6th of April commemorates six years for Ashraff Associates, an agency which has made its mark in Sri Lanka’s highly competitive advertising industry as a creative force, committed towards delivering brand building solutions with relevance, at the highest international standards of creative excellence.

“The last year has proven to be both challenging and immensely rewarding in professional terms,” said Aman Ashraff, Executive Creative Director of Ashraff Associates.

Ashraff continued, “Our milestone for the year was the arrival of Jagath Kosmodara as our Creative Director who brought with him an invaluable offering of both professional and artistic experience. Under his leadership, we have been able to restructure ourselves into a more dynamic and effective working unit, and the results in the context of the work we have done since, speak for themselves.”

The agency welcomed into its client portfolio this year the International Finance Corporation (IFC), for whom they developed the short film ‘We Are’. Launched on International Women’s Day, the film celebrated the role of over 140 women business leaders who continue to contribute to board diversity and advancing business development in Sri Lanka.

Ashraff Associates also worked with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) this past year in a brand building exercise which resulted in the creation of brand identities for CITRA Social Innovation Labs and the Colombo Development Dialogues (CDD).

The trust and confidence placed on the agency by these brands is a testament to the levels of professionalism and expertise that are consistently awarded to every brand that enters into their purview of responsibility and care.Other new partnerships for the year included Bella’s, The Sandwich Factory, Altec Educational Institute, Ohoma Yang and Orit Lanka. 



The agency also prides itself on being a popular mentoring hub for young professionals and interns fresh out of school on the path to securing their careers. “Ashraff Associates is privileged to have been able to provide insightful training,” said Jagath Kosmodara, Creative Director of the agency.Kosmodara added, “We have had many young professionals passing through our doors with the eagerness to learn. We are confident that the fundamentals instilled in them through their internships will prove invaluable to them in any professional careers they choose.”
