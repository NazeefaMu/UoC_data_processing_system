Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Thursday charged that many Parliamentarians, even those who were within government ranks, had abstained from voting for the VAT Bill on Wednesday (27), as this ‘Yahapalanaya’ government was not listening to anyone but doing things in a dictatorial manner.

“It is clear that there are concerns even from the government ranks. These members are afraid to vote against this bill in Parliament, fearing they would be punished by the party's hierarchy if they do,” the former President said in reply to a question from media posed to him as he emerged from a meeting in Galle.

 

Speaking further, the former President remarked “by now everyone knows who the guilty parties are in the CB bond scam after the release of the COPE report. Even the UNP members have accepted the report now that it has been proved. The company responsible may be charged for this act. He referred to the VAT bill and said that even the health services had not been spared. They could have taken over the millions they proclaim I have stashed away and avoided this VAT Amendment Bill. This government has no humanitarian values. They do not understand the people’s difficulties and their wants. We have been saying for a long time that National security should be strengthened. In order to do this they have to activate intelligence units, establish army camps and also strengthen the police and the security aparatus.( Nimal Algewatta-Habaraduwa)
