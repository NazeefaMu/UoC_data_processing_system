The Colombo District Court today issued an order restraining the film 'Usawiya Nihandai' being screened till October 19.

The order was issued by District Court Judge M.U. Gunawardena after taking into consideration the petition filed by former magistrate Lenin Ratnayake that the film directed by Prasanna Vithanage was based on a false story relating to him and it had defamed the judiciary.

The Judge also directed the respondents to file their response in Court. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
