Party maverick meets his Waterloo!


	



 

There is a JO stalwart who made newspaper headlines by claiming that he was qualified to vie for any high office in the country given his merit and seniority as a politico.

 


He also started directing barbs at the former security bigwig who is rumoured as a likely candidate from Pohottuwa at the upcoming big poll.


However, the former strongman continued to keep his cool about the JO stalwart’s outrageous public statements.
However, the former strongman had decided enough was enough on hearing that the JO man had said that he was not prepared to go marketing for anyone (kaatawath kade yanna laasthi nehe) which seemed an innuendo aimed at the JO leader himself.


Meanwhile, the former strongman met face to face the big-mouthed party stalwart at a wedding. And the former strongman exploded.


“I didn’t ask you to do any marketing for me (Mata kade yanna kiyala mama oheta kiyala nehe). You seem to be carrying out a contract for someone. What you keep saying in public is backfiring on all of us! I am going to decide on a candidate acceptable to all at the proper time. If you are not prepared to back the candidate I nominate, you may at least keep your big mouth shut!”


A highly disconcerted JO maverick spluttered: “Excuse me, Sir. I can’t remember having said a thing like that!”
The boss laughed at this answer.


“Ah! You can’t remember having said a thing like that. If you can’t remember it doesn’t matter!  Try and remember at least what I have just told you!”
