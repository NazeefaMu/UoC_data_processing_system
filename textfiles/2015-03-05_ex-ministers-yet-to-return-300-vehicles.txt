	Ministers of the previous government are yet to return some 300 vehicles used by them, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today.
	He said though an ex-minister was officially entitled to use two vehicles, some of them were found having about 20 vehicles.
	“President Maithripala Sirisena has asked Minister Karu Jayasuriya to submit a comprehensive report in this regard,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
