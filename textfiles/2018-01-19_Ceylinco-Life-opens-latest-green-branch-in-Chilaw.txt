Designed for optimal use of natural light and entirely solar powered with a generating capacity of 20kW, the new building was built with minimal use of timber, is equipped with the latest energy-efficient lighting and air conditioning systems, has a facility for rainwater harvesting and its own car park. Conforming to the ‘Go Green’ programme of Ceylinco Life, all trees on the property were preserved during construction.
