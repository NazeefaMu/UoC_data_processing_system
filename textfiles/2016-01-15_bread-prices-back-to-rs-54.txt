In the wake of the government’s decision not to implement the amendments proposed to the Value-Added Tax (VAT) and Nation Building Tax (NBT) in the 2016 Budget, All Island Bakery Owners Association has decided to reduce the price of bread, which was earlier increased by one rupee.
Few days ago, the Association’s Chairman N.K. Jayawardana said the price of a 450 gm loaf of bread was increased from Rs.54 to Rs.55.
“We are glad to hear that Finance Ministry has decided not to implement some of the budgetary proposals. Earlier, we decided to increase the price of bread because of the 2016 budgetary proposals on VAT and NBT which would increase prices of wheat flour, Margarine, Sugar and Yeast which are raw materials for bread production. But, the Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake assured he would reduce the taxes at a discussion held with us,” Mr. Jayawardana said.
Accordingly, a 450 gm loaf of bread will remain at the earlier price of Rs. 54.00 with effect from today midnight. (Piyumi Fonseka)
