As a discussion between Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and the railway trade unions had failed the railway strike would continue, a Trade Union source said.

Meanwhile, the SLTB has cancelled all leave of its crews, while the National Transport Commission has loosened its regulations for private buses to operate without route permit during the strike period.  

The Railway Locomotive Operating Engineers Union and the Railway Guards Union had launched the strike yesterday evening placing several demands.

Meanwhile, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva has requested President Maithripala Sirisena to declare the railway service as an essential service.

The Ministry of Transport said the Minister had instructed officials to make arrangements to minimise the inconvenience caused to commuters due to the strike. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
