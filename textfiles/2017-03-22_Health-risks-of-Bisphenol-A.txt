Health risks of Bisphenol A


	



 

Bisphenol A and Bisphenol S are two chemicals used with other chemicals to manufacture plastic and resin. For example, BPA is used in polycarbonate, which is a high performance, transparent, rigid plastic. This is often used as a plastic roofing light even in Sri Lanka, to get more lighting into the household. Bisphenol A used in polycarbonate is used in the manufacturing of food containers, beverage bottles, tableware, storage containers and in infant feeding bottles. Almost every plastic container used nowadays contains Bisphenol A. The residue of Bisphenol A is also present in epoxy resins used to make protective coatings and linings in food and beverage cans and wraps. The issue lies with the fact that BPA can migrate in small amounts to food and beverages stored in materials containing the substance.   


Plastic is definitely not an element created from a single substance. Plastic stands for a wide collection of chemical compounds. These chemicals are known as endocrine-disrupting compounds which means that these chemicals can mimic the hormones in the body. Bisphenol A is an endocrine disrupter which can disrupt the hormonal balance of the body. This could result in inducing activities in the estrogen including disruption in the functioning of the thyroid hormone. It also affects Antiandrogens such as male masculine features. Bisphenol A could also cause mutations. These mutations are related to certain abrasions in the chromosomes (This refers to the genetic aspects that could get affected as result of chemicals like Bisphenol A). Therefore, such mutations could eventually lead to certain types of cancer such as prostate or endometrial cancer. Generally, it can lead to chromosomal abnormalities and result in cancer formation. Fetal development could also be affected due to Bisphenol A. The sexual hormone balance could get disrupted and the underdevelopment of sex organs could take place at the fetal stage owing to the adverse effects of the chemical. BPA is very often found in feeding bottles. The early life development stage is the most influenced stage in relation to Bisphenol A. There could be birth defects, immune system suppressions and development problems as well. Consumers should not buy BPA feeding bottles and my advice is that they should go for glass feeding bottles, which are the best health option available.  


There are certain restrictions imposed on BPA worldwide. Most countries in the European Union have ensured that awareness is raised among consumers concerning the possibility of feeding bottles containing BPA or not. In European countries, Bisphenol A is subjected to regulations. According to the legislation of the European Union, “Bisphenol A is subjected to regulations that guarantee a high level of protection of human beings and environment. In the European Union the manufacturer and the use of chemical substance including BPA must comply with the comprehensive legislative framework. REACH is the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals and constitutes the framework legislation on chemicals in the EU (Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006)”.
