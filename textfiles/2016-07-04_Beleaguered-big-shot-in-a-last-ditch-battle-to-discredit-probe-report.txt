Beleaguered big shot in a last ditch battle to discredit probe report


	



 

A team of officials, of a key government institution, who probed a key issue has submitted a report containing a damning indictment on a white collar bigwig with close ties to a leading politician. And the bigwig is now reportedly carrying out machinations aimed at compelling the probe officials to retract their indictment. 

 


Incidentally, the white collar bigwig has come in for severe flak from various sections of the enlightened public for various acts of commission and omission on his part.   


The bigwig has also made a well-planned bid to get a responsible high up of the department concerned to make a public statement saying that the damning report had been issued without the unanimous approval of the probe team, they say.
