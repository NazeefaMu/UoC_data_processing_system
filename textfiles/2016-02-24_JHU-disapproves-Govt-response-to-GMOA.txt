The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said in a statement yesterday that the Government must respond wisely to the ideas and arguments of the professionals on the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) without making speeches undermining the GMOA, which is a recognised professional organisation.

JHU Media Secretary Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said that responses of certain Ministers and Government leaders to the ideas, arguments and objections of the professionals regarding the ECTA was unethical and that the Government must be mindful, when reaching economic, trade and technological agreements between two countries, as no one can foretell the short term and long term impact on the economy, society and politics through such agreements.

“The Government must engage in open and intelligent discussion with the relaxant and educated professionals about such agreements. The Government must respond to the ideas and arguments of the professionals wisely. It is not suitable to the Good Governance principles to undermine the GMOA. It is not the way to resolve and manage issues by undermining the professionals and provoking them,” Warnasinghe said.

He said in a statement that it would be prudent to resort to wise and intelligent discussion about the ETCA and stop boasting about it so that people could be well informed.

“We hope that engaging in cordial discussion with the professionals about the agreement would not cause any disadvantage to the country’s future. We stress that the government must not suppress or insult the professionals who represent the country’s educated society directly or indirectly,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
