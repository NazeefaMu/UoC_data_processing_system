Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda today informed the PCoI that Anika Wijesuriya, who previously testified before the Commission with regard to leasing out of a Penthouse by Arjun Aloysius in which former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake’s family resided, had fled the country due to numerous threats levelled against her.

ASG Kodagoda said that he earlier, informed the Commission that the Attorney General’s team had predicted the threat to her life and named her as a witness under the Witness Protection Act.

Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda revealed this while he was informing the Commission about a complaint received by them from the elder brother of Anika Wijesooriya as he was threatened by one Shanil Neththikumara recently.

"He owns casinos and Ravi Karunanayake is his uncle. He had threatened Wijith Wijesuriya the brother of Anika. Anika has now fled the country and an investigation into this must be carried out as it is an offence under the Penal Code and the Witness Protection Act" he said.

“Neththikumara is a person who seems to be acting on behalf of the person whose name was implicated during Anika’s evidence”, ASG Kodagoda said. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
