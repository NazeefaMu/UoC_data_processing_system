Kalyani Karaka Sabha of the Kotte, Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha yesterday unanimously decided that the proposals put forward by the steering committee on the drafting of the new Constitution should be temporarily withdrawn stating that the drafting of a new Constitution was not suitable at this juncture, Anunayake of the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha Prof. Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera said today.

Ven. Wimalarathana Thera said serious issues may arise if Parliament accepted the proposals submitted as alternatives regarding the unitary State, security of the country, and Buddhism.

The Thera said the proposals on the new Constitution should be temporarily withdrawn and if amendments to the Constitution were needed, it could be done later.

After having discussions for about two hours on the proposals on the new Constitution, Ven. Wimalarathana Thera told media that the Kalyani Karaka Sabha convened in the absence of the Mahanayake of the Kotte, Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha Most Venerable Ittapane Dhammalankara Thera as he was leaving the country last night.

The Thera said they would issue a joint announcement on the matter shortly and added that Karaka Sabha convened with the blessing of the Mahanayake Thera and that he would approve the decision taken by the Karaka Sabha.

In response to a question that the President and the Prime Minister had stated that this was only a set of proposals, the Thera said they knew that it was not a draft or a bill but the new Constitution would be based on these proposals.

“We wanted to reveal our stance before it was drafted so that it could be useful to those involved in the drafting of the Constitution,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
