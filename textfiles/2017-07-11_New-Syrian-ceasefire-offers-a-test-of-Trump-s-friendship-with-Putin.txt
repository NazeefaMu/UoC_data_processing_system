New Syrian ceasefire offers a test of Trump’s friendship with Putin


	

The first attempt by the Trump administration to cooperate with Russia on an international crisis got underway on Sunday, with the implementation of a ceasefire in southwestern Syria that appeared to be widely holding.   


If the truce can be maintained, it could open the door to deeper cooperation between the United States and Russia on ways to quell the violence and to progress on other ceasefire deals being pressed elsewhere in Syria .   


The guns fell silent well ahead of a noon deadline, residents in the ceasefire zone said, lending hope that it would stop the violence for at least a while and save lives.
