Train services on the coastal line have come to a standstill this evening due to a derailment near the Galle railway station, the railway Control Room said.

They said the ‘Sagarika’ train, which travels from Colombo to Matara, had derailed.

The last two compartments of the train had derailed and the coupling (a mechanism for connecting railway cars in a train) had uncoupled.

“About 25 to 30 railway sleepers had been damaged. Most probably the train services would be restored by tomorrow morning,” they said.

The train services would be operating from Colombo Fort upto Gintota and Ambalangoda stations, they said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
