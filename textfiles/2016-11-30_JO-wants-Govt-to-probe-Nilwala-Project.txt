JO wants Govt. to probe Nilwala Project


	

The Joint Opposition (JO) today requested the government to probe into the President’s statement made in Galle that a whopping Rs. 3,012 million allocated for the Nilwala River Development Project going missing just a day before the last Presidential Election.

Addressing a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) membership drive campaign held in Galle on Saturday, President Maithripala Sirisena said that Rs. 1,000 million had been issued by the Finance Ministry for the project in 2012 and the Treasury had issued a cheque for Rs.3,012 million to the Irrigation Ministry Secretary in January 7, 2015.

The fate of the total amount of Rs. 4,012 million was a mystery, President Sirisena said.

Responding to the remarks of the President, Matara District JO MP Dullas Alahapperuma said all ministers who are responsible for the project were in the current government and as such the government should probe into the statement.

“It was President Maithripala Sirisena who was the Mahawali Development Minister when the agreement was signed for the project with a China based Company. Irrigation Minister during the said time was Nimal Siripala de Silva who is the current Transport Minister. Therefore, it is up to the government to probe these remarks and clarify as to what has happened,” he told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
