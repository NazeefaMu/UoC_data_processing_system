The top 10 Test spells in 2015

From Yasir Shah and Ravichandran Ashwin’s captivating varieties of spin to Stuart Broad’s destruction and Wahab Riaz’s swing, here is a look at the top ten Test bowling efforts of the year.
Yasir Shah - 7/76 v Sri Lanka, Galle
Pakistan Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq’s go-to man put in his best performance during a superb year in the victory in Galle, his 7/76 being the best figures by an overseas bowler in Tests in Sri Lanka. The visitors had taken a lead of 117 and Sri Lanka were left to counter on a fourth-day pitch. Before stumps, the legspinner removed Dimuth Karunaratne for 79 and Kumar Sangakkara for 18. On the fifth morning he bowled Dilruwan Perera without a run added, then claimed the skipper Angelo Mathews for five before closing in on the Sri Lankan tail. Those seven wickets spun Pakistan to a ten-wicket win.

Mitchell Johnson - 3/53 & 3/27 v England, Lord’s
“I hope so. That would be nice to have those scars come back out.” That was Johnson after the second day at Lord’s when asked whether his left-arm fast bowling could cue memories of his 37-wicket Ashes 18 months earlier.
Johnson’s two-wicket burst had helped reduce England to 85/4 at the end the day, trailing by 481 runs, following Australia’s declaration at 566/8. Johnson first removed Gary Ballance by bowling the left-hander with a lovely outswinger that snuck under the bat, then eight balls later had Joe Root nicking a back-foot drive to Peter Nevill. The packed crowd was in shock. England were four wickets down in 11 overs, with Johnson the chief destroyer.
On day four, Johnson grabbed 3/27 and effected a direct hit run-out as England crumbled to a 405-run defeat on day four - their fourth-heaviest loss in terms of runs. Johnson began with the wicket of Alastair Cook who flashed a cut to Nevill, then his lethal throw ran out Ben Stokes, followed by the dismissals of Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali.

James Anderson - 6/47 v Australia, Edgbaston
Anderson said after the first day’s play that England hadn’t expected the Edgbaston pitch to do as much as it did. But they were mighty chuffed that it had, and none more then England’s greatest wicket-taker. A day before he turned 33, Anderson ripped out his best Ashes figures of 6/47 to bowl Australia out for 136 after Michael Clarke chose to bat. On a surface with a covering of grass but dry and even a little cracked underneath, and under slightly overcast conditions, Anderson pinged David Warner in his crease very early but it was his second spell that really unhinged the Australians. Returning in the 20th over, he took four wickets for seven runs in a half hour of swing bowling of the highest class. It was a fitting reply from a champion bowler after his wicketless outing at Lord’s - his first in six years. And it put England back ahead 2-1 after a humbling defeat in the second Test.
 
Stuart Broad - 8/15 v Australia, Trent Bridge
With all due respect to Phil Tufnell’s 7/66 in that 1997 cracker at The Oval, not since Bob Willis’ 8/43 at Headingley in 1981 has an England bowler achieved such a break-out performance. This was Australia’s worst performance in years, and where they surrendered the Ashes. Their 18.3 over innings was the shortest in Test history; never before had the fourth, fifth and sixth wickets fallen so early, and at no time in Ashes history had extras contributed the most to a scorecard. Leading the way was Broad, hero extraordinaire with an astounding spell of 9.3-5-15-8, his career best in Tests and the eighth best for England in Tests. From 60 all out, there was no way Clarke’s team were going to save this match. By stumps, England led by 214 runs after Joe Root scored a fine 124 not out. It was an Ashes pace-bowling special to rank alongside Glenn McGrath’s 8/38, Jason Gillespie’s 7/37 and Bob Massie’s 8/53 - except this time, an Englishman was the one doing the damage.

R Ashwin - 6/46 v Sri Lanka, Galle
Ishant Sharma was disciplined. Varun Aaron was wasteful after his first spell, conceding 34 in four overs during his last spell. Harbhajan Singh was wicketless across eight overs, never having any Sri Lankan batsman in trouble. Amit Mishra found himself on a hat-trick in his last over, but that owed to a rash shot from Dinesh Chandimal and a nothing shot from Sri Lanka’s No 10. R Ashwin finished with figures of 13.4-2-46-6 and he was, by far, the best bowler on view. Tidy, economical, aggressive, crafty. There was flight, dip, turn and bounce - all four elements of spin bowling in full display. Backed by some fine catching, Ashwin bagged his best figures outside of India (his previous and only five-wicket haul was in Bangladesh in June).

Rangana Herath - 7/48 v India, Galle
After bowling 33 wicketless overs during India’s first innings - the second time since 2000 that he had bowled that many without success in Galle - it was perhaps to be expected that the 37-year-old spinner would have a say on proceedings on day three, with the surface expected to turn as the match wore on, Herath was always going to be tricky. Starting off with the wicket of nightwatchman Ishant with his first delivery, Herath bowled 18 consecutive overs for figures of 6/35 to completely derail any aspirations that India had of chasing 176. Herath ended with his best figures in Galle and this superb performance extended his overall tally at the venue to 68 at an average of 25.73 and strike-rate of 58.4. Wriddhiman Saha’s wicket took Herath past Bishan Bedi, making him the third-most successful left-arm spinner in the history of Test cricket. “I’m carrying a bit of an injury so its been tough, but when you’re playing for your country you have to give 100 percent,” said a pleased Herath afterwards.

Adil Rashid - 5/64 v Pakistan, Abu Dhabi
A unique debut for Rashid, the England leg spinner. The first half of his long-awaited debut could not have gone anywhere near as planned: 34 overs, 163 runs, zero wickets to pass Australian Bryce McGain’s 0/149 as the most expensive figures for a Test newbie. The second half was astonishing, for a different reason. Getting better drift as the Abu Dhabi surface started to wear, Rashid took 5/64 to almost fire England to an unlikely win. In reply to Pakistan’s first innings of 523/8, England had made 598/9 thanks to Cook’s marathon 263. In a hurry, Rashid ran through Pakistan to bowl them out for 173, setting the visitors a target of 99. Giving the ball plenty of air and bowling attacking lines, Rashid preyed on the Pakistan batsmen’s techniques and temperament, and as the pressure built, some panicky shots added to his column. It was a stirring performance in what ended as a superb, dramatic Test match.
Wahab Riaz - 4/66 v England, Dubai
Pakistan’s victory over England in the second Test - coming after that gripping draw in the series opener - bore the stamp of Yasir, but it was Wahab’s exceptional spell on the third morning that really swung the pendulum the home team’s way. In nine back-breaking overs featuring high pace and tasty reverse-swing under a hot sun, the left-arm quick accounted for Root (88), Stokes (4) and Buttler (0) for just 15 runs, each of the batsmen caught behind, as England went from 206/4 to 212/6, eventually all out for 242. It was captivating and clinical stuff. For that brilliant spell, Wahab was named Man of the Match, beating Yasir’s 8/180 on return to the side.

Ravindra Jadeja - 5/21 v South Africa, Mohali
In his first Test match since August 2014, when he was dropped during a lean run on unresponsive English pitches, Jadeja made an emphatic performance to claim the Man-of-the-Match award. His crowning glory was taking 5/21 on day three, accounting for Vernon Philander, Hashim Amla, Dane Vilas, Simon Harmer and Imran Tahir. Set a target of 218 on a square turner, South Africa were bowled out for 109. The tourists sent Philander to open the innings with Dean Elgar, but the experiment failed spectacularly with Jadeja striking him in line with the stumps first ball.Amla’s decision to not offer a shot to Jadeja was fatal, the the regulation arm ball going on to hit middle stump. The score read 10/3 and South Africa were doomed. Say what you will about his limitations away from home, but in India Jadeja continues to be a lethal weapon in Tests.
Josh Hazlewood - 6/70 v New Zealand, Adelaide
In a low-scoring historic first ever day-night Test at Adelaide Oval, young Australian quick Hazlewood was the stand-out exponent of the pink ball. His three wickets had been crucial to Australia bowling New Zealand out for 202, but the hosts had a lead of just 22 to work with and were hit by the inability for an injured Mitchell Starc to bowl. Up stepped Hazlewood with a career-best six-wicket haul in a relentless performance of quality pace and movement, accounting for Tom Latham, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, BJ Watling, Mark Craig and Trent Boult. New Zealand were limited to 208 in their second innings, and Australia completed a nervous three-wicket victory for a 2-0 series win.
