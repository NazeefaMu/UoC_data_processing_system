An ex-LTTE cadre who had allegedly attacked residents of a war heroes housing scheme in Kokeliya, Vavuniya was arrested by the police today.

Residents reported the assault by unidentified gangsters was allegedly led by the ex-LTTEer known as Sinnawan.

The suspect, who had been absconding from the police, was arrested along with another suspect involved in the incident in Iranamadu, Kilinochchi and will be produced before the Vauniya Magistrate today.

The gangsters, apparently under the influence of liquor, had threatened the residents demanding they vacate the premises and claimed the housing scheme was constructed on land belonging to Tamils.

The residents said they heard the attackers shouting, ‘We will re-take our homeland’. (Sithum Chathuranga)
