Some shedding crocodile tears for HNDA students - Minister

Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said those responsible for assaulting the Rathupaswala people when asking for water and those who removed the degree status of the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) are now shedding crocodile tears for HNDA students.
He said so while handing over letters of employment as development officers to 780 youth.
The ceremony was held at the Public Administration and Management Ministry. The minister added that the then UNP government offered the degree status for HNDA as an alternative for the Accountancy Degree in 1990.
"The previous UPFA government removed the degree status in March 2014 issuing circular Number 10 of 2014," the minister said.
The HNDA students did not come on to the streets shouting slogans or hold protest marches in 2014 against the act of the UPFA government. But the HNDA students launched a protest march this year, he said.
However, we do not condone the behaviour of the police during the protest," he said.
The people responsible for killing Ratupaswala children and approved the removal of degree status of the HNDA at the Cabinet meeting are now shedding crocodile tears over the HNDA issue, he said.
