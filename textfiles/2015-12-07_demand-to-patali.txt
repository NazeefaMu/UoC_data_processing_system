	The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said a letter of demand would be sent to Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka for allegedly making defamatory comments alleging a connection between the island-wide strike launched last week by the GMOA and some other professional groups with the Avant Garde issue.
	During an event held recently, Minister Ranawaka said the government should investigate whether there was a connection between the island-wide strike and the Avant Garde issue.
	He suggested that the government probed whether there was an attempt to embarrass Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne for commenting on the Avant Garde issue.
	GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said they would send letter of demand to Minister Ranawaka for allegedly making defamatory comments regarding collusion between the GMOA and Avant Garde backers.
	“He used to work together with us when he was serving as the Power and Energy Minister during the previous government. We are disappointed regarding the allegations of Minister Ranawaka who is also a professional engineer. We should stress that no one can buy off the GMOA for their political agendas. If we are chasing after money and other benefits, we would not even be in the country by now since we have got many opportunities to go abroad to lead luxurious lives while engaging in our profession there. Nevertheless, we do love our country Sri Lanka and that is why we are trying to work for the country despite this kind of defamation,” he said.
	He added that though the government sector professionals had received proposals from various politicians to halt their struggle, they never did so and would not.
	He also alleged that they have been informed by reliable sources about a group of 25 persons who had allegedly been arranged by some opponents of GMOA to create Facebook posts and pages defaming government sector professionals. (Piyumi Fonseka)
