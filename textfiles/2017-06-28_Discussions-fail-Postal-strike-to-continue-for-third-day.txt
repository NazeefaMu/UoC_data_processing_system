The postal strike launched by them would continue for a third day today (29), as the discussions held with the sub-committee headed by Ministry Secretaries did not meet their demands, the Postal Services Joint Trade Union Front said yesterday.

Following the discussion held with the Secretary to the Prime Minister, Secretary Ministry of Public Administration and the Postal Services Ministry Secretary, union Co-convener H. K. Kariyawasam said their trade union representatives were given a written assurance that the issues brought up by them would be resolved; however they were forced to reject the solution that was offered to us.

“They assured us that a decision on handing over the post office buildings in Nuwara-Eliya, Galle and Kandy would not be taken without the consent of both the Postal Department and the trade unions. But our main demand that staff recruitment should be streamlined did not receive a satisfactory solution. Therefore, we have decided to continue with our trade union action until we get satisfactory answers to all our concerns,” he said.

Meanwhile, Kariyawasam said they will hold further discussions with government officials today as well in the hope of coming to a mutual agreement.

Postal services countrywide came to a standstill with the indefinite strike launched by postal unions at Midnight on Monday (26) where 21, 000 postal service employees from 653 post offices and 3,410 sub post offices were involved. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
