A Diyawanna Green from an electorate adjoining a sacred city-based constituency is poised for a political somersault, they say.

 


Hailing from a well- known ‘ge’ family in the area, the politico is reportedly telling all and sundry that none outside his family has a right to seek political power in their bastion.


The man is visiting the prominent party activists in their homes these days to treat them to a desparaging commentary about his own political party.


Meanwhile, he is said to be going out of the way to cultivate the friendship of the local leaders of an up-and-coming new political entity.
