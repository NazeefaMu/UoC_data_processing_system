The parliamentary debate on the PCoI and PRECIFAC reports could not be considered sub judice though legal proceedings had been initiated against three suspects in the Central Bank bond scam, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya ruled today.

He made this ruling at today’s party leaders meeting held in Parliament to discuss tomorrow’s debate.

The party leaders had also decided to continue the debate on February 21 and 22.

The Speaker said on a previous occasion Parliament had discussed the killing of journalist Richard De Soyza in 1990 during an ongoing court case with the then Speaker M. H. Mohammed ruling that the debate would not affect the court hearing.

He had also requested Presidential Secretary Austin Fernando to inform Parliament as soon as possible whether there were any other important documents, connected to the two reports, which had not been referred to the House.

The Speaker is reported to have requested all party leaders to make sure that the debate was conducted in a dignified manner because the subject matter was of much public interest.

He also asked them to keep a tab on their members and ensure that the ugly scenes on the previous occasion on a similar debate were not repeated.

Meanwhile, heeding to a joint opposition request for more time at the debate, the JVP had agreed to give one hour from its allocation to the JO.

The main opposition party, TNA is not expected to take part in the debate.

The party leaders meeting was attended by Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka, Dinesh Gunawardana, Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera and Ravi Karunanayake. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)
