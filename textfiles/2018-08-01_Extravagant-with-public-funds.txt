Extravagant with public funds!


	



 

Yet another case of criminal waste of public funds attributed to a high Diyawanna political authority has raised many an eyebrow in the public administration circles.

 


In this instance, the political authority concerned had got an ornamental pond at the centre of the ground floor of his official residence demolished and a redundant deluxe bathroom put up in its place at a cost of Rs. 4 million.


The political authority had got this bathroom put up when there are two toilets already available on the ground floor. Besides, every room upstairs has an attached bathroom, they say. Employees in the public sector say that four modest houses for homeless families could have been constructed with the money spent on this unnecessary bathroom.
