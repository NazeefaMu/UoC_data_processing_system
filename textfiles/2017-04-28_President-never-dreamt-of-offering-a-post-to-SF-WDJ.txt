President Maithripala Sirisena has never dreamt of offering Minister Sarath Fonseka the post of army commander or the responsibility of heading a committee on essential services in case of being disrupted because of TU action,” Labour Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said today.

He told a news conference held at Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Headquarters that what the President said as a joke had been given various interpretations.

“When speaking about the non-ending strikes, the President has jokingly asked whether Minister Fonseka could control such situations,” he said. (Vineetha M Gamage)
