A fish tank project that smells fishy!


	


An aquarium has been put up in the Gampaha district at a cost of Rs.11.8 million without following the tender procedure, they say.
A fair white collar high up had given the okay for the aquarium project on the request of a prominent politician in the area. 
Meanwhile, a big question mark hangs over how funds had been raised to purchase a coconut estate in the name of the husband of the fair white collar bigwig.
The informed ones discussing the doings of this lady recall that once when her husband, a class two officer in the administrative service was transferred to the pool, she used her clout to nominally attach him to her office enabling him to enjoy a 14-month holiday with all perks including an official vehicle at his disposal.
