Some young Nepalese women forcibly detained by racketeers in a house near the Avissawella industrial village to be sent to the Middle East as housemaids were taken into custody by Investigation Officers of the Immigration and Emigration Department yesterday.

A senior officer of the Investigation Division said the Nepalese Government women going abroad for employment as housemaids and modus operandi of the racketeers was to send them abroad via Sri Lanka. He said the racket might have been in operation for sometime until it came to light recently. The senior officer said the women entered Sri Lanka on tourist Visas.

A Sri Lankan man behind the racket was arrested during the raid.

The department said it would inform the Nepalese Embassy and make arrangements to deport the women to Nepal.(Buddhika Kumarasiri)
