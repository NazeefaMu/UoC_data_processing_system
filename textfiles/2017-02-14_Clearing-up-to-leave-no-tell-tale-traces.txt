Clearing up to leave no tell-tale traces?


	



 

Political and media circles of late have been abuzz with the rumour that a reshuffle of the yahapalanaya top team is in the offing. 

 


Meanwhile, a top team member disconcerted with strong reasons to believe that he would be moved out of his present portfolio had begun quietly removing some important files and furniture from his office.


Another top team member in the meantime made a bold statement at a public function that a reshuffle was close at hand. This provided an excuse to the already agitated top team member to inquire from Number One whether there was any truth in the statement. 


Number One had replied: “No such thing in the immediate future.”


Following this assurance, the agitated one has stopped removing things from his office, they say.
