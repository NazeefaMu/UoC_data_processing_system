He can make a complainant an accused or vice versa


	



 

This ‘single-star’ khakied one handling minor complaints at a lakeside cop shop can make a complainant an accused or an accused the complainant in a jiffy thanks to his close connection to a powerful politico in the area, they say.

 


It is well known in the area that a certain meat-stall owner is a close buddy of this khakied one and any complainant offering a santhosham to the meat stall owner on his way to the cop shop would surely get a warm reception from the khakied one, they say.


Many complaints against the khakied one made to those sporting more stars have so far fallen on deaf ears because the latter fear to antagonize the man because of the political clout he wields, they say.
