The repair work on the pipeline carrying water to Colombo and the suburbs has not been completed yet and the resumption of the water supply would take another two hours, Ambatale Water Treatment Plant Operations Manager Piyal Rajapaksa said.

“Water will be pumped from the Ambatale Water Treatment Plant soon after the repair work is finished,” he said.

Water supply to several areas in Colombo and the suburbs was suspended from 6 pm yesterday following a burst in the pipeline.
