PM, ministers not removed; only functions suspended: GL


	

The Court of Appeal's restraining order had only stopped the prime minister and the ministers from functioning in their offices and had not declared them unlawful, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) chairman G. L. Peiris said today.

He said there was a misconception that the posts of prime minister and those of the ministers had fallen vacant.

“This is completely false. The court order has not removed the PM and the ministers from office but had stopped them from carrying out their duties and functioning in their posts,” Prof. Peiris said and added that there had been instances in world history where prime ministers had been removed but said this was the first instance where a prime minister was suspended from carrying out his duties.

“Once, a Pakistani Court removed a prime minister. However, this is the first time in the history where a prime minister and ministers were suspended from functioning. Though we respect the court order, we don’t agree with it. That’s why we filed an appeal in the Supreme Court,” he said and added that the only solution available to the current political crisis was to hold a general election. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
