From yellow to white


	



The Road Development Authority’s new programme through which all zebra crossings in the country which have been painted in yellow would be painted white started yesterday.

According to the RDA, the zebra crossings would be changed in line with international standards as the white crossing can be seen more clearly, especially in the night. Pix by Nisal Baduge
