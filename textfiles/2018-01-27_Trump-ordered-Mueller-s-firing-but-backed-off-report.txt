THE HINDU, 26th JANUARY, 2018- US President Donald Trump last year ordered the firing of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is conducting an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, but backed off after the White House counsel threatened to resign, a media report claimed.


The news report comes a day after Mr. Trump said he was willing to be questioned under oath by Mueller.


Mr. Trump’s opponents allege that the Russian interference helped him win the polls.
But he denies any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.


Mr. Mueller, the former FBI director, has interviewed several members of the Trump campaign, Mr. Trump’s family members, colleagues in the Cabinet and present and former White House officials.
He has been seeking the interview with Mr. Trump as part of his investigation.


According to media reports, Mr. Mueller wants to interview Mr. Trump on his decision to fire national security advisor Michael Flynn and FBI director James Comey.
