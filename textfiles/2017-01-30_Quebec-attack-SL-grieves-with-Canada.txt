Sri Lanka grieves with Canada for the victims of the terrorist attack in Quebec and condemns all forms of terrorism, Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne tweeted today.

Six people were killed and eight injured at a mosque in Québec in a shooting on Sunday night.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the terrorist attack.

“We condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge. While authorities are still investigating and details continue to be confirmed, it is heart-wrenching to see such senseless violence. Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear,” he said.
