DPA, 01st FEBRUARY, 2018- The Polish Senate early Thursday voted in favour of a controversial bill that will criminalize anyone who lays any blame on Poland or its people for Nazi war crimes, state-run news agency PAP reported.


The bill, which was passed by the lower house last week and still has to be signed into law by the president, has sparked condemnation from Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it an attempt “to rewrite history.”
