The youngster of the former royal family, now a Diyawanna member had rung up the onetime family astrologer who was ditched after the last big poll.

 


Although the most important prediction about the father had gone wrong, the son continues to have faith in the astrologer as whatever prediction had made about him had come right, they say.


During the lengthy chat over the phone, they had cleared up some misunderstandings that led to a much stronger mutual understanding.


The astrologer had also assured the young Diyawanna member that a special favourable yoga due to come to fruition would elevate him to much higher status, informed sources say.
