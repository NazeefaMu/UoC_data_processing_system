A northern Irish MP propping up the government accepted luxury holidays worth £100,000 from Sri Lanka without telling Parliamentary watchdogs, it was reported.

Ian Paisley Jr, of the Democratic Unionist Party, accepted two all-expenses trips from the state.

Mr Paisley, his wife and four kids flew business class, were ferried around in a chauffeur-driven Mercedes and stayed in posh hotels.

In exchange he offered the Sri Lankans help brokering an oil deal, saying he had “significant arrangements with national oil suppliers” in Oman and Nigeria.

He went on the 2013 jaunts without declaring them in the Commons register of interests, according to The Telegraph.

MPs are obliged to declare income, gifts or affiliations that could spark a conflict of interest in their parliamentary roles.

This week Mr Paisley posted a picture of himself alongside Sri Lankan high commissioner Amari Wijewardene outside the Houses of Parliament.

Mr Paisley is one of 10 DUP MPs relied on by Theresa May to keep her government functioning properly. (thesun.co.uk)
