The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) today arrested Muniwarage Asitha Premathilaka alias Solta -- an accomplice of underworld criminal ‘Angoda Lokka' -- in connection with two recent killings at Kottawa and Malabe, Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said.

He was wanted in the killing of 42-year-old Egoda Chathurikage Manjula Sanduni on November 30, 2017. She was the owner of a beauty parlour in Kottawa and was on friendly terms with underworld gangster ‘Samayan’ and had been arrested on charges of aiding and abetting in the killing of notorious underworld figure, Tranil Bandara Dharmasiri alias ‘Banda’.

Police alleged that ‘Solta’ had carried out the shooting by way of taking revenge for Banda's killing. He was also wanted in connection with the killing of Roshan Premalal alias Poli Roshan on April 25 this year at Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga Mawatha in Malabe.

At the time of his arrest, ‘Solta’ had in his possession a 9mm pistol, which had been used to carry out the shooting, live ammunition and five grams of heroin.

SP Gunasekara said the suspect was arrested on a tip-off from the public and under the direction of CCD Director SP Nishantha Zoysa and OIC Nevil Silva. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
