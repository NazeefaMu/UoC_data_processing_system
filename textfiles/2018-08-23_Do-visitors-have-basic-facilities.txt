Do visitors have basic facilities?


	



Sri Lanka is selling itself as the number one destination for tourists from around the world, with its multi-faceted attractions. The eternal summer weather, the warm, blue seas and the golden beaches, wild-life, marine life, nature, culture, climate and history are the main reasons tourists visit the island.   

Some of Sri Lanka’s most popular tourist attractions such as the Sigiriya Rock Fortress and the Galle Fort are also considered as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. They are some of the main places that tourists visit on a large scale and are promoted around the world by travel and tour agencies locally and internationally.   

Yet, has anyone ever considered the difficulties faced by tourists while visiting these sites?

 


Once visitors realise that these facilities are not available, but they are charged quite a high price for the ticket, they will surely not come again or recommend the place to others, once they return to their country 



 

As in many other places around the country, are there basic facilities such as clean toilets, drinking water etc? These should be provided not only for tourists but for local visitors as well. Once visitors realise that these facilities are not available, but they are charged quite a high price for the ticket, they will surely not come again or recommend the place to others, once they return to their country. For their next tour,  they would perhaps consider Thailand or Malaysia, instead.   

If we wish to sustain ourselves as the prime destination for tourists, then we have to consider the long term aspect and maintain these much visited places, provide decent basic needs and try to lure back the tourists who are now heading more towards Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
