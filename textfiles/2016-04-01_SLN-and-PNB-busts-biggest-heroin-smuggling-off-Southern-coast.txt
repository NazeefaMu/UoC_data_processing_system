The largest ever heroin haul in the sea, 101 kg of heroin was nabbed by the Sri Lanka Navy and the Police Narcotic Bureau(PNB) in a joint operation carried out in the sea off southern Sri Lanka on Wednesday, the Navy said today.

Issuing a statement, the Navy said search operations are still continuing to identify the culprits involved in the smuggling which had allegedly being operated by Sri Lankan, Pakistani and Afghanistan agents in collaboration.

A foreign ship owned by the smugglers, a Pakistani and 10 Iranian nationals were arrested in the raid.

“The main drug haul of 101 kg was found apart from another kilogram of unidentified drug species. Police have detained the arrested suspects and taking steps to identify other suspects as well,” it said.

It had been reported that the heroin haul was imported from Pakistan via the southern sea and then brought into the island using fishing trawlers by the agents in the guise of engaging in fishing in the waters.

“Drugs are then transported to Colombo via the Southern Expressway and to be distributed among main agents in here,” the statement said.

The raid was carried out upon a tip off received by the Navy Intelligence Unit on Wednesday with the input of naval ships Nandimithra, Mihikatha and other fighter craft.

Meanwhile, Police said altogether 14 foreigners had been arrested in connection with this smuggling. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
