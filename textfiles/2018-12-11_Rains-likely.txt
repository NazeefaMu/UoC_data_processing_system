The low pressure area over the Southern Bay of Bengal to the southeast of Sri Lanka is likely to develop into a depression during the next few days, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said today.

Quoting the Meteorology Department, the DMC said the depression was expected to move towards the Tamil-Nadu coast.

However, heavy rains and rough seas with wind speeds of up to 80 kmph in the sea off the coast extending from Hambantota to Trincomalee via Batticaloa and Pottuvil are expected.

Naval and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant. (Yohan Perera)
