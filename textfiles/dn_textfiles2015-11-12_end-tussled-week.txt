End of a tussled week

It was a tumultuous week for the government as it lost its spiritual guiding light, Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera and was then confronted with the resignation of Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana, over the controversy surrounding the Avant Garde affair.
Much has been written about the passing away of Ven. Sobhitha Thera. There is no doubt that he was the one person who was instrumental in first conceptualising the defeat of the regime led by Mahinda Rajapaksa through the strategy of employing a ‘common candidate’.
At the time the late Ven. Sobhitha Thera mooted the idea, many scoffed at it but he proved to be more astute than most politicians, realising that any division of the votes of the forces opposed to Rajapaksa will only ensure Rajapaksa’s return to power. Therefore he persisted with his plan, coaxing and cajoling reluctant politicians in different camps to consider various options.
When even that did not seem to work, Ven. Sobhitha Thera offered himself as a candidate but he also had the political nous to realise that he probably wouldn’t succeed because, as a Buddhist monk, it would be difficult for him to attract votes from the minority communities.
Nevertheless, by offering himself as potential candidate, he spurred what was then a lethargic opposition in to action. It is now no secret that he was a major influence in convincing President Maithripala Sirisena, then Health Minister in Rajapaksa’s government, to make a break and declare himself as the much sought after ‘common’ candidate.
Campaign to oust Rajapaksa regime
Ven. Sobhitha Thera didn’t rest after finding the ‘common’ candidate; he was involved every inch of the way in formulating policies for the opposition in keeping with the outcomes he yearned for: the pruning of powers vested in the executive presidency, the repeal of the 18th Amendment, changes to the electoral system and establishing independent commissions to govern key state institutions.
That he did all this without any rancour is testimony to the greatness of the late prelate. He was able to agitate for the Sinhalese against terrorism without being called a racist. Even when he was the leading light in the campaign to oust the Rajapaksa regime at a time when many politicians shied away from taking on that mantle, Ven. Sobhitha Thera commanded the respect of the regime which didn’t dare to intimidate him. Mahinda Rajapaksa himself held the late Thera in great esteem.
Ven. Sobhitha Thera’s uniqueness in the Lankan socio-political arena arises from his integrity and his adherence to principles rather than political parties. He was never a ‘UNP priest’ or a ‘SLFP priest’. He opposed Mahinda Rajapaksa’s preoccupation with authoritarianism with the same vehemence that he opposed the deprivation of civic rights of Sirima Bandaranaike. He opposed the Indo-Lanka Accord with the same tenacity that he pleaded for an end to Sinhalese triumphalism that emerged after the end of the Eelam war. Thus, he earned the respect of all and sundry, even his detractors.
The late Thera’s integrity came to the fore after the presidential and general election. He famously used the idiom of baking the ‘roti’ when the pan is hot but was disillusioned when the government indulged in some exercises that were not in keeping with their pledge of good governance: the delaying of electoral reforms, the expansion of the Cabinet to accommodate more and more ministers and the inclusion of defeated candidates on the National List.
Emergence of petty politics
He criticised these moves openly and without fear or favour and is known to have admonished prominent persons in the new administration, reminding them pointedly that they were deviating from the straight and narrow and what he saw as the emergence of petty politics taking precedence over policies and principles.
As many have noted, Ven. Sobhitha Thera’s passing leaves a void that is impossible to fill for he was a man in a generation. More importantly, as his mortal remains are consigned to flames today, he farewells a nation that is still at a crucial cross roads that would have benefited enormously from his wisdom and saner counsel.
Preoccupied as government leaders were in making arrangements for the last rites of Ven. Sobhitha Thera, they had to deal with another event of significance: the stance taken by Minister Tilak Marapana over the Avant Garde affair. Marapana made a statement in Parliament late last week claiming that nothing untoward was uncovered in the investigations into Avant Garde and that it was instigated by the Police to score ‘brownie points’.
On the one hand, Marapana is the Minister in charge of the Police. On the other hand, he was the lawyer retained by some parties implicates in the Avant Garde affair. As a former Attorney General and a senior lawyer, Marapana should have known better for the conflict of interest was obvious. By making a statement in Parliament that virtually exonerated those against whom charges were levelled, Marapana made his position in the Cabinet untenable.
On Monday, Marapana called a press briefing and announced that he had tendered his resignation. This came after discussions with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Premier had already been chastened by the controversy involving the Governor of the Central Bank and many were of the opinion that if that matter had been dealt with more decisively, the United National Party would have won more seats at the general election and arguably even secured a simple majority in Parliament. Therefore, he didn’t want another scandal involving one of his own loyalists to erupt. Hence the call for Marapana’s resignation with which the senior minister duly obliged.
Marapana’s resignation
However, in offering his resignation, Marapana stoically maintained his stance that there was no illegal activity at Avant Garde. He said he was resigning only because of the conflict of interest where he was the minister in charge of the Police which was investigating one of his clients.
For the government, unfortunately the issue doesn’t end with Marapana’s resignation. Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha had already waded in to the controversy, having claimed to have prevented the arrest of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Minister Vajira Abeywardena, though not making a statement on Avant Garde, has been accused of having dealings with the company. The opposition is now baying for their blood as well.
The government has adopted damage control as their strategy in response to these calls. President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe have assured that they would oversee investigations into Avant Garde which would be expedited. This is in the face of strong criticism from within the Cabinet itself, notably from ministers Rajitha Senaratne and Champika Ranawaka who, prior to Marapana’s resignation, were threatening to quit the government themselves.
It will take a lot of effort to restore public confidence in the government and an independent investigation that will lay bare the facts in relation to Avant Garde without undue delay before the controversy is swept off the headlines would be the best outcome for the government but whether this would eventuate is a different matter altogether.
With months to go for the Local Government election both major political parties- and indeed the general public - will be watching these developments with interest. It is ironical that the Avant Garde controversy initially involved leading figures in the Rajapaksa regime but it has now come back to bite the party that ousted it.
It has already claimed its first victim in Marapana. Will more heads roll, that is the big question that both major parties will need to be cautious about.
