The questions he 'never' asked JR!

'Young Voices from Diyawanna' features statesman Dr. Kavinda Jayawardana who is very much a change maker with vision. Jayawardana, who is a far seeing astute leader, discussed his passion which is his country.
Early Life
Son of one time parliamentarian and Minister of Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Refugees Dr. Jayalath Jayawardana, Dr. Kavinda Jayawardana did his studies at Royal College till his O/Ls and after his O/Ls attended an international school. After his A/L he got through to Sri Ramachandra Medical College in India and graduated as a doctor in 2011. He worked there till 2012, and came back to the island and practiced in two hospitals in Sri Lanka.
After his father's demise, with the request from his father's supporters, political friends and family, he joined politics, contesting for the Western Provincial Council and becoming number two in the district.
He was a Western Provincial Counsellor for a year and a half, and joined the National Youth Front becoming the Secretary for Human Rights at the National Youth Front and is Deputy National organizer for the National Youth Front which is the Youth League in the United National Party. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and the UNP party wanted him to contest for the general election from the Gampaha district. He contested for the general election and as the youngest Member of Parliament from Gampaha district he was able to get selected to parliament.
In class and in the territory of the fairer sex!
"At Royal College the most fun time is the big match time. And during that period we had the cycle parade and we used to jump into girls' schools for fun! There were a few incidents where we jumped into a couple of girls' schools - St. Bridget's, Ladies and HFC. And some of my friends got caught to the Police and got themselves into trouble. But I was always able to escape and it was fun! In school we were very united. Even if one of our mates did something naughty, we never let him down. The entire batch and class would get punished rather than let the boy down.
Secret to success
My secret to success is dedication and commitment. I identify what is important and what my priorities are. Other than that, it would be my father's blessings. I watched and learnt how my father did politics and how he got close to people. All those things gave me a lot of lessons in life and I am very determined to carry on my father's work and I think it is on my shoulders now. So right now it is a duty for my nation and the people of my country.
Identifying the country's strength and requirements
Sri Lanka is one of the best tourist destinations in the world. We need a proper plan and strategy for tourism. There will be tourists who want to see only the beach. There will be tourists who want only to go to the jungle and see the leopards and birds. There will be tourists who want to come here to read books, rest, relax and look at the scenery. They may even like to go to Adam's Peak and World's End. There will be tourists who want to go to Jaffna and see the development and lifestyles of Jaffna. So you can make a package for them.
If we can make them more comfortable, we will have more tourism flooding into Sri Lanka.
There is also a huge number of Sri Lankans living abroad. We are losing a lot of Sri Lankan young blood in their prime. They are working for somebody else and most of them are abused and even end up losing their lives. And it is breaking the livelihoods of families in Sri Lanka. If we get them down and give them opportunities to work in Sri Lanka, then that would be a better way.
Challenges in life
The challenges I have faced is the health sector in Sri Lanka. As a doctor a lot of patients come to us. Most of them find it difficult to buy their medicine. And some of the patients, when they have to undergo a bypass surgery, they have to be in the list and have to wait forever sometimes. So we feel very helpless because there are less opportunities for them to survive. If we can upgrade the system for them, that would be good.
The hospitals have to be upgraded and the doctors have to be given a decent salary. The medical staff needs their facilities. We have to be conscious of the quality of the drugs. Some hospitals don't have equipment and they don't even have the required number of beds.
Message to the youth
My message to the youth of Sri Lanka is that first you have to have a dream -who you want to become and what you want to do for the country because you have a responsibility towards your country. You have to work towards your goal, your mission and you have to be determined. You should never give up. And do the right thing all the time.
Chatting with a historical figures
I would love to talk to J.R. Jayawardene and I want to ask him why he wanted this preferential voting system and why he implemented that. I also want to ask him why he wanted this Global Economy because he was the one who opened the international market in Sri Lanka by doing that.
He took the entire country to another level. When it comes to international leaders, I would like to talk to Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. I want to ask them how they managed to be so patient when everyone was attacking them!
Love conquers all
If I was omnipotent and could change anything in the world I would eradicate racism, terrorism, violence, hatred and religious extremism. Secondly I would eradicate cancer, drugs and heart attacks!
Historical figures he considers exemplary
When it comes to historical figures I admire Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. They were against violence when the violence was at the optimum level.
A day that changed his life
The one day that changed my life was when I lost my father. If I could live with my father for longer, then that would have been good. If I knew things would go bad I would have spent more time with him.
Walking through history
If I went back in history I would change Black July and those 30 years of war from ever happening.
Of movies
When it comes to movies I like ones based on true stories like 'Blow' (based on the true story of a drug trafficker) and 'The Walk to Remember' and I watch a lot of the history channel - Saddam Hussein, Idi Amin and Gaddafi and Hitler's life story. All of these are documentaries. I used to watch a lot of TV shows like 'Lost,' 'Prison Break,' 'Friends' and 'Two and a Half Men.'
Love life
I dated a girl next door, I used to go to church to meet her every Sunday. I was in school back then. Sunday was the best day of my life because at mass I got to see her. So we would hold hands in church and attend mass. She was my first love and we exchanged letters and pictures. We didn't have mobile phones back then, so we would talk over the land line.
It was very hard for me to get away from my mother and talk to this girl. I used to walk all the way from Royal College to the British Council with a pay phone card. For 100 rupees I talked to her for five minutes and walked back to Royal College and got into my vehicle to go home. Once I even collected money for Valentine and bought her a ring. That was the best gift I could get for her back then, because I was not doing a job.
Prophesying a possible future
The fear that I have is, with technology evolving so much, we will lose touch of each other. We will lose the touch of humanity. We will lose the touch of family. We will be robots one day. The technology will take us over, we will not be human we will be robots. And we will stop drinking water and stick to Cola. We will stop eating green vegetables, rice and bread and we will start eating pizza for the rest of our lives. We will be so lazy we will not even turn the fan on. We will be too lazy to get into the bus or the train. We will be obese and our life span will be shorter. We will have physical and mental problems and we will be stagnated to one place.
Emotional moments
The Tsunami that hit our country was an incident that moved me. Another event that moved me was 9/11. Right now I am pretty upset about what is happening in Syria with innocent people being tortured, murdered and girls being taken for sex slavery. I was very much moved when I saw the lifeless little body of the little Syrian boy washed up at the sea shore. I can't believe humans are doing this.
