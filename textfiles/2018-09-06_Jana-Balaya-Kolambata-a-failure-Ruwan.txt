The ‘Jana Balaya Kolambata’ protest, which was an attempt made by the joint opposition to certifying its next political leader, was a total failure State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said yesterday.

Addressing a news briefing held at the Government Information Department last evening, the State Minister said the protest only resulted in inconveniencing the people who were in Colombo.

“Because of the protest parents could not send their children to school, people could not get to work. As you know Wednesday is the public day in many ministries and people could not get to meet their ministers because of the protest. It was not the government but the people in the City of Colombo that was affected by this,” he said.

He said due to internal issues taking place within the JO, the party was forced to bring people to Colombo.

“The protest had no impact on the government. Many people are spending the whole night on the roads in Colombo with the hope of forming a new government tomorrow,” he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
