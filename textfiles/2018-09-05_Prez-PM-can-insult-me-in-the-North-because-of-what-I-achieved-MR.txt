Prez, PM can insult me in the North because of what I achieved: MR


	

It was because of what I achieved in the North that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe now have the opportunity to insult me when they go to the North, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.

Addressing a Sathyagraha organized by the joint opposition (JO) he said, “The incumbent government has violated the independence that we acquired after defeating the LTTE. The people’s democratic rights are being violated by postponing the elections".

“The situation is going from bad to worse. The country is heading towards an autocratic form of governance rather a democratic rule,” the former president said.

“Therefore, it is our responsibility to restore democracy by forming a new government,” he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
