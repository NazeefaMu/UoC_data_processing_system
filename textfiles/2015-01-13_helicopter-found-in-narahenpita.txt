	A two-seater aircraft was found today at the Narahenpita Economic Centre following a tip off by phone to the 119 call centre, police said.
	When we tried to contact the managing director of the Asian Aviation Centre regarding reports that the aircraft belonged to them, Ms. Nihara Jayathilaka answered and said the aircraft was in a dilapidated condition and had been gifted to Yoshitha Rajapaksa on a written document following his request.
	The following is a transcript of the conversation with Ms. Jayathilaka:Q. Is the report true that the light aircraft which was found at the Narahenpita Economic Centre belonged to you?A. Yes. It was an old, dilapidated one which is unusable. We used it for several years after it was assembled. Later on it was used only for exhibitions.Q. Did you sell it or was it a gift?A. It does not have any financial value. It is just an attraction. One day Yoshitha came and asked my husband, “Uncle, can I have it?” and we gave it to him. It is an unusable one.Q. How did the people at the Economic Centre come to know that it belonged to you?A. We gave it with a letter. So it must have been there. Two days ago someone from the Economic Centre phoned me and asked whether I could help dismantle it and I sent some of our technicians and that is how it came to public knowledge. There is nothing to panic about.
	Narahenpita Police had received information that certain people were trying to take away a two-seater aircraft which was at the Narahenpita Economic Centre and found a dilapidated aircraft at the location last evening.
	Narahenpita Police are investigating the incident. (Ajith Siriwardana)Video by Sanath Desmond
