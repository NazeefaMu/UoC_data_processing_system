“Repairing security scanner is a waste of funds!”


	



 

A security scanning machine of a government secretariat that went out of order some time ago is lying idle as no action has been taken to effect the necessary repairs.

 


This machine used as a body scanner in the days of the ever- lurking   terrorist threat had gone out of order later. And when a request was made to the white collar high-up in charge to approve the expenditure involved in effecting repairs to the machine, he made the following endorsement in the relevant file submitted to him: “I am the highest official in this secretariat. None will come here to assassinate me. It does not matter even if I am assassinated.  I am not worth the cost involving the repairs to the machine. There is no need to waste public funds on repairs to the machine.”
