The Kurunegala programme for Wayamba Province entrepreneurs in progress

A programme by Commercial Bank of Ceylon to empower entrepreneurs with essential knowledge recently benefitted 130 business people in the Wayamba province.


The seminar held in Kurunegala was conducted by Chandana Gunawardena, a leading speaker on motivation and business development. It focussed on empowerment of participants in the areas of business development and sustainability.


Commercial Bank has conducted 36 similar seminars for entrepreneurs in many areas of the country under this on-going programme, which has to date benefitted more than 3,600 entrepreneurs in the Northern, Eastern, North Central, Southern, Uva, Central and Western Provinces. 


The Kurunegala seminar was attended by Commercial Bank Regional Manager (Wayamba) V.P. Kolamunna, officers of the bank’s Development Credit Department and branch managers in the region.


In May this year, the bank also conducted a special programme in Matara exclusively for women entrepreneurs. The event was attended by over 100 participants.


These programmes are supported by the bank’s 15 Agriculture and Microfinance Units (AMFUs), which play a key role in helping the Bank identify specific needs of people who require assistance to develop either their agriculture activities or small businesses and are dedicated to promoting agriculture lending and microfinance and providing special assistance.
Commercial Bank’s AMFUs are located in Ratnapura, Narammala, Kandy, Anuradhapura, Kilinochchi, Bandarawela, Wellawaya, Hingurakgoda, Galewela, Atchuvely, Vavuniya, Kattankudy, Tissamaharama, Neluwa and Pottuvil.
