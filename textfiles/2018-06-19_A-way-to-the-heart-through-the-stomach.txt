A way to the heart through the stomach


	



 

A contractor who won a tender to put up a four-storey library building hosted a select group of local politicos and white-collar up high-ups and their families to a grand dinner at a high-end hotel in an upcountry city, they say.

 


However, Pohottuwa politicos had boycotted the function saying that it was improper for the contractor to host them or for them to be his guests either.


Meanwhile, rate-payers are said to be asking one another: “If the contractor could spend so much on the feast, how much must his profit be from this contract?”
