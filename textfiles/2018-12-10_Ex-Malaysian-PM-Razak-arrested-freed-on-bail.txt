Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was arrested by the country’s anti-graft agency over alleged “tampering” of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) audit report, Channel News Asia reported a short while ago.

Najib was arrested at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) headquarters shortly after he arrived at the premises for further questioning over the issue. However, he was later freed on bail at around 1.20 pm.

On Nov 25, Auditor-General Madinah Mohamad revealed that the final audit report on 1MDB had been tampered with and that Najib had knowledge of it.

She also disclosed that two crucial matters dropped from the report were regarding the presence of fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho at a 1MDB board meeting, as well as the financial status of 1MDB.
